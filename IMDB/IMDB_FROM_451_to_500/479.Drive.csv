0,MartinHafer,Amazingly violent....so beware.,7,4 February 2012,"I should point out at the onset that this really isn't the sort of film I like--so keep this in mind. I decided to watch ""Drive"" because it received a lot of critical attention but was ignored at the Oscars. And, since I'd heard so much good stuff about it, I decided to rent it.""Drive"" is a SUPER-violent film. While the number of deaths isn't as extreme as some films, the deaths that do occur are among the bloodiest and closeup you will ever see in a movie. You see a person get their head blown apart at close range with a shotgun, you see a man stomped to death (complete with lots of squishy sound effects) and a guy stabbed in the eye and then in the throat! Do NOT let kids see this film and think twice about seeing it yourself. It is brutal...very, very brutal--and this might be why it didn't get any major Oscar nominations.The film begins very well. I really liked the music and thought it quite fitting. Ryan Gosling plays a guy who is a spectacularly talented driver--so much that he does stunts for films and also drives getaway for crooks. I know the film makers were trying to make him super-cool by having him show ZERO emotion and talk rarely. I just thought this was too underplayed for my taste. As for the mobsters in the film, they are quite the opposite. Albert Brooks (yes, THAT Albert Brooks) plays a maniac killer--a guy who loves to use knives and razors on his victims. Ron Perlman isn't much nicer! Bryan Cranston is also on hand but never gets around to killing anyone.When Gosling meets a nice lady (Cary Mulligan) and befriends her and her son, he learns she has a husband who is in jail. Instead of trying to steal her, he actually helps the guy when he gets out of jail. It seems that the mob is going to make the husband perform one last robbery--then they'll let him and his family live--and Gosling agrees to drive the getaway car. But it all blows up in their face--it's all a setup and it looks like EVERYONE will eventually die. Can the almost zombie-like Gosling manage to take on the gang and survive?I personally respect the film but thought it was way too over-mannered and way too artsy for my taste--as well as WAY too bloody. If this if your thing, fine. I just didn't enjoy this sort of thing though it's well made.",Drive
1,TheLittleSongbird,A contender for my favourite of the year so far?,10,26 September 2011,"Yes, very likely. Of a very hit-and-miss year so far, I have seen some gems like Tree of Life, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy(the first two in a way are not for everybody though), Rio and Source Code. And then I saw Drive, which was simply brilliant.Like I said with some of my favourites this year, Drive is not a movie for all. It is a slow-paced movie, but I did not find it ""boring""(a term I hate with a passion, as it is massively overused and hardly ever elaborated upon). For me, just because it is slow-paced, doesn't necessarily mean it is going to be a bad movie, only when other components don't work does it apply to me, which is not the case with Drive.Besides, Drive isn't even the only slow-paced movie around, so I don't know why people have to make such a big deal of it. There are many other movies(Godfather, 2001, Tree of Life, Brokeback Mountain) that are and deliberately so. I feel also that Drive is paced deliberately, for atmosphere.The pauses and the ""sparse"" dialogue to me were just two of many things that made Drive so great. There is such an atmosphere here, one that is very tense and beautiful at the same time. The pauses actually helped to enhance this.Refn does a fine job directing. From his previous work, this director showed promise, and here he delivers all the stops and gives his best directorial job so far here.The story starts off electrifyingly, and then slows down again without ever feeling dull, thanks to the unrelenting violence, that is part of the world that is shown here through the eyes of the title character, and adeptly edited car/chase sequences. The dialogue I also have no problem with, it is memorable without falling into cliché territory. The characters are credible, especially the titular character, whose characterisation is perhaps the most complex of the year.The cinematography is truly excellent, as is the editing, bringing much to the atmosphere and I'd also go as far to say that Drive could very well be the year's most visually stylish film. The colours and scenery are lush on the eyes too. The score is every bit as electrifying as the start of the movie, and manages to raise my adrenaline.Acting-wise I couldn't fault Drive either. Carey Mulligan and Christina Hendricks's roles mayn't be as well written as Gosling's or Brooks', but these two actresses-particularly Mulligan- manage to bring some much needed credibility to them, elevating the characters to a higher level, and Ron Perlman, Oscar Isaac, Bryan Cranston and in particular Albert Brooks are terrific. Ryan Gosling is simply mesmerising, in his best performance to date. It is a quiet, yet very charismatic and intensely brooding portrayal, reminiscent of Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver for characterisation and Alan Ladd in Shane in how the role is conveyed.Last but not least, the elevator scene. Brutal, yet very powerful and moving, I'd say it is a contender for the best scene of 2011. In conclusion, a brilliant film that for fans of films from the 70s and 80s and were expecting a sort of nostalgic throwback in style will appreciate. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Drive
2,Leofwine_draca,Simply wonderful,9,17 January 2014,"Nicolas Winding Refn's previous film, VALHALLA RISING, an existential Viking epic with Mads Mikkelsen, was a breath of fresh air for this tired reviewer. I immediately marked out Refn as somebody to watch, and while his prison biopic BRONSON was a little disappointing, I waited with interest to see what his next movie would be. Well, DRIVE was it, and the good news is that it's his best one yet.The story is simplistic, as is always the case with Refn: the hero is a getaway driver by night and a stunt driver by day. Through no fault of his own he gets caught up in a scam involving some deeply unpleasant gangsters, and it all kicks off from there. Refn's gameplan is to contrast moments of serene beauty and tranquility with shots of unflinching and bruising violence and it works a treat; this is one of the best and most memorable movies I've seen in a good while.Everything about this movie is great: the moving soundtrack, the exquisite camera-work, the subtle yet profound performances. Ryan Gosling is a new to me star, but his acting works a treat; he's as iconic as Eastwood back in the day. I don't even like Carey Mulligan but even I have to admit she's on good film, too, as are the various old timers (Ron Perlman, Albert Brooks, and Bryan Cranston).The first half of DRIVE leads you to wondering where it's all going to go, but in the second half it all slots together nicely and becomes more predictable. That's not to say the predictability is a negative though; Refn knows exactly how to handle his thematic elements, leading to confrontations that pay off beautifully. This is a superb film throughout and one I can't wait to see again.",Drive
3,SnoopyStyle,Good Artsy Neo-Noir,7,10 March 2014,Unnamed man (Ryan Gosling) is a skilled LA driver who takes jobs for whoever is willing to pay. He also works at an auto shop owned by Shannon (Bryan Cranston) who books him the driving jobs. He befriends new neighbors Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her kid. Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) gets released from prison. Standard is in debt to Albanian gangster Cook (James Biberi) who forces him to rob a pawnshop. The Driver steals a car to be the getaway driver for the sake of his neighbors. Things go wrong and Standard is shot. Cook's accomplice Blanche (Christina Hendricks) and the Driver escape with a massive amount of money.It's not as fun as it should be. It's not as intense as it should be. Ryan Gosling's stoic demeanor may have something to do with that. Also the twists and turns with so many characters can be very confusing. It's an artsy neo-noir film which is not necessarily everybody's taste.,Drive
4,Hitchcoc,Tense and Violent but Forgettable,7,19 September 2012,"I think that Ryan Gosling is the new Steve McQueen. That's not a criticism because I really liked Steve McQueen. He was a humble, understated actor who often played roles where violence ensued. This is a movie about getting in over your head through a moral code that requires you to become a protector, even if it's not in your nature. In addition to some pretty incredible car chases and organized mayhem, this gets down to the tussle between the guy who may want out and the guys who won't let him. It's about money and the Albert Brooks character (playing out of his usual element) is a pretty good adversary. He is offhanded in his appearance, but down and dirty in every aspect of his life, and like most wise guys, he doesn't hesitate to kill even his closest compadres. While there are great possibilities, I could never quite understand how one could sit on such opposite poles and keep it going. We are what we do and, of course, Gosling's driver, for all his skill will be made to pay the piper at some point.",Drive
5,claudio_carvalho,A Driver without a Name,8,19 May 2012,"In Los Angeles, a mysterious driver (Ryan Gosling) is a man of few words that works as a garage mechanic for his only friend Shannon (Bryan Cranston); stuntman in Hollywood films; and driver of getaway car in heists. One day, he helps his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan), whose husband is in prison, and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos) and her falls in love with her. However, a few days later her husband Standard Gabriel (Oscar Isaac) is released from prison and they meet each other in the building. Standard is pressed by the criminal Cook (James Biberi) to rob a pawn shop to pay for the protection he had in prison, and the driver decides to help him driving the getaway car. However, the heist does not work as planned, Standard is murdered and the driver discovers that they have been double-crossed by Cook. Further, the money belongs to the Mafia and now he has to protect Irene and Benicio from the mobsters. ""Drive"" is a good thriller with the lead character without a name, recalling the style of Clint Eastwood in ""High Plains Drifter"" in the role of ""The Stranger"" – a man that speaks a few words only, violent when necessary that protects innocent and beloved people. The film is weirdly attractive with potential of cult movie.The stylish cinematography discloses in an adequate pace the big picture and develops characters very well. The conclusion has an open end, a characteristic that has been forgotten by Hollywood. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Drive""",Drive
6,kosmasp,Fantastic Voyage,10,10 March 2012,"Let's get one thing out the way from the get go: While I do like the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise for what it is (I'm not really a car person), do not watch this expecting something similar. It's tough making predicaments and telling people to watch something or to steer clear of certain things. But I knew when I told a friend to stay away from this, that he would hate it. Sure enough, he told me later he didn't like the movie at all. How'd I know? Because he thought ""Being John Malkovich"" was bad too (I'm not comparing those either, just trying to convey, that this is more a ""head"" movie, than a ""gut"" movie).While terribly overlooked by the Oscars (and the Globes for that matter, only one nod each), this is superior filmmaking. Refn will be known to his fans for the Pusher trilogy, but also for the movie ""Valhalla Rising"" (which btw. was hated by most people in the video store I work ... goes to show you what taste they have. And I don't mean that in a negative fashion, they just like their Blockbusters more).Ryan Gosling is superb in a role that has him talk as little as possible. I almost thought the entire beginning was ""voice-less"" until I watched it again. Also the title ""Drive"" does not necessarily stand for driving per se. It can also mean the motivation, the inspiration in ones life. Something that makes us continue on our ""journey"".I haven't even touched the surface of the movie yet. One of the greatest things (besides the acting, the story, the cinematography ...) is the soundtrack. The electro pop is fitting as is Goslings outfit. While not original (and therefor the only category I'm not mad the Oscars didn't nominate the movie) the score almost elevates the movie onto a new higher level.Don't get it twisted though. This isn't just ""artsy"" filmmaking. There is pulp mixed in there too. And blood and violent action for that matter. Maybe my film 2011 (definetely in my Top 3)!!!",Drive
7,classicsoncall,"""I drive.""",8,27 February 2018,"Despite the title, the film is not primarily about fast cars and high speed chase scenes. Ryan Gosling's no-name character is a combination mechanic/driver/stunt man with an unacknowledged shady past, and you get the idea that he wants to go straight but hasn't had the opportunity yet. Meeting his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) just might be the ticket, but her ex-con husband is something of an obstacle when he's released from prison. With the stars unaligned for our complicatedly ambiguous hero, the story is set to go in unexpected directions.I thought the chemistry between Irene and Driver was well played without compromising her marriage in an overt way. When Standard (Oscar Isaac) got whacked, I thought it was just a bit too convenient way for the attractive couple to get together, but the story wisely took things in a different direction. To my way of thinking, I don't think Irene would have made a wise decision casting her future with Driver anyway, that scene of Driver cracking open the guy's head in the elevator wasn't exactly the mark of someone with a lot of compassion if things went against him.I thought about all those long, slow frames of Gosling with his emotionless expression and I think it worked well for the character. It gives you time to wonder what he was thinking in a given situation, and he seemed to have a lot of those. The few good action sequences of Driver actually driving are well done, but that's not the reason to see the movie. Tune in for an effective neo-noir character study of a man on a mission, who if this was a Western, winds up riding off into the sunset, alone and undeterred seeking a destiny he might never find.",Drive
8,gavin6942,The Dangerous Ryan Gosling!,7,1 July 2015,"A mysterious Hollywood stuntman and mechanic (Ryan Gosling) moonlights as a getaway driver and finds himself trouble when he helps out his neighbor (Carey Mulligan).This film has a great supporting cast with Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman and more. Together, they really light up the screen and turn a better-than-average crime film into a real spectacle. Maybe not as great as first made out to be, but even after the hype, still a solid piece of cinema.Mulligan really needs to get bigger. She had a brief spike with ""An Education"", but already (2015) seems to be fading back into obscurity. Someone rescue her, cast her as the lead in your next film. Get her a few Oscars, please!",Drive
9,lee_eisenberg,life is a dangerous road,7,12 May 2015,"A review or two that I've read call Nicolas Winding Refn's ""Drive"" the best movie of 2011. I wouldn't call it that, but it's an impressive one. Ryan Gosling plays a car repair man sees his life take a dangerous turn after he befriends a woman (Carey Mulligan) whose imprisoned husband (Oscar Isaac) owes a gangster protection money. There are some VERY nasty scenes in this movie.This movie reminded me of Gosling's ""Place Beyond the Pines"", in which he also played a man whose life explodes into chaos. Neither movie is really an action movie. Both would more accurately get described as dramas about how a person's life can change almost in an instant. Probably the most surprising cast member was Albert Brooks, who plays a role very different from the roles that he's usually played (but does so very well, make no mistake about it). Another surprise appearance is that of Russ Tamblyn, who notably played one of the gang members in ""West Side Story"" (he more recently appeared in ""Django Unchained"").I recommend the movie. This look at the underbelly of LA leaves little to the imagination. Definitely not for the squeamish, though.",Drive
10,jboothmillard,Drive,7,21 February 2012,"I may have heard about this film a little bit when it was released in cinemas, but I certainly heard about it more when it was nominated awards and released on DVD, it was one I wanted to see, from BAFTA nominated director Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson). Basically a mysterious and unnamed Driver (Ryan Gosling) works three car related jobs, the two normal day to day are as a car mechanic and as a Hollywood movie stuntman, the nighttime job though has danger as he is an anonymous getaway driver for various criminals. He wants to escape his shady life, he has ideas to run his own garage business and live a more normal life, and this becomes more a priority when he meets and falls for Irene (BAFTA nominated Carey Mulligan), whose husband is in prison, and she looks after her son in the apartment next door. His boss as the garage Shannon (Bryan Cranston) is the one who arranges his other jobs, and he is putting together a race team using gangland money, and he needs the Driver to be involved as the main racer to compete. Mobster Bernie Rose (Golden Globe nominated Albert Brooks) is persuaded to put his money on the Driver's skills, and his Jewish business partner Nino (Hellboy's Ron Perlman) is involved in the deal as well, of course the Driver gets more than he bargained for. As the Driver tries to avoid trouble with the mobsters, he starts spending more time with Irene and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos), and he eventually meets her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) after he comes home from prison. Standard owes money from protection to gangster Cook (James Biberi), and the criminal threatens him to rob a pawn shop or his wife and child will be hurt, so the Driver agrees to help him pay off the debt, and also joining them is Blanche (Christina Hendricks). But the job goes wrong, Standard is shot dead, but the Driver gets away with Blanche and the money, more than expected, and he is sure she is involved with those chasing them, she is killed when they get to a motel, but he kills the two men who were after them. The Driver finds out Nino sent a hit-man to kill him, Irene and Benicio, but he is killed in the elevator, and meanwhile Bernie and Nino find out the money at the pawn shop was for the East Coast mafia, and those who know about it, Cook and Shannon have to be killed. The Driver manages to catch up to Nino, and wearing his fire proof latex mask he drowns him in the Pacific Ocean, and after calling Bernie to arrange a meeting in a Chinese restaurant he calls Irene to say goodbye. Bernie promises Irene and Benicio will be safe if the Driver gives him the money, but in the parking lot the criminal stabs him, but the Driver stabs him back and kills him, and Irene doesn't know that the Driver drives away into the night, supposedly never to be seen again. Also starring Russ Tamblyn as Doc. As the man with no name who hardly speaks and is a whizz behind the wheel Gosling gives a pretty good performance, and even though she could have been on more Mulligan is good too, I can see the resemblance to films like The Transporter and Taxi Driver, I will admit the gangster stuff was a little confusing, but overall it is an interesting revenge action drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Film. Very good!",Drive
11,Tweekums,A stylish and violent neo-noir thriller,8,6 September 2015,"Ryan Gosling plays an unnamed stunt driver who earns a bit on the side as a getaway driver; he is efficient and almost unemotional. Having recently moved into a new apartment he bumps into his neighbour Irene and ends up helping her when she has car trouble. They grow close and he learns that her husband, and father of her child, is in prison. When he gets out he says he wants to go straight but he owes a lot of money to people so must do one last job. The driver offers to help and drives him and his associate Blanche to a pawn shop the robbery doesn't go as planned; Irene's husband ends up dead while the driver and Blanche flee with a million dollars of the mob's money. Those who organised the robbery want the money and they want everybody involved dead so the mob will never be able to trace the crime to them. The driver will have to get bloody if he is to save himself, Irene and her son.When I started watching this I didn't really know what to expect; I just knew it was about a getaway driver and had received good reviews. It crossed my mind that it might be a bit like 'The Transporter' series of films It is not. Things start well as we see the Driver avoid the police as he drives a couple of crooks away from their job before finding out about his day job. Once he befriends Irene a very chaste relationship develops. It isn't until her husband gets out of prison and has a run in with the people he owes money to do we get a hint of the violence to come. It isn't that there is a lot of violence; it is the intensity and suddenness of it that really shocks; a woman gets her head blown off with a shotgun, a man gets his head stamped to a bloody mess and another gets a fork in his eye! This isn't the exciting, highly choreographed violence of most action movies; it is nasty and brutal and deliberately so.Ryan Gosling gives a fine performance as the Driver; a character who at times seems like a hero and at others a psychopath. He is able supported by Carey Mulligan, who plays Irene; Christina Hendricks, who plays Blanche; Brian Cranston and Ron Perlman amongst others. Director Nicolas Winding Refn did a great job as he lulls us into a false sense of security with a gentle start then unleashes shocking violence and ever-increasing tension right till the end I was unsure whether or not the Driver would survive. Overall I found this will well worth watching even if the violence was quite shocking.",Drive
12,BA_Harrison,A stylish ride.,8,16 April 2014,"A stunt-man/mechanic who moonlights as a getaway driver lands himself in big trouble with vicious gangsters after helping out his neighbour.It's hard to believe that any film centred around a character who drives really, really fast for a living could move so slowly, but don't take that as a negative Drive's deliberate pacing helps to separate this tense thriller from many of its contemporaries, lending it a leisurely air of cool that is sorely missing from much of today's Hollywood output.Gosling's deliberate central performance also adds immensely to the film's distinctive mood; his Driver is classic anti-hero material—a man of few words, calm and collected in even the most stressful of situations, but capable of extreme violence when provoked, proving just as capable in a fight as he is behind a steering wheel.Excellent performances, a gripping plot, and several shocking outbursts of extreme violence make Drive a thoroughly absorbing and entertaining ride, with only the very ending—in which I felt Driver uncharacteristically lets his guard down— detracting somewhat from this viewer's overall enjoyment.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Drive
13,moonspinner55,"Laconic, but not brooding...glamorously narcissistic, with bursts of bloody violence",5,8 March 2013,"Ryan Gosling portrays a Los Angeles stunt-driver for the movies who, for reasons left purposefully unknown, moonlights in the evenings as a getaway driver for various local criminals willing to pay his fee (and finish with their business within the five minute time limit). After becoming attracted to his neighbor, a waitress with child whose two-bit crook husband has recently been paroled from jail, the driver is hired by the spouse to participate in a pawn shop robbery. Screenwriter Hossein Amini, working from James Sallis' novel, keeps his protagonist cool, quiet and in control--until a midway point in the proceedings when violence overtakes his life (and the picture). While Albert Brooks is surprisingly menacing as a financial backer with mob ties, and Gosling himself seems well-adept at stepping into the laconic anti-hero shoes of an action star like Steve McQueen, the film itself seems to be without a central core. It is buffed and shined to a neon-tinted glow, but it doesn't pulsate with life...and it doesn't involve the audience. ** from ****",Drive
14,edwagreen,Get Out of this Driver Seat *,3,2 June 2012,"The bodies begin to pile up as the film goes along and you just don't know where you are at, and for that matter, you couldn't care less.This film would have been a lot better if they had settled on another theme. After all Gosling works in a garage and does part-time movie stunts on the side and has a reputation for good driving in the fast lane.We would have been better off had we had more chase scenes. Instead, we are subjected to a simple tale of everything going awry when the Gosling character helps out a neighbor who has recently been released from prison. Go know that we're dealing with mob money being stolen.",Drive
15,michaelRokeefe,Basically shy: but volatile.,8,24 February 2012,"A true thriller. Driver(Ryan Gosling) is one of those quiet guys that doesn't shy away from excitement. Multi-talented; well, let us say that Driver is well skilled. A Hollywood stunt driver and mechanic by day and quick moonlight getaway man. His life isn't mundane, but a bit isolated. Driver comes to the aid of a troubled neighbor Irene(Carey Mulligan)and her young son. The relationship begins showing some promise, until Irene's violent husband is released from prison. Driver's skills will soon be needed. A high price will be put on vengeance and survival. This story line is smooth as silk lubricated with rocket fuel. Some scenes are gruesome and the violence is, well violent. Gosling is outstanding. Mulligan is fine as the mousy love interest.

16,sunwarrior13,Drive Is Robotic And Extremely Violent,6,26 November 2020,"Ryan Gosling together with Carey Mulligan and Albert Brooks stars in ""Drive"". The film directed by Nicolas Winding Refn was evidently inspired by Walter Hill's 1978 Ryan O'Neal starrer ""The Driver"".The story is a person who is extremely skillful behind the wheels simply known as ""Driver"". He also happens to be a Hollywood stuntman and a getaway driver for criminals. He is obviously possess a stoic character but started to become more emotional after he gets to know her neighbor Irene and her young son,Benicio. Things become more interesting and intriguing when Irene's husband gets out of jail.The Driver intends to help them during a million dollar heist that the ex-convict gets involved in. But things get out of hand during the robbery.No question that the viewer is treated to an artsy film that many would appreciate.Added to that,we also get to see great acting from a cereberal thespian in Gosling. But overall,I felt that the film is robotic in the sense that the characters are basically acting like caricatures. What certifies this is the its extremely violent scenes especially when the film tries to place close ups on murders and killings done.This is to provide shock to the viewer.The story was lacking as well.Too bad that movies should possess an emotional value to them particularly when it comes to the characters to understand their nature. While many may appreciate this movie especially those who love violence in films,personally I felt that giving less importance to the characters made it less interesting.",Drive
17,hitchcockthelegend,Fate? Unknown...,10,4 February 2012,"Drive is directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and adapted to screenplay by Hossein Amini from the novel of the same name written by James Sallis. It stars Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman. Music is by Cliff Martinez and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.Driver (Gosling) has a day job, he's a Hollywood stunt man, but by night he makes the serious cash as a getaway driver for the criminal fraternity. Into his life comes married next door neighbour Irene (Mulligan) and her little boy Benicio (Kaden Leos), pitching him right into the middle of two wars; one is for his emotional worth, the other with the criminal underworld.Real human being, and a real hero.They cheered at Cannes, it has garnered instant cult classic status as well as gushing critical praise, Drive is arguably the biggest surprise of 2011. Some would debate that it arrived in a year that was dominated by blockbuster brain drains and pretentious parables, meaning it wouldn't take much for something like Drive to find a favourable audience. Yet Drive is a special movie, the surprise being that it delivers a different film to what the plot synopsis suggests. There would have been many disappointed that it didn't turn out to be something akin to The Fast & The Furious 19, but as its reputation grows, one likes to think that many also had their senses tingled unexpectedly by Refn's western done out in 1980s neo noir attire.Yes, at first glance it looks like a simple story given over to style over substance leanings, where the fact that our laconic protagonist is not prone to dialogue expansion, could lend argumentative weight to those potential dissenters only skimming the surface of the picture. But the material is in excellent hands, with Refn, Sigel, Gosling and co, calmly unravelling Amini's stripped down screenplay to reveal a gritty urban fable that's laced with ethereal overtones. A picture where a look means more than any words can express, a subtle holding of hands reveals many layers peeling, and then the serene state of play often gets punctured by bouts of shocking violence, yet always it remains a picture big on intelligence, beating a mighty heart in the process.Propelling the picture forward is the complexity of Gosling's driver character. He has no back story for us to work from, and he gives nothing away outside of the tender bond formed with Irene and child. He is actually one of many purposeful grey areas (or should that be gris areas?) within the plot structure. We learn just enough to be on his side, a noble but flawed hero battling against fate as he fights for the innocent, he be Shane for a modern pot boiling Los Angeles. Helps, too, that he's so cool behind the wheel, where he mines Steve McQueen's effortless charisma. Refn delivers magic moments of car play, from the near ten minute opening getaway extended sequence, to a high speed kill or be killed pursuit, when the action flows it really pumps the adrenalin.Gosling is amazing, instantly iconic, soft voice matching his soft blue eyes, toothpick perched between teeth, it's a testament to his acting ability that the requisite homages to iconic characters of movies past never veers into parody territory. It's with the calm moments that he triumphs most, be it watching TV with the boy Benicio or just gazing intensely into Irene's eyes, Gosling has a magnetic quality of some significance. Mulligan, too, is wonderful, deftly underplaying Irene to work off of Gosling to create heart aching tenderness, their chemistry superb. Isaac does fine work with the ex-con/husband character that is thankfully not stereotypical, Brooks is Colm Meaney like, thriving on simmering badness, while Cranston puts real heart into the role of Driver's garage boss, the closest thing the Driver has to a pal. The only one dimensional character lands in Perlman's court, but Perlman is such an ebullient and watchable life force the film survives the character's oafness.From the opening pink neon credits, accompanied by the synth plink of a retro 80s soundtrack (a soundtrack so memorable it lands in the ears and stays there for days), it's evident that Refn is a man who takes his style serious. Drive is full of classy (yes arty) passages, fluid camera movements, single takes, non central framing of characters, slow motion unfurls and eye dazzling chopper shots of a neon lighted L.A., the director has an eye for the quality required to cloak his story. He of course is aided considerably by his editor Matthew Newman, and Sigel's photography. The former is dealing in seamless precision, the latter a master of shades (a lift sequence is to, ahem, die for) and colour toning delights. Marking this out as a Blu-ray essential.You can name about ten films that Drive has been either likened too or put forward as an influence, and Refn's work here has been touted as an offspring created by Michael Mann, Walter Hill, William Friedkin and Sergio Leone (all viable and all actually high praise indeed). But rest assured, Drive is still fresh and exciting, the perfect movie package. Refn's masterpiece and one of the best films of 2011. 10/10",Drive
18,Hey_Sweden,"Not bad, but overly self-indulgent.",6,15 August 2013,"Director Nicolas Winding Refns' film of the James Sallis novel makes for fairly good entertainment. The basic story is decent, but Refn takes it all just a little too seriously, and his pacing will likely test the patience of some viewers. He really loves to stretch out his moments. He and his star Ryan Gosling work overtime to give both the film and the unnamed main character a sense of cool, but overall the main character just isn't that interesting, despite the fact that he can morph from soft spoken dude to brutal bad ass at the drop of a dime. Still, it's all attractively shot on various L.A. locations, and the supporting cast makes it worth watching. The brief bursts of graphic violence are a little jarring, but this viewer personally doesn't have a problem with that sort of thing.Made sort of in the style of Walter Hills' under-rated 1978 thriller ""The Driver"", ""Drive"" stars Gosling as a young man who clearly likes to keep busy, functioning as a part-time mechanic, a part-time car stunt specialist for the movies, and a part-time getaway driver for hire. Usually a careful individual, he only buys himself trouble when he becomes attracted to Irene (Carey Mulligan), who lives in his building with a young son, Benicio (Kaden Leos). Irenes' former jailbird husband ""Standard"" (Oscar Isaac) is in trouble with goons who are trying to force him to take a robbery gig; The Driver oddly decides to do Standard a favour and participate in the robbery. Of course, things don't go as planned.The film does benefit from the kind of pulse quickening action scenes that you would expect from any film titled ""Drive"". Some of the dialogue is punchy, and delivered to perfection by co-star Albert Brooks, who has fun with a good part as a gangster. Bryan Cranston of 'Breaking Bad' fame is also excellent as The Drivers' friend at the garage. Ron Perlman is typically amusing as Brooks's associate, and it's nice to see screen veteran Russ Tamblyn (""West Side Story"", ""The Haunting"") in a brief appearance. Mulligan is both cute and appealing as the female lead.""Drive"" is ultimately much more of a character driven crime drama than action film in the end, and while some may find it too slow and too pretentious, it does adequately entertain with a number of good moments, and the performances help to keep it watchable.Six out of 10.",Drive
19,preppy-3,Easily one of the best films of 2011,9,31 March 2012,Ryan Gosling stars as Driver. He's a Hollywood stunt driver by day and serves as a wheelman for criminals by night. He then meets Irene (Carey Mulligan) a beautiful mother whose husband (Oscar Isaac) is just getting out of jail. He falls for her and then trouble starts. Mixed up in this are two vicious criminals (Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman) who aren't above killing to get what they want.Critics raved about this when it came out but it bombed at the box office. Why? It was pushed as an action picture which this isn't. There IS action and violence but not a lot. It's a fascinating character study of a man (Driver) who has his own code of rules and is a loner--and what happens when he falls in love. The movie is beautifully directed with stunning night time cinematography of Los Angeles. There's also a music score which fits the movie perfectly. It's a quiet slowly paced film but it has bursts of VERY graphic violence which are jarring (but necessary). The acting is great. Perlman and Brooks are chilling in their roles. Mulligan (a very talented actress) isn't in this much but she's right on target when she is. Best of all is Gosling. He's easily one of the most underrated actors of his generation. He has very little dialogue but he conveys everything through looks or body language. You can't take your eyes off him. I won't lie--the slow pace finally got to me by the end but I still HIGHLY recommend this film. Just fascinating.,Drive

21,Bunuel1976,"DRIVE (Nicolas Winding Refn, 2011) ***",7,30 September 2011,"This first caught my attention by its surprise win of the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival; just this week, then, a local friend also highly recommended it and, since the movie has not yet been released over here, I acquired it via ulterior sources. Actually, it appears that the edition I ended up with was not the finished version but rather a workprint which, instead of utilizing the score composed by Angelo Badalamenti (a pertinent choice given the film's Lynchian tone) for the entire duration incorporated cues from the Oscar-winning soundtrack of THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010) – a fact that immediately stood out to me while watching – and did not even feature the end credits but rather a blank screen accompanied by more indiscriminate and intermittent music snippets! Anyway, given the foreign-sounding director's name (of whose previous work I was only vaguely familiar with VALHALLA RISING {2009} and who, coincidentally, has just turned 41!), this could hardly be expected to emulate the Hollywood action formula – so that the ensuing European sensibility that runs throughout baffled audiences not attuned to (or prepared for) it, while delighting those used to movies which employed silence at least as eloquently as sound and speech! Likewise, I had not watched leading man Ryan Gosling in anything prior to this (despite having a handful of lauded films to his name), so I was a bit wary of his supposedly cool demeanor, given the actor's scrawny physique! That said, while I was sufficiently impressed with Gosling's contribution, I still could not reconcile myself to the fact that a stunt/getaway driver should automatically possess the 'angel of vengeance' faculties (though I concede that he is, by necessity, streetwise and quick-witted) displayed by the hero along the way! Incidentally, while the central character has been likened to Clint Eastwood's Man-With-No-Name in Sergio Leone's ""Dollars"" trilogy and Alain Delon's similarly enigmatic and taciturn hit-man Jef Costello in Jean-Pierre Melville's LE SAMOURAI (1967), a more obvious model would be Robert De Niro's deranged Vietnam vet Travis Bickle in Martin Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER (1976) – in which, at least, the protagonist's survival tactics can be excused, and we even get an equivalent here of that film's misguided date at the porno theater (which had naturally alienated girlfriend Cybill Shepard) in the elevator 'face stomping' scene (witnessed by the head-shaking heroine, neighbor and impossible-object-of-desire Carey Mulligan) clearly inspired by the notorious visage-squashed-by-fire-extinguisher opening of Gaspar Noe's IRREVERSIBLE (2002). Other easily identifiable links to the picture can be found in Don Siegel's THE KILLERS (1964), John Boorman's POINT BLANK (1967) as well as, it goes without saying, Walter Hill's THE DRIVER (1978), while the hero's chivalrous protection of a lonely woman and her son is borrowed from innumerable Westernsand, yet, it is amusing to just consider how modern film-buffs who staunchly believe that cinema began with Quentin Tarantino will only ever see his influence – in the form of foul-mouthed dialogue, seedy underworld figures, farcical violence and the non-linear structure of the climax! With this in mind, the finale is left open-ended, though the director reportedly stated that he likes to think the protagonist lived on to engage in further adventures in another city (though this would imbue him with quasi-mythical connotations that are incompatible with the unpronounced but very human love story at its core!).Mind you, the film is one of the best noir-ish thrillers of recent vintage: I was especially reminded of Steven Soderbergh's Elmore Leonard adaptation OUT OF SIGHT (1998) – not least because of the presence (again as a mobster) of Albert Brooks here – even if the Tarantino-worshippers will doubtless point out that he had himself put his stamp on the author's work with JACKIE BROWN (1997)! Other cast members include Ron Perlman (as Brooks' imposing Jewish associate, who gets a great 'exit'), ROBIN HOOD (2010)'s Oscar Isaac (as the ex-convict who seeks to capitalize on Gosling's criminal savvy as payback for the latter's interest in his wife, Mulligan) and, according to the IMDb, Russ Tamblyn (but, for the life of me, I failed to spot him!).",Drive
22,zardoz-13,Automotive Shoot'em Up,7,25 February 2013,"""Bronson"" director Nicolas Winding Refn's crime thriller ""Drive"" concerns a guy who works during the day as a Hollywood stunt car driver when he isn't an accomplice in robberies as a getaway driver. Comparisons between this Ryan Gosling epic and Jason Statham's ""Transporter"" franchise are inevitable. The chief difference is ""Driver"" is far more realistic, with up close and personal violence, that people don't walk away from except for a miracle. This R-rated, white-knuckled, urban melodrama shows men getting stabbed repeatedly with forks, rammed by automobiles during high speed chases, and slashed mercifully with straight razors. Things progressively grow worse for everybody in this grim account of cry doesn't pay. The hero is a taciturn fellow who knows how to drive like a bat out of hell. He can roll cars, outwit cops, and cruise backwards, but he doesn't use a gun. One day he notices another woman who lives in the same apartment building where he lives. Moreover, Irene (Carey Mulligan of ""Brothers"") has a young son, Benicio (Jeff Wolfe) and her husband, Standard Gabriel (Guatemalan actor Oscar Isaac of ""Sucker Punch""), is just getting released from prison. Driver (Ryan Gosling of ""Fracture"") takes an interest in Irene before he learns that she is married. After her husband gets out of prison, he approaches Driver about a robbery in the valley of a pawnshop. Standard needs this robbery so he can pay back the dastards who have run him into debt. The trouble is that they are going to double-cross him. They involve a woman, Blanche (Christina Hendricks of ""Detachment""), who knows that they will be robbed after the robbery takes place. Mind you, nobody breathes a word of double-cross to our protagonist. He is startled when he sees Standard gunned down before his very eyes. Complicating matters is the Driver's crippled friend Shannon (Bryan Cranston of TV's ""Breaking Bad"") who persuades Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks of ""Taxi Driver"") to furnish him $300-thousand dollars so he can overhaul a car and get Driver to race it. As it turns out, Bernie's accomplice is a temperamental Jewish entrepreneur, Nino (Ron Perlman of ""Hellboy""), is behind the caper that our heroes were working on when all hell broke loose. Eventually, our hero learns who he is and rams his limo so it topples off a beach. Nino tries to elude Driver, but our protagonist follows him into the surf and drowns him. Meantime, Bernie slashes Shannon's forearm and the Driver's boss bleeds to death. Bernie arranges a meeting with Driver at an Asian restaurant where he dictates the terms of their resolution. Bernie promises not to hurt the woman, but he advises the Driver to look over his shoulder at all time as a consequence of this debacle. Bernie surprises Driver and stabs him in the stomach. Driver cuts Bernie's throat and leaves his corpse in the parking lot.Everything that can go wrong does go wrong in ""Driver."" Albert Brooks, who made a name for himself as a comedian in films in the 1980s and 1990s, is cast against type as a ruthless killer who slays without a qualm. Squeamish spectators may flinch at all the close-quarters violence, like a woman getting the top of her head blown off with a shotgun. To his credit, director Nicolas Winding Refn refrains from glamorizing violence. ""Drive"" was lensed around Los Angeles, and lenser Newton Thomas Sigel makes the city of Angels look cool.

24,Boba_Fett1138,A bold and daring project that works out extremely well!,8,12 February 2012,"The rumors are all true. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2011, that takes you back to the golden years of cinema.It's good to see that there are still some film-makers out there that know how to create a great movie, that takes you back to good old '70's, when these type of movies were extremely popular. It's the sort of movie in which the main character is a criminal, or at least involved with some criminal activities but ultimately he is one with his heart at the right place and wants to do right and have justice, not for himself but for those he loves. These are the type of crime movies I absolutely love watching but it seemed like it was a genre, or at least the art of creating it, that has long been gone. Only John Woo and some Korean directors often still managed to create a great movie like this but Hollywood seemed to had forgotten all about it.And this seemed like a project that was created with a lot of love and passion. It's not one with a lot of money, or a big studio behind it. Everyone involved with this movie was involved because they must have felt it simply was a great project and not because like it seemed one that would be making them an awful lot of money.But even though this movie got made with a fairly low budget, it still is one that looks like it at least had a $100.000.000 budget behind it. It's because the movie has a great visual style to it and despite not having a big budget, it still manages to be a real spectacular and very tense one at times, with its action.It mostly still remains a movie with a slow and steady pace to it. It takes its time for its scenes to buildup, which often provides the movie with lots of tension and suspense, especially also during all of its car great car chases. It also really makes all of the action and violent moments of the movie all the more intense to watch. At first this movie really didn't look like it was going to be one with an awful lot of violence in it but there comes a turning point in this movie when suddenly everything chances and the violence becomes quite extreme and very graphic. I totally wasn't expecting this, which only made all of those moments hit even harder, than they normally would have.It also makes the movie very unpredictable. Even though the main story is quite simple and straightforward and still has plenty of surprises in it and at times the movie is truly doing some unexpected things, that luckily all work out very well for the movie as well.And despite not being a big project, it still has a real great and big cast in it. Ryan Gosling is perfect as the mostly silent and mysterious driver. He is very charismatic in his role and shows that you don't need to have an awful lot of dialog as an actor to hand in a fine, effective and very memorable performance. The supporting cast is quite effective and impressive as well. Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman are all truly excellent in this modern but yet old fashioned crime movie.Another thing that truly adds well to the atmosphere and overall style of the movie is its most excellent soundtrack. Its retro feel suits the movie extremely well and at times it also adds to the movie its buildup and tension.You this case you can truly believe the hype: ""Drive"" is an amazingly and surprisingly great movie!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Drive

One such ""job"" gets him in the tangled middle of a noirish mess, at the center of which is a crime boss played with chutzpah by Albert Brooks. Gosling's enigmatic figure is reminiscent of Travis Bickle, the character created by Robert De Niro in ""Taxi Driver,"" but even more solitary and taciturn. And like Bickle, he explodes in violent expression when pushed too far.Gosling isn't the only one who conjures impressions of ""Taxi Driver""; the whole movie does, with a healthy dash of 1980s crime thrillers thrown in for good measure. The film is awfully and explicitly violent, and my one complaint about it is that the violence is so graphic at times that it threatens to take over the movie. But that one quibble is easy to overlook in the face of a movie that is so tremendously stylish and entertaining. The only other movies from 2011 that looked as good as this one -- and as much like a MOVIE -- were ""The Artist"" and ""The Tree of Life.""

26,ferguson-6,A 5 Minute Window,8,16 September 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. An art-house crime drama. That's the best description I can come up with. Danish film auteur Nicolas Winding Refn takes the James Sallis novel and presents it like an art gallery opening ... with operatic tendencies ... and electronic music thumping straight out of the 80's. Confused yet? My apologies, but I am trying my best to make the point that this one is different. No wonder it got such a strong reception at Cannes, where creativity has always been rewarded.Ryan Gosling stars as the nameless driver. He is a movie stunt driver by day and hired lead foot in his spare time. He partners with hustler Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) for the odd-jobs and they both dream of going straight by entering the racing world. To do that, they need a capital infusion from bad guy Albert Brooks. Yep, I said BAD GUY Albert Brooks. We all know Mr. Brooks as the wry comedian who makes us laugh at the world. However, trust me when I say he plays a bad man. If you have seen ""Out of Sight"", you have seen this side before. If not, you will be shocked.Gosling's character is quite the loner, but he falls for his neighbor played by Carey Mulligan, who also has a cute young son. Gosling's dream of normal include not only racing, but also a domestic home life with these two. Small obstacle: Mulligan's husband (Oscar Isaac) is getting out of prison in a week. When he arrives, Gosling agrees to help him square a debt with some bad guys. Things don't go so well and Gosling's dream of domestic bliss goes straight to Hades. Well, actually not all that straight.Somehow the bad guys run a double cross and things get really messy. The middle 60% of this movie is as intense and thrilling as you could ever ask. Some terrific driving stunts as you would expect, but also some very nice ""little"" scenes as these most interesting characters try to make sense of many horrible loose ends.My mind was racing as I watched this oddly paced, minimal dialogue, intense story unfold. A few films flashed in my mind and I have decided there are elements of each: Bullitt (1968, Peter Yates), The Driver (1978 Walter Hill), Thief (1981 Michael Mann), To Live and Die in LA (1985 William Friedkin), and Heat (1995 Michael Mann). Additionally, Gosling's character shares some traits with Clint Eastwood's 'Man with No Name' trilogy. Now I am sure you are confused. How about one more: Gosling wears a jacket similar to Kurt Russell's Stuntman Mike in Death Proof, only this one has a scorpion and sure enough, we get the scorpion and frog story.Gosling gives a very solid strong, silent type leading man performance, and Mulligan has very little to do. Albert Brooks will probably get some well deserved attention at Oscar time. There are a couple of scenes that more and make this one worth seeing. One is the fantastic chase scene after the pawn shop robbery and the other is the most beautiful and violent elevator scene ever filmed with mood lighting.This one will be loved or hated by those that see it. Hard to imagine it falling in the gray area. If you are up for a twist on the traditional approach to crime dramas, and can handle some brutal violence, I would encourage you to check it out.",Drive
27,FlashCallahan,A five minute window....,9,29 June 2012,"Driver is a man of few words who works as a mechanic for his only friend Shannon.He moonlights as a stuntman in Hollywood films and drives getaway cars in heists.One day, he helps his neighbour Irene, whose husband is in prison, and he falls for her.

It's heavily influenced by 'The Driver' and other heist movies of the seventies.But the genius that Refn has done, has made this feel so much like an eighties movie, and not just any, a proper dirty B-movie that was released straight to video.from the soundtrack, to the whole feel, it's easily the best looking film of 2011. It's exploitation cinema at it's most silent. You don't realise until after you have seen the movie that this harks back to the exploitation movies of the late eighties, maybe this is how Stallone wanted the Expendables to feel like.Gosling is amazing as the Driver, saying very little, but doing everything he can to help his neighbour.And then there is the violence. It's extreme in it's nature, but not out of place. It fits in with the feel of the film and Refn lets you see the carnage, but only in a subliminal manner. It's not Eli Roth type violence, more from the Gasper Noe school of violence.it truly is a wonderful motion picture, and very accessible to all with different tastes in movies.Refn again proves he is a wonderful film maker.",Drive
28,gradyharp,Transformations,10,2 February 2012,"DRIVE is a fascinating character study, one that uses a minimum of words to define a complex character in a manner than seems terrifyingly quiet and mesmerizing. Based on a book written by James Sallis the screenplay is the minimalist yet secure writing of Iranian writer Hossein Amini (Wings of the Dove, The Four Feathers, Jude, Shanghai, Kill Shot, etc). Nicolas Winding Refn is the sensitive director who takes advantage of the pauses in the storyline, allowing cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel to bring this mysterious story to life.An unnamed young man referred to as Driver (Ryan Gosling) is a loner, holding down several jobs as a Hollywood stunt driver, a garage mechanic, and a getaway driver who participates in robberies as a silent, by his own rules driver. He works for garage owner, the crippled Shannon (Bryan Cranston) who in turn works for criminals Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman). Driver meets his apartment house neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos) and while there seems to be a chemistry quietly building between them, Driver is told that Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) has been in prison and will be coming home soon. Driver, Irene and Benicio bond and when Standard is finally released from prison Driver learns that Standard owes a huge protection debt and to befriend the only people about whom Driver cares, he agrees to help in a getaway car that turns very wrong. From this point the normally gentle and quiet driver transforms into a brutal man and the rest of the film is full of terror.Ryan Gosling is splendid in his role as the driver, saying more with his eyes and his body language and his silences than many actors say with a full script. Carey Mulligan is likewise strong and the supporting roles by Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, Christina Hendricks, James Biberi and even Russ Tamblyn (!) are superlative cameos. This is a tough film, full of graphic violence, but it is such a unique story and is so well acted and directed that it is one of the year's most surprising quality movies. Grady Harp",Drive
29,zetes,Excellent,10,25 September 2011,"I absolutely despised Refn's previous film, Valhalla Rising, which was a ridiculous stylistic exercise that exhibited a great eye for photography but nothing else. Well, Drive is also mostly a stylistic exercise with great photography, but this one's a keeper. Ryan Gosling stars as a stunt driver/mechanic/aspiring racecar driver who moonlights as an uber-professional getaway driver for criminals. After getting emotionally involved with his neighbor (the drop-dead gorgeous Carey Mulligan) and her son, Gosling agrees to help her ex-con husband (Oscar Isaac) pull off a heist. It goes wrong, and Gosling becomes a mob target. So, yeah, the story's nothing new or special. And the performances are nothing to write home about, either. It's all in the direction, the cinematography, the sound and the editing. And, man, it's just a beautifully made film. It feels kind of out of place in 2011, more resembling a 1970s auteurist project. It's pure cinema, not unlike the other great English language film of 2011 (so far), The Tree of Life. Not quite as profound as that one, but, still, quite great. Also starring Albert Brooks, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman and Christina Hendricks.",Drive

The car scenes, the few in the film, where good. The bad is when a movie is titled Drive one expects a car film. The car chase scenes where short and anti climatic. I said to myself: What? That is it for the car chase? The film had a nice artistic Michael Mann style acting, sets, visuals, but to much style over substance.

31,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Drive,10,4 November 2011,"I have to admit I haven't been much of a Ryan Gosling fan, but two back to back movies of his hitting the theatres simultaneously here have changed my mind, both being very different films that Gosling nailed his leading characters to a T. With The Ides of March, his character was a cocksure schemer who had to compromise his morals and principles to stay ahead of the game, and in Drive, he plays the archetypal strong, silent and man of few words type, hiding a more explosive self deep within, ready to be released at the shortest of notices.There are many films of late that has that fast car component, from The Fast & The Furious and Transporter franchises, to Faster with Dwayne Johnson as a tough guy and Nicholas Cage as an undead in Drive Angry. Drive is a different take altogether, more Transporter in the way Gosling's stunt car Driver operates with his rules for any side, clandestine jobs he undertakes, being the best of the best in what he does, although less flashy and sans fancy martial arts moves and packing a default gun. But that doesn't make his character any meeker than he looks, with a violent pent up nature well hidden from his gentle, hardworking demeanour, ready to unleash hell on his unsuspecting opponents.If you haven't heard of director Nicolas Winding Refn, perhaps it is time to sit up and take notice, especially since the director's works have not hit the local screens until now, with films like the Pusher franchise, and Bronson being critically acclaimed. He brought about both style and substance in what would be a rather moody film, with characters speaking less and showing a lot more through their nuances and acting, which Gosling aces and made his driver character all the more appealing. The opening heist scene will set the tone on what you the viewer will come to expect, totally going off in a different tangent from what the usual cookie cutter scene will be - noisy and almost always complete with reckless crashes, for what would be an extremely smart and stealthy getaway relying on street smarts, logic and plenty of driving know-how.Based on a book by James Sallis and adapted for the screen by Hossein Amini, who was also responsible for films like Shanghai and Killshot, the story has the Driver getting caught up with the affairs of his married neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos), with a promising romance rudely interrupted with Irene's husband, an ex-convict, being threatened by gangsters to get involved in the robbing of a pawnshop. Things of course don't go as planned and the Driver takes it upon himself to protect the innocent people he is in love with from any potential harm, even if it means sacrificing relationships he holds dearly and a budding hope of carving out a career in car racing.What made this film such a stand out from its genre peers, is how Refn crafted a film based on extremely gorgeous cinematography and having to say a lot more with less. I'm absolutely taken in by how beautiful every shot looked, coupled with an excellent soulful soundtrack that fit perfectly into the film, as well as the heartfelt performances by Gosling and Mulligan, even if the latter is somewhat reduced to a damsel in distress. There were many scenes that stood out so well you'd want to freeze frame those moments to adore its play with light and shadow, and credit goes to cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel for having every shot in picturesque fashion.Then there's the explosive turn from the midway point which threw all the hope the characters had built up out of the window, and where the violence got amplified. From the silent nature that the Driver had exuded so far, it gave way to careening violence and gore when he goes on a one man protective rampage to want to make things right again, with villains being forced to a corner, and essentially having both sides show hand just how extreme each side can get when it boiled down to self-preservation, with everyone sent down a spiral of never ending violence with all to lose. Here Gosling shines in his one man army role without being over the top, with his intense gaze mesmerizing all on screen and always threatening to go over the edge, which he does with loved ones under threat.It's an extremely romantic story at heart as well as a film based on technical brilliance punctuated with well delivered performances from its cast, with Refn at the top of his game making you feel for and getting involved with the characters and plot. An excellent film all round and one that will go into my shortlist as one of the best this year. Highly recommended!",Drive

Ryan Gosling plays the role of a quiet young man who appears to be a genius behind the wheel and sometimes is the getaway driver for different undesirables.If you think this is the same plot as The Transporter, then you are right, only with a realistic and atmospheric screenplay and soundtrack.

He falls for Carey Mulligan (who can blame him?) befriends her child and even her husband, then it all goes bust.Bottom line: a very beautiful film, quiet, understated, going for the art, not really the story. At the end of the film you get a little pause, just good enough to make you wonder how you would like the film to end and if it would matter.

However, the excessive violence will surely putt off the faint-hearted. There is just too much of disturbing bloodshed in here. The violence definitely could've been toned down. The Adapted Screenplay is intense & progressive. Nicolas Winding Refn Directs this recent critical-darling, with Razor-Sharp Vision. His work in here, deserves him an Oscar Nom! Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are perfect. Action-Sequences/Stunts, are extremely raw.Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Brooks dominates the show with an unforgettable performance as the violent & unpredictable villain. This is Brooks At His Finest! Ryan Gosling is commendable, as always. Carey Mulligan is in excellent form, while Bryan Cranston deserved more footage. Oscar Isaac is as usual. Others lend support.On the whole, 'Drive' is grotesque, but stunning at times nonetheless.",Drive
35,Smells_Like_Cheese,Reminder on why we love movies,9,11 February 2012,"Last year one of the big films that I think was a surprise hit was called Drive. I was always curious to see this movie, but unfortunately missed it. From what I had heard it was a must see so I rented it and absolutely fell in love with it. Reminding me a bit of the old action movies from the 70's and 80's with those great old cars that could take one heck of a beating with the anti-hero who wins your heart over and then we get a million sequels trying to out bank the previous film. Anyways, Drive offers something different, a new cult classic for a generation that is a bit ADD, this gives you something exciting or great to watch each second. I can't tell you what an amazing opening chase scene they choreographed, not to mention some very exciting action scenes. Ryan Gosling continues to be a star on the high rise proving his leading man qualities and to be an action star, he just steals the show as Driver.Driver lives in a low-rent apartment building and works as a mechanic, stuntman and getaway driver. The Driver works anonymously, never for the same people twice, and allows them only five minutes to do their business. He meets his neighbor Irene in the apartment building elevator and later helps her and her young son when Irene has car trouble at a local market. Shannon owns the garage the Driver works at and arranges his other jobs. Shannon persuades the mobster Bernie Rose to purchase a stock car for the Driver to race after seeing the Driver's skill. Bernie's business partner is Nino, a Jewish mobster. But when Driver has been set up he realizes that not only does he have to protect himself but those he cares about most.The car chase scenes are so well put together, I haven't been this excited since Death Proof. I also loved how Driver's face in the first scene just stayed emotionless, he knows he's good and that no matter what how to out run the cops. He's a man with a mission who doesn't have anyone in his life, but when a woman and her son come into his, he will fight for them because they're worth it. He has a man, who's his boss, who is almost like his father figure and their relationship is not only believable but relatable for anyone. Bryan Cranston has come quite a way since Malcolm in the Middle, he does a great job and conveys such a likability to what could have been a bland and boring character. The bloodshed in the movie is absolutely insane, like I said, this reminds you a bit of a 70's action drive in movie. There's buckets of blood and tons of violence. I also loved having Ron Pearlman as this typical mobster who's terrifying to cross paths with but you can't forget that he's Jewish. What a great addition to the character. I think Drive was one of the better movies that came out of 2011, it has everything that you could want in an action movie. Action, romance, great soundtrack, cool cars and awesome chase scenes. Let's put it this way, I rented it, watched it, the next day I bought it, it was totally worth it.9/10",Drive
36,lasttimeisaw,Drive,8,20 February 2012,"This high-acclaimed black noir of our era has accumulated ""best-of-the-year"" momentum ever since it garnered a Best Director honor for the Denmark prodigy Nicolas Winding Refn (from PUSH trilogy and DRIVE is his Hollywood premier) in Cannes last year.The film exudes a drastically visual flare almost in every scene, from its one-of-a-kind camera angle, an utterly mind-blowing hue (a mesmerizing contrast between warm orange and ruthless shadow dark). The whole script is as corny as any hacks could write with eyes shut, a point-of- no-return road for a lone hero to save his beloved woman from danger. So plot wise, the film could be a thorough disaster, and here comes our virtuoso director to rescue the film and without embellishing the content, fully showcasing his theatrical aesthetics to fend off the fatigue of the tedious characterization (a taciturn Ryan Gosling can only be beneficial to his staunchest followers, while a dainty Carey Mulligan has too little to display her faculty), among the cast, if one doesn't harbor a over-hyped expectation, Albert Brooks will be a fierily menacing discovery particularly it is creepily against his usual comedic strain. Subtlety rules, several remarkable shots and tableaux (to wit: the hammer menace in the strip- club's dressing room, the man with a creepy musk in front of the pizzeria before the slaughter with its consequent beach hunt at night and so on) are jaw-droppingly staggering and the violence showcase is harrowingly stylistic, the elevator scene could be on a par with the Gaspar Noé's groundbreakingly grisly IRREVERSIBLE (2002). The film is going to be a classic cult not the least because of all the Oscar snubs it receives, which is confoundingly a congenial sign of its bright future both for the film itself and Mr. Refn's professional career (the latter is even more uncanny regarding the recent vicious curse upon non-American new directors' debut in Hollywood, Refn and Cary Fukunaga from JANE EYRE 2011 are the only jinx-breakers so far). Ps. the hypnotic soundtrack is the ace, the ending-song COLLEGE'S A REAL HERO is the killing for me.",Drive
37,KineticSeoul,"Slick, edgy and artistic film that is awesome. Even the mass audiences will enjoy this film.",9,20 September 2011,"I heard that this movie is split from audiences that enjoyed it and those that didn't. I fall into the category of the audiences that enjoyed it. I really think this is a artistic movie that can reach out to the masses. Yeah it's a artistic movie but it just didn't seemed that forced and most of the way through it was engrossing. Yes, even the first half of the film. The second half is better but I thought the first half was pretty good and didn't seem boring to me. But even I gotta admit the first scene of this movie was one of the most awesome opening to a movie, it was cool while having a bit of tension to it. Ryan Gosling was really good in this and almost perfect for this role as the slick, quiet, reserved, cool and yet dangerous character. The rest of the cast is stunning as well and the 80's vibe was great, especially the music in this. Another thing that is stunning is how it's directed, there might not be that much going on but the way it's directed in a artistic old school manner makes it great. I also enjoyed how the characters sometimes uses the emotions of there body instead of dialogue to convey what they are feeling and thinking, especially with Ryan Gosling. Maybe I need to see this again but for the first watch it was awesome. If your one of those audiences that wants to see chase scenes similar to the ""Fast and the Furious"" movies or something along the lines of ""Transporter"" with it's ridiculousness might be left disappointed. This is a edgy and artistic flick that revolves around a character that is a stuntman by morning and a getaway driver by night. Just wish there was just one more cool drive scene near the end cause it just seemed to lack that although the title of this movie is ""Drive"". Anyways this movie proves that artistic movies can not only be compelling but fun as well.9/10",Drive
38,sddavis63,"The Very Definition Of ""Dreadful""",1,21 March 2017,"Seriously - there are times when I just don't get this site. I get that people have different tastes in movies - but this movie has a ridiculously high rating. To be perfectly blunt about it - it's dreadful. If you look up the word ""dreadful"" in the dictionary, I'm sure that there will be some reference to ""Drive"" in the definition. It takes almost half the movie before we really get a sense of where this is going - and even then it doesn't become very interesting. It's ridiculously and often graphically bloody and makes terrible use of bad music to try to build suspense.Ryan Gosling is the star of this. He plays a Hollywood stunt driver who also moonlights as a driver for more than a few shady characters. But that really doesn't matter, because ultimately his ""undercover work"" isn't what gets him in trouble. He gets in trouble because he falls for his neighbour - who happens to be married to a guy who gets out of prison owing a lot of money, and he decides to help him out, gets entangled in - something. I tried - hard - to follow along but I spent a lot more of my time just trying to stay awake.One thing I have discovered over the years is that people get caught up in the hype about a movie, and when it turns out to be dreadful, they can't admit that they got caught up in the hype, so rather than calling it a good movie, it becomes an ""artistic masterpiece"" or some such thing. But seriously - let's cut to the chase. This was dreadful. Just dreadful. (1/10)",Drive
39,Hellmant,Gosling is the man with no vocabulary!,9,20 September 2011,"'DRIVE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Art house indie action film from director Nicolas Winding Refn (a man well known in the genre for films like 'BRONSON', 'PUSHER' and 'VALHALLA RISING'). It was written by Hossein Amini and adapted from the book of the same name by James Sallis. The book was a popular property in Hollywood and went through multiple filmmaker's and producer's hands before successfully going into production. It was star Ryan Gosling that picked Refn to direct the film because he was a fan of his earlier work and thought he'd be a good fit. The result is what many call a masterpiece and a joyous example of cinematic style and art. It's rare that an action film like this receives such high praise from critics (making it one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year) and because of it's bold character and individuality it has received the opposite approval from the viewing public, with many showing a strong dislike to the film (obviously they were expecting a different movie). I don't always do so but this time I definitely agree with the critics. The film is a wonderful example of stylish action done right. Gosling plays an unnamed mechanic who also does part time work stunt driving for major motion pictures as well as getaway driving for crooks. In his illegal ventures he always remains unknown to his business partners and only allows them five minutes to do their business before he abandons them. He's an expert at everything he does and always remains cold and calculated. He also remains distant and aloof to everyone he meets (never saying more than a couple words to anyone) except his employer at the car shop where he works Shannon (Bryan Cranston), who's also his closest friend. That all changes when he starts to get to know (and develop feelings for) a young mother, named Irene (Carey Mulligan), in the apartment complex where he lives. When her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) returns home from prison and puts his wife and son in jeopardy the 'driver' steps in and offers to help him out. When the job he assists him on goes bad 'driver' soon finds himself in a s--- load of trouble with some local mobsters (Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman) and things turn bloody really fast.The film is visually stunning and almost always pleasing to the senses in almost every way. The soundtrack and score add the perfect touch to an already extremely visceral film going experience. The violence is stunning and overly graphic but in my opinion not too distracting or unsettling; it all fits well in the context of the film. The screenplay is cleverly written and the directing of course top notch. The film is very reminiscent of classic 'grindhouse' as well as classic Hollywood 'film noir'. Gosling is decent in the lead but it's not his best work in my opinion. I'm a fan of his and know he can do much better. Here he plays the silent 'I'm too cool to acknowledge you' type that he's somewhat been type casted as in a number of films. The character is supposed to be a 'man with no name' Clint Eastwood type but to me it just came off as Gosling doing Gosling. He speaks very little in the entire film so we never really get to know his 'driver' character and the romance between he and Mulligan feels a little forced and unbelievable as a result of it as well. The routine character he does is fitting to the film though and makes for a good Hollywood tough guy even so. The rest of the cast is more than adequate in their parts and makes up a variety of distinct and unique characters. The film as a whole is a stunning piece of thrilling cinema and packed with memorable visuals.

40,Buddy-51,Mesmerizing exercise in pure cinema,9,19 April 2012,"Not since ""Taxi Driver"" has there been so glorious a paean to the poetry of driving as the appropriately titled ""Drive,"" a film that received a standing ovation when it was unspooled at the Cannes Film Festival in 2011. Indeed, the film is an homage of sorts to Scorsese's 1976 classic as well as to its iconic lead character, Travis Bickle.As Ryan Gosling's unnamed character cruises hypnotically along the streets of downtown L.A., he seems all of a piece with his vehicle - almost as if it were an extension of him or he of it. For Gosling, driving is clearly both an obsession and an art form and he brings to it all the finely-tuned grace and immersive concentration of a symphony conductor or a prima ballerina. Taciturn almost to the point of inarticulateness, Gosling's character only comes fully alive when he's behind the wheel of a car. Indeed, almost a full quarter-of-an-hour of running time elapses before he speaks a word, and even then - and indeed throughout the course of the film - it's only to utter some banal commonplace or half-articulated thought. Language cannot convey his feelings, the sense of who he is; only driving can. Speech serves a strictly utilitarian function for Gosling, but driving speaks to his soul. And, appropriately, both his jobs - that of an assistant mechanic at a local repair place and a daredevil stuntman for the movies - involve working with cars to one extent or another. And, oh yes, he also sells his services as getaway driver for an assortment of sleazy armed robbers willing to pay his price and play by his rules.This last fact is what winds up causing problems for the character, when he falls in love with an attractive neighbor (Carey Mulligan) whose husband gets paroled from prison early on in the movie. But the direction the story takes with this plot turn is not what you might expect, thanks to an intelligent screenplay by Hossein Amini based on James Sallis' novel of the same name.Gosling's character fits comfortably in the mold of Travis Bickle - a morally ambiguous yet righteously angry antihero who defends innocent women and children against the evils of the world while freely crossing over that line himself. And at times he seems almost as mentally unhinged and psychotic as Bickle himself does. Yet, Gosling also runs the risk of inadvertently endangering both himself and those he cares about with his actions. The dual nature of the character is evident throughout the picture in the radically different ways in which he treats the various people in his life. Indeed, it is only with Irene and her young son, Benicio, that Gosling can be unconditionally and stoically tender - in stark contrast to the methodical brutality with which he dispatches the numerous enemies who are out to get him (be forewarned: the violence in the film can be unnervingly graphic at times).Perpetually clad in a silver racing jacket - its collar turned up and a giant scorpion printed on the back - Gosling delivers his most indelible screen performance to date. Largely denied the tool of dialogue to define the character, Gosling is forced to rely almost exclusively on facial expressions and body language to convey the man's thoughts and feelings at any given moment. And he does an award-worthy job, for he commands our attention every split second of the time he is on the screen - which is virtually always. He's like a muted vortex drawing us into the heart of the character.The superb cast is rounded out by a hirsute Bryan Cranston (""Breaking Bad"") as the owner of the shop where Gosling works; Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman (""Sons of Anarchy"") as mob bosses looking to hire Gosling to be the driver for a stock car they're planning on purchasing; and a barely recognizable Christina Hendricks (from ""Mad Men"") as a moll who gets in over her head on one of Gosling's ""jobs."" Heck, even Russ Tamblyn, of ""West Side Story"" fame, makes a cameo appearance! Those who criticize the film for being too arty and Gosling's character for being too taciturn seem, to me, to be missing the point entirely. First, he is inarticulate precisely because he has found a means of expressing himself (i.e. driving) that doesn't require conventional language. (In fact, wouldn't that criticism eliminate all silent movies automatically?) And, second, like a fine wine, the movie can be savored strictly on the basis of its aesthetic qualities (""The New World"" is a similar film that comes to mind). We are transported to a different world through the sheer beauty of the imagery and pacing, the mesmerizing performances, the hypnotic and smoothly flowing tracking shots (kudos to cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel), the haunting score (more kudos to Cliff Martinez) and canny soundtrack choices.As a director, Danish-born Nicolas Winding Refn is clearly a filmmaker to the manner born, demonstrating a command and mastery of the medium that leaves one breathless with admiration and awe. For ""Drive"" is a movie that revels in its own being. And that makes it a special treat for anyone sophisticated and savvy enough to appreciate its cinematic richness.",Drive
41,thesar-2,A Slow Transport,7,14 December 2011,"If one could imagine an adult, much more serious and a helluva SLOWER version of the Jason Statham action movie, The Transporter, it'd be Drive.Critically acclaimed and further praise for one of my favorites, Ryan Gosling, were reasons for me wanting to see this. And I, too, will rave on how well made it was, shot, acted and contained some decent action sequences. Butit was so dammed slow, I could barely keep my head up to wade through 80% of the movie – the slow-paced scenes – to get to any promise of action as the plot indicated would happen.And what was with the pink opening credits?I digress. Much-too-quiet ""Driver"" (Gosling) aids bad guy's getaways as a night job while managing a garage-shop day job and being a part-time movie stunt driver. How is ever to find time for romance? Especially with a married mother one apartment over? Obviously, he will, but he will also get caught up in both helping them and mixing with the wrong (mob) crowd.It's a fun movie, when it's moving – hence the title, but get ready for a snail's walk to get to something exciting. Yeah, I know I shan't be critiquing the movie for what it's not. It's not a Transporter reboot. But it's also not something I ever want to see again.",Drive

43,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Initially threatens to drown in style, but stick with it and there's a fine pay off",9,22 May 2012,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A man known only as Driver (Ryan Gosling) has a successful career as a Hollywood stunt man and can basically do anything he puts his mind to when it comes to fast cars. But Shannon (Bryan Cranston), an old friend of his, has come in to some money worries and approaches crime boss Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) about using Driver as the getaway in a heist on a pawn shop. With his own money worries after falling for the wife of Standard (Oscar Isaac) who's just come out of prison, he agrees-only to find himself caught in a maze of deception and deceit.Drive found itself the subject of some favourable reviews from a lot of critics, who I expected it to get the brush off from. Before I even started watching it, I knew there'd be a little more to it than what it looked. And indeed, Nicolas Winding Refn has done something quite inspired by taking what is quite a conventional heist story and coating it over in an art-house style flavour, with a clever use of style and an accompanying background soundtrack. The trouble is to begin with, it sort of loses you with this and threatens to become a case of style over substance, and it's true that a bit of patience is required with it, but it all pays off in the end with quite an impressive, brutal thriller that delivers.Cast wise, in the lead, Gosling has a natural, quietly mesmerising presence, even if he can't shake the feeling of being a bit too much of a pretty boy for such a brutal, blood thirsty film, while a supporting cast including Brooks, Carey Mulligan and Ron Perlman manage to be a little more than surplus to requirements. Refn manages not to get too lost in his own pretensions and pulls everything off quite wonderfully.It's a film that could well alienate as many as it draws in, but it deserves to be appreciated on it's own level and seen for the stylistic, violent gem it is. ****",Drive
44,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Never conforms to its genre, instead bending it to fit its stoic, tender yet explosively violent story.",7,27 February 2018,"Nicolas Winding Refn's calmly tender yet explosively violent crime thriller never conforms to its genre, instead self-assuredly bending it to fit its stoic story while perhaps somewhat stubbornly maintaining its relatively laid-back pace and less-is-more mentality, and it's undoubtedly a much more memorably nuanced affair because of it. While The Driver himself may seem somewhat of a blank slate, he's actually an incredibly deep character who's lack of overt outward expression is matched by an interior complexity rarely seen in pictures of this kind (if any) and it's his unspoken connection to the other characters that roots him deep within his newfound reality, while establishing his longing to escape the criminal world he has unwillingly come to call his home. His brutality is presented in an honestly visceral way that refreshingly shows the consequences of such actions and never condones them even if they ultimately save the people that the protagonist cares the most deeply about. 7/10",Drive
45,bowmanblue,An interesting ride,7,26 May 2014,"I have to say that I was surprised at what Drive turned out to be (but pleasantly so). I didn't know much about it. Driver. Bank robber. Stuntman. That was basically the premise - not that original, but well done and suitably different to be very watchable.First of all, don't expect wall to wall action. The action is subtle and certainly not the central focus (Transformers 3, it is not). And there is violence. Not a lot, but when it happens, it does hit you.The thing you have to know about Drive is that it is SLOW. That may sound like the wrong word to use to describe a film that uses fast cars as a main element to it. However, it's not the car chases that are slow, it's the dialogue. No one says that much. Words are replaced by looks and some slightly obscure shots (any more and it may almost be considered 'art house.' If you've seen David Lynch's 'Lost Highway,' I couldn't help but draw comparisons. Drive has a very similar look and feel to it (minus the supernatural element).If you're looking for fast paced action and snappy dialogue, you probably won't like this film. However, if you're in the mood for something a little different with underplayed performances, interspersed with some violence and car chases, then give it a go.A pleasant surprise.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Drive
46,dromasca,a beautiful love story disguised as a violent action movie,8,9 January 2012,"Certainly, 'Drive' is a thriller. A different and unexpected type of thriller. Whoever has seen this film will remember maybe the story line, and a few action sequences, some of them extremely violent. They will remember first of all the two principal characters and their almost unreal lover story, they will remember the calm and focused look of Ryan Gosling (we never get to know the name of his character, he is just the Driver) which blurs into tenderness when he crosses the restraint smile of Irene (Carey Mulligan). One kiss followed by a violent kill, this is the only physical contact the two will ever make on screen.It may take a good 30 minutes for the viewer to decide what this film is about, but then things become clear. It is the most impossible and most beautiful love story we have seen in a while, disguised in a violent action movie. He is a stuntman, and a potential race driver who does not get to the race tracks, but races for burglars, helping them escape the location of their crimes. She is her floor neighbor, she has a kid and a husband in jail. When things seem to converge to some domestic low class drama located in the non-privileged area of Los Angeles, the husband returns from jail, gets soon into trouble, and the Driver is the only one who can potentially help him. Or drive him to his destiny. From here the second half of the film becomes one of the most violent I have seen recently on mainstream cinema, all packaged by director Nicolas Winding Refn in 70s style cinematography mixed with classic cars races.The sincere and straightforward acting and the day to day appearance of the main characters make the violence (and there is violence!) even more striking. And yet, the overall impression 'Drive' left to me was of one of the most sensible films I have seen recently, with emotion surging up from a very unexpected place. My only problem is that I am not sure to whom this film would be recommended. Action films fans may find a little bit too sentimentality here, romantic movies fans may be shocked by the violence.

47,g-bodyl,"Gritty, Violent Art-house Thriller!",9,5 May 2013,"Drive is an excellent film just how most critics made it out to be. It is a gritty and sometimes quite disturbing film. It's also a way different film than I expected it to be and it seems I was the only person who accepted that. This film was basically marketed as action film similar to the Fast and the Furious franchise but in reality, it wouldn't come close. This is a slow-paced drama with very violent scenes incorporated in.This crime film directed by Nicholas Winding Refn is about a guy named ""Driver"" who is a Hollywood stunt driver by day and getaway driver by night. He falls in love with his neighbor and that romance spirals them both into the underworld where heists gone wrong can be quite deadly.The acting is really good as it should be with a cast like this. Ryan Gosling is becoming a great, versatile actor as it seems like he has been in every movie that came out in 2011. Carey Mulligan, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, and Ron Perlman make a very convincing supporting cast. I really thought Mulligan shined the most though.Overall, this is a very good crime thriller that reminds me of the heyday of crime films back in the 70's. I noticed how sharp the camera movements are especially when showing scenes of the city at night which reminded me of 2004's Collateral.

50,CuriosityKilledShawn,If David Lynch directed The Transporter,7,15 January 2013,"Ryan Gosling overtakes Jason Statham as the stoic man behind the wheel. Like his bald-headed rival he gets into trouble when distracted by a woman and is hurled into a plot involving gangsters and hit men. While Louis Leterrier's French thriller tried so hard to be Hollywood, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn's LA-based thriller tries very hard to be European, and takes the viewer on a ride down a lost highway.At the same time it also comes across as a secret remake of Walter Hill's The Driver. All of these films are very, very similar, but Drive is the best of them. It's difficult to comprehensively review the movie as it is very minimalistic and focuses more on atmosphere and the quiet moments in between dialogue rather than action and twists. It's a wonderful movie to look at though, and I do want to complain about how problematic the morals and values of the unnamed 'Driver' are, but if it is the intention to make him morally ambiguous then I guess it is successful. It doesn't make for a great character regardless of how smooth Gosling plays him.The violence is harrowing and brutal, as it is in real life. Nicolas Winding Refn seems to understand that there is no action in real life, there is only violence, and it's brutal and ugly and not something any sane person wants to happen to them. In this respect it is far more grown-up than The Transporter but cannot be praised as being a 'better' film as it is still sold on style and visuals. The substance takes a back seat and the movie apologetically delivers what it wants without feeling the need to scream for attention. I have to respect it for that.",Drive

He sees his chance of a new life, when he fall in love, with his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her young son, Benicio (Kaden Leos). However, Irene's ex con-husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac) own a large debt to some dangerous mobsters, Nino (Ron Perlman) & Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks), that puts everything that the driver is hoping for, in jeopardy. Can, the driver live a quiet, simple, peaceful life, or will his dreams be shatter by the harsh reality of a life of crime? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, the first thing, most people notice about this film, is the lack of car chases. After all, you would think, a movie call 'drive', would be full of action scenes like that. The trailers give the impression that the film is a straight car chase thriller similar to 2001's 'The Fast and the Furious', when it actually features quite a lot of quiet drama scenes sprinkled amongst the bone-crunching violence. One woman even try to sue because she didn't receive the movie, she wanted. Instead, the movie is more focus on the character development of Ryan Gosling's character, from isolated bad guy to a man trying to be the hero, despite being driven to a life of crime. You see this, with the film metaphor of the famous ""frog and the scorpion"" fable, in how it relates to his associates. No wonder, why he wears that cool neon scorpion jacket, all of the time as if he's a frog. I like the director approached to a typically American crime genre with its silence, but deadly Euro-chic sensibility and style. He paints a very realistic picture of grimy landscape of dark, neo-noir, seedy underbelly of the modern LA with his mise-en-scene style. From his amazing shots, and lighting, comes a great impression of what characters are thinking, without the mastery of a lot of dialogue. While, some people might see that, as somewhat boring to see, two people stare blankly at each other in long cuts, both in romanticism and in crime drama. In my opinion, there is no better, example of great use of that, then the surrealistic scene in the elevator. It's really shows, the complexity of light of hope versus dark of destruction, all while maintaining the consistent mood, tone, and look of the film, until the climactic end, which furthermore, spark the audience member to think, even if 2012's direct sequel novel 'Driven', kinda spoils it. It is not often that a filmmaker is able to do that. The film's soundtrack is also amazing with electropop songs like ""Nightcall"" by Kavinsky & ""A Real Hero"" by College & Electric Youth. A mix of earnest '80s-synth-inspired tunes and original pieces by composer, Cliff Martinez were also worth listening to. Drive also has the ability to be one of those movies that reminds us of other movies like 1963's 'Scorpio Rising', 1967's 'Point Blank', 1968's 'Bullitt', 1978's 'The Driver', 1981's 'Thief"" and others. Yet overall, I thought the film was less about making direct homages than blending its influences together into fascinating hybrids. So, it was no surprised to see the movie being set in Los Angeles. There is also theories online about the film, being a spiritual sequel to 2012's film, 'The Place beyond the Pines'. Anyways, I enjoyed Ryan Gosling's enigmatic, messiah complex, type of a character. He has the right amount of graceful swagger and sex appeal to pull off, a character, that look tough and sinister, but also has a bit of a heart, while speaking fewer than twenty full sentences. I like how the film didn't spoil his mysterious character, outright like the novel, did. There's a moment past the midway point of the film in which his character looks at Mulligan's Irene with a mixture of self-awareness and confusion as if he was a small child, who knew he upset somebody. It's the expression of a man who knows he's a shark and wonders if he can be a good one, without speaking one word. Gosling and Mulligan have an incredible chemistry, which is impressive when you consider how little they actually speak to each other. Each actor manages to say more with a glance or an awkward smile than most do with pages worth of dialogue to work with. Still, I wish, the movie would had hired a Hispanic actress for the role as Irina, as it would focus the book, more. Despite that, Mulligan does a wonderful job. So, it was little lost. Albert Brooks is also wonderful. He achieves a level of intimidating menace that hasn't really been seen from him before. Ron Perlman is reliable as ever, but not as memorable as Brooks. Maybe, because he's more typecast as these types of a role. Bryan Cranston effortlessly applies a lot of heart to his supporting role as Driver's boss and loyal friend, Shannon. Behind Brooks, he's probably the second most memorable supporting character in the film. Overall: I have to say, the excellent synth-pop soundtrack, great performances and the juxtaposition of beauty and shocking violence, ensure that Drive will become an instant cult-classic for years to come. It's a must-watch for any fan of neo-noir. Highly recommended.",Drive
55,paulclaassen,I can watch this film just for the soundtrack...,7,16 September 2019,"'Drive' certainly is unlike any vengeance film I've experienced. The film's beginning is seriously short on dialogue. I mean, there are literally moments when characters are together without saying a single word. But the cinematography is so awesome that dialogue are sometimes not necessary.The film's score is awesome! It has a tranquil synthesized mood, resulting in a serene feel, despite the dark theme. The film spends about 40 minutes setting up the scene and the characters (and is never boring), but when the action (and unexpected) arrives around the 45-minute mark, the film really hits you! It grabs you and doesn't let go. Be warned, despite the film's initial tranquility, it becomes brutal and gory - yet ever so stylish and effective.Ryan Gosling is outstanding!! His character is mysterious and seemingly trouble-free (Dan Stevens' character in 2014's 'The Guest' was very similar). 'Drive' is beautifully filmed and will consume you with every frame. By the end of the film one can't help but think what a masterfully crafted film this actually was! Brilliant!!",Drive
56,sol-,Driven,7,18 February 2017,"A stunt driver's life is thrown into disarray after befriending a lonely young mother and her son in this crime drama directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and starring Ryan Gosling. 'Drive' is a curious to film watch with Refn's subsequent features fresh in mind. With a more traditional narrative than 'Only God Forgives' and 'The Neon Demon', it is little wonder that audiences took more kindly to this earlier film than Refn's follow-up efforts, however, Refn excels when directing sequences that are dreamy, nightmarish and mysterious and there are less such sequences here due to the more conventional narrative. That said, 'Drive' is still very visually alluring with its nighttime shots set to Cliff Martinez's atmospheric score standing out in particular. Gosling is also more compelling here than in 'Only God Forgives' despite playing a character equally as laconic with equally sketchy background details. The connection he makes with the mother and her son always feels very real with little need for small talk between them. A montage of the trio playing by a lake is way too cute, blatant and unnecessary, but generally speaking, the bond between them radiates in remarkably subtle ways. The limited background for Gosling's character (only ever known as 'The Kid') work fairly well too. Of course, one desperately wants to know more about how he ticks, but by keeping him at a distance, it makes it easier for Refn to spin here what could be considered a parable for the chaos that comes into one's life with a partner and child to support.",Drive
57,tomgillespie2002,Stylish cinema with nods to David Lynch and Michael Mann,7,5 January 2012,"Sarah Deming, a resident of Michigan, took legal action against the producers of Drive, as she was expecting a Fast and the Furious (2001)- type action movie. Bizarrely she is also claiming that the film is anti- Semitic, but on the former, she has a bit of a point, as the trailer does focus mainly on the driving element of the film, which there is very little in comparison to the aforementioned piece-of-s**t franchise, making the trailer a little misleading. This ludicrous story aside, the film does use many of the iconographic elements that make a good driving/action film: Ryan Gosling's character, simple named Driver, wears the sports jacket made famous by the likes of Steve McQueen, Ryan O'Neal and Paul Newman, made iconic in 1960's and '70's cinema.Driver is a stunt man for the film industry, and makes extra cash as a transporter of people in heists. He meets his neighbour, Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son. Eventually her partner is released from prison, and is conned into doing a robbery, to pay back money for services whilst in prison. Driver, having a strong connection with Irene, wants to help him out. As this is a set up, things go terribly wrong. Albert Brooks gives a superb performance as gangster Bernie Rose, along with smaller - but no less brilliant - performances from Ron Perlman and Bryan Cranston (who was the main reason that I ever watched Malcolm in the Middle).Nicholas Winding Refn's first American film, sees him riff on many classic films - of particularly the 1980's. The lush look of LA is captured in all it's neon-lit beauty and reminded me very much of the iconic Michael Mann aesthetic. Also there are some protracted, and audio-specific moments of violence that offered that same kind of eeww- factor that you get in a David Lynch moment of violence. Gosling has to beat a guy in a lift, and the sounds are very reminiscent of the opening scene in Wild at Heart (1990), where Sailor crushes someones head against a stairwell banister.I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this piece of stylish cinema - and fortunately it is not a case of style over substance, that is so prevalent today. This film has strong emotion, even with Gosling's incredibly laconic performance. I had a conversation with a friend about this film. As I was saying how ""cool"" it was, my friend turned to me and said he had started watching the film, but switched off half way through as he found it boring. This brings me back to the first paragraph of this review. He also believed the film to be of action orientation. So, is everything about this film misleading? Well, no.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Drive
58,Floated2,Really well done with a unique style,10,8 February 2012,"Finally got the chance to see this film after hearing a lot of praise about it, so I decided to watched it, and I think it lives up to it's hype. It is quite hard for me to review this movie. Everything that can be said HAS been said. Why would you even need another opinion? Drive has suspense, romance, great dialogue, and more that will just take up WAY too much time to put into full detail. Even though this movie is very meditative in nature, there are some really cool action scenes. The opening getaway scene may be slow, but has so much suspense in it as The Driver, whose name is never revealed, is a wheelman with a 5 minute window. He starts the clock, listens to the Police radio, and waits for the criminals he is driving for to be done with their heist. One of them gets back while the other is still in the building. This scene causes a ton of suspense. Will he just drive off and have the mission go off? Will the cops arrive? There is also an amazing car chase scene after a critical event in the movie which I thought was awesome.Like the protagonist, the film's actions speak louder than words. There is dialogue, but what is really memorable is the atmosphere, however, the dialogue is also brutally realistic even though I did think it was a bit odd how The Driver and Irene, the love interest, have huge pauses when talking, but that just adds to the mood of their relationship. I think the director described this movie as being Romeo and Juliet in a modern day setting which is true to some part. Even though The Driver is the bad guy and never talks that much, something heart wrenching comes when you see him get sad or get hurt.Drive is a great movie that has care for what it wants to be and executes everything well. It isn't flawless. It does some things that bothered me. Sometimes I get the feeling that the film is just TRYING to be too artsy and I just can't stand it when films do that. The violin/opera music starts to kick in and everything goes in slow motion or super fast. I am probably false accusing the movie and I know a complaint like that is off so I wont look down upon the movie for something it never did wrong. I also have a problem that the movie is ultimately missing something. This movie is short and I believe had they at least showed some flashbacks to Driver's previous life, it would have been better. The thing is we don't really know much about him so it is kind of hard to understand him. It is a little over an hour and 30 minutes. Some more would have done this movie good and I thought a little more development in the villains would have been nice. The violence is a little brutal, as explained before there is a scene of a woman's head blasted off, a scene where Driver smashed a guys face down in the elevator, a fork to the eye scene, a few slitted wrists scenes, some stabbings. I think the director was going for shock value and it worked for me but in all honestly, I could have done without that type of violence. I also didn't really like the ending. Not sure but it seemed a little rushed. All in all, a great film but definitely not for everyone.",Drive
59,johnnyboyz,Gritty character drama that is unfolded with grace and nuance.,8,21 August 2018,"""Drive"" reminded me in many ways of another excellent mobster film entitled ""Eastern Promises"" - both are made with a noticeable level of maturity, in that neither are afraid of moving at their own pace, and both tell a very intriguing character driven narrative which, by chance, happen to revolve around drivers. Events unfold, not slowly, but methodically; there are bursts of violence which disturb us, but it isn't played for entertainment; characters interact with one another realistically, and they get to know one another in ways which we find plausible and inherently satisfying.""Drive"" tells the story of a youngish man, played by Ryan Gosling, living in Los Angeles who works as a stunt man in the local film industry and moonlights as a getaway driver for the common crook. When driving for some petty criminals who need someone to get them out of dodge fast in the dead of night following a warehouse robbery, he is in his element avoiding accidents and dodging the police - as a stuntman, his job under the bright Californian sunshine consists of getting involved in ORGANISED accidents. Perhaps symbolically, he must don masks in order to look like the character which ought to be doing the driving. The opening warehouse heist itself is a piece of work - untypically for the genre, the film decides to teasingly hang back in the quiet confines of the car as the actual theft happens - it cleverly utilises a two minute shot-clock countdown radiating from the car stereo blaring out a basketball game to crank up the suspense. We have already had it confirmed to us in the opening scene that a smart looking sports car in a sea of old 1950's relics is ""very"" our lead, inferring an air of modernity in a man otherwise operating in a world of older models.These particular 'models' consist of borderline acting heavyweights Bryan Cranston; Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman, who are dead-on the right choices for their respective roles when it may have been tempting to merely cast the likes of James Woods; Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Each of these particular characters come to occupy important, yet dangerous, places in our lead's world: Shannon, played by Cranston, is a film director who employs Gosling's character to do all the stunt work - his limp and twitchy mannerisms, in what is a wonderful performance, exudes a kind of nervousness where there doesn't seem to be the need for any. Bernie (Brooks), meanwhile, looks to employ Gosling as a stock-car racer - director Nicolas Winding Refn places him above Gosling when they first meet, and lingers on Brooks' outstretched hand as they go to shake for a little too long for it not to mean something. Nino, played by Perlman, runs a local restaurant - he clashes with Bernie, but they are evidently equal in general stature. At home, more importantly still, is Irene (Carey Mulligan), who lives down the hall in the apartment block with a young son and a husband in prison. It is through his interactions with her that Winding Refn tells the story of his lead becoming somebody else, juxtaposing her softly spoken demeanour with the other character who will play the biggest role in this chapter of his life in the form of Bernie, a tough-talking tough guy. One particularly impressive stroke from the film lies in how Irene's husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac), behaves upon being released from prison. We sensed the film may have gone down a route of depicting a budding relationship between the lead and Irene, only for the husband to re-arrive on the scene and have something to say about it, but it doesn't unfold like that. Moreover, Standard is not merely some psychopath - he appears weak, and is even mired in some money trouble. It is then though these debts that the final act of the film is propelled wherein Gosling's character become more heavily involved than he'd like. ""Drive"" is full of various feats of film-making which, for me, places it above most films of its genre. Certainly, the manner about which everybody seems to get along with one another during the opening act is incredibly deceptive in one sense, and I think if the film appears overly-violent; shocking or even completely unpredictable, then it is for the reason that Winding Refn does not unfold the second half of his film with characters behaving symptomatically of how they interacted in the first half. Additionally, and without giving anything away, what occurs during the raid on the pawn shop catches us totally off-guard because Gosling's character had already been established to be the ultimate professional in getting away from robberies. The opening heist was more complicated; unfolded in a larger building and was at night in the dark, so we expect the pawn shop robbery to run smoothly. The film then goes on to subvert heist genre norms by revolving the last scenes around a character wanting to RETURN the spoils of a theft to its rightful owner as they hunt him down anyway.Chiefly, ""Drive"" is a character study with Gosling's nameless driver at the heart of it - he is transitioned from being robotic and somewhat faceless to being someone who cares about somebody else and their predicament. When he agrees to be involved in the pawn shop robbery, he is doing so out of compassion for Irene and the family rather than strictly for the cheque - the traffic rushing by in opposite directions in the background, as he sits in a diner realising this, seems to signify the scrambling his core outlook has just begun to undertake. With its performances; direction and story-telling on top of this, ""Drive"" is very easy to recommend.",Drive
60,howard.schumann,A film of style and mood that has a European feel to it,9,24 September 2011,"If you are looking for wall-to-wall CGI effects, bodies piling up in the streets, and one-dimensional characters, stay away from Danish director Nicholas Refn's intelligent character study, Drive. Based on a novel by James Sallis and adapted for the screen by Hossein Amini, Drive is not a fast-paced action thriller but, in spite of its violence, a film of style and mood that has a European feel to it, in the tradition of Melville's Le Samourai. Ryan Gosling, in one of his best performances, is a reticent garage mechanic and movie stunt driver during the day, but at night, a getaway driver for small-time crooks. We are offered no information on his background or how he came to be where he is. He is called only the driver because he drives.The film opens with a stunning sequence in which the driver commands a getaway car after a theft by two hoodlums. He manages to elude police by using his knowledge of the L.A. city streets and by being just a bit cleverer than those who are pursuing him in their cars and helicopters. Drive takes a different turn when the tight-lipped loner forms a tentative connection with his next door neighbor, single mom Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benecio (Kaden Leos). Although she will not turn against her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) who is in prison, the driver's interest helps her to go on with her life.Supported by an eclectic soundtrack, the first half of the film is quiet but filled with palpable tension. The driver is a reticent man who shows little surface emotion, but we can sense that underneath he is an explosive device, wired and waiting to detonate. When he does, we may wish for the quiet time. Though the film belongs to Gosling who establishes himself as one of the premier actors of our day, Drive also has a superb secondary cast that includes Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman as a menacing crime duo. When Standard is released, instead of having a fit of jealousy, he accepts the driver's offer to help him fend off some of these crime kingpins to whom he is in big trouble because of an unpaid debt.Standard and the driver concoct a scheme to rob a pawn shop, but it is not well thought out and goes very wrong, putting the driver on his heels, having to avoid the determined thugs who are now relentlessly pursuing him. The driver is now up against ruthless killers, and must use all of his mental and physical attributes to stay alive and protect the people in his life he most cares about. Drive has a lot of violence, but it is not the kind of dehumanized violence that we see so often in the movies, the kind that deadens our feelings and atrophies our moral sense of human worth. Refn doesn't hold back on the blood, but makes us feel its repellent horror and agony even though we know that, for the driver, it is kill or be killed. Drive may often be difficult to watch, but if you give it the green light, you may find a sweet payoff at the end of the road.",Drive
61,TheMovieDiorama,Drive accelerates through stylish neon districts with unsubstantial tyres.,7,23 April 2020,"Los Angeles, California. Dimly lit street lamps illuminate the fading roads. Traffic lights controlling its mechanical flow. Red. An anonymous Hollywood stunt driver patiently waits whilst revving the booming engine of his '73 Chevy Malibu. Leather gloves fastened. A toothpick precariously lodged between his lips. Embracing a calm demeanour. Green. The driver proceeds across the city, shrouded in darkened moonlight, promptly arriving at his destination. A watch strapped to the steering wheel commences ticking. Five minutes. Sweat eventually percolates from his once cool forehead, with each second anxiously passing. Two unknown mobsters eventually leave a building, with two substantial bags of money in tow, entering the backseats of the parked car. The driver, a mechanic and stuntman by day, rampantly flees the scene whilst being pursued by police cars and helicopters. Bright spotlights intersecting the neon-lit streets. The silent driver evades the law, returning to his quaint apartment where he rapidly develops amicable feelings towards his new neighbour Irene. Yet their blossoming romance is abruptly interrupted when her husband is released from prison, required to pay off substantial protection money. A new heist develops, however its awry nature unequivocally endangers all the lives directly, and indirectly, involved.Refn's adaptation of Sallis' crime novel is one throwback thriller that has been lauded with praise with every passing year since its initial release back in '11. Objectively speaking, it's relatively simple to see why. A revelatory piece of virtuosity, where each electrifying shot from Sigel's flawless cinematography, is integrated with clinical precision and technical astuteness. The opening five minute getaway drive, with zero dialogue from the film's protagonist, accelerates the tension beyond description. The frenetic energy of the surrounding lights, the masterful sound editing of the exhaust pipe booming down the streets of LA, and the sensational panning of the camera within the vehicle itself. Undoubtedly, the driving sequences is when Refn showcases his directorial talents, embodying a contagious confidence throughout.It's provocative film-making, engaging as many senses as virtually possible. A notable example would be the elevator scene. The internal lights dim when the driver passionately smooches Irene, with slow-motion increasing its lingering longevity. The lights re-illuminate, the driver protects Irene by graciously moving her to the side before proceeding to bash a mobster's skull repeatedly in with his hefty shoe. A perfect depiction of visual storytelling without the need for inconsequential dialogue. Martinez' synthesised score embraces the abstract electronic aesthetic that Refn yearned to imitate from 80s neo-noir flicks, producing an illusory aura throughout.So, as mentioned previously, the gorgeous technicalities are faultless, in what is Refn's most efficiently directed feature to date. Having said that, there are fundamental issues littered throughout, both from an objective and subjective viewpoint. For starters, Amini's strained screenplay and the uncreative choice to adapt a non-linear story into superfluous linearity. Drive commenced its contents with such bravura, resorting to no dialogue whatsoever. Conveying a gritty world of realism through visuals alone. Breathtakingly refreshing. Then the characters begin to talk, and the acute attention dissipates almost immediately. The problem is not necessarily the fact these individuals talk like emotionless androids, it's more leaning towards the overwhelming simplicity of the dialogue. For example, when the driver and Irene become accustomed to each other, they begin to ask questions in the most monotonous way possible. ""What do you do?"". ""I drive."". ""Like a limo driver?"". ""No, like, for movies."". ""Oh. You mean all the car chases and stuff?"". ""Yeah."". ""Isn't that dangerous?"". ""It's only part-time. Mostly I work at a garage."". So, in the space of five seconds, Irene ascertains what her neighbour does for a living in approximately eight lines of dull dialogue, expressed emotionlessly to emphasise the awkward communicative abilities he possesses. Yet, it could've easily been conveyed through visual narrative instead.Many will claim the script to be ""succinct"". But what does that prove? The ""succinctness"" unfortunately possesses a redundancy that makes these characters emotionally non-investable. Gosling shaking in fear and anxiety whilst holding a bullet and a hammer between a man's eyes? Perfect. Gosling attempting to be menacing by whispering ""shut your mouth or I'll kick your teeth down your throat""? Not even comparable. It was as if Amini was attempting to channel some memorable gangster lingo to masquerade the screenplay's lucidity.A consequence of all of this, is that the romance between the two neighbours was, for the most part, inaccessible. Underdeveloped whilst surrounded by artificiality, which ultimately weakens the driver's central motives as this ""guardian angel"" figure. The characterised acting from the cast members were hit and miss. Mulligan, Isaac and Gosling chewed up every scene. Cranston, Brooks and Perlman were all either underused or hammed up their performances, particularly Perlman as a pizzeria Jewish gangster. Lastly, the gratuitous violence really did not add anything to the film's impact. Remove it, and the end result would still be the same.Drive remains one of those acclaimed films that started a rejuvenation for hyper-stylised carnage. With its vivid imagery, striking score and flawless direction, it's a film that understands the craft of film-making as an art form. Yet the low amount of basic dialogue should've either been culled entirely or added to, as it currently diminishes an incredibly visceral thriller.",Drive
62,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A non-traditional thriller that becomes brutally effective when it wants to,8,8 December 2013,"Welcome to ""Drive,"" Nicolas Winding Refn's exercise in the tried and true lesson that less is more, and more when it follows less is pulse-pounding mayhem. Maybe somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of ""Drive"" could be considered ""action"" or ""violence,"" but Refn makes every second of it count. When each slowly mounting scene finally explodes, the rush of adrenaline is so startling that you will either gasp or laugh from shock. ""Drive"" offers nothing the ""stoic hero takes revenge"" plot hasn't seen before, but you've never seen it done in this seemingly counterintuitive but amazingly effective fashion.""Drive"" stars Ryan Gosling as our nameless ""Driver,"" a mechanic and stunt driver by day, stone-cold wheelman by night. Gosling hardly does a scene without a toothpick in his mouth or his scorpion-emblazoned driving jacket. And when the driving gloves come on — you can forget about it. His calm demeanor says everything not written into Hossein Amini's script and from the get-go, this protagonist has earned legions of faithful viewers.Gosling packs a lot of his signature suave from previous roles into the driver, that suave that would have anyone convinced he's a blue-blooded New Yorker and not a Canuck from Ontario. Anyway, the driver develops a little crush on his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan), who happens to have a son and a husband in jail. Instead of sweet-talking his way in, he just gazes at her with that little smirk on his face — courtship complete. Men would kill for that move, women are killed by it and Gosling is one of the few who can pull it off convincingly.After the driver grows fond of Irene and her boy, the husband (Oscar Isaac) comes back. Not only does his return bust up their relationship, but also the husband owes money for protection in prison and if he can't pay, it could lead to his wife and son getting hurt. From what we know about our driver, that's tickles the one moral fiber in his body the wrong way. He agrees to help the husband rob a pawn shop by acting as the getaway, but when the job goes horribly wrong, he finds himself in a situation no one could drive away from.It takes awhile for ""Drive"" to get rolling, but that appears to be Refn's style: tantalize the audience with brilliant camera angles, an unpredictable score and churn the suspense to a tar-thick consistency. This approach will undoubtedly scare off some moviegoers yet completely awe others, but from a filmmaking perspective the artistry of the shots and takes puts Refn easily into a category of elite directors. Only a director with an undeniable gift could linger on literally half his shots and draw out nearly every scene without driving the viewer completely insane (that pun wasn't intended, yet quite fitting). ""Drive"" feels tedious at times anyway, so it would be painful to imagine such an interpretation of ""Drive"" in lesser hands.Due to this choice, the film suffers at points for lack of dialogue, but perhaps that's years of conventional filmmaking built up inside me. The instinct becomes particularly hard to ignore in those scenes of longing gazes between the driver and Irene when the script that ought to be runs through your head over the silence in the film. Fortunately, the love story plays second fiddle to the ever-spiraling degree of danger.Considering the aforementioned percentage of action and violence in the film, what little there is feels somewhere between excruciating, satisfying and terrifying all at once. The driver's iced veins through some jarring brutality seem unexplained, but the void in his back story rather than hindering his character allows us to draw any number of wild conclusions about what he's been through. The same goes for most of the other characters. Bryan Cranston's character and especially Albert Brooks' carry themselves in similar fashion. In one scene, Refn even commands the half-naked strippers to stay completely still and silent as the driver holds a bullet over a guys forehead with one hand and a hammer with the other. Realistic response from strippers? Hardly — but effective.Effectiveness would have to be the card ""Drive"" plays best. Say what you will of character motivation, romantic subplots and the the fact that much of the second act rests completely on an improbable coincidence, but Refn's film cuts hard and fast to the core; it makes you pay attention and then forces you swallow, just as any veritable tour de force ought to. Long term, count Gosling and Refn as two such forces.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more",Drive

Photographic masterpiece!",9,14 September 2018,"Claustrophobic, dark and slowburning thriller about a heist job driver, who is played magnificently by Ryan Gosling. He lives the life of crime, being one of the best heist drivers. He is cool, calm and collected. But when he falls in love with a girl, he accidentally gets into trouble with the mob. Love and crime intermingle in this wonderfully photographed portrait of the night time crime scene of L.A. Very impressive soundtrack driven story. Magnificent photography. Gorgeous still shots. Wonderful coloring of the images. Just a lust for the eyes. The story isnt particularly original, but the way it is executed is chilling to the bone. Director's Nicholas Winding Refn masterpiece. Lots of slowburning, silent scenes, with characters being filmed as if it were a slow motion painting. Gorgeous. Must sound pretty incomprehensible, if you read this description, but I am just a bit lost for words to describe the beauty of the direction and the photography powered by a very effective soundtrack. Gotta see it yourself to understand.For the masses who just wants to see an exiting heist thriller, this movie could disappoint, because it is made for an arthouse audience and not for a Transformers and Captain America audience. But the arthouse audiences will certainly revel in the slowburning suspense, because this movie excells in a grandiose way in moods, colors, still shots wherein NOTHING happens, but with a tension that just cuts me up and leaves me behind bleeding...Very impressive masterpiece!",Drive
64,jzappa,"Get Ready to Be Played Like a Piano. And Pounded Like One, Too.",9,28 October 2011,"The first time we see the Driver, he's the wheelman for a getaway car, who evades police pursuit not simply with speed and force but by taking calm advantage of the street landscape and outmaneuvering his chasers. Its up there with some of the best car chases I've ever seen. By day, he's a stunt driver for action movies. The two jobs are no contradiction for him: He drives. As played by Ryan Gosling, he's in the convention of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name and Alain Delon's Jef Costello. No family, no past and ostensibly few feelings. He's an existential hero, It would seem, characterized completely by his actions.That would meet the criteria for the hero of a tedious action movie, but Drive is an utterly graceful implementation of style, and its feelings may be submerged but they resonate intensely. The mystery of Gosling's wheelman is surrounded by a fertile balcony of tangential actors who are clear about their plans and suspicions, and who have either reached an understanding with the Driver, or not, yet another example of the old Hollywood noir tenet that a movie breathes not merely through its hero, but from its shadows.The Driver actually lives somewhere. Somehow that seems amazing. Played by Carey Mulligan, his neighbor is a model for defenselessness. She has a young son, Benicio, who appears to motivate warmth in the Driver, though he isn't a demonstrative sort. They become friendly, but soon, her husband Standard is sprung from prison. Counter to our almost certain expectations, Standard isn't resentful or antagonistic toward the new friend, but evaluates him, sees someone formidable, and find they can help each other. That will supply the locomotive for the story, and as Irene and Benicio are threatened, the Driver unravels intense feelings and allegiances, and suffers massive peril at little real advantage to himself.The film is populated with characters who bring volumes to the screen, counter to the Driver, who brings nothing but pure presence. Ron Perlman looks to be a major operator working out of the petty frontage of a strip mall pizzeria. Albert Brooks, every bit as formidable as you'd never expect, plays a producer of the sorts of B movies the Driver drives stunt for, one of his business ventures as a powerful local mobster. These people are cold-blooded. More benevolent is the great Bryan Cranston, as the sort of guy the Driver has to have backing him, a whiz at car repairs, and supercharging.Drive appears to have little CGI. Most of the stunt driving seems authentic, with cars of mass and heaviness, instead of ridiculous animated fantasies. The whole movie, actually, is incomparably more genuine than the typical action-crime-chase fabrications we've become bored with. Here's a movie with deference to writing, acting, technique and well-informed moviegoers. The crucial feeling you want to experience during a chase sequence is participation in its intent. You have to worry. Almost always nowadays, we're just watching fast machinery.Ryan Gosling is a magnetic actor, a modest one. He exemplifies aura and unaffectedness. For as long as we've been seeing him in movies, he's demonstrated a knack for discovering striking, commanding characters. An actor who can make us believe he's become smitten by an anatomically correct doll can realize practically anything. Drive looks like one kind of movie in the ads, and it is that kind of movie, but also a rebuke to most of the movies it looks like.",Drive
65,Vartiainen,Detached violence,5,10 May 2014,"Drive feels like a crime action film directed by an art-house director. Its focus is not necessarily on the action or the coolness factory of it all, but on the human lives and their struggles to continue living. The storytelling is slow and ponderous, many long scenes are dedicated to subtle facial expressions alone and both the score and the visual design have that artsy feeling to them.As a whole it's an interesting experience and I'm in no way saying that its so called artsiness in any way takes away from its enjoyment value. Quite the opposite. Its a take on the genre I've never seen before and it has a lot of novelty value. Besides, the art-house style means that the aesthetics are given a lot of attention, which means that the whole film looks and sounds great. From fight choreographies to colours to dialogue, it all works.My only real problem with this film is really the main character, the eponymous Driver (Ryan Gosling). I can see the director's idea with the character. A coldblooded criminal, more in tune with the cars he drives than with people or life in general. It's an interesting character concept, but unfortunately Gosling plays him too subdued, at least for my tastes. It's hard to get into the head of someone that never expresses something or seems to care about anything. The main character is detached from the world of living and in the process from us, the viewers.Drive is an excellent film to watch if you want to see an intense crime action film that is shot extremely well with well-utilized production values. I cannot personally vouch for the main character, but I have heard that most people have no problem with him so it's just my personal pet peeve.",Drive
66,robert-temple-1,"Fascinating, dreamlike, well made film about evil people",7,15 June 2012,"This is a film about evil people, killers, robbers, their accomplices, and so forth, but it is made in a dreamlike ethereal style which is most impressive. There is magnificent coordination between the director Nicolas Winding Refn (a Danish American), the cinematographer, and the art director. There are so many exquisitely filmed shots with careful colour composition that the film is highly artistic. Why can't all of that good taste be put to better use with a story and characters which are more pleasant and less despicable? Refn seems to have done previous films with blood, fear, death, etc., in the titles. Pretty creepy. And he writes them as well, which is even more worrying. Ryan Gosling plays an entirely amoral 'driver' who drives criminals to and from their bank robberies and assassinations. He is very good at saying nothing. Christina Hendricks of MAD MEN appears in this in a very minor capacity, presumably because she could only manage a couple of days off from her series to do a few quick scenes. She need not have bothered, because we see so little of her she might have been anyone. OK, it shows she's versatile. So now back to Madison Avenue where we all love her. Carey Mulligan plays the young girl, and she is the 'everybody's sweetheart' type, with the same winsome quality that Gwyneth Paltrow had at her age. We all probably want to watch Carey Mulligan in anything, because she is such a delight. More of her please, less of the criminals.",Drive
67,Turfseer,Dynamic and entertaining neo-noir plot trumps Gosling and Mulligan wooden parts and performances,6,4 February 2012,"'Drive' is directed by Nicholas Winding Refn, a Danish director known for films with a violent bent. 'Drive' is no exception, as it emulates some of the darker film noirs of the 40s and 50s as well as the neo-noirs of later years. Refn shot 'Drive' in a contemporary Los Angeles but due to the use of an 80s, synth pop score, the story feels like it's more from the 80s rather than today (sounds like some of those synth tracks with the choppy bass parts were 'borrowed' from one of Hall and Oates' more popular hits).For women who might be drawn to the film due to the casting of Ryan ('The Hunk') Gosling in the lead role, be forewarned that 'Drive' is anything but a 'chick flick'. Gosling, in an unnamed part, moonlights as a getaway driver but has more respectable jobs as a part-time stunt driver and auto mechanic. Unfortunately, Gosling has little dialogue and speaks mostly in a monotone. Even worse is Carey Mulligan who plays Irene, the Driver's next door neighbor and mother of a five year old, who appears to drift about in a perpetual stupor (I seem to recall that when Driver crushes the hit man's head in the elevator, Irene backs off in shock but later never discusses or alludes to the incident at all).Things pick up in terms of action when Irene's husband, Standard, is released from prison but is being forced to commit another robbery by a brute named Cook, who claims Standard still owes a debt to former inmate associates who 'protected' him while incarcerated. A normal guy might feel some jealousy when another man encroaches on his territory, but 'Knight-in-Shining Armor' Gosling is ready to help Standard simply because he's taken a real liking to Irene and the kid. 'Drive' soon begins to shine through some neat twists and turns in the plot as well as the introduction of cool supporting players who overshadow both Mr. Gosling and Ms. Mulligan. Some critics have argued that the violence in 'Drive' is gratuitous, but I beg to differ. It might be a bit over the top, but is never cartoonish. In fact, the violence underscores the menacing, ruthless character of the antagonists Gosling's Driver must face.Cook beats Standard to a bloody pulp and the shocks are just beginning. There's the big double cross at the pawn shop, where Standard is shot in the back and later Cook's moll, Blanche, is gunned down at the motel room (there was a significant gasp that could be heard throughout the theater from a taken aback audience when the moll is dispatched). Gosling also gets the chance to be ruthless when he works Cook over. Later Bernie (a mobster played by Albert Brooks, who earlier backed the Driver and Shannon, the owner of the auto body shop where the Driver worked, in a joint stock car racing venture) kills Cook by stabbing him in the face. In addition to the aforementioned 'stomping in the elevator' scene, Bernie eliminates Shannon 'mercifully' by slicing his artery, causing the Driver's former pal, to slowly bleed to death.Who would have thought that comedian Albert Brooks, could actually be so good as an amoral crime boss? Bryan Cranston is also excellent as the Driver's seedy employer. Ron Perlman is always great playing the heavy but I would have liked to have seen more of him, as his character Nino's declaration of his Jewishness, remains wholly underdeveloped.The film's climax, where the Driver cuts off Nino's car on the highway, leading to his death by drowning at the hands of the Driver, was quite exciting. Less exciting and more awkward was the Driver's agreement to meet Bernie in public and return the money. For a person as crafty as the driver, didn't he anticipate that Bernie would try and hurt him at the scene of their meeting place? Or is it that he just didn't care? One other thing I wondered about at film's end. If the loot belonged to the east coast Mafia, even though Bernie and Nino were now dead, wouldn't the Mafioso still come looking for the Driver as well as Irene, who they would have discovered was affiliated with him? Thus, how could the Driver ride off into the sunset, knowing full well that Irene was still vulnerable?When I saw the title 'Drive', I expected the film to have many more chase scenes. Fortunately, director Refn took the story in a different direction, emphasizing the rivalry between the Driver and his criminal antagonists. 'Drive' is a film which doesn't have a lot to say. In other words, if you're looking for great 'meaning', you will not find it here. With the exception of the more complex Bernie, its characters are pretty much one-dimensional caricatures, especially the main protagonists, played by Gosling and Mulligan. Nonetheless, in the tradition of some of the great noirs and neo-noirs of the past, 'Drive' manages to be highly entertaining, due to a dynamic plot, that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",Drive

70,freemantle_uk,"A dark, stylist and tense neo-noir film",10,12 February 2012,"Drive was seen as one of the best films of 2011, so much so that fans were angered and upset that the Academy Award ignored it. It is fast becoming a cult classic and oozes style in what is a very brutal thriller.Driver/Kid (Ryan Gosling) is a young mechanic and part-time stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver for heists and bank robberies. He is a quiet man who lives alone, but he has a cool menace underneath. Driver soon befriends his neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos). But when Irene's husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac) is released from prison, Driver ends up having to help the man with his protection debts and runs up against two powerful gangsters, Nico (Ron Perlman) and Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks).Nicolas Winding Refn is certainly showing why he is a hot young talent as a director, creating a dark, constantly tense film, amplified by the dark visuals and the 80s like soundtrack. Winding Refn knew how to build up scenes and develop characters even with a lack dialogue. The action and crimes scenes were quick and well shot, particularly the day light car chase and the shooting in the model. Some of the violence was a little over the top, which made the film deserve it's 18 rating in the UK, but it did add to the brutal nature of the film. There was always a constant brooding feeling about Drive, with it at boiling point all the time.The cast is great throughout. Gosling as already mention was a quiet character but felt like he can be really threatening when he did turn. There was a lot of mystery toward this character, we don't know his name let alone his past and Gosling brought that to live and making him seem like a character you do not want to mess with. Mulligan is of course a very talented actress and she shows it again here as she plays a regular, struggling lone mother and Brooks' character seem to have a lot more depth then just being a ruthless gangster, that he there is a real character and moral duality about him.Winding Refn certainly does not make out that they there is any glamour in this life of crime, Driver lives a lonely, isolated live and even when he does get close to someone he still tries to put some distance between them and unwilling or unable to love. The main gangsters were still just thugs, they did not live the high life, they dress in unflattering clothes and do not have legions of followers as they have to be very hands on in their profession. The crimes themselves are quick and the driving was explained by the fact that Driver is a stunt driver.Drive is a truly tense, stylised crime film that is filled with brutal violence yet still has a subtle feel about it. It really is a must see.",Drive
71,strong-122-478885,Have Action Films Really Deteriorated To This!!??,2,24 June 2014,"Unlike a typical Tarantino film where its characters just about talk you to death, Drive is a film whose characters, like speechless dummies, literally silenced you to death. I'm not kidding.The complete absence of normal, everyday dialogue that should've taken place between its characters was so noticeably missing from Drive's story that it began to give me a serious case of brain-freeze. I mean, Drive took the meaning of being mind-numbingly dull to a whole new level of dreariness.In particular - It was that absolutely stunned, goose-on-the-loose, Ryan Gosling, whose lapses into braindead silence were mind-boggling beyond belief. Gosling is truly one dead-charisma actor who puts the likes of Vin Diesel to absolute shame when it comes to projecting total hollowness on screen.When it came to Gosling's character, Drive was not the sort of film where this person's silence represented someone who was deeply philosophical. No. It was actually quite the opposite here. Gosling's silence was not cool. It was not masculine. It was just a completely vacant nothingness.I couldn't help noticing that whenever Gosling spoke any line of dialogue that exceeded more than 5 words it appeared like he was actually struggling to remember what to say.In my opinion, this film never came to life. It's excessive violence and over-the-top gore (that came way too late in the show) couldn't save it. And the use of haunting soundtrack music and ariel views of L.A. at night only served as a distraction from the fact that Drive was nothing but a big, dull bore.This film also lost itself some major points by the use of blatant product placement while the Gosling character went shopping at the Big 6 Market.And, last, but not least - I think that actress Carey Mulligan is an absolute dog. (arf! arf!) This woman is so unattractively scrawny (almost like a young boy) and possesses absolutely no sexual allure, whatsoever, that it boggles the mind that any guy, even that drip Gosling, could get at all excited over a pathetic scrag like this one.The ""aw-shucks"" romance that transpired between the Gosling and Mulligan characters was a literal joke and a half.And - Drive's ending was a total empty-headed cop-out. It left the viewer suspended (along with the main character) in a void of pure nothingness.And - The utterly sickening sight of that dirty, filthy, crud-encrusted, ""scorpion"" jacket that the Gosling character continually wore, day and night, throughout the entire duration of the story really began to make my skin crawl, big-time. (ick!) And I can't tell you how many times I wished that this nitwit had accidentally swallowed and choked on that toothpick that he had forever dangling out of his mouth! (Grrrr!) And, finally (phew!) - I ask you - Have Action films really deteriorated to the likes of this?? Eh? Have they!!??... Sheesh!",Drive
72,dfranzen70,Full-speed existentialism,9,20 February 2012,"The Driver (Ryan Gosling), it shall be noted, drives. Doesn't matter what for, what the odds are, if it's immoral or illegal, it's what he does. Perhaps that's a metaphor for his life, where he sees himself with one purpose and an incentive to be the very best at his vocation. We're led to believe that he exists to drive.He seems to split his time into three jobs: Hollywood stuntman, mechanic, and getaway car driver. One pays better than the others. He works with people with whom he's had little to no prior contact, and he has some rules. He gets his way, because he truly is a terrific driver with pinpoint reflexes. He says little, listens much, and does his job. Sort of the perfect employee, except for the times when one of his little rules is violated. But if they aren't, he will deliver your package on time.The Driver's life experiences no real bumps until he meets one of his neighbors, Irene (Carey Mulligan), who's apparently a single mom/waitress. They become friends, but nothing more. He helps her when her car breaks down, and she - what luck! - brings it to the garage where he and his boss Shannon (Bryan Cranston) work. Irene confesses that she's not single; her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) is in jail for reasons unknown. It is giving nothing away to mention that in short time Standard is released and confronts The Driver. But then they become friends, because why not? The Driver likes Irene, and she digs him, as does her kid, but he intuits that Standard, although full of bluster and machismo and probably running with the wrong people, isn't a terrible person. The Driver has no real need to rescue Irene. But, as he quickly learns, Standard does need to be rescued.It appears that The Driver does more than just drive. He cares. He's deadly with his hands and other objects. He can break into cars and elude police. He's tough but reticent. Very reticent, willing to let others dig their own holes before he dives in. He acts without telegraphing his move to everyone, particularly the audience. He's still wildly existential, but now it seems he exists as a man playing by rules of which only he is truly aware.Gosling is really something. Rather than giving us the impression that, because of his silence, he is dim witted or vulnerable, he shows us that there is much beneath his handsome exterior. We never know his motives other than a desire to help Irene, Standard, and their little boy - in fact, that motive alone seems to a new one on The Driver himself. Does it enrich him? Yes, but only because he mentions it himself; otherwise, he's the same cipher he's always been. Gosling's Driver isn't just a blank-faced object of desire; one can tell he's thinking about something, forming a plan, keeping it hidden deep within. I kind of wish he'd garnered an Oscar nom out of this performance.But he's not alone. Mulligan is excellent as the haunted, torn Irene - much better than she was in the ill-fated Shame from last year or even from An Education. She's sweet and cute but not naive and not the proverbial sex bomb. Cranston and Ron Perlman have showy roles as good and bad guys. But stealing the show - almost the entire movie - is Albert Brooks, yes, the comedian who has dabbled in dramatic acting in the past, who is unbelievable as Cranston's mob contact. He's terrifying but methodical, a horrifying combination if ever there was one.Drive is a work of art in many ways. It's meticulously edited by Mat Newman, and the sound is blended perfectly by the team of Lon Bender and Victor Ray Ennis, with the latter two earning Oscar nominations for themselves. Nicholas Winding Refn's direction is crisp, unyielding, confrontational, and engaging, particularly for one's first Big Movie. There's much to like in Drive if you're a fan of adrenaline-enhanced experiences that don't bludgeon you with CGI and other fakery. The level of realism is just right, both in the action scenes and in the person- to-person scenes.",Drive

OK, maybe many of you reading this feel that I put it in overdrive with that statement, but you have to trust me on this one. Ryan Gosling stars as (he pulled one out of Clint Eastwood's ""man with no name"" spaghetti westerns) because his name is never mentioned throughout the movie, he is just simply Driver. How cool is that? Driver is an orthodontist, brace yourself. OK, so he is not. Helloo! What do you think he is! Ryan Seacrest eat your heart out because Driver has more Hollywood gigs than you. Driver is a Hollywood stunt driver for movies, a mechanic at an L.A. body shop, and a contract driver for thieves on their robbery hits. He is tacit, conscious, and of course driven. He befriends a cutesy apartment neighbor Irene and her son Benicio. When Irene's husband Standard returns from a prison sentence and hires Driver for a forced robbery , ""Drive"" is taken to another gear altogether, and shifts more to an ultra-violence speed. The Standard operation heads to a dead-end zone and that is when ""Drive"" moves up to top cool control. Refn's mastery of the movie's guise, unpredictability, and stylishness are key factors why this movie rocks! Refn is very deserving of a Best Director Oscar nomination. I will be refn mad if that does not happens! Hossein Amini's staid screenplay is limited in wordage but unlimited in deftness. Gosling does not take a back seat to anyone with his stellar starring performance. 2011 is looking like the year of the Gosling, so I think he is on the right route for a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Carey Mulligan was solid as Irene. Albert Brooks delivers a menacing performance as the antagonist Bernie Rose. Looks like Brooks' comeback is heading in the right direction. Give The Brooks a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nom! Some other nice turns were thespianly delivered in ""Drive"" by Bryan Cranston as body shop owner Shannon, Oscar Issac as Standard, and Ron Perlman as Rose's partner Nino.

75,drqshadow-reviews,"Gosling's Stoic, Enigmatic Driver Helms a Daring, Unconventional Take",8,31 May 2012,"A ridiculously stylish, unusually-paced take on the crowded action genre. It's almost unheard-of for the lead in this type of film to be so stoic, contemplative and softly spoken, but in this instance it works magnificently thanks to a deep, powerful performance from Ryan Gosling and a masterful sense of directorial timing. Gosling's nameless wheelman speaks maybe one full page of very limited dialog throughout the picture, but the deliberate way he pauses to contemplate before acting (and the broad range of subtle facial ticks he broadcasts in the process) tells us more than an encyclopedia of dialog could ever manage. Without the rudder of a brash, charismatic lead, the plot often flirts with disarray amid a very loose structural backbone. Ultimately, though, it flows surprisingly well despite those departures, the lull of its often slow, casual pace emphasizing a penchant for sharp, sudden skids into violence. My only gripes lie with the shallow, under-explored villains at the heart of all the madness and a shortage of great chase scenes for Gosling to navigate. The few we get are so good, it's a real shame they aren't more frequent.",Drive
76,st-shot,Boring Drive fails to maintain decent speed.,5,29 September 2011,"This sluggish piece of neo noir featuring a protagonist (Ryan Gosling) in a constant state of comatose cool who assists in LA heists will have you wanting to get out after a couple of miles as it cruises into the slow lane of mawkish pretentiousness after the first twenty minutes. Other than a couple of taut car chases this lemon has to depend on some vivid gratuitous violence to keep the audience awake as it careens out of control.Gosling is Driver (what else?) who beyond giving instructions is a mostly mute dour fellow who looks in need of a good sleep. He don't carry artillery he just drives. Don't get him mad though.The story is needlessly convoluted with Driver becoming involved with the girl and her kid next door whose paroled husband is forced into pulling off a job involving mob money of the same shadowy characters that bankroll a race car (did I tell you he has sure thing Nascar driver promise? ) as well as his loyal buddy who employs him who wouldn't you know it is also involved in the heist that's really a scam to cheat the East Coast mob.Director Nicholas Winding Redfn opens Drive with a sharply edited tense nighttime LA heist raising the tempo to a high pitch almost immediately. But by the time the opening credits finish Redfn begins to stumble with awkward clumsily paced scenes filled with pregnant pauses and pallid posing in the dark by all concerned. Redfn moves his camera without purpose and when he does frame a composition well he lets it linger to a point of tedium. Making matters even more heavy handed are a soundtrack and music score (Cliff Martinez gets the blame) barging its way through nearly every scene of insipid gravity reinforcing ad nausea its tough guy stance to a point of unintentional parody. Performances are uniformly zombie led by Gosling, a clueless Carey Mulligan as the drab, conflicted love interest and Albert Brooks with his usual flat lifeless affect as a surly hood looking heavily medicated. Bryan Cranston as Driver's boss delivers somewhat but the script will only let him expand on his role to a limited degree lacking the depth to make him or anyone else for that matter absorbing or even mildly interesting. Drive is one long meandering ride of strained seriousness. Better you should walk.",Drive
77,estebangonzalez10,My Favorite Film of 2011,10,13 October 2011,"¨If I drive for you, you give me a time and a place. I give you a five-minute window, anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours no matter what. I don't sit in while you're running it down; I don't carry a gun... I drive. ¨Drive is probably my favorite film of the year so far. I hadn't even watched the trailers for this movie so I had no idea what it was about, but what a special surprise I was in for. The movie hooked me from the very opening action scene up to the very end. Yes, the film is slow at times, but it's also intense and original. This art-house action movie works in great part thanks to a terrific performance from Ryan Gosling. He keeps on surprising me; he is a hugely talented actor and can excel in any role. This time he proved himself in this action film as the lead man. The reason the movie is so slow at times is because it is character driven, and Gosling's character is so quiet and laid back; he hardly speaks and the dialogues he has feel real and authentic. The dialogue in this film was brilliant, everything about it made it perfect. I would absolutely watch this movie over and over again because it is just that good. I couldn't believe the direction the movie was taking. It is one of those action movies that is hard to predict and I loved not anticipating what was going to happen next. Gosling is a star, he is great in this movie and the feel that the movie has is just so amazing. It's hard to get this overwhelmed by an action film these days because we've seemed to have seen it all, but Drive feels fresh and original. It doesn't focus so much on the action and the heists as much as it does on the characters. Gosling's character grows increasingly dark over the course of the movie, and so does the violence in this movie. It really has a Tarantino/Cronenberg feel to it (A History of Violence, Pulp Fiction). Drive was amazing, but many people may be put off by all the violence.The movie focuses on a driver (Ryan Gosling) who's name is never said in the film; he has a part time job as a Hollywood stunt man specializing in crash scenes, but spends most of the time at a mechanic shop working for Shannon (Bryan Cranston) on some classic cars. Shannon knows that this guy is extremely talented and wants him to become a NASCAR driver, but in order to do so he needs to buy a car first. Shannon decides to make a deal with an old mobster friend named Bernie (Albert Brooks) who gives him the money to buy the car. Bernie also has an associate, Nino (Ron Perlman), a New York Jewish mobster who broke Shannon's pelvis in the past for trying to overcharge him for a job he had done. Differences settled however they all decide to put their money on the driver, who is a quiet fellow who spends some nights as a wheelman on heist jobs. He is very professional about it. He soon begins a friendship with a neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son, Benicio (Kaden Leos) and the relationship seems to slowly develop into a romantic one until Irene's husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac) returns home from prison. Standard promises to leave his past life behind him, but he owes a lot of money to some people back in prison who offered their protection in exchange. Now Standard is forced to accept a heist or else his family will be in great danger. The driver finds out about the threat and decides to help Standard, but something goes wrong in the heist and the movie develops violently from that point forward. I can't help but repeating myself when I say this was a great film. Ryan Gosling really gives one of the year's best performances and his character is really intriguing. Gosling is a smart actor, he knows what roles to accept and he makes the best of them. In Drive he was given a really great script that allowed him to show off his full potential. The character is so central to the film that Gosling basically carries the movie, although the supporting cast was also great. Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, and Albert Brooks were great in their roles, and Carey Mulligan also had great chemistry with Gosling. Their relationship felt very real and nothing felt forced. Drive isn't your typical Hollywood action film, it's more of an indie film, and a dark one. There is a lot of violence, some strong scenes, so it might not be for everyone. I really enjoyed it and thought it was one of the best art-house action films I've seen in a long time. Last year I was blown away by Affleck's action film, The Town, but this year Drive manages to surpass it. Gosling's character reminded me a lot of De Niro en Taxi Driver; he is just that good. The action scenes were also very well choreographed and there were some great driving scenes, although the best thing about the movie was the character driven story. I also enjoyed the soundtrack of the film which felt retro. Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn (known for The Pusher trilogy) did a great job with this film, and Hossein Amini deserves a nomination for his screenplay adaptation of James Sallis's book. Drive is one of the best films of the year. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Drive
78,iquine,Don't Let His Quiet Demeanor Fool You,6,29 January 2020,"(Flash Review)You know when you eat a really old un-chewed stick of gum? For this smart majority who doesn't, the gun crumbles apart and never joins together. That was this movie. Not that it was stale but its diverse oddness never jelled. It was slow and quiet, had car chases and cold brutality. How well do you really know the person living next door. This film is about an awkwardly quiet and calm mechanic and stunt driver by day; a steely cool getaway driver by night. He gets involved with his attractive neighbor and young boy whose father just got released from prison. He gets himself involved with the father's latest problem to help the mother her boy. Of course this means driving. What happens when getting involved goes awry? What happens when you ruffle the feathers of the easy going driver? Duh, duh, duuuun. This is film was full of calmness occasionally offset by some brief heavy violent moments and was a light case study of this dude and what makes him tick. Good acting and atmosphere.",Drive
79,Fluke_Skywalker,"Hypnotic, odd, engrossing, puzzling...",7,23 May 2014,"All of the above accurately describe 'Drive', one of the most unique films that I've seen in a long time. From its sparse dialog and quirky soundtrack to its dreamlike atmosphere, 'Drive' puts the ""un"" in ""unconventional"", and the end result is likely to be a bit polarizing.If you go into this film thinking 'Action' along the lines of 'The Fast and The Furious', you're in for a crushing disappointment. 'Drive' is really more of an extremely violent--and I can't stress this point enough. This film is gruesome at times--fairytale. That's right. Fairytale.If you can keep an open mind and just let your self get swept up in it, 'Drive' is an off-beat experience that you won't soon forget.",Drive

81,juneebuggy,The movie that makes men love Ryan Gosling as much as women do,8,21 October 2014,"This had been on my want to see list for ages because I'd heard so much about it. Its the movie that makes men love Ryan Gosling just as much as us women do. It's dark, sexy, violent, blood splattered, dreamlike and unique. And while I didn't love it as much as I expected to I appreciate it for being an instant classic and I'm rating it up due to originality -which is super hard to find nowadays.Ryan Gosling is a Hollywood stunt driver by day but as he says ""It's only part time."" By night he's the getaway driver for heist operations. He is one cool character here, unlike I've ever seen him be before. Silent for the most part, speaking only when necessary and showing a range of emotion; tough, sexy, enraged, caring, and oh that smile when we get it. For me this had a real 70's vibe and I should probably give it another watch. 5/16/14",Drive

85,TdSmth5,"Interesting story, well directed, but with plenty of weaknesses",7,1 September 2012,"A silent driver moonlights as the driver for getaway cars for criminals. He has his rules, doesn't want to know anything about anyone, or the crime. In the intro we witness one of those getaways. It's pretty thrilling stuff.During the day our driver works as a stunt driver for the movies and also at a garage. His boss/mentor/handler is Shannon. He dreams of having the kid drive a race car but he needs 400k to make that happen. He turns to a sleazy mobster- a former movie producer- who in turn is involved with another mobster who runs a pizza place.One day the driver falls in love with some ugly kid next door and eventually with his mom. But soon thereafter her convict husband is released from jail. One day he's beat up and the driver gets involved for the sake of the kid and the mom. The ex-con owes some protection money to some guy. To get the money he has to rob a pawn shop. Driver decides he will be the driver for the job. The job goes wrong and ex-con is killed. Now driver has a million bucks in his possession.The universe of this movie is fairly limited so they are forced to create all these coincidences for the sake of the story and to avoid hiring more actors. It turns out that the protector guy is also involved with the two mobsters and the million dollars belong to them somehow. Which means they are going to go after the driver and after the kid and mom if he doesn't deliver the money. Even though the movie takes place in LA, the world of thugs is so small that no one can escape and everyone can be easily found. Driver is now forced to become an ultra violent but suave criminal himself to guard the people he loves.Drive is very well done for what it is. In fact, with another director, this movie could have been unwatchable. The main character and others don't say a whole lot, you have repeated shots of the guy driving in his car at night, and even more long slow motion shots of the back of his 80s jacket embroidered with a scorpion. Sometimes the director overdoes it, too. When the two main characters flirt, they just stare at each other and smile, that scene goes on just a bit to long, and the shots of the jacket get annoying at some point. So does the music. At first it's enjoyable, but then it gets obnoxious when scenes are put on mute, put in slow motion and with loud music. It is a success that with so little, the director manages to make you care about what happens. Acting is very good overall. Brooks in particular is interesting in this role. This movie isn't perfect or faultless. It's an engrossing movie, with some excellent action scenes, some surprising violence, and plenty of weaknesses, the strangest of all being the ending, where our driver shows his heart of gold, I guess, and that he doesn't care for money but only for love.",Drive
86,dworldeater,Overrated,4,24 November 2012,"This much over-hyped revisionist action flick was better than I though it would be.(which is'nt saying much) However, Drive still sucks as Ryan Gosling is not a credible tough guy and not talented enough as an actor to carry a movie with little dialogue . Gosling 's wooden performance had me care less about what went on storywise. This often gets compared to the 60's and 70's films of Eastwood, Bronson ,McQueen. Those actors were tough, but also had the acting chops and charisma to carry along material without speaking much . I did enjoy the violence and bloodshed in the few scenes there was some to wake up to enjoy . So , the film moved slow, which would not be a problem if I cared about the characters. Overall it is nice that this material was taken seriously , however Drive drove me to sleep most of the time. Lame score also.",Drive

I even went to the men's room and came back to find the scene hadn't changed. My toenails growing had more action than this movie. Actually the movie had no reason to move along because whoever wrote this nonsense forgot to add a plot. Yes, there is no action and no plot. What else? No acting either.

88,peterp-450-298716,Arty dark movie. Aggressive and poetic at the same time.,7,3 March 2014,"Driver: I'll see you in five minutes. Standard: I'll see you in four.This one was standing in line already for a long time to be watched. Looking at the number of responses on IMDb, my expectations about it went sky high. Here and there I've read it would be a unique masterpiece, quite arty and directed in a Tarantino kind of way. Those forecasts were also met.I thought Ryan Gosling would be kind of a modern version of James Dean who would make female movie-fans swoon with his blue puppy eyes. But what an excellent anti-chick flick interpretation he puts into this movie. With the leather gloves, the emotionless facial expression and the high value on the coolness thermometer he surely reminded me of James Dean. At other times, he seemed to be a fear toothpick chewing loner from a spaghetti western made by Morricone.And ""Drive"" really is a brilliant movie in retrospect. Indeed, it is an arty dark movie, without a lot of complicated plots and twists, yet straight-to-the-point. Aggressive and poetic, interwoven with a slow-building romance, horrifying at times with explicit violent images. The composition and progress in this movie is sometimes enervating slow in the beginning with lot of silenced pauses that really started to work on my nerves a bit. ""Rehearsing this script was a piece of cake for him"" I thought after about 15 minutes. Eventually, the silence and the expressions say more than a magnificent elaborate dialogue.The storyline itself I find masterly. A timid stunt driver/mechanic overloaded with Antarctic coolness, offering his services in the late hours as a getaway driver, eventually emerging as valiant knight for the neighbor in trouble whose wife was a cool aloof who sneaks into his emotional world of feelings in an extremely slow manner, and ends up in a complicated rip off plan of some local thugs. Beautiful atmospheric images of LA with ""Grand Theft Auto""-like situations.And yet sometimes I felt that the meaningless pauses could be safely left out, without prejudice to the overall atmosphere of the film. The soundtrack was also a positive contribution. Usually the music passes by without attracting my attention. In ""Drive"" it was appropriate and relevant.I found this review at IMDb. I don't agree with it completely, but some points were right on target. I liked this because of its use of super humorous terms,writing style and content.Plot synopsis 1) Driver is driver. He's like the Transporter from the movie, except 1/14th as interesting. 2) He goes home after job ,finds girl,girl has boy, girl has husband in prison. 3) Driver wants to be a mechanic, or a Nascar Driver, or a criminal, or a Movie Stunt Driver...or maybe a space shuttle pilot? or President of Uganda, who knows. 4) Husband of girl gets out of jail, and he owes money to mafia guys. Drivers likes girl, so he helps husband. 5) Husband robs pawn shop and dies. Seems that he's been set up by mafia guys as a frame job and Husband gets dead'ed. 6) Driver gets even. Kills everyone. For a while, dressed in a stunt driver mask. 7) Driver gets killed, but lives, or something, driver drives off.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",Drive
89,aidanratesmovies,A Unique and Stylish Film,10,6 December 2019,"This neon drenched compelling narrative is not only better than something like it should be, but is masterly crafted to be so. Ryan Gosling provides a rather good performance as his often silent character, with Bryan Cranston providing a well supporting performance as always by his side, as well as Oscar Isaac and Carey Mulligan. The film is brutal, but isn't so without a sense of purpose, the film knows exactly what it is, and does itself justice by being so and doing it so stylishly. The film is beautifully shot, with a great soundtrack, and a by far interesting script. In the end, Drive is not the best revenge action thriller out there, but it certainly is quite out there, and in the best of ways.

The only benefit I found to the entire thing was Oscar Isaac looking incredibly hot, but I was freaked out by the mob boss who had the voice of Marlon from Finding Nemo.
Pointless, boring and unenjoyable, so I have no idea why it appears in so many lists of films to watch.
The soundtrack wasn't bad I suppose.",Drive
91,dierregi,Stuck in second gear,5,26 February 2012,"I am always suspicious of movies with nameless characters. It seems an unnecessary contrivance. Unfortunately, ""Drive"" proves no exception, by adding this annoying detail to a slightly schizophrenic plot. Our anonymous hero, played by Gosling, is a stuntman by day and a driver of heist cars by night. Complications ensue when he falls for his neighbor Irene, a young mother with a criminal husband.Our driving hero is moved by love into protecting Irene and her child, so he gets involved into a spiral of violence. At this stage ""Drive"" could have taken a turn as a romantic movie or taken the pulp fiction route. Unfortunately, it does not develop fully in either direction.The romancing angle is played subtly and delicately. After having watched a couple of Gosling's movies and disliked him intensely, I actually liked him for the first time. He plays remarkably well the star-crossed lover.The violent part is an unbelievable mess. Turns out that there is only one criminal organization in all L.A. and all our characters are mixed up with it. The gentle driver turns into a bloodthirsty creature and physical elimination of all members of the cast ensues – needless to say, in the most graphic manner. Of the seven main characters (+child) only two make it to the end of the movie. Not difficult to guess who; however, do not expect a ""happy ending"".Besides the above mentioned ""split-personality"", ""Drive"" suffers from other problems: 1. Our driving hero is a bland cypher, a mildly likable guy, not a super-cool hero of Steve McQueen proportions. His long silences and mysterious aura are just annoying 2. The plot moves at snail's pace. Although I am not a fan of fast editing and deafening soundtracks, here we are at the opposite end of the spectrum. Long silences, pauses and minimal dialogs sold for ""intensity"" 3. The soundtrack is abominable. A mood-destroying collection of easily forgettable, third-rate songs. I sorely missed the witty dialogs and the brilliant score of Tarantino's movies 4. Finally, ""Drive"" takes itself very, very seriously, so forget fun. Sometimes when I watch a movie like this I wonder if it is the same one so many critics are raving about. How many movies titled ""Drive"" starring Ryan Goslings are currently out there? Because for sure, the one I watched does not seem to deserve much praise. Not bad, but a masterpiece it ain't.",Drive
92,valleyjohn,Gosling picks another gem,9,23 October 2011,"Ryan Gosling is hot property in Hollywood at the moment. He has so much screen presence and his acting is extremely good. He also has the knack of picking great films and ""Drive"" is no exception.This is the story of a young mechanic who does a few jobs on the side . He is a stunt driver in the movies and also a getaway driver for some unscrupulous gangsters.. He finds himself caught up with the mob when a job goes wrong and the life of a female neighbour and her son become his priority. This really is an adrenalin filled movie. Not just because of the driving ( There actually isn't a great deal) but because of the violence. It has the feel of a Tarentino film but without the dialogue. Gosling is superb as are Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman. I have a sneaky feeling this could be up for a few awards in the new year and i think it deserves it.",Drive
93,truemythmedia,More Narrative that I Prefer,8,11 September 2019,"Many critics have remarked that Gosling's performances often leave something to be desired. He tends to act very sparingly and not emote to the last row of the theater.This is precisely why I, and certain other film makers, like Ryan Gosling. He's reserved and forces the viewer to read every micro expression to figure out what he is thinking. He relies on that 90% of what we all know gets communicated when we speak, the non-verbal.His emotions teem under the surface ready to break free in a frenzy, which is the end of this film. The still waters everyone normally sees are erased from memory by the actions he undertakes when he is forced.
The violence was a lot more shocking than I remember as well. That isn't necessarily to warn anyone off of viewing the film. This movie is a prime example of violence being used effectively as a story telling technique. The violence in the film is delayed, showing the lengths to which some characters are willing to go in order to avoid it and contrasted with the characters who lean on violence as their first resource.Nicolas Winding Refn (""Only God Forgives"") is one of my favorite directors. He doesn't always nail it as far as communicating what he wants in the way that he wants but he always swings hard. Drive is probably his most accessible film and the one most people would know him for. It's probably in my top ¼ of his films but I won't say it's my favorite. It's a little more grounded than I like from him but for the average movie goer, I can't say I would recommend branching out into his other work.As a cinephile, however, I am quite thankful that my first drive with NWR led me to his other works.",Drive

Al though I should also say that after the great initial thriller sequence, the movie kind of pace down very much drastically. The entire pace of the movie kind of walks in that way, disorderly switches from fast to slow to fast to slow again. The soundtrack manages to make this movie a one of a kind. It can emphasize the other aspects capable of being of interest such as the artsy lonesome indie movie feel, I like how Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan acted here. They can withhold the overall calm, not so much into talking feel for their entire performance.

97,eric262003,Give A Thumbs Up For Refn,8,25 June 2012,"Though not a high-prolific director, Denmark born Nicolas Winding Refn was a driving force behind this invigorating thriller Drive. Sure it was run on a meagre budget; Refn takes this movie with pride and does everything he could to make it all that captivating. Granted it was only until recently that I have heard about the director, let alone most of the cast (with a few exceptions). Ryan Gosling never looked so cold and calculating since his 2002 villainous performance as Richard Haywood in ""Murder by Numbers"". The simplistic plot is very involving for me because I am just a sucker for loner individuals being that as an Aspie I am one myself. Refn embarks his audience on a structured journey around the streets of Los Angeles as we follow our unnamed socially deprived Driver (Gosling). Mr. Driver lives a double-life, he's a stunt-player in the movie industry by day and he's a getaway driver at night. He goes by a routinely strict protocol by offering you 5 minutes of his own service, after that it's all up to you. From the opening scenes we can see our protagonist that the he has a very laid-back in his approach and seems to obey all the traffic rules and he's quite a good car mechanic as well.The principal shortcomings of Mr. Driver are that the emotional urges come across as his perpetual liability. In his humble apartment, we get acquainted by his neighbour Irene (Carrie Mulligan) and her young son Benecio (Kaden Leos). Mr. Driver takes them under his wing after their car breaks down nearby at the shop where Dr. Driver works. Mr. Driver's boss Shannon (Bryan Cranston) assures that Irene and her kid will be driven home safely. But it isn't before long that Mr. Driver spends more time with Irene on a regular basis. As the connection between the two deepens, no sooner Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaacs) has come back after spending some time in prison and the tensions begin to become intense. Mr. Driver's affection towards Irene manifests to epic proportions as Standard takes a beating from the mob at the garage because he owes them protection money. This lead s to Mr. Driver to break out of his routine and rescues Irene's husband. Inadvertently, Mr. Driver becomes better acquainted with the mob lead by the stoic Bernice Rose (Albert Brooks) and his business partner Nino (Ron Perlman).When it comes to pacing I will have to dismiss those naysayers who said that ""Drive"" runs at a snail's pace. In fact I thought Refn did an incredible job in exploiting the constant sense of uneasiness that runs its course throughout the film. He knows when to let intensity build up and when to slow things down when needed which makes it all look real and natural. The chemistry was pretty convincing most of the time. Okay Gosling's performance was standard, but it was all part of his character, solitary, no family or friends to turn to, and maybe a handful of antagonists. He's quite an enigma in character, but he can be very volatile when he's protecting Irene. He's actually very fun to watch. The supporting cast also turns in very compelling performances as well. Brooks and Perlman were unmerciful as the diabolical mobsters. The car chases are executed quite nicely as well as the sounds and colours remain splendidly subliminal and the violent scenes come in at the right time and the cars are so astonishing and good looking.The musical background by Chris Martinez was treating to the ears as it pays homage to the techno sounds of the 1980's. It represents the emotional instability of Gosling's character. The sounds of the synthesizer throughout the movie gives you a true glance adds the right texture to this stylized and well substantial film.",Drive
98,pc95,"Sometimes Visceral, but overuse and misplaced Music problematic",6,29 November 2011,"In what felt like a mix of Risky Business-esque Soundtrack meets Goodfellas-type violence, the movie ""Drive"" was a bit of a disappointment. The movie amps up the graphic violence and blood to grotesque and gratuitous degree. The effect is jolting and disgusting. And while the soundtrack is often good, some of the picks and the frequency of music-video cuts is way too indulged in by director Nicholas Winding Refn. As I've written before in other reviews, Music is very important in movies, and so is the right type and usage. It's a very personal choice and reaction for each viewer. For me, Some movies succeed without it, but I think the best movies also include novel and enhancing music in the right way. ""Risky Business"" has sensational music fitting it's content. ""Drive"" has about I'd guess almost a third to half it's runtime with some music track running. The moody synthesizer and electronic blues are good mixes but not the other cut female vocals. They are whiny and distracting. The dialog of the movie is sparse throughout although the gangsters motor-on with requisite obscenities. The director, tiringly frames Gosling as almost a fashion model constantly changing angles and overusing facial close-ups. What is to like though is a lot of the driving shots and chase scenes. They are very well shot and edited. Pan-in and night shots are beautiful Still this movie is a mild disappointment and a mixed rating for me, moody and visceral at times, but over-indulgent with it's soundtrack at others.",Drive
99,lewiskendell,One of my favorites of 2011.,9,16 September 2011,"Drive is probably the coolest, most effective hard-boiled thriller I've seen in quite a while. Any time I'm sitting in a theater full of people that are absolutely quiet and still for long stretches of time (minus occasional gasps and laughs), it's pretty obvious that you've got an engrossing movie on your hands. Everything about Drive works. The pacing is excellent, the soundtrack sticks in your head like glue, the cinematography is outstanding, and the actors, led by Gosling, left no room for complaint. I'm really starting to respect the guy as a pretty amazing actor. Driver (the main character) is a quiet man, but there's a danger inside him that Gosling brings to life perfectly when necessary. It's the best role I've seen him in. As much as I liked Drive, I can't recommend it for everyone. It's a very violent movie, a slow burn, and it has heavy noir influences. If any of those things are a turnoff for you, do a little digging first before you lay down your cash to see this. Otherwise, I recommend it wholeheartedly. It's like a throwback to the 70's in the best possible way, I really enjoyed it.",Drive
100,yoggwork,Slow rhythm,8,23 February 2019,"Slow rhythm is really neither like sports car movies nor gangster movies. The use of light in the film is characteristic, especially in the elevator at the end. Tone matching, driving darkness, killing coldness, and warm lights in apartments",Drive
101,brando647,A Powerful Character Piece with Great Cast,9,16 March 2012,"DRIVE is another one of those low-key movies that didn't really get a lot of attention over the course of its release, and most people I mention it to haven't heard of it. The one person I've found so far that has even seen the movie couldn't stand it. The movie suffers from a narrow-minded audience that believe it to be another mindless car chase/action film, and DRIVE is the exact opposite of such a movie. It's a slow-boiling, tense drama that relies more on mood than bullets. With an awesome 80's vibe, the movie may not be the best from 2011 but it's high on my personal list of favorites from the year. Ryan Gosling is the unnamed driver in the film; he works in an auto repair shop and does the occasional stunt for Hollywood, but his night life involves working as a wheelman-for-hire to the local criminal scene. He becomes involved with his beautiful neighbor Irene and her son Benicio for a time, and the situation becomes complicated when Benicio's father Standard returns from serving a prison sentence. Standard is in a bind, and he owe's people protection money from his time inside. He's pressured to pull one final robbery of a pawnshop, and the driver agrees to help him in hopes of keeping Standard's family safe. The robbery goes wrong, the driver is set up, and now he's got local mob boss Bernie Rose and his Italian gangster-wannabe brother Nino to contend with if he wants save Irene and Benicio.I remember reading a bit of press when DRIVE was in its limited release when a woman was attempt to sue the producers of this movie. She was upset because she thought a movie called DRIVE was going to be the mindless action fun of the FAST & FURIOUS series. She was wrong, obviously. And she was an idiot. I urge anyone to at least know what a movie is before you pay to watch it, especially with the current exorbitant cost of a theater ticket. DRIVE never promised to be an action film; so if that's the sort of movie you're in the market for, keep searching because this movie will probably only bore you. It is incredibly slow-paced in the first half of the movie as it establishes the characters and creates the relationship between the driver and Irene. It is very much a character-driven movie. The car action in the movie, what little there is, does not compare to your average car chase film. In fact, when we are first introduced to the driver, we see him in action as a wheelman for an after-hours warehouse robbery. His escape involves almost no flair, no high speeds, no police cars ramping off parked cars and exploding. The driver is meticulous, keeping a low profile and hiding in shadows, avoiding conflict with the police at all costs. The driver in this film isn't your average over-confident, rubber-burning, catchphrase-spouting hero. He's an introvert, incredibly quiet, and incredibly talented behind the wheel.The movie may crawl for the first half, but the second half can be brutal. When the conflict with Bernie and Nino escalates and the driver is drawn in against his will, violence erupts and comes off as incredibly shocking after we've been so gently eased into the story for the first 45 minutes. It makes the little bit of violence that does occur in the movie hit harder when you aren't expecting it. There is a gritty realism here and I really dig it. The cast is superb. Major points go to Ryan Gosling, who is perfect as the driver. He's got a subdued, charming quality but it isn't hard to believe what he can be capable of when he's cornered. I loved Albert Brooks in this movie as Bernie Rose. I've come to a point where I hate the idea of the stereotypical hardcore, mafiaso-style gangster; they're everywhere in these sorts of movies and so many people play the character the same way. But Brooks doesn't. He's got more of a subtle evil to him, and (despite the fact that it's Albert Brooks) you have no probably believing that this is a guy you don't want to cross. Ron Perlman, on the other hand, sort of got on my nerves. He was a little too over-the-top as Nino. But, still, between Gosling, Brooks, and some great performances from Bryan Cranston and Carey Mulligan, this movie is filled with strong people that are giving this character piece everything they've got and it works well.",Drive
102,moviewizguy,Some Heroes Are Real,8,9 September 2011,"DRIVE tells the story of Driver (yes, that is his name), played by the wonderful Ryan Gosling. He's a stuntman and a ""driver-for-hire"" (think THE TRANSPORTER), but above all, he's good at driving. No, he's the best at driving, or at least that's what we're told, but it doesn't take us long to believe that once the film opens with a car chase that is something that should be experienced. The sequence starts off quietly but builds up in nail-biting suspense with each second. If that wasn't enough, the fantastic soundtrack will suck you in. It's wonderfully shot and cleanly edited, nothing like you'd see in a Hollywood action film these days. And it's clear, DRIVE is nothing like a Hollywood film, defying conventions and deliberate in pace. I'd say it's something like an art-house action flick but on with the story.Driver meets his beautiful neighbor, Irene, played by Carey Mulligan, whose husband is in jail. The two click instantly with a look. Since Driver isn't the talkative type, they don't get to speak to each other much. In a scene where they are alone, they just stare into their eyes, one smiling to the other. It's an endearing scene where the actors' expressions seem more important and effective than dialogue. However, Irene's husband eventually does come home, and that's when bad things start to happen. I will not reveal what occurs because you should just really watch the whole thing unravel. Additionally, avoid the trailer because it unfortunately gives a lot of plot points away. However, I will say it gets very violent and bloody.DRIVE wants the audience to get to know its characters before starting the action, and it's obvious that this is Ryan Gosling's film. Let me just say that I think Gosling is a terrific actor, from his roles in HALF NELSON to BLUE VALENTINE to LARS AND THE REAL GIRL. This guy can act, and his talent remains apparent with his first action role in DRIVE. Even though his character doesn't talk much, Gosling is able to command the camera with a single look. He brings a large presence throughout the film, only talking when he needs to. Carey Mulligan is also very good, and I should say that she is a terrific actress as well and at such a young age! The two definitely have great chemistry with each other. Bryan Cranston is Bryan Cranston. What can I say? If you've seen BREAKING BAD, you know how good he is. He's just wonderful in here. The remaining major supporting actors do just as a great job in their roles as everyone else, including Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Ron Perlman. and Christina Hendricks.With a tight direction by Nicolas Winding Refn, wonderful performances from a knock-out cast, and tense action scenes, DRIVE is quite something. Even though the story may feel familiar, the art-house style of the film makes it refreshing. I can guarantee that not everyone will like it, but it should be seen.",Drive
103,bob-rutzel-1,Well Told Thriller,7,2 February 2012,"Drive Driver (Gosling) is a get-a-way driver, a stunt driver, a mechanic and soon to be a race car driver. That is until he meets and falls for Irene (Mulligan) whose husband is in prison and is about to get out. Then the problems start. (here we go) No, no it's not what you think.This is basically a love story with some very good stunt driving and a whole lot of killing over a robbery gone bad.We have all heard the line: no good deed goes unpunished and basically, that is what puts Driver into high gear to help solve a problem. As things go wrong, Driver feels he has to make things right. However, Driver doesn't carry a gun and doesn't know any karate moves; he just drives, and everything he does is for Irene and her little boy. As we go along with him, we are somewhat concerned as to how he is going to fare going up against professional killers. But, it's in the telling that makes this a very good thriller. And, this is very well told.The slow moving scenes are there to help build tension and there is tension galore to jump-start your heart almost from beginning to end. The driving stunts are very good and I don't think CGI was used. Kudos. The acting by all is very good. Some of the killings show bloody gore and in some instances, we witness overkill.and I mean real overkill. And, the music will help get your heart rate up there too. This is all about excitement. Yours and mine. The tension begins with Driver throughout. We know very little about him, we are never given his name, and he doesn't talk much; but we keep hoping he can be a Dirty Harry (without a badge) or a Mel Gibson character protecting his family. But Driver just drives, no gun, no karate. Stares a lot though and when he does that we feel there is more to Driver than we know and we end up not worrying for him so much. StillThe ending confuses me. I thought I knew how this ended. Hey, I was there. I watched it. But, now, I'm thinking they are thinking Drive 2. But, that couldn't be, can't happen. What do you think? (very clever the way they ended this. HA!) (7/10)Violence: Yes. Bloody Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes. Language: Yes",Drive
104,bkrauser-81-311064,A Masterpiece...I guess,7,19 December 2011,"Drive is one of those rare movies I can praise for its originality and its success in expressing its point yet I simply couldn't stomach another viewing. Its audacious and different to be sure but theirs just something inherently rotten about it.Ryan Gosling plays a pensive young man who makes his living as a stunt driver and getaway driver for hire. Finding jobs mostly through his handler Shannon (Bryan Cranston), Driver (yes that's his name too) lives a comfortable and regimented existence. But When a lonely neighbor (Carey Mulligan) and her young son (Kaden Leos) make a connection with him, things start to unravel.The first half of the movie has a meditative Kubrick-ian style that immediately entranced me. The minimalist dialogue was spot on and the spellbinding late night drives through downtown L.A. were zen-like, like visual poetry. The throbbing soundtrack only aided me further in enveloping me in Driver's quiet, cool world.Then heads started rolling. Every drop of blood is painfully exuded from open wounds all for the camera and audience. Both Driver and the bad guys (Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman) seem to have an aversion to guns so they do their killing with sharp razors and blunt boot heels instead. The story then feels like the director stacked a score of champagne glasses into a pyramid then smashed them with a sledgehammer. Its not to say the dramatic series of events wasn't expected but it was done so abruptly and with such vulgarity that, in my opinion, it undermines everything that came before it.No doubt strong visceral reactions were expected by director Nicholas Winding Refn who previously directed the violent yet intriguing ""Bronson."" Both ""Bronson"" and ""Drive"" are grouped with a slew of recent films delving into the nature of violence. Other films include: Best Picture winner ""No Country for Old Men"" and last years Korean film ""I Saw the Devil."" It's a theme worth exploring but not my particular cup of tea.Like the dangerous stunts Driver pulls on his film sets, this film is meant for those who know what they're doing. Passive moviegoers beware; but for those considered film buffs, ""Drive"" is a must see.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",Drive
105,fntstcplnt,Drive (2011),9,14 September 2019,"Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. Starring Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Ron Perlman, Christina Hendricks, Kaden Leos. (R)Gosling is the Driver (no other name given, except for ""kid""), a mysterious, taciturn young man who's an L.A. mechanic and stunt driver by trade, but occasionally moonlights as a wheel-man for low-lives. Then neighbor Mulligan and her son Leos enter his life, inadvertently getting him mixed up in some sordid business with the last people in the City of Angels he should ever mess with. Superior neo-noir thriller is an ultra-stylish riff on cinematic post-modernism and anti-hero crime pictures, with tense, crisply-assembled action sequences and potent eruptions of graphic violence, yet it's focused far more on mood and character than getting the adrenaline pumping. Gosling does more with controlled looks and enigmatic smirks than the handful of lines he's afforded; his understated romance with Mulligan is expressed almost entirely in their elegantly elongated gazes. Brooks, however, walks away with the movie, cast against type as a fairly soft-spoken but ruthless crime boss, geniality masking chilly menace. The emphasis on preening, existential dread does short change the narrative twists, especially in relation to Perlman's Jewish gangster character and motivations, but it's tough to care about any of that in the moment. Arthouse genre filmmaking at its purest and most viscerally impactful.90/100",Drive

107,Muhammad_Rafeeq,Man I really want that scorpion jacket now. This Movie is my absolutely favourite of all time! ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10,10,8 February 2020,The movie of Drive is filled with lavish imagery and a sophisticated color profile. The Los Angeles cityscape provides a very accessible setting for the ethical and non-ethical jobs the protagonist stunt driver finds himself in. This movies high points are backed by a pleasing sound track filled with lush synthesizers and eerie vocals. The plot towards the back half of the film seems rushed however the lack of closure could be intentional. Overall a very enjoyable watch and pleasant 95 minutes.,Drive
108,Abdulxoxo,Cool movie,8,25 January 2021,"This movie has the smallest amount of plot but is serviceable. The leading man (Ryan Gosling) is the perfect choice for the character. The character doesn't have any real backstory, we basically only know that he's a stuntman/driver and that's he cares about only for a few people and that's it. But as time goes by, we get see to a different, darker side of him. It came as a surprise not only to the characters but also to the viewer. I like the mysteriousness of the character. The lack of dialogue is refreshing as there are seemingly awkward moments of silence that don't seem to bother the characters one bit; words spoken are important and thoughtful. The locations are simple but well chosen for the plot. It contains an atmospheric and colorful cinematography with a remarkable camera-work that captures the free-spirited locations of LA beautifully. The soundtrack focuses on full-bodied techno with creative depth and blends in perfectly. The lighting and sound effects are crafted very stylishly as well. The film also includes slightly romantic side story, but it doesn't dwell on it much but it's fun to watch. The action is surprisingly very violent, I watched the film without any prior knowledge about it, so the violence (that's almost gratuitous) caught me by surprise. This film is not for the feint of heart but it's a well-made movie and truly moving.",Drive
109,sme_no_densetsu,Highly stylized but enjoyable nonetheless,8,6 October 2014,"Nicolas Winding Refn's ""Drive"" concerns an unnamed Hollywood stuntman who moonlights as a getaway driver for robbers. When a job goes wrong he finds himself stuck with a bag full of money whose owners are bent on retrieving by any means necessary.While this brief synopsis suggests plenty of action, that's not exactly what the movie delivers. There is indeed a fair amount of that but, early on, Refn moves the story along at a very deliberate pace. Ryan Gosling's unnamed character rarely speaks or even betrays any sort of emotion. This is probably enough to turn off many viewers expecting something else.When the movie eventually gets going it presents an intriguing story, though one that's somewhat simplistic and vaguely reminiscent of past classics like ""Bullitt"" and ""Point Blank"". Stylistically, though, the movie actually echoes the 80's moreso than the 60's. This is mostly due to the film's look and its synth-pop soundtrack.The cast is well stocked with talented actors. While I'm not completely sold on Gosling's near robotic performance there's good work here from others. Albert Brooks is perhaps the most memorable in his against-type role as a ruthless mobster. Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, Carey Mulligan & Oscar Isaac also deserve special mention.Refn's direction is skillfully done as he presents a story that is at times intensely stylized while at other times decidedly raw. There's a certain European sensibility (as suggested by one of the characters) that gives this well-worn material new life. Musically, the soundtrack has grown on me somewhat over the years but your mileage may vary.In the end, the eccentricities of ""Drive"" are unlikely to be to everyone's taste. It's stylish almost to a fault but, luckily, it tells a story whose outward simplicity is mixed with a certain air of mystery and an undeniable aura of cool. I'll admit that the first time I saw it I was frankly disappointed but additional viewings have convinced me that the film does indeed have considerable merit (especially from a purely visual standpoint).",Drive
110,Analog_Devotee,The most overrated film of the 2010's.,3,4 March 2020,"One of the most boring, cliche, snore-inducing main characters in all of 2010's cinema.

This film isn't even worth being played as background noise to drown out your neighbor's early Saturday morning lawn mowing session.",Drive
111,Screen_Blitz,"Stylish art-house thriller is very violent, but beautifully crafted and solidly entertaining",8,20 January 2017,"Drive is certainly no ordinary crime thriller with guns blazing and cars flying down the streets, it is a neo-noir thriller that proves you can make a visually mesmerizing vehicle of a film with such a less than inspiring plot. It sports vastly engrossing performances by an charismatic cast, a solidly competent screenplay based on a novel by James Sallis, an artful depiction of violence, and an alluring soundtrack to sit the ambient tone of it's dark revenge plot; and these aspects are safely guided by director Nicolas Winding Refn who clearly carries a unique vision. From the opening scene to the closing, it is clear that Refn is clearing aiming for a style-over-substance vibe as the film falls slightly seldom of narrative originality, while paying homages to classic crime flicks from the early days. But if this film proves anything, it is that Refn is capable of competently modernizing a progressively fading subgenre from the early age of Hollywood. This film stars Ryan Gosling as unnamed Los Angeles native who works part-time as a mechanic for auto salesman Shannon (played by Bryan Cranston), part-time as a Hollywood stunt driver while moonlighting a getaway driver during the night hours. Upon residing into his new apartment, he meets hot-shot blondie named Irene (played by Carey Mulligan) who's stuck taking of her seven-year old son Benicio alone while her husband Standard Gabriel (played by Oscar Isaac) is serving time in prison. Upon his release, Standard is back home and has reunited with his family. But he still owes several thousand dollars to gangsters Bernie Rose (played by Albert Brooks) and Nino (played by Ron Perlman). When a bank robbery attempt goes horribly wrong, Ryan Gosling must seek for justice against the vicious mobsters.Nicolas Winding Refn isn't the strongest filmmaker when it comes to pedaling on an awe-inspiring story. But upon revitalizing the genre in an art-house fashion, Refn hits nearly all the right notes. Mixing elements of romance, action, corruption, and melancholy; Refn operates this movie with a stylish cinematic grandeur that makes it feel almost original even when it's not. In short, it makes an entertaining, if leisurely ride. Ryan Gosling steps into the foots of the unnamed protagonist who works as a mechanic, a stunt driver, as well as a getaway driver for criminals in the midst of robberies. Although little information is handed from his character, the opening scene featuring recklessly speeding through the streets of Los Angeles with a duo of robbers hunched in the backseat implies he has a shady past. And the story unfolds, the film slowly dissects the character's layers to score for a powerfully mysterious character with inner demons. When it comes down to facing off against the baddies in a vicious bloodbath, the film proceeds with a hypnotic tone supplemented with an ambient music score by Cliff Martinez that results is in a slow pace which is enough to turn off viewers who root for a more solidly moving storyline. Those rooting for a solid proceeding will be reasonably frustrated while others will be riveted by Refn's sweeping style along with the alluring electronic 80s-like soundtrack. The sporadic (and startling) burst of graphic violence that sprout out of nowhere many times throughout the second half can make this an uncomfortable sit through on the other hand, unless you are capable of stomaching gory carnage.Ryan Gosling embraces a fascinating portrayal of the nameless protagonist elicits a very limited range of dialogue. In this case, he relies his performance vastly on his facial expressions over verbal communication bring out the emotions of his mysterious character. In shorts words, it's almost haunting. Although his character is understandably questionable in terms of his mean of justice, there is no denying that Gosling effectively channels for a role further from his usual nice guy typecasting. His chemistry with his blond neighbor played by Carey Mulligan is deeply moving for the time they spend on screen together, though arguably the bigger aspect of their bond is formed by the camaraderie between him and her young son Benicio who looks at him as a friendly figure. Oscar Isaac makes a competent (and likable) presence for all time he shares on screen. On the dark side of the moral compass is Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman who both turn in sinister portrayal as a duo of mobsters consumed with greed and violent tendencies, while cashing in a few pinches of humor. In fair results, these two decently sell themselves to their antagonistic roles. Bryan Cranston plays his role pretty safely, but perhaps nothing out of ordinary.Drive is a stylish art-house thriller polished by an inspiring direction by Nicolas Winding Refn, striking visual heft, and an enthralling array of performances by an A-list cast. In short words, it is an entertaining ride for those who can swallow Refn's unique style of filmmaking. It is dark, it is slow, and it is extremely violent to hence it's R-rating. But most importantly, it demonstrates Nicolas Winding Refn operating on an admirable cinematic grandeur.",Drive
112,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Drive is one of the best character-driven movies of the 2010s.,9,17 April 2016,"Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 cult-classic Drive has become a modern classic for filmgoers and art-house cinema goers as well. One of the defining movies from Indiewood, Drive has been subject to some debate whether or not it is the grand film many of its defenders make it out to be; and I can honestly say it is what the fans make it out to be.Drive is visually driven (no pun intended) by Ryan Gosling's titular nameless character 'The Driver' and the way the world of Los Angeles has created this person who moonlights as a getaway driver at night. He's bored of this Hollywood stunt-driving life he leads and he wants to become something more than his lowlife way of living has made him out to be. He want's to be part of a family and not be a lifeless shadow of a man.Though the film may be slow for some people, it is a neo-noir film not meant for the faint- hearted and is a subtext driven film. The story is not so literal as one might expect from a film; the nuances are the things that make the film stand out from other films of its ilk. Can criminals become something better than they realise? Is there any escaping the life they've become trapped in?Drive is a very well directed film, though some scenes of the film may be disturbing to those even accustomed to heavily gritty films; there's a lot of violence in this film and when it's there, it's not at the behest of action film lovers, but that of the story and the unleashing of something unsettling and impersonal.Do not expect a rosie-painted action film where there's no consequences from what's just happened; this is a real story where moments that would be spectacular become something rather important to the characters. It's a thinking-man's film and a neo-noir for the ages; it's bigger than you realised.",Drive
113,oneguyrambling,The best 80s flick from 2011.,7,17 February 2012,"Drive is the best 80s movie released in 2011, and I include the remakes of 80s films Fright Night and Footloose (which I have not and will not ever see). From the cheesy opening titles to the uber-serious pop that dominates the background of several 'drivin' and thinking'' montages, Drive is an 80s throwback all the way. I'm actually amazed the film didn't end on a freeze frame high 5 (if that isn't a special feature on the DVD they missed a golden opportunity).Hell, even the unnamed Driver (Ryan Gosling) spends the entire film dressed as either the Marlboro Man on his day off or an onlooker at a break dancing exhibition, with a haircut so sharp it must always be school photo day to him.'Driver' is a bit of a dabbler, he spends part of his time as a Hollywood stunt driver, part as a gun mechanic and part as a 'no questions asked' courier, where his only rules are essentially be prompt and don't keep me waiting.Driver is an odd type, he seems dispassionate and removed, and operates in a clinical manner. In the getaway that opens the film his car is pursued from the get go, but he doesn't just blast away 2 Furiously with his pedal to the metal, he nurses his car along until the Need for Speed arises, then Top Guns it until he loses the tail, before promptly vanishing as just another in a crowd.Driver is 'managed' by the enterprising yet slightly pathetic Shannon, a man who openly acknowledges that he is short changing him considering his immense talents, and a man who sees bigger things on the horizon in the form of Nascar racing. But he doesn't have the funds to start a team, which necessitates the need for a meeting with Small Time Crime figures of Bernie (Albert Brooks playing against type) and Nino (Ron Perlman playing exactly to type). They green light the project and get to constructing a car to be piloted to victory by their protégé, who, like Rain Man is possibly an idiot savant and really is an excellent driver It was at this point I was sure it would be just another fast racing movie with a mildly retarded guy behind the wheel to root for, like that Sylvester Stallone movie a few years back.But that all changes – sort of – when he meets a young woman Irene and her 5 year old son Benicio. Irene is a single mum of sorts (as her hubby is in prison) that lives two doors down in Driver's apartment building, and the two strike up an 80s friendship with the boy Benicio taking a special shine to this new Father figure. When Irene's husband Standard is released from prison and moves back home the dynamic changes, but never Driver's expression or demeanour.It soon comes to light that Standard hasn't left all of his problems behind him, and fearing for the safety of Irene and Benicio Driver volunteers to help.There are consequences for all Drive is not the best film this year, and despite the undeniable 80s flavour that permeates proceedings it is one of the more original and different films that you will see this year. I can certainly see how it has both struck a chord with critics and conversely why the mainstream have stayed away. Fans of The Notebook (including my wife) won't find much joy here.The director Nicolas Winding Refn is a creator of offbeat uncompromising cinema with a decidedly non-mainstream bent, in only the last few years he has made two of the more striking and non-conformist films that I have seen in Bronson and Valhalla Rising. Both were at times difficult to watch but impossible to switch off, and both remained with me for a long time after I saw them.Drive is slightly more accessible than the aforementioned – with the smouldering Gosling no doubt helping the marketing somewhat – but Refn has become notorious for the violence in his films and while this film starts a little sedately he certainly indulges himself more than a few times in the second half of the film, leading to my wife watching as much of my armpit as she did the film for a while.I can't recommend Drive to everyone, the violence is too sudden and realistic for many and the pace too deliberate and unexciting for others, however I think fans of modern era David Cronenberg will find much to admire with this film. While I can appreciate the ferocious originality and vision of Bronson and Valhalla Rising I think Drive represents a decent compromise for director Refn, if he decides to work this niche for a few more films I will definitely go along for the journey.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Not always easy to watch but certainly one of the more singularly powerful films of the decade so far.",Drive
114,seymourblack-1,A Fully Justified Critical & Commercial Success,8,27 May 2018,"A slick, stylish and totally absorbing opening sequence introduces this movie's unnamed main character who operates as a getaway driver for criminals who carry out night-time heists in L.A. His sheer professionalism, exceptional driving skills and coolness under pressure are immediately apparent as is his ability to evade pursuing police cars and helicopters. A stopwatch to ensure perfect timing, a radio that's tuned to the police wavelength and an obviously detailed knowledge of the streets of his city, are all important tools in his armoury and contribute enormously to his continued success. Looking consistently calm, confident and fearless, this man of few words looks remarkably unassuming and possesses a useful ability to blend into a crowd and when needed, to just very naturally, disappear into the night.The Driver (Ryan Gosling) works for garage owner Shannon (Bryan Cranston) who provides him with vehicles for his night work and arranges his daytime employment as a Hollywood stunt driver. Unexpectedly, The Driver's life changes when he becomes attracted to Irene (Carey Mulligan), a young woman who lives in a neighbouring apartment with her young son Benicio (Kaden Leos). The couple soon strike up a warm relationship and The Driver bonds well with the boy. After a couple of weeks, Irene's husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac) returns home after completing a prison sentence and as well as being remarkably contrite about what he'd done in the past, also doesn't show any hostility to The Driver.On one of the days, shortly after Standard's return home, The Driver finds him covered in blood after having been beaten up and the ex-con explains that he owes a large amount of protection money from his time in prison to some mobsters who've demanded that he carry out a pawn shop robbery to clear his debt. As they'd also threatened to harm Irene and Benicio if he doesn't do what they ask, The Driver offers to act as Standard's wheelman. The robbery ends disastrously and from a TV news report that he hears shortly after, The Driver realises that the heist was a set-up and that his life is in immediate danger. What follows involves a lot of violence and The Driver losing something that's very precious to him.Whilst this adaptation of a novel by James Sallis contains many familiar components such as car chases, a heist gone wrong, romance and strong violence, the end product is so moody, gripping and beautifully photographed that it's very enjoyable to watch. The whole production has a rather retro feel and includes many recognisable influences from movies of the past with Walter Hill's ""The Driver"" (1978) being the most obvious and strongest source of inspiration. Both films feature a laconic driver with no name and no back-story who's inscrutable, unflappable and routinely doesn't carry a gun (and the similarities don't stop there).The movie's most memorable scene takes place in an elevator where the juxtaposition of a moment of great tenderness and a sickeningly violent episode proves to be incredibly powerful. The pacing of the piece and its wonderful soundtrack are also extremely effective in maintaining its ominous atmosphere and an impeccable performance by Ryan Gosling who has to express so much non-verbally, is also another part of what made ""DrIve"" such a great and fully justified critical and commercial success.",Drive
115,napierslogs,Driving a slow and thoughtful character study into a full-on violent crime thriller,8,16 September 2011,"Ryan Gosling is a driver. During the day, he's a part-time Hollywood stunt man and a part-time car mechanic. During the night, he seems to spend most of his time helping out with criminal activities. All of the time, he's a leading man. He has a quiet and unassuming charm about him that can drive girls wild, and grateful bosses (like Bryan Cranston) since he's so trustworthy and capable.The girl is Carey Mulligan, looking much older and more experienced than her 16 year-old Jenny from ""An Education"" (2009). Again, sometimes girls fall for the wrong guy. But sometimes, the guy isn't bad, he just makes some wrong turns. For the few questionable choices that the driver made, every choice the filmmakers made was perfect. The film has such an artistic appeal to it with interesting transitions and scenes where the characters might just sit silent for five minutes, but we still know what's going on.The driver may drive at high-speeds and flip cars in Hollywood crash 'em up action movies, but ""Drive"" is anything but. It's actually not so far-fetched for Gosling to refer to it as a ""John Hughes superhero movie."" There's a background feel to it that makes it seem like an '80s chick flick, even though it's nothing like that. It starts with the speed of a minimalistic character study, but we don't even learn our hero's name. I'm glad it started that way because it got me more interested in the crime and money-stealing plot.""Drive"" is slow, thoughtful, and interestingly shot and paced. Oh, and it's violent.

He ""drives"" the whole film throughout the duration.The director has built quite good suspense in the initial few minutes. He then proceeds to slowly set up the characters so that we feel more invested in them once the action starts. The first half didn't have any dull or boring talkie parts, much to my surprise and delight, and the car chase sequence was simply stunning.From there on, the action starts to get gorier and more fun.In arthouse action films, action scenes serve an important and deep purpose to the plot. This is exactly what happens in Drive. Each and every action sequence is not just brilliantly executed, but also well plotted. There's a buildup before each one of them and thus it's easier to enjoy these exciting set pieces.The soundtrack, especially the one that closes the film, is really impressive.The plot, while pretty simple and straightforward but with ""action-y"" twists is very impressively written. Not a single boring moment in the whole film.Drive is one of the finest action dramas to come out from the American cinema.

Strangely though, it doesn't seem to matter, because 'Drive' manages to be absorbing and highly entertaining anyway. The film is slow moving but the air of mystery around the main character is enough to keep the viewer compelled.'Drive' doesn't mess about when it comes to violence. There's plenty of it, and then some. Bloody violence in an 18 rated film isn't that surprising, but I didn't expect just how graphic some of it was. In a way it was refreshing to see in a crime themed movie.

Thanks to superb casting and Rejn's directorial abilities, ""Driver"" presents a tight, simmering character-driven piece that periodically explodes in gory mayhem. Ryan ""The Notebook"" Gosling deserves all the accolades he's been getting for his fully invested portrayal of the titular, laconic anti-hero, while the support from the likes of Carey ""Shame"" Mulligan, Albert ""you have to ask?"" Brooks, Ron ""you have to ask again?"" Perlman, Bryan ""Breaking Bad"" Cranston, Christina ""Mad Men"" Hendricks, Oscar ""Robin Hood"" Isaac, and even a cameo Russ ""West Side Story"" Tamblyn provides a thoroughly realized foundation. ""Driver"" has style and substance to spare; if I were to have any complaint, it might be about the somewhat melodramatic finale, which I refuse to spoil here.Rejn proves once and for all that he is a highly competent storyteller worth keeping an eye on. Gosling absolutely demonstrates his rising star power and the subtlety of his acting chops; this young man has a long, illustrious career ahead of him.

Less is more in film, and Refyn is a master of visual storytelling. It's plot isn't a groundbreaking one. A heist gone wrong. A gangster movie of the most typical kind. So when the characters get a chance to speak, the dialogue itself doesn't pack the same punch. The rest is thrilling and nerve wracking, and fabulously executed by NWR. Placing him on the map as a seriously good film director. The cast is also, in hindsight, amusing to see. The debuts of giants like Oscar Isaac and Christina Hendricks are fascinating. So are Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks as a ruthless gangster. Imagine that.",Drive
123,KnightsofNi11,Brutally beautiful,9,29 September 2011,"What's more intimidating than Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman as violent Jewish gangsters? Nothing. That's what. Don't believe me? Then watch the film Drive, one of the highest quality films to come out this year. It stars Ryan Gosling as our nameless protagonist. He's a young man who has a job as a Hollywood stunt driver during the day, but moonlights as a getaway driver, constantly putting his life on the line to make a few extra bucks for himself and his partner in crime, Shannon, played by Bryan Cranston. Things operate smoothly until a heist goes terribly wrong and Gosling finds himself with a million dollars in cash of someone else's money. The rest of the film delivers some of the most intense, violent, and artfully magnificent filmmaking you will see this year.Drive has a very quiet brilliance to it which is conveyed through masterful artistic style which remains consistent through every shot and every intensely gripping moment of the film. It's easy to see what Drive sets out to be. It is an art film which also has to be cool. And cool it is. In fact, there's hardly a better world to describe Drive than just... cool. The execution of the film is so smooth and so powerful in the way every single moment of the film is played off in a brilliantly exciting way. Drive is a film that does everything in its power to be as wickedly intense as possible, while not being melodramatic or over exaggerated. It plays its action up at such a tasteful level, compelling us to be entranced by every haunting second of it. It is stunning how well the tone of the film is established and how perfectly it is kept up from start to finish.Drive is a film that is all about style, but it most certainly doesn't lack the substance to complement the style. Drive tells a great story with great characters that play the specific roles of this crime/drama/romance/thriller flick perfectly. And it goes without saying that the acting of Drive's all star cast backs up the characters very nicely. Ryan Gosling couldn't have been any cooler. He plays off every moment of the film with such a calm, collected, smooth, and sexy persona that we can't help but become so invested in his harrowing story. The film's supporting cast are all superb as well. Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, and Ron Perlman are all insanely good and, as far as Albert Brooks goes, all I can say is that he better make room on his shelves for that Oscar statuette.Drive is a frighteningly good film. After seeing it you won't be able to forget how cool it was and just how thrillingly awesome every moment of the film was. You won't be able to shake the horrific glory of the film's intense style and you won't be able to put some of those gruesome shots out of your mind. You won't be able to stop singing the film's wicked soundtrack in your head. You won't be able to stop thinking about the brilliant characters and the ridiculously incredible actors who portrayed them. You will not forget the movie Drive.",Drive
124,phanthinga,The movie made me fall in love with Ryan Gosling,9,27 August 2018,"I came across Drive purely by chance when I'm looking for some ultra violent movie and the title Drive pop up a few time but what I got after Drive is much more than what I'm asking forDirected by Nicolas Winding Refn Drive is a stylish crime drama featuring what I believe some of the coolest main character in modern cinema.The Driver played by Ryan Gosling is an action hero that on par with the like of Steve McQueen,Sean Connery or Charles Bronson when he the type of guy who talk very little but get the job done on time.Looking at The Driver the first impression is he a very handsome guy that can't do no wrong but you will not want to get on his bad side cause deep down inside him is a force of nature that waiting to be let loose.The whole movie got this warm and cuddly feeling with The Driver and his new found love interest in the first half but when the stuff hit the fan it make a great""GOD DAMN"" moment.The movie may get a bit slow after the opening getaway scene but again Drive is not an action movie it a journey of a shady guy who want to be the hero of his own story",Drive

126,joebloggscity,"Thankfully not ""The Fast and The Furious""",8,9 November 2011,"Ryan Gosling is a great actor. He's starred in a lot of films that aren't mainstream and can be defined as niche or cult. One of my favourite of his films in the genre breaking was ""Half Nelson"" which if you've not seen then I'd strongly recommend. It breaks the norms and turns things upside down. ""Drive"" fits into this field well, and takes us down a road that has been blocked off by the bulk of the other motor & road movies.""Drive"" follows our nameless lead who is an exceptional driver, working by day in a garage and on stunts for films but also takes contract jobs as a getaway driver for criminals. He falls in love with the girl next door (Irene) which lets his guard down, but then this gets himself in what most would find to be way over their heads. Our ""Driver"" though despite his predicament is as controlled out of the car as in it. Reticent, calm and intelligent ""Driver"" has to clear up the mess he has got into without hurting Irene.Before anything else, note this is NOT ""The Fast or the Furious"" or ""Bullitt"", and it's not even ""Top Gear"" off the television. There are few driving scenes, and even then they are not too long and the action is sharp, believable and engrossing. The focus is on the story, and the actors have much meatier roles than you'd expect in a driving movie. Don't expect a showroom full of product placed vehicles, there's none of that.The actors are all well placed, with Ryan Gosling perfect for the role. Christina Henricks (of ""Mad Men"" fame) is billboarded as appearing in the movie, but note it's a brief role. Ron Perlman and Carey Mulligan are great support actors to Gosling which builds on everything.Fabulous direction and shots of the LA landscape give us a great feel of the environment and you'll lap it all up.I'd heartily recommend this film. It's definitely a change from the norm, and given half a chance you'll enjoy it.",Drive
127,Danusha_Goska,"Slow, Anonymous, Nihilistic Sadism. But Gosling is Brilliant, As Ever",3,27 May 2013,"I was watching the beginning of ""Drive"" on DVD and I was bored. ""Drive"" is very slow moving. I wondered what I was missing; the film had gotten rave reviews. I paused the DVD and read a few internet comments. One reviewer wrote, ""Skip the first fifty minutes. It's boring. Fast forward to the end with all the interesting killings."" ""Drive"" is a nihilistic, sadistic, nasty little film. There are graphic scenes of one man stomping another man to death. The victim's skull is depicted as having the fragility of an eggshell; his brains have the squishy consistency of chocolate pudding. A man places a nail into the forehead of an intended victim and threatens to hammer the nail. A man makes to shake another man's hand and pulls the man forward and slashes his arm open. There are also more conventional stabbings and shootings. I'm used to images of gore; my facebook friends tend to post the latest stoning, decapitation, or bombing videos. What sickened me about ""Drive"" was realizing that Hollywood executives cooked up all this nihilistic sadism as a moneymaking form of entertainment. Ryan Gosling plays The Man with No Name. He drives getaway cars for violent criminals. He develops a crush on Irene (Carey Mulligan) his neighbor. Her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) has just gotten out of prison. Gosling offers to drive Standard in a heist. There are some Jewish gangsters, Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks. None of this is particularly believable or involving. I never forgot that most characters are actors. Oh, there's Albert Brooks, who usually plays a narcissistic whiner, who is now playing an atypical bad guy role. Oh, there's Ron Perlman, who was in Beauty and the Beast. Oh, there's Carey Mulligan, who just played Daisy in ""The Great Gatsby."" Oh, there's Bryan Cranston, from ""Breaking Bad."" It's impossible to believe that Mulligan and Isaac are married, or that Mulligan belongs in this movie at all. She looks like a dewy buttercup; Isaac looks like he could play Satan with no makeup. Mulligan totally lacks that Gloria Grahame feel of a true film noir heroine – beautiful, shopworn, tragic. The film moves very slowly. There is virtually no dialogue between Gosling and Carey Mulligan. The viewer has no idea why this woman breaks into Gosling's heart. You have no idea who Gosling is. He comes across as being too stupid or too smart; too amoral or too ethical; he's just not believable. None of the characters are likable. This film could have had any number of endings, with everybody dead or everybody alive or the lovers united or the lovers apart, the money in the bank or the money in the backseat of the car. I just did not care. The film seems to exist only to satisfy that sad, creepy demographic of fans who pay to see ""interesting killings."" ""Drive"" gets more than one star for Gosling's performance. He is a brilliant actor who can do anything. I just wish he would not waste his gifts on drek like this.",Drive
128,itamarscomix,A breath of fresh air,9,15 December 2011,"There were few films in recent years that I enjoyed quite as much as Drive. The main reason is that few films managed to surprise me as much: Drive managed to create expectations and then avert them several times over. It constantly straddles the line between genres - clearly channeling the action films of the 80's in its first half, then turning into a violent, character-driven crime drama. It also straddles the line between past and present, lovingly embracing the romanticism and energy of the classic action flicks, but contrasting it with dark, post modernistic nihilism.More importantly than all that, Drive dares to avoid the border that divided almost the entirety of American cinema in the last thirty years, the border between art and entertainment. Like some of the best films ever made - The Godfather, Silence of the Lambs, Pulp Fiction - Drive attempts both. And while it's not on the level of a masterpiece, it manages to be good art and good entertainment. It's well-paced, constantly intense and thrilling, and doesn't overstay its welcome - offering the viewer only glimpses of the characters, leaving us wanting more. It's also beautifully shot, with a moody and unnerving color scheme, and boasts a wonderful cast of top character actors (Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston and Carey Mulligan are great; Ron Pearlamn and Albert Brooks play against type and do a wonderful job) playing a group of fascinating and intricate characters.Drive is an action film, a crime thriller and an art-house drama rolled into one, but don't expect it to fulfill whatever expectations that description gives you. It's a simple film with a simple story, which immerses the viewer in completely and never lets them lose interest. Might not be a classic masterpiece to be remembered fifty years from now, but a damn good movie by any standard.",Drive

131,witster18,"A stylish, deliberate film that will divide audiences.",9,20 February 2012,"Drive is the best film of 2011. I'd probably put it a touch above two polar-opposite types of films;The Descendants and Midnight in Paris(both great).Nicolas Winding Refn has an eye and an ear for direction. This is easily the most stylish film since Michael Mann's Early Work, or William Friedkin's ""To Live and Die in L.A."". This is a 'throwback' film. It's deliberate pacing and basic story-line will likely turn- off those in search of a new ""Fast and Furious"" entry, but for those in search of a film that was ""cared for"", a film that oozes perfection with nearly every frame, THIS IS IT!The cinematography is awesome. Angles, lighting and colors that would make Kubrick proud.And the music... my god the music... I'd pay 30 bucks to go see this at the local IMAX tonight if it were there.The story is a rather basic, fairly-good-guy mixing with fairly-bad- people storyline. This is a lead character that we can root for, but the script is so bare that we hardly know him. That's part of the intrigue here. He's the ""man with no name"".. the driver.. that's it. THis is Michael Mann's ""Thief"" all over again, only better(omg did I just say that, OK fine Thief's equal then). It's a hard-edged, stylish juggernaut of a film.It's not perfect. There are some issues with the opening scene(as great as it is), and the film could use a touch more dialog.Ask yourself what kind of movie-goer you are before you watch this. Are you a ""popcorn-movie-person"" that likes the big-budget CGI stuff, or are you a film-buff or a person who really takes in the intricacies of direction and style.There's really no middle ground here - this is definitely an 'art' film.It's also a terribly violent film. The kind of violent that only a European, Aussie, or Scandinavian director knows. I don't know why they do a better job of it, but they do. Blood looks real, knives are the preferred weapon, and realism that is often hard to watch. Perhaps it's that regional-background-edge, coupled with his eye and ear, that push this film into ""elite"" status. This film would fit in any of the last 4 decades and still be considered a masterpiece in any of them. There's a grit to this polished diamond too, and that is what makes it truly unique. It's like Von Trier, Villenueve, and Michael Mann had a Baby and you died and went to movie heaven.",Drive
132,RonellSowes,Overly Subdued,6,17 April 2021,"The film is about a getaway driver and a heist that goes wrong, which gives you the inclination of a fast paced action packed flick. However, Drive couldn't be further from that. It's actually very slow in pace, car chases and high speed action are kept to a minimum(almost not at all) and it stops to take everything in. At a lesser degree I would praise it for it's better judgment, but its tone is just too subdued. Every scene is played out as minimal and quietly as possible. The lack of any acceleration to this film is burdensome.Ryan Gosling's character in this film-who is nameless-takes 'the quiet type' to a whole new degree. I'm not sure if he has even 50 lines of dialouge in the whole film. He doesn't come across like the cool, retiscint types that actors like McQueen or Eastwood were known for, but only someone who is just refusing to speak. I don't think such a personality is natural to Gosling and his periods of silence are hollow and frustrating.Drive took a road divergent from most action films and on the surface I condone it. But the tone and style is so muted it's practically silent.",Drive

Unfitting soundtrack works surprisingly well, and even has a haunting effect that may not be intention but is still perfect. MPAA forced director Refn to trim one scene heavily to achieve an R-rating; hasn't everyone seen IRREVERSIBLE yet, who are we sheltering?

He is not even slightly interesting, he doesn't talk, he lives in his little inner world of cars and precision mechanics, an economy-class emotional bubble that can burst into something relentless.Ah yes they brought to life the superhero next door, the kind of monster living only in the brains of writers. Bad writers that is. Writers that will happily confuse nothingness with rich inner substance. You want a specific car stunt for $500? Just ask the superhero driver. He needs no careful planning, it's all in his veins. Have some trouble with the local Mafia? Head-on collision is the solution, the silent boy can certainly write off a couple of big mouths and settle it all. Seems some director found the story compelling and convenient though. And viewers bought that sh*, which is most disheartening given the level of gore graphic and gratuitous ultra-violence.The nihilistic trend sells well as artsy gutsy stuff these days. The Coen bros dood it, and it's now a real consummate genre from Cronenberg's self-inflicted History of Violence to There Will Be Blood. Adding the F-word in movies was an artistic endeavour years ago, now it seems that violence, especially dumb violence, is the way to show off how much more gripping you can do with less substance.",Drive
136,JohnRayPeterson,"An uncommon wheel man, a driver with brains and a plan and a Good Samaritan; an enigma",8,28 November 2011,"Ryan Gosling plays the driver with no name, an enigma, in many ways, from start to end. After reading a few pretty good reviews I was curious to see if in fact the director Nicolas Winding Refn had indeed managed to keep Gosling's character from revealing his name; amazingly the main character played by Gosling is not 'interpelled' by his name nor does he introduce himself. The movie is so captivating that this goes almost unnoticed by many viewers, sadly myself included. Gosling's character is revealed in ever small doses and it never leads to where you expect. You will not get to know him but in a few surprising moments at a time, each more dramatic than the one before. I've seen many movies with Gosling and he was right for this part; if you have seen ""Half Nelson"" and ""All Good Things"", to mention his less viewed and lesser grossing productions, you would likely agree he was the man for this part. The writing and directing, however are no less the elements that make the movie very different than what I'm sure viewer expected. It is very well conceived and flows nicely while it grips you seemingly. The story is more than has been drafted to promote it; it is well worth reading a few reviews to get all the intricacies at play here. Despite being heavy in sub-plots, it does not weigh the movie down as I would have thought, a tribute to Refn, Amini and Sallis.Contrary to what the title would have you believe, as well as the trailers, the movie is not about car chases. There are only two car pursuits. The first one starts at 2:09 minutes into the movie and ends absolutely brilliantly at 8:52, making it a mere 6:43 minutes chase which feels much longer; it feels longer because you are put in the driver's seat, but not quite as the racer wheel man, rather as the mastermind escape artist, well prepared, aware of all the goings on by the cops and making moves like a chess player in a blitz tournament. The second car chase is a more standard pursuit, but remember that Gosling is an escape artist behind the wheel and this time he's running from double-crossing criminals. No match for Gosling's character. The movie is much more about the main character's contrasting Good Samaritan nature and the ruthless means he must resort to in order to do what he must. The high ratings and praise from reviewers is no surprise. You should like it; I certainly did.p.s. If you are in need of a fix for car chases, high octane nature, I recommend Peter Fonda 1974's ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"", Charlie Sheen in 1987's ""No Man's Land"", Nicolas Cage in 2000's ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"", Paul Walker's 2001's ""The Fast and The Furious"" & the other ""Fast and Furious"" sequels, Jason Statham in 2002's ""The Transporter"" & the two other sequels; also both the 1969 and 2003's ""The Italian Job"", Steve McQueen 1968's ""Bullit"", Gene Hackman 1971's ""The French Connection"", William Petersen 1985's ""To Live and Die in L.A."" and Daniel Craig 2008's ""Quantum of Solace"" opening scene. The last four are my favorites; the two most intense chases are by Petersen and Hackman, the former as the driver pursued and the latter as the most determined pursuer.",Drive
137,Christian_Dimartino,"Keep on driving, Ryan. Keep on driving.",10,31 January 2012,"I finally know why everyone talked about Drive last year. Drive, which was that popular movie that not many saw, should have been seen. For too many reasons.Ryan Gosling plays an unnamed lonely guy named Driver, or nicknamed Driver. He is a movie stuntman moonlighting as a getaway driver for criminals, and damn is he good. But he begins to see an actual life outside all of the chaos when he meets Irene(Carey Mulligan), and her son, Benicio.He begins bonding with them, and becomes incredibly close, but it's not really a sexual relationship with Irene, though he cares so deeply about her. But this bond is broken when her convict husband returns from prison, and soon Driver's quiet espionage-like life is turned upside down.Remember Ryan Gosling from The Notebook? Remember Ryan Gosling from Crazy Stupid Love? Yeah, this is him. But here he does something that I don't think i've seen him do before. He's those characters from the other films, but with a brutal side. An ass-kicking Jacob Palmer. Every scene with him, which is nearly every one, you can not take your eyes off of. He's fantastic. He's a guy who has found something to love.Strangely, the film is a love story in it's own violent way. Yes, it is violent, but not that violent. Violence I can tolerate, even though I have made a vow never to see Hostel. Blehh.The acting from everyone is fantastic; Mulligan, a fellow Oscar nominee, Albert Brooks as the mob boss who seems harmless up until he sticks a knife in a guy's eye, Rob Perlman as his partner, and Bryan Cranston as Driver's friend.The action sequences are fantastically shot; the film is a mixed genre. The first ten minutes is a thriller, then the following half hour is a drama, your typical Ryan Gosling indie-flick, then after the first forty minutes, the story plot kicks into gear and we're forced to (cheese alert) buckle up and go for a ride.Drive is a strange movie, but it's one that will definitely keep people talking. I didn't quite agree with some of the year's Oscar nominees, but damn it this should have been one of them. And Gosling is constantly overlooked. I felt like he did better than Michelle Williams is Blue Valentine, and it's a crime that he wasn't nominated for any of his movies this year.Why wasn't Drive nominated? Because it was awesome, strange, and very violent? I don't know, but i'm positive that some day, they'll regret their snubbing. They'll realize what a classic it is, and feel very stupid.A",Drive

Only a woman with whom he never really has a relationship (???--unclear) has the power to cause him to renounce his ""code"" of ""drive only: no weapons or violence"". No one, however, not even a cute as a high school prom queen single mother whose husband is in prison, can get him to drop the soggy toothpick. At one point, he stows it behind his ear.

Well, so is the life of the Driver in Drive, the tale of a Hollywood stunt-car driver by day and a getaway driver by night.Drive is relatively simple filmmaking that is complex and complicated due to the depth of the performance from Ryan Gosling and the psychological directing of Nicholas Winding Refn. The Driver falls in love for his next door neighbor, Irene, portrayed by a refined Carey Mulligan, but yo ho, complications arise when her husband is released from prison and the Driver must aid this family that he has grown to care for when Irene's husband must pull off a heist to pay off a debt. Refn and Gosling work in tandem to do so much with so little. Gosling does not show much emotion, but rather his eyes show that he is thinking about the events transpiring, and Refn just keeps the camera on him, letting us as the audience meditate whilst slowly dollying in at all of the right moments to bring us into the Driver's mind. The cinematography by Newton Thomas Siegel is definitely a highlight that helps all of the proceedings, and Refn and Siegel are in for potential Oscar noms.However, Drive is a tale of two halves. The first half deals with the Driver living his odd life simply wanting to drive no matter what he is doing, whilst getting to know Irene and her son, which was a lot stronger in terms of character; where as the latter half forsakes all of the strong character work in the first half for gratuitous violence. While Refn and Gosling manage to keep it together in the few quiet moments near the end, the action often overwhelms the characters and they get lost in the shuffle. So what? Even if Drive shifts from a spectacular contemplative drama to fairly standard thriller midway through, Refn delivers the thrills in pulse pounding, Hitchcock fashion to make Drive a thrill throughout.I give Drive a 9 out of 10!",Drive

144,asda-man,Drove me the right way,8,11 January 2013,"I wasn't really too sure with what to expect with Drive. People were calling it an incredibly slow art-house movie, which I don't mind at all, I'm quite fond of the odd good art-house movie e.g. ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" is a firm favourite of mine. I also had high expectations however, as a lot of people were raving about it like it was the greatest achievement of film ever! So I went in with an open mind and found myself being very fond of it. Drive is a film which I shall definitely give a second run around the block again.Drive opens fantastically! It perfectly captures the dangers of being a get-away driver. It's a thrilling chase scene with Ryan Gosling trying to evade the police and is beautifully shot. It tries to rely more on realism than go for the cheap quick-cut and shaky-cam thrills which the Fast and the Furious franchise aims to deliver. Drive takes a slower pace and has much more of an interest in character than action, which is a good thing to me. The slow direction perfectly conveys the loneliness of Ryan Gosling, but also shows that he's in control. He's a severely calm and methodical person, who you wouldn't really like to get on the wrong side with.The main show in Drive is the near-perfect directing, cinematography and lighting. Drive is a master-class in these elements as it's obvious that every shot was set up with great care and precision. There's not one piece of lighting out of place and the cinematography is quite astounding at times. It's incredibly easy on the eyes and carries a very cool charm with it. I loved the realism of the film and the shocking violence was used with reason, and almost reminiscent of a Haneke film, with short and shocking bursts of extreme violence. However, like Goodfellas, it is used to show the nasty and unglamourous side of the mob industry.I also really liked the love story told. There's some chemistry between Ryan and Carey, and although they don't really say a lot to each other, the connection between them is definitely there. Things between to hot up when Carey's husband is released from jail and things take quite an unpredictable turn for the worst. The final half hour or so may be slow, but it is still undeniably thrilling and realistic. There a some beautifully shot sequences that will stay with me for a long time. The finale is also very gripping, and you care about the characters involved.Overall, there's something about Drive that makes it unique and different to other films. It has certainly got under my skin and is an experience I shall look forward to again. The soundtrack perfectly engulfs the retro feel of the film and the directing is almost as stylish as Tarantino. Lovers of dialogue may be disappointed but there is certainly more dialogue than what some people say. I was expecting a film like ""Hunger"" where nothing's said for what feels like an hour, until a non-stop 15 minute talk-fest! Drive is nothing like that. It just takes a somewhat different and unconventional approach from the average Hollywood production. Drive's a film of quality and one I won't be forgetting in a hurry!",Drive
145,Rickting,Exceptional and exhilarating art house action,10,23 February 2015,"Drive was the best film of 2011. Not The Artist. Not The Tree of Life. This. However, many are going to frustrated with Drive as for some reason it was marketed as an action film filled with car chases. Drive is a slow, insightful art house film with brief but exhilarating bursts of heart pounding ultra violence and a lot of emotion conveyed with images instead of dialogue. Drive is far better than a car chase fest, and why it wasn't marketed as the great film it actually was is a mystery. Ryan Gosling's nameless getaway driver gets into trouble when he helps out his neighbour, who he is in love with. Drive could be seen as pretentious or self indulgent, as it refuses to stick to conventions and many shots are just characters looking into the distance. There isn't an awful lot of dialogue; the main character's lines are Harold Pinter level simplicity. Music and visuals speak louder than words in this film, but the dialogue is still very meaningful and there is plenty of emotional content here. Ultimately, the character relationships are moving, although in an understated though still powerful way.Ryan Gosling, as the main character, has a very difficult job since he doesn't say a lot, but he creates an interesting and memorable character with a minimalistic but powerful performance which allows one to sense the many complexities of his character and his emotions. Everyone does a good job acting wise. This is perhaps a style over substance film, but there is substance in the style. The style itself is extraordinary. Smooth, sleek and dazzling cinematography propel Drive, while the clever use of music adds emotion and drama to an already astonishing film. The action and violence is thrilling but because it is minimal it never loses the key element of suspense. It's such a compelling and intelligent movie it doesn't need a lot of action. The elevator scene will probably go down in history. Drive is a stylish, ultra cool work of art with plenty of depth beneath the surface. It won't speak to everyone, but it's a very fine work and one of the best movies of the 2010s so far. Only God Forgives is thoroughly inferior and shows the style completely dominating the substance. Drive shows Nicholas Winding Refn's fascinating style finding true balance, power and soul.10/10",Drive

There was a slow pace of events during the first half hour and I felt a little bored, but the level of the film rose greatly. Ryan Gosling's acting was excellent, the body of his character was excellent, the story of the movie was good, I highly recommend watching the movie and my rating for the film is 7.7/10.",Drive
147,dragokin,a remake that pretends it isn't a remake,6,18 February 2013,"Drive was somewhat slow and pretentious but had nice moments, as well, and the gory scenes of violence are not the ones i mean.It was a surprise, though, that the first 15 minutes were almost copy-pasted from the Driver (1978). So, my issue with Drive is that i wondered which movies i haven't seen or remembered that are potentially a part of it.I guess such an approach is good when you want to avoid producing a remake. You simply take the best parts (or the ones you like the best) from favorite movies of your childhood, put them together and claim you're re-imagining all those stories. And if enough people read in some higher sense in it, you've got your masterpiece.",Drive
148,andrewroy-04316,"It's a sleek and thrilling action film, but it's got plenty of emotional appeal and ideas too",8,18 February 2020,"There's no one concrete element of Drive that makes it so fun - it's the constant atmosphere of the film pulling you into the driver's world. Much like another beloved action film of the decade and recent memory, Mad Max: Fury Road, Drive is an action movie that does an excellent job with the essentials but also is intelligent and engaging. Drive trades out the apocalyptic world-building and analogies of Mad Max for modern city and crime life. It also has some elements similar to Nightcrawler or even Taxi Driver, as loners very committed to what they do but struggling to make human connection. Drive is a clever meta-commentary on traditional action tropes, as the driver's masculinity and determination to get the job done is ever-present. I love the scorpion/frog fable as a metaphor for how people can't avoid doing what's in their nature, and love the line where the driver asks why sharks can't be good guys. The movie rests on the ability to convincingly sell the driver, which is a tall task, but Gosling is up to it. He has to command scenes with intensity and power despite hardly ever speaking, and he does an amazing job. His slow but purposeful statements and facial expressions allow him to control the gravity of the situations, even with some heavy hitters. The score and cinematography are great, adding to the city atmosphere with synth-heavy beats and neon lights. The emotional beats hit well enough - the driver is too deep in his life of being a driver and forgoing any emotions to completely avoid violence, even as he knows it'll lose him Irene. The elevator scene is a sad one, as is the ending with him driving away, knowing Irene will be better off without him. The selfishness and obsession with money, taking any angle possible to screw others over, fit in as a solid mob crime movie. Drive is a movie that manages to be extremely entertaining and feel like fine art, and that's a powerful combination.",Drive
149,judywalker2,Total waste of time and driving.,1,18 September 2011,"Went to see this movie with my daughter hoping it would be better than the movie I saw the previous day. It wasn't. Drive, should have been about a driver. You know a Steve McQueen type guy who is a stunt driver by day and a getaway drive by night. It should have been sequence after sequence of cool getaway driving or cool stunt driving with an interesting character study of a man who drives and loves cars in between. It wasn't and that's the problem with the movie. Between endless sequences of silence we get bad dialog by stupid, old, white gangsters and stylized violence; which put together produced one boring movie where the only character we actually care about for a second is in the movie for a second. What a waste, this should have been a good movie.",Drive
150,danielmanson,"Starts slow, really gets going",8,21 November 2020,"Watching this film, about half an hour in I thought I was watching a romantic. No real action of note and the plot was heavily centred around this ""relationship"". After the half way point it seriously ramps up in action and becomes a fantastic film to watch. A lot of unexpected gore and well shot action scenes and car chases in abundance.Beyond that, the crime side of the plot is fairly average nothing confusing, which is good. The personality of Ryan Gosling is what will really turn people off/on. For me, I personally enjoyed it. His long silences and introvert personality I really related to and fitted the character and plot well. Maybe a few flaws within this. For someone that doesn't often speak, he manages to bag dates with this woman (I need to learn how he pulls that off). But, that's really me nit picking.Overall though I really enjoyed this film. Once I got past the relationship section and more action started kicking in it really was good. 8/10 from me. Would recommend.",Drive

I had expected more speed, more adrenaline and more action, but the tempo and the wavy high impacted ups and the very mellow downs are working well, but it wasn't what I expected.All the actors do a very fine job, but especially Driver played by Ryan Gosling is great, Carey Mulligan and Bryan Cranston have some good supporting roles and the bad guys by Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman are great.This is not a film for everyone, it's very violent a long the way, the mood, the lighting and the atmosphere is helping a lot to bring a kind of unpleasant scenery in, But it's a well directed and instructed movie, with a great cast and crew and a good story, I liked it a lot.",Drive
152,Darth_Osmosis,"Overrated pretentious flick, that doesn't know what it wants to be...",3,9 March 2012,"This movie was one of the biggest dissappontments to me in years. It has been praised to death by critics and regular moviegoers alike, and has tons of fanboys ready to defend it to the grave. So no wonder I had high expectations. But I was expecting something different(better)than what I ended up getting.It starts promisingly enough with a fairly good opening scene and a promising start to the movie. But don't get excited, it goes downhill fast. We soon find out that the main character is either retarded, or is just a sociopath, but not in a good way that would be entertaining to watch(Joker, Alex Delarge etc), but rather a boring version of Norman Bates. Silent, emotionless and brutally violent if needed. But only a few times during the movie, it's like the movie knows it's boring and has to throw something at us once in awhile...Speaking of boring and emotionless, the movie is FULL of excessive slow-mo and ""artsy"" shots of people doing nothing. For a movie called DRIVE I sure expected more car chases, we got two quite short and not particularly jaw dropping ones.Watching this movie I thought what were they thinking, who is the target audience? It was almost physically painful to sit through all the long scenes where nothing is even said. And the slow-mo got more and more comical till it just was WTF seriously again in slow mo? I guess the main character's brain also worked in slow mo! I feel that at least half of the people ""liking"" it, are doing so cause it's ""hip"" to like it! I have seen over 1500 movies, and this just might be the most baffling to me.. Maybe I just don't get it, but if so, I don't feel as if I have lost anything more than maybe the time watching this.They even managed to make Christina Hendricks look unattractive for god's sake! Didn't think it was possible before I saw this...",Drive
153,ethanbresnett,Woah - what a surprise!,9,31 December 2020,"Drive took me completely by surprise. It wasn't the type of film I was expecting at all. It was very stylish, very moody, very minimalist, and very very good.I loved the story. At its heart was the intriguing character of the Driver, portrayed by Ryan Gosling. We aren't really much closer to getting to the heart of this character come the end of the film, but I really liked that. He was an enigma that I was constantly trying to figure out. This was hard as there wasn't much dialogue, and Ryan's performance had a lot going on beneath the surface, which was great to watch.Carey Mulligan was also great. Yet again a complex character who we hard to work to figure out. Then there were some fantastic supporting performances from the likes of Bryan Cranston, Ron Pearlman and Oscar Isaac.What I loved most about Drive though was the style. It had such a great vibe to it. The direction was spot on, the score complimented and contributed to the mood of the film perfectly, and the cinematography was on point.Put all of this together and you get a very accomplished, moody, gritty and stylish thriller.",Drive
154,MovieCriticOnline,For sure worth seeing..... but,7,1 March 2019,"I would definitely recommend it, especially for the performances. The stand out is Albert Brooks. He was and always is amazing. I normally don't like Ron Pearlman, but he did well here.My only criticism is that it is a little slow at times and relies a little too much on tone. I.e. Music driving scenes, rather than cutting down and getting to the point quicker.Overall I think a good 15 minutes could have been cut and you would have had an even better film. It's nice to have a moment in a film, but we don't need 30 of them. I refer to the slow-motion moments with music. They lose impact when overdone.Having said that, I still think it was good and much better than a lot of films coming out. Likely one of the best of 2011.",Drive
155,moviemanMA,Just drive.,10,17 September 2011,"Calm, cool, collected. There are a ton of characters who fall under this description, but there are only a handful that stand out above the rest. Rick Blaine in Casablanca. Jef Costello in Le Samourai. Jack from The American. These characters are methodical. They don't lose control easily, but if they do you would never know.It's safe to say that the Driver from Drive can be added to that prestigious list.Drive is the cool, smart, festival favorite of the year helmed by Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson, Valhalla Rising, Pusher). Based on the book by the same name, Drive follows the Driver, played by Ryan Gosling in a tour de force. He's a nameless, mechanic who does a few jobs on the side. Sometimes he's a stunt driver for Hollywood movies. Other times he's a getaway driver. Regardless the setting he works with efficiency and composure.His handler Shannon, played by a fantastic Bryan Cranston, extorts his talents at the shop and with other jobs, but the driver doesn't mind. Shannon is a guy with the best of intentions just trying to get luck back on his side. His problem is associating with gangsters, played by Albert Brooks in a surprisingly nasty performance and Ron Perlman, his nasty partner in crime.The driver, with his tough exterior and cold stare, has one soft spot; his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio. Her husband is currently doing a stretch in prison and the driver takes it upon himself to keep her safe, even when things start to get really ugly.Drive is a samurai type story set in Los Angeles. The driver has morals that he stands by. He doesn't take advantage of people, he isn't concerned with material things, and if you wrong him you better run. Gosling plays the role with a certain grace rarely seen on the big screen. He speaks with his facial expressions. A glance, a twitch resembling a smile. When he does speak you listen. His words are selected carefully. No small talk, just enough to get his point across. He does the rest of the talking with his hands.The rest of the cast does an excellent job. Mulligan continues to shine as well as Breaking Bad's Cranston. Cranston especially had a certain quality about him. The way he carried himself made me feel like he knew exactly who he was playing and what he had been through. It was interesting seeing Brooks in a tough guy role, seeing as he seems to nab the slightly neurotic and always comical characters (Finding Nemo, The In-Laws, Defending Your Life), and Perlman continues his string of rugged performances.Refn's style carries over from his previous films, an impressive feat considering he's used three different cinematographers on his four major films. There's violence when there needs to be, there's an excellent musical selection, and there's fantastic camera work. The angles, the cutaways, all perfect. He manages his action scenes with extreme care. We get an excellent dose of action with character decision and reaction. He doesn't bog us down with a heavy musical score or a plethora of shaky cam cuts. We get nice, smooth shots, showing us the craft of the chase.This film is going to be a slow mover for some viewers. If you're looking for a high octane thrill ride, I would either prepare for a bit of a wait, or go see something else. There's a lot of waiting, but if you can handle the wait it is well worth it. It's more violent and more intense than The American, which might have been the most underrated movie last year, but it shares in that less is more quality.A big win for both Gosling's career and Refn. With his last string of movies Gosling has really stepped up his game. He's more than just a face. This role allowed him to look good and kick some ass, all without taking his shirt off, something a standard Hollywood action flick would require. Expect this film to maintain it's headway heading into award season. I'm basically guaranteeing at least Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor nods, with the possibility of supporting actor nods for Cranston and Brooks. Who knows, it could be a double nod year for Gosling who's co-starring with Clooney in Clooney's The Ides of March.",Drive

158,TaylorYee94,Ryan Gosling can talk with his face.,7,5 February 2021,"Ryan Gosling's acting is... something.. He does not say much, but the audience strangely understands exactly how he feels. What makes him a good actor is his effortlessness, and it is a key to this mysterious and jittery crime movie. He does not have to try hard to be sexy or attractive in front of Irene. He just is by the way he looks at her without talking too much. (Seriously, I can count the number of lines between two protagonists.) He does not have to try too hard to act the Driver. He just IS. The Driver stabs, shoots, almost gets shot, and kills, but Gosling does not overdo it, even with this extreme emotion. It's heck of realistic because people usually react dazed after dramatic incident.On the whole movie, the story is in disarray, too many this and that; the whole story lacks motives and reasons behind crime, poor crime scheme and backstory. One thing good though is tension-building, both the tension before the crime and the tension between the Driver and Irene. Gosling's acting contributes to this because his calmness even under life threatening pressure makes me think there is something bigger to happen. The decreasing volume, slower motion, lighting change before the crime amplifies every sense. Also, the event happens a second earlier/later than at the highest expectation. The director surely know how to play with timing, angle, speed of scenes, and lighting.",Drive
159,socrates99,I didn't know what they meant when they said Gosling hit it out of the park,9,1 October 2011,"But it doesn't take long to agree completely. I hadn't really enjoyed his roles until now. This one features a very low key guy most male viewers will admire as coming from the cool guy side of the movies. What's surprising is that Gosling gave no inkling, to me anyway, that he could handle or seem appropriate for this kind of role. And that makes the fact that someone did see it in him, almost as impressive as his performance. But enough of that. You'll form your own opinion, I'm sure. Let's just say you'll have fun doing so especially since this is not a role that tries for something that couldn't actually be.Another surprise for me was the direction in this film. I haven't seen this kind of treatment in a long time. It's reminiscent of spaghetti westerns but really it's its own style. I especially liked the sense of being in the main character's car and this director's sense of timing. All, like a spaghetti western, enhanced by well selected music.There's violence, more than I expected, but nothing that I can't believe could actually happen given the story. However, this might turn off female viewers in particular, as it did my wife's friend. And it's why the film is rated R.There are a couple of small points I could quibble about but I thoroughly enjoyed myself, so enough said.",Drive
160,LloydBayer,Gosling leads the third generation of serious Hollywood talent.,8,2 February 2012,"Something about Ryan Gosling caught my eye when I first saw him in ""Murder by Numbers"". Opposite Sandra Bullock, I was heavily mistaken for underestimating this relatively new actor. After ""Fracture"", Gosling had my full attention. Not only did he refuse to be outdone by the legendary Anthony Hopkins, Gosling vindicated his star power as an up and coming actor with some serious screen charisma. With ""Drive"", Gosling smashes it out of the park. The best part? He doesn't even say much in the movie but gets it done through sheer screen presence. Adapted from a short story of the same name, Gosling plays a nameless Hollywood stunt car driver and mechanic, who also moonlights as a getaway car driver. As the getaway driver, his rules are simple: burglars must finish the job within a five minute window and never contact him for another heist. After helping his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her young son, with car trouble, The Driver starts to spend time with them. Just when an air of attraction develops between The Driver and Irene, her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac), is released from prison. From here on, things turn ugly for everyone. Standard owes mobsters money for protection during his time in prison. The Driver helps Standard in what should be an easy 'in-out' heist, but the job is a setup and our hero ends up running the gauntlet with mobsters Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman). There are three names that I think deserve high praise for this movie. Aside from Gosling, director Nicolas Winding Refn does a phenomenal job with almost every aspect of this film. There are flaws, some factual and some due to obvious oversight in editing, but in giving Refn the benefit of the doubt, on a whole this movie is one fine piece of work. What works for Refn is the mood he creates when setting up a brooding atmosphere, along with the 1970s period setting. This is the result of seamlessly integrating an exceptional score by Cliff Martinez with intentionally mute moments. Evidently, Refn also pays attention to cinematography that focuses on a first-person perspective, literally putting the viewer in the driver's seat. Even so, you get a feel of the world surrounding The Driver, but his past always remains a mystery. It is this mysterious past, complimented with a haunting atmosphere that gives The Driver an almost super-human personality. Towards the end, this personality makes him appear unstoppable as a man on a mission. Coming back to characterization, and as I said before, Gosling owns it. He fits snug behind the skin of his character in a way that dates back to the days of a younger and angrier Clint Eastwood. I am not placing Gosling on par with the legend that is Eastwood; rather that Gosling's characterization of an anti-hero is memorable and justifies comparison to the likes of Eastwood, or even Robert De Niro for that matter. When it comes to Mulligan and Gosling in the same frame, the atmosphere shifts to a whole new level arising from just flirtatious eye contact. There is a definite yet restrained sensuality between both characters and even for the few muted scenes they are together, on-screen chemistry is obvious. Another worthy mention is Brooks as the cynical antagonist with a thing for blades. Incidentally, Brooks does it better than Perlman, where both play mafia foot soldiers. I recommend this as a must watch for its style, story, portrayals and artistic visuals. The narration flows at a steady pace but gradually picks up momentum towards the end and includes some scenes of extreme violence when you least expect it. Thankfully, Refn doesn't dwell too long on scenes of blood and gore.",Drive
161,diac228,A Multi-Layered Abuse to the Film Industry,1,19 September 2011,"So I walked out of the movie Drive. This is the first time I've ever done such a thing. I've seen a lot of bad movies in my day but there has never been one that infuriated me to a point in which I couldn't continue. And being a film lover, I sat down and analyzed just why exactly this movie ticked me off so much. What was it about this movie that drove me up the wall to a point in which I walked out before I even got to see the conclusion? It wasn't the acting. It wasn't the music. And it wasn't the lush cinematography. What irked me the most was that Drive was disguising itself as an indie flick when in actuality it wanted to become an action movie so badly.And this strategy while an insult to the entire institution of filmmaking, worked. It got rave reviews at film festivals here and there and got nice reviews from critics, lavishing the acting, supposed tension, and cinematography. I watch this movie because of the rave reviews and literally saw the Transporter movie wrapped in an indie flavor, nothing more. The first half, where we supposedly see ""character development,"" consists of characters engaging in extremely minimal small talk and the rest of the time just staring at each other. I am not kidding. After the tense opening which reveals our main character's secret job (which is familiar to the opening of Transporter), we get nothing for about 40 minutes. Except a lot of pointless scenes.Drive is about a very good stuntman that doubles as a secret driver at night (Ryan Gosling) who silently falls for his new neighbor (Carey Mulligan) while at the same time gets mixed up in a mob scene (which loosely is a Transporter plot). The first half has all the development, only in the second half is when we see all the action and driving you've been observing in the previews. Based off a novel of the same name, the script must have been easy to write, because it barely has any dialogue while the story is pretty much a mashup of Tarantino-like violence with Transporter-like symptoms.The movie is so inconsistent, and amongst the small pieces that don't fit together they are all sparkles of what we've seen before—and what we've seen before has all been superior. The supposed amazing chase sequences? Bourne and Ronin does them better----and to a similar budget extent, The Transporter. The supposed amazing violent tension? I can name dozens of movies that do it better. And the extreme violence that is inconsistent with the theme, tone, pace, and characterization of the first half of this slum? Of course, while it doesn't quite match the plot it's been perfected years upon years ago by Tarantino and even to an extent Robert Rodriguez.But another big reason why I dislike this film so much is because with Drive, we've seen it all before, and yet the critics will not point this out—or choose to avoid it. We've seen these types of movies before (quiet men that has their actions do all the talking), we've seen this type of ultra-action before, and we've seen these stupid attempts at conflicting and blending genres far too many times in the indie and mainstream scene. Drive was originally billed as blockbuster during development so what do they do? Hide the fact that it's the clichéd low-caliber blockbuster that's trying so hard to be a European Tarantino hybrid. They trimmed the dialogue, screen time, and for the Cannes Film Festival nixed the action billing and called it an independent film. They literally were changing the packaging and tone of the movie based off of box office numbers. That's disgusting. They were trying to sway the critics by changing the entire genre.Bottom Line: Drive, you are a pathetic, pointless, stupid, trite, slow, muggy, grudgy, tasteless, senseless, disposable, forgettable movie with abysmal pacing, abysmal writing, and no sense of direction whatsoever from the first second to the last second I watched before deciding to walk away. You don't know what movie you want to become, as you literally spit yourself through at least three different genres that actually repeal each other like a magnet. You barely clock in at 100 minutes, yet it felt like two hours the first half in. I will not blame the acting, for they had next to nothing to work with. I will not blame the cinematography, which wasn't bad either. I will blame the fact that your crew decided to pretend like your movie was artsy, underground, and indie, when in actuality your movie is this ultraviolent action movie that rears its ugly head long after the audience has fallen asleep through the numbing first half.Your movie sucks.Bad.",Drive

163,rooee,Drive on,3,24 September 2011,"Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn's Bronson was an attempt to do something strange which came across as depressingly ordinary, whereas his latest – starring a stolid Ryan Gosling as the nameless ""Driver"", and Carey Mulligan as his angelic neighbour, Irene – seems to be something very ordinary made quite strange, mostly through the use of slo-mo in the emotional bits as much as the action.There isn't all that much action. Certainly very few car chases. When it hits, the violence hits hard, but it's all mired in long stretches punctuated by wordless glances, pregnant with nothing but beauty and elegant framing. It's like some crawling period drama for angrily repressive mechanics. Thankfully it is accompanied by Cliff Martinez's delicious ambient score, so you could just close your eyes.The plot is first-rate ""meh"": a one-last-job affair with sexless damsel-in-distress underclothes. The Driver gives his clients a strict five-minute window (the reason for which, even after he's explained it twice, is never entirely clear), before he bails out – but five minutes is all he needs. He doesn't carry a gun; he'd prefer to force-feed his enemies bullets.We know that Driver is our hero because he's the only man who doesn't shout all the time. Bernie (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman) are particularly perturbed. Their over-the-counter barneys are strongly reminiscent of those Grand Theft Auto cut scenes we tend to skip. In fact, the whole italicised neon credits thing and the 80s-esque synth score is pure Vice City, except without the fun.At least Mad Max had a reason to be mad. From where does Driver's psychotic streak stem? Valhalla Rising suggested that Refn positions man's capacity for violence somewhere deep in his soul, so I guess a backstory isn't necessary. Bryan Cranston puts on a good show as the half-crippled Shannon, who might as well have an enormous glowing target on his forehead.Comparisons with Michael Mann are inevitable, particularly the neo-noir nightmarescape of Manhunter, and the homoeroticism of Heat. Difference is, in both cases Mann was shooting a screenplay of quality and distinction. Drive, by comparison, is about as distinct as a cigarette flicked from a passing car.",Drive

And of all the reviews I've read and watched, 95% of them said the movie was a masterpiece, not just good, but a phenomenal film. It has a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, and a 8.1 on IMDb (Number 204 on IMDb's top 100.) So when I was done watching it, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.Really my big problem was that I really didn't care for Ryan Gosling's character, at least near the beginning. I think the only reason I actually cared about weather he died or not was because he was helping out this family (which we will get to later). This movie is about an hour and a half, and the first half hour of this film is extremely boring. The first car chase wasn't that impressive because they really hadn't established anything except that we were watching robbers, so why should we be rooting for them? A lot of the characters I completely forgot were in the film, like the bald guy, seems he was the guy in both the strip club, and the diner when he, well, if you've seen the movie you know what happens to him. At times the movie seems kind of pretentious, like their trying way to hard to make it artsy. I swear there were several points in the movie where I though I paused the film, it seems the director told the actors to just not move a muscle for no reason. And for a movie called Drive their aren't many driving scenes.Now let's get onto the good stuff, I LOVED, the family, I really cared about them, I thought I would hate the father who just got out of prison, but when we find out that he is basically being screwed by the mafia, I felt sorry for him. And Irene and Benicio are so likable that they make up for the main character's flaws. The acting is great, I wouldn't mind if this film won some acting awards. Despite some scenes being about nothing the direction and cinematography were great, no shaky cam. The two driving scenes that aren't the first one are pretty entertaining, and I actually gasped a few times. People die in this movie, and I actually felt kind of sad for them. And the gore effects are great, the elevator scene will make any gore hungry nut very happy. And the villains were pretty cool too, not amazing, but I was waiting for them to die.Overall Drive is not an outstanding movie, at least not to me. Richard Roeper and Peter Travers named it the best movie of 2011. While it may be one of the better films I've seen, it didn't even make it into my top 10 favorites. I had more fun with Transformers, Final Destination and Rio, even if they are worse films. Drive is a good film, I did like it, but I didn't love it and I hope that everyone will respect my opinion.",Drive
165,cat_ranchero,Quite brilliant!...,9,5 June 2012,"An interesting mix of tunes and the back streets of LA form a rather interesting backdrop to this tale. Nicely made with a few nice stunts thrown in for good measure (well there had to be really, didn't there).A very slow paced film, almost noir in the look and feel to it, the tension slowly builds. There are, at times, some scenes of extreme violence that are by no means out of place here. One scene in an elevator (if you've seen it, you'll know which one I mean) is an almost perfect moment of cinema. No dialogue, just a perfect scene (IMO). I did have just one gripe though, and that was the casting of Carey Mulligan; I couldn't get my head around how someone like her could end up with the guy she was with. Or maybe I'm just reading it wrong, I don't know. But other than that it's quite an eye-opening film and one I have no problem in deeming HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.1/10IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (based on 185,406 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 79/100: (Based on 40 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 92/100 (based on 225 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 78/100 'Liked it' (based on 72,813 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Drive

168,markgorman,Ultra violence with exquisite style.,8,5 October 2011,"I've managed to miss every single one of director Nicolas Winding Refn's previous movies (Bronson being perhaps the best known) and typically his scores are mediocre on IMDb, which suggests his perchance for violence (he cites Texas Chainsaw Massacre as an influence) has divided his audiences to date.Not so in this one.At the time of writing Drive is recording a whopping 8.4 on the movie bible score meter.And with justice.Refn now sports a Cannes Best Director gong on his mantlepiece and it feels justified because this movie has been crafted to within an inch of its life. This is a real director's labour of love; from The Michael Mannesque, super saturated, ultra crisp LA at night cinematography to the uber mannered acting, fantastic casting, sparse as Ebeneezer Scrooge's pantry script (he wrote it) and ASTONISHING soundtrack (surely the Oscar winner already ).It's languid, propped up be very little dialogue but driven by the aforementioned score that oozes class, from the opening and closing songs to the underscore by Cliff Martinez that builds tension relentlessly. It's a tribute to the 80's with echoes of Moroder, Kraftwerk, Eno, early Human League and more recently My Bloody Valentine and Mogwai. Astounding. That gets a straight ten in my book.But of course that's not what everyone's talking about.They're talking about Ryan Gosling as the unnamed, unblinking, unflinching eponymous driver.Ryan Gosling is amazing in this movie and while there are brilliant supporting roles from the touchingly understated Carey Mulligan as the love interest, Albert Brooks (nasty as the lead baddie with a tiny little bit of a heart) and Ron Perlman (neanderthal, wicket, compelling...gorgeous in a way) it's Gosling all the way. The performance of his career surely (great as he was in Blue Valentine, and I've not seen him in the much lauded Ides of March yet, but I will) he commands the screen with not a blink of his eye from start till end, well actually at the end there is a wee blink. This is a tour de force performance and I loved it.The violence is excellent. Slow to come to the boil but shocking and visceral upon arrival.The driving is not overdone. Chase movies (except Ronan) are so tedious.The love story is well developed but never gets in the way.And the moral? Heroes come in all shapes and forms because this is surely a hero movie wrapped up in a complex web of antiheroes.Very strongly recommended. 8.5 out of 10.",Drive
169,HelenMary,"quiet, slick and smouldering",8,7 June 2012,"This film is brilliant. It's quiet, powerful, dark, slick and really understated, not coming across as a massive blockbuster. Gosling, yet again, smoulders - he really is an incredible actor. Not much dialogue but the quietness and minimalism of the Direction, is brilliant. A bit gory, but it's all so well done and not excessive. Something you could watch again and again for the atmospherics alone. Bryan Cranston was good (always), and the soundtrack rather mellow to contrast what is on the screen. Cliffhanger ending, love it. If you insist on your films having special effects, prattle, flashes and bangs and whistles, don't bother. Sexy. The elevator scene... Woh! 8/10",Drive
170,krachtm,"Tarantino, Mann, and ostentatious 1980s references",7,26 March 2013,"The plot: A getaway driver gets involved in the lives of his next door neighbors, when they run afoul of mobsters.I'm a big fan of Refn's Pusher trilogy, but this film failed to live to the enormous hype. I'm a fan of minimalism, art house films, exploitation films, and electronic music, but there was something that was just off about this movie. To some extent, I think it's because it was constantly reminding me of Michael Mann and Quentin Tarantino.It was moody, atmospheric, and just as violent and nihilistic as I was expecting, given that it's a Refn movie. No complaints there. I was also impressed with how much Refn accomplished, given the minimalist style. There's very little dialogue, and almost none of it comes from the protagonist. He seems to communicate almost entirely through nonverbal cues. However, the story just didn't really grab me. It's easier for me to get behind a minimalist story like Halloween (disturbed man tries to kill his sister), Assault on Precinct 13 (crooks siege a precinct), or The Thing (monster hunts down researchers), because they're properly minimalist. John Carpenter knows how to prune down a script to just the barest essentials until there's absolutely nothing left but the high concept pitch he used to sell it. When it comes to Drive, it seems like Refn wants to have his cake and eat it, too. It's got complex neo-noir elements mixed in with the minimalist style, and I'm left wondering why he didn't just commit one way or the other.Maybe with repeat viewings I'll come to appreciate it like all the raving fans. As it stands, I liked it, but I don't think it was the best movie of all time. I don't even think it was Refn's best movie. The Pusher trilogy is what made me a Refn fan, and it seems as though he might be moving away from that style (inspired by Dogme 95).",Drive
171,kgprophet,Great use of Subtlety,8,21 October 2011,"It would be difficult to write about parts of the storyline in this film, because many expectations change when the consequences of one event folds upon another. A terrific original screenplay defies Hollywood conventions of over-the-top plot convolutions and unrealistic twists. Sure, there are a couple coincidences, but there are many rewards for keeping the story simplified and enhance the characters' arcs. The director borrows heavily from Michael Mann in painting a cool atmosphere with glistening city lights at night and a throbbing synthesiser soundtrack. The film elevates itself above any other similar film in it's drama, perhaps better than the character rich film ""The Town"" from 2010. The editing emphasises the main character's withdrawn persona, hiding his emotions (indirectly hinting at his criminal past) while romancing his neighbour. Moments in conversation where a 'normal' person would express their feelings or be more extroverted, are instead tension filled passages of silence that speak louder than words. With great use of subtlety, the film does wonders in terms of depicting the main character's withdrawn mental state, but still visualising his thoughts and intentions without direct exposition.Another accolade must be given to actor Ryan Gosling in the lead role. We the audience must invest time into this character, which the film keeps in the first person narrative, most activities outside of his knowledge are outside of ours. He must show realistic reactions to danger, even though his past is never quite explained. The right emphasis is given to revealing moments of his capabilities, so when he is set in harm's way, we believe he can stand up to the test. The rest of the cast is well heeled in talent, allowing the sense of naturalism to provide the tone. As you may notice in critical reviews, when a film exposes no obvious weaknesses, the positive rating goes up. I myself am having a hard time exposing any weakness in this film, I felt I was in good hands, and was not annoyed by any plot contrivances. I happen to be a fan of Michael Mann, as must the director of this film, and the right homage elements work for me. I think of this perhaps of the antithesis of ""Fast & Furious"". One of the best films I have seen this year, could even get an Oscar nod with the screenplay or editing.",Drive
172,eagandersongil,"Everything is good, nothing is perfect.",8,6 August 2016,"Drive is one of those movies where nothing is perfect but nothing is bad, everything in the movie is good, no highlights, everything is fine encaixadinho, starting with the script that shows you the characters, then with time explores the connection thereof, then puts our protagonist in complicated situations generating changes and surprising despite being somewhat linear, the soundtrack is very good, almost every movie scenes has an incredible tension, even in light scenes, Nicolas Winding Refn brings many oitentistas songs animated in tense situations, remembering a little Tarantino or Scorsese, not to mention its great photography, which is urban passes a reality air and reminds Taxi Drive, including camera angles inside the car reminds me also Taxi Drive, and the film reminded me also the popular game GTA, especially the great opening scene, the first act of the whole movie is amazing, Ryan Gosling is great, he is focused, he's calm he smiles, but he has an almost psychopathic aura, which is proof if just an aura, it is understood the last of our unnamed protagonist, and shows the passion he feels for Irene (Carey Mulligan), all narrative mirrors the film features are great, very smart and surgical, Drive is not perfect, far from it, but it's still a great movie.Forgive my English translator google.",Drive
173,nickmesafilms,"Drive (2011) - My Hands are a Little Dirty! Well, So are Albert Brook's Hands!",9,5 February 2012,"With openly critical acclaim and tons of box office buzz, ""Drive"" is recognized as one of the more artistic motion pictures of the film noir. This is basically an art house movie about a driver who's a Hollywood stunt driver and mechanic during the day, and a criminal getaway driver at night. Ryan Gosling is just terrific playing the solitary driver, and since being a terrific actor, he delivers a dark beauty to this character, and delivers enough charisma and attitude. He was just perfection in this performance. He then falls in love for his neighbor, portrayed by Carey Mulligan, whose husband returns from jail, and tries to help him with a heist that later goes wrong. The movie then falls into sharp consequences between serious criminals who want something more than money. This falls into a bloody and intense thriller that just keeps going and going. Yes, there are depressing long scenes with no dialogue, and the movie does start at a slow pace, and Hossein Amini's well-written script wasn't really that much of a big deal, but ""Drive"" is still one of the most entertaining movies of the previous year. Director Nicolas Winding-Refn perfectly makes a movie filled with intense bloody sequences, top-notch action, an interesting plot, and well-made character development. I couldn't have asked for more. Aside from Gosling and Mulligan, the rest of the brilliant casting ensemble includes Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks, Ron Perlman, Oscar Isaac, and Albert Brooks in a scene-stealing performance as a former movie producer, now a vicious villain. I just wish that the Oscars never snubbed Brooks, because he should have deserved a Best Supporting Actor nomination. The soundtrack is wonderful, the score is breathtaking, the editing is superb, the cinematography is scene-stealing, the directing is top-notch, and the cast is just wonderful. Everything brilliant about this movie makes you wonder where that 100-minute running time has gone. This is a brilliant art house film for true movie lovers out there. Go watch this movie, if you want to see Ryan Gosling behind the wheel. If you don't see this movie, just don't make me bring the hammer. ""Drive"", in my review, ""a beautifully well-made thriller for the ages"".",Drive
174,dvc5159,The lone hero rides again,7,8 October 2011,"In a time where explosions and CGI dominate the American box-office, we are grateful to have at least one film this year that challenges the clichés and brings it to a style of its own.That movie is ""Drive"", which for my money is a beautifully structured and extremely well-crafted film.For anyone with doubts over whether Ryan Gosling can be a tough guy - the film blows away any doubts of that. Gosling is superb here as the nameless Driver, as his hero character is the perfect lone hero - a stranger who talks only when he needs too, who can exploit whatever he can however he can, and who never loses his cool no matter the odds - his stoic face hiding his emotions and determination. This silent hero is not too uncommon from Clint Eastwood's ""Man with no Name"", or lately George Clooney in ""The American"", but get him mad and the rage flies off from the screen and towards the audience - and he doesn't even do it shouting obscenities or other ""heroic"" rage clichés. He's emotionless and speechless, and that makes him an even more dangerous, unpredictable, and (for lack of a better word) cool character.As for the rest of the supporting cast, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston and Oscar Isaac provide emotional balance to Gosling's calm performance, and Albert Brooks surprisingly sheds his comic image to become a brutal character to great effect. Ron Perlman and Christina Hendricks' appearances are somewhat brief, but they are still very good in their roles.""Drive"" is not exactly original. We've seen this ""heist-gone-wrong"" story millions of times in Hollywood and other countries. But you can still make a great movie out of an overused story if you do it well, and ""Drive"" does exactly that, and more. Director Nicolas Winding Refn's calm and focused touch gives the film a very old-school ""noir"" feel that exudes a dark and sombre atmosphere throughout the film - like it came straight out of the 1970's (what with the gritty, sombre thrillers that came out during that era). He also controls his actors wisely, and the action sequences are grounded in reality and unpredictability, making it even more exciting and gripping to watch. Hossein Amini's script also fleshes out the characters well, showing that when they talk less they reveal more. It's these long pauses between conversations that makes a character, so the many instances of silence between Gosling and other characters showcases the best of his acting ability. Amini also is no stranger to old-fashioned thrillers, having already penned the nostalgic ""Shanghai"" years ago - here he shows that he may be the screenwriter which can revive the noir genre.The violence in the movie is bloody, unpredictable and somewhat raw. Moments of silence are shattered with gunshots or the revving of the car engines. The car chases in particular are brief, but they reminisce the good old days of solid car chase movies like ""Bullitt"" and ""The French Connection"". No CGI and no studio back-lot, no annoying music in the background, no shaking camera and no quick-cut editing - its old fashioned and that's the way I like it.""Drive"" is gorgeous to watch. Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography is sublime and crisp, painting Los Angeles in a bright orange tone during the day and drifting shadows and light during the night. Especially in the car scenes when the lights and shadows go past Gosling's eyes and the scene in the elevator with Gosling and Mulligan. His work along with Cliff Martinez's very transcendent and ambient electronic score, combining with Refn's direction and Gosling's mysterious atmosphere all contribute to the hypnotic atmosphere of the film. That, and the film's retro soundtrack makes for a very mesmerizing movie to watch. The film is edited nicely in a slow but moving and intriguing pace that makes one concentrate on a subject all the way without having to experience quick cuts all the time like some Michael Bay popcorn flick.""Drive"" respects the audience and it makes them focus on the story and characters instead of the style that it is being presented upon. It makes you feel the film, and that's something that I don't experience often - you become engrossed in the characters' world and start caring for them instead of just awaiting the next big action scene.In short, ""Drive"" is a great film. It's may be unoriginal in plot but it's beautifully crafted with class, respect and care by Refn, Amini, Gosling, Martinez, Sigel, and everyone else involved. It's old-school noir and it's a sign that the classic style of film-making is coming back. This is one mean muscle car of a movie.Overall rating: 85/100",Drive
175,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Pop rocks and bloody gloves.,7,25 September 2011,"There's not much to say that hasn't been said a thousand times already. Pop rocks and bloody gloves. From the second the film started I was sucked into the visual style that Nicolas Winding Refn had injected it with, and once the credits began I was convinced the film wasn't going to disappoint. The movie opens with a heist and it's an impressive show of palpable intensity, where Refn gets us to care about this guy that we just met and has yet to say a word. Ryan Gosling sitting silent in the car, the only noise being a police radio in the car detailing the scenario as it plays out without us, it was such an effective technique and immediately draws you in. In this day and age, it's hard to really get taken away by a film, but this one does just that. It takes you to another place and keeps you there for the duration.Another thing that films generally fail to do currently is make you understand the gravity of violence. It's so common-place and jazzed up in film that it's just expected at this point. Drive is one of the more violent films I've seen recently, but it does the exact opposite; it makes you feel every drop of blood that hits the pavement. With a Cronenberg-like approach to it, very in your face and blunt with no musical score backing it up, every scene of violence becomes gripping and brutal. In fact, the moments of graphic violence are the least stylized ones in the picture. With his cool, ferocious stare Gosling really packs them with a punch.I know the main complaint for the film is that the characters aren't very well-developed, but I don't see that so much. Yeah, we don't get a lot of surface development for them, but I think the actors do a magnificent job of really playing who these people are underneath the surface. Driver is that loner who falls into love and it changes his whole life. Irene (played with lovely grace by Carey Mulligan) is the woman who got married and had a kid too young and is getting a taste of the kind of high school crush that makes her feel free and alive again. Shannon (played with surprising vulnerability by Bryan Cranston) is the guy who has been dragged through the mud his whole life, no matter how much hard work he puts in to stop it. The cast is loaded with remarkably talented actors and they all do a fantastic job of bringing what was underneath the surface to our attention.They make these peoples real while Refn creates this vintage, bubble gum on a blood-stained boot sensation that pours through every scene. Gosling's suave exterior is hiding a very enraged, borderline psychotic man hiding just underneath. Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks are an excellent yin and yang of the criminal world, the former being loud and violent while the other is soft and visceral. The soundtrack is one of the best in quite a while, perfectly capturing the tone that Refn sets to achieve and making the whole thing so vibrant and alive. This is one of those films where everything just pulls itself together so well and vibes without a crack in the shell, bringing you into it's unique world and taking you on a wild journey that will stick with you. There are so many memorable scenes and I had to grab the soundtrack the moment it was over.",Drive
176,jackasstrange,Classy style over substance,8,2 January 2014,"I really wanted to like 'Drive'. Really. It has almost all the aspects i appreciate in a film. Good art direction, contemporary, and mostly in the night, with a great soundtrack based on electro-music with a retro touch on it. There is some kind of nostalgic feeling, in fact, in the soundtrack of drive. Looks like something made in the 80s despite being very actual and pursuing actual electro beats. I would say its sorta annoying in the first watch, but then, trust me, with a re-watch, it gets a lot better.But the plot is very straight to face. There is no subtly or depth to the characters. It don't makes people think. Is like a generic hero fairy tail, which in fact, i despise. And once is over, you don't need to return there, not for the story at least.Also, the characters are way one-dimensional, there is the good, the bad, the girl, all painted in black and white. Apart from the driver, which is obviously supposed to be a very ambiguous character, the rest are the classic 'sympathize or despise' kind of characters. I wouldn't say its predictable or something. And though i liked the fact it somewhat contrasts the peaceful scenes with the voracious and violent scenes, i thought the violence was very very harsh and excessive. Unless if that was the director main intention, so he could 'show the violence like it really is, ugly and shocking', so i say bravo, but i'm afraid he just likes to use the gore for 'fetishist' purposes. Pity, unfortunately.In the end, it is worth check it out, but there is nothing so special about it. 7.8/10",Drive
177,x_manicure_x,Sometimes style can be enough,8,14 August 2021,"""Drive"" is a contemplative but somehow concise film that limits the chitchat to the absolute minimum and lets the images talk instead. Every frame, every line is carefully thought to be functional to the story. The relaxed pacing and hypnotic retro aesthetics lull the audience only to suddenly wake them up with bursts of graphic violence. The structure reflects Ryan Gosling's character: a solitary and taciturn figure who acts quiet and distant, but at the same time doesn't mind resorting to violence when needed. The character is partly inspired by Walter Hill's ""The Driver"", a getaway driver who also happens to have no name or known background. He looks like some kind of western outlaw hero at first, but eventually doesn't seem to follow a clear moral code. He might just be a crazed misfit who happened to have enjoyed the pleasures of human contact for once. For some reason I am not a big fan of Gosling's acting, but his performance grows on you as the film goes by.Cinematographically elegant and sophisticated and backed up by an undeniably chic synth-pop soundtrack, ""Drive"" became one of the films that dictated the trend for independent filmmakers of this generation. It's also Nicolas Winding Refn's most appreciated film as, unlike his later work, manages to be formally impeccable without lacking substance. Much more entertaining and than I remembered.",Drive
178,GeorgeRoots,A Contemporary 1980's Throwback That Is Awesome.,9,11 August 2014,"Few mainstream movies manage to capture the ""Midnight Movie"" experience anymore, let alone throw back to some idioms that were well established in the 1970's & 1980's. ""Drive"" is a fantastic movie that stands well on it's own two feet. Without directly saying it there feels plenty of influence to take from it's imagery, most notably Steve McQueen's ""Bullitt"" (1968), and Walter Hill's ""The Driver"" (1978). The opening scenes set the style of the movie perfectly, accompanied by a fantastic font choice and possibly 2012's most stellar movie soundtrack (Props to former Red Hot Chili drummer, Cliff Martinez).Having read the original novel by James Sallis, I can confidently say it deviates from the original source material slightly without effecting it's overall premise. For the movie they incorporate some romantic interest subplot that never felt right to me, but lends itself to incorporate some stellar shots of both of them together. It's beautiful cinematography, but personally I never felt all too engaged by it (Except for the ""Elevator"" scene).What is engaging however, is Ryan Gosling's performance as ""The Driver"". I love the fact that both the movie and book never use a name, as it all builds some kind of mythic aspect like Clint Eastwood's ""Man With No Name"". Carrey Mulligan is charming what little screen time she has, and the same goes for Christina Hendricks, Bryan Cranston and Ron Pearlman. All are heavy hitters that again do well with what they have, but without doubt Albert Brooks performance as Bernie Rose is both subtle and brilliant. How that man did not win an Oscar, let alone not get nominated is beyond me.If there's anything more to say about ""Drive"", it's that I'm very glad it circulated many festivals before (I think) a limited film release. In this day and age where common audience members expect to have emotions and feelings fed to you through tedious dialogue, ""Drive"" is all the more impressive for not having to directly address that when it clearly shows up on the screen. I would also normally hate that in a modern movie, but the execution in ""Drive"" speaks volumes and makes it all more than bearable. Making me somewhat a little more optimistic should we see more of it.Final Verdict: Props to Nicolas Winding Refn for making a great movie. Definitely one of the best from 2011, and I very much recommend it. 9/10.",Drive
179,bix171,An Actor's Movie,8,16 February 2014,"Ryan Gosling continues to develop as one of our better leading actors and while his performance here doesn't break any ground, his portrayal of a part-time stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver is the kind of stoic, intense role that audiences have come to identify as particularly American. The Danish director, Nicolas Winding Refn, seems to understand this and builds his L.A. noir around Gosling's combination of silent menace and vulnerability, which contributes to the delicious tension that forms almost immediately and which frequently explodes in well-filmed car chases and paralyzing ultra-violence (images, while well-edited by Newton Thomas Sigel, that are not for the faint of heart). Fine supporting performances by Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Oscar Isaac and Ron Perlman also add to the quality flavor of the film; but it's Albert Brooks, playing against type as a brutal yet agreeable gangster, who continues to astonish, adding yet another layer of complexity to his diverse film repertoire and making him one of the greatest hidden assets Hollywood has to offer.",Drive
180,webmaster-3017,HK Neo Reviews: Drive,7,22 November 2011,"The only reason I watched this film at the cinemas, is because it won Best Director at my favourite film festival at Cannes. In fact, Drive is by no means an outright good film, as the opening 20 minutes is quite simply a bore fest. Fortunately, this is the kind of film that finishes strongly and even saying that, this is clearly an understatement. Drive finished with a blast of a big bang! Ryan Gosling is one of the best and versatile actors in Hollywood today and once again he does not disappoint. In the role of a soul-less driver who simply drives for a living, Gosling is able to portray a character in a middle of a dilemma when he meets next-door neighbour, played by the uniquely talented face of Carey Mulligan. The film really do pick up from the 30 minute mark and never stops from there. The killings and bloodbath goes from soft-core to eventually hardcore. The scene at the lifts, allows Gosling to release his emotions by continuously bashing the victim with great effect. All in all, Drive may not be worthy of the hype nor the Cannes Award, but it is certainly without doubt, one of the strangest, unique, yet good movie experience of the year. In fact, if you can get past the opening bore-fest, you will be pleasantly rewarded Neo rates it 7.5/10.www.thehkneo.com",Drive

A hard look and a slight expression is all that's needed to sway ours and Mulligan's affection. Drive's dialogue is compact, only making a show when the mise-en-scene needs a small boost.

2. The silence and stillness of the film helps to harden the impact of the violence, as not only has the silence and stillness been violently disturbed, but the aforementioned force you to dwell on said violence.
3. The scene of Driver, Irene and Benicio (Kaden Leos) driving together is utterly beautiful to watch, and a succinct glimpse into the life Driver strives for.
4. The action film's inversed atmosphere of being calm, quiet and meek, is amazingly executed.
5. The gore looks spectacular as it's really brutal and unforgiving, and it serves up some truly memorable moments.
6. The cinematography is stunning with the still and wide shots adding so much ethereal beauty to the movie.
7. The symbolism of Drivers' scorpion jacket, wherein no matter how hard he tries Driver just cannot suppress his violent nature, is great.
8. The score and soundtrack are gorgeous, with the 80's synth-like soundtrack, in particular, lathering the film in a paradoxical light-hearted and soft tone.
9. The usage of the lighting to produce the intended emotions is phenomenal.Cons:
1. There are a couple continuity errors.
2. The action dialogue is a little clunky at times.",Drive
184,squirrel_burst,Unforgettably stylish,10,7 February 2015,"""Drive"" is a very well shot, incredibly acted action thriller that also works as a quiet drama and character piece. It's the story of a guy (Ryan Gosling) that's so obsessed with driving that he is almost a robot. He works at a garage during the day and does side jobs doing car stunts for movies. He moonlights as a getaway driver with a specific set of rules. As long as you abide by them, you'll get away every time. His existence is basically meaningless until he meets an attractive neighbor (Carrey Mulligan) and her son. When her boyfriend is released from jail, our protagonist is roped into a robbery that goes horribly wrong.As the film begins, it's quiet and methodical, building up the characters and slowly setting up the story for the one event that will change everything. While the setup is happening, you'll get to see the quiet, subtle performance by Ryan Gosling and even though you never really get to know him very well, you do get attached to his character. His character grows and the chemistry between him and Carey Mulligan is so good you forget that there is a thriller/action element that is lurking just beneath the surface. When the film changes gears and goes into the darker route, it's incredibly violent and tense. There are scenes that are dead quiet and you'll be scared to see what comes next but your eyes will be glued to the screen. Throw in an excellent soundtrack, combined with excellent performances from everyone and a smart script and you have a quiet thriller that really builds to a satisfying end. If you find that ""Drive"" starts off a bit slow for your taste, stick with it and by the end, you'll have forgotten about any faults you found at first because you'll be on the edge of your seat.

185,Ryan_MYeah,A nail biter of a thriller. Gosling and Refn knock it out of the park.,10,7 October 2011,"I recently lent my attention to Drive, an art-house thriller from director Nicolas Winding Refn. And yes, in case you were wondering, it really is that good. Drive is outstanding.Ryan Gosling plays Driver (His real name is never revealed in the film), a man who works as a car mechanic and Hollywood stunt driver by day, but by night, moonlights as a getaway guy. He gives his clients a five minute window, and carries no weapons. ""I drive"" as he puts it. Across the hall from him is that of Irene (Played by Carey Mulligan), and her young son, leading him to help them out, and forcing him to suppress feelings he's developed for Irene. But Irene's husband (Played by Oscar Isaac) is released from prison, and sought after by criminals who force him to complete one last job for them, enlisting Driver's help, and sending everything afterward into a spiral.Let me say this: There's a reason that Refn won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival. Obviously, what he does with actors and story building is quite strong, but the atmosphere and ambient sounds do just as much storytelling as the former two do. He paints a violent, chilling portrait that places an emphasis on tension, and even the sense of paranoia. He does this, along with the lens of DP Newton Thomas Siegel, the interesting cuts and dissolves of editor Mat Newman, and particularly well staged driving sequences, to involve the audience as much as he is involved, none more attention grabbing than a very well handled scene in an elevator.As for the story, - adapted from the James Sallis book - it's also an essential to the mood. Something in the film is always up, something always feels off. Whether it's the action of a character looking over their shoulder, or a bit of improvisation of one actor to keep another on edge and at the ready, the actions feel legitimate.Ryan Gosling gives a no holds barred performance as Driver. His quiet expressions give off a deceptive, perplexing facade to something that's boiling with emotion. Emotion is there, it's just not incredibly obvious. The penetrating glimpse of Gosling's eyes and what his character must be thinking conveys a very fascinating side of him that you might not expect.It's also worth nothing the rest of the cast. Carey Mulligan shines as Irene, as well as flawlessly hiding her British accent. Bryan Cranston, as Driver's mentor, manages to get a sense of warmth across. Oscar Isaac and Ron Perlman do well with their supporting roles, while Christina Hendricks achieves solidity with her small cameo. But let's not forget Albert Brooks, cast as far away from type as humanly possible as crime boss, Bernie Rose. His subtle stance manages to hide a darkly intimidating persona chilling enough to make yours truly gulp.All this praise aside, Drive can be polarizing. Either you'll love it in a big way, or you'll probably be turned off by a lot of it. As for me, I'll be looking forward to giving the film a couple more looks.As expected since the start, I'm giving Drive **** out of ****",Drive
186,luke-a-mcgowan,"Awful first half, awesome second half",6,11 September 2015,"For a movie to have a 1 hour and 40 minute run time where the plot doesn't kick in until the 50 minute mark or so is always grating on me. Its even more grating for the film Drive, which has an awesome plot crammed into its second half, forcing me to sit through nearly an hour of Ryan Gosling Looking Intently At Things.There's not much to be said for the first half. Boy meets girl, boy meets girls' son, they all bond and he grows attached to them. Given the ease in which this happens, you'd think that this might have happened at least one or two times in the past. Drive is way too coy trying to conceal the Driver's name - Bryan Cranston's Shannon calls him ""kid"", and everyone else seems to get by saying ""hey"" or ""you"". It found it irritating after a while, rather than mysterious, and I was nearly shouting at Mulligan's/Isaac's/Brooks' characters ""YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE MAN'S NAME WHY ARE YOU TRUSTING HIM"".Gosling stares a lot in the first 50 minutes, but in the second act he shows a lot more acting talent. He's cool and collected behind the wheel, but there's also emotion keyed to a fever pitch in later scenes. I sometimes wish Hollywood would stop trying to make Ryan Gosling happen and leave him in romcoms, but I can't deny he's got talent. In Drive's stellar supporting cast is the incredible Oscar Isaac, who moulds the jealous husband character into something novel and keeps showing the incredible depth that makes him one of the greatest actors of his generation. Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks also hugely impress as a pair of Jewish mobsters - Brooks in particular is amazing. Bernie Rose is ruthless but surprisingly honest. A pivotal scene with a razor blade speaks volumes about his performance. I didn't like the end very much, but as a climax for the incredible crime thriller that was Drive's second half, I'll tolerate it.There's some incredible action (read violent) scenes in this film, and I feel that the film would have suffered without it. Director Nicolas Winding Refn certainly knows how to direct a superb action sequence. A scene in the lift with Mulligan, Gosling and a hit-man is beautifully executed as an action sequence and a piece of drama. The cinematography on this film is absolutely breathtaking as well, on normal shots as well as exhilarating car chase scenes. I found the film's score to be absolutely disgusting, especially that awful techno song that plays over the opening credits.The camera-work, action, Oscar Isaac and Albert Brooks are best in show, but you could just as easily find entertainment in another movie that doesn't circle the block aimlessly for fifty minutes of your time.",Drive
187,SafReviews,Decent,7,1 May 2019,"The movie was decent, but it could have been a bit better. For example, the first 40 minutes was dull, which I guess was done deliberately due to the drivers personality, but It wasn't fun too watch. The plot gets very intriguing after that with some good action and twists. However, I was expecting something interesting happening in the end, but that wasn't the case for me. This is more of a drama movie with a good story and a few action scenes which were also quite good. Don't expect it to be an action-packed movie though.",Drive
188,trublu215,One of the best films of the decade,10,13 February 2015,"Nicolas Winding Refn's hyper stylized vision, Ryan Gosling's darkly timid hero, Newton Thomas Sigel's flawless cinematography, these are the key components to Drive that make it one of the best films of the decade. Drive tells the story of a mysterious and nameless hero who is embroiled with the underbelly of the LA mob all while falling in love with his neighbor. In a nut shell, this is two films in one. The first half of the film focuses on Driver's relationship with Irene (Carey Mulligan) while the second half is a livewire crime thriller that never lets up. The beauty about this is Refn strikes the perfect balance between telling the love story and telling the real story, this setting up motive after motive in a grand finale that is unforgettable. There isn't a ""strongest"" player here, everyone involved, both the actors and the crew, are at the top of their game. Some of which have yet to achieve this level of greatness even four years later. Ryan Gosling delivers a performance likened to De Niro's Travis Bickle. He is quiet and timid but taking one look at him, you can tell that there is a rage building up in him. Gosling does an amazing job in this role and its hard to take your eyes off the screen with a performance like that. The supporting roles are equally colorful, Ron Perlman, Albert Brookes, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston and Oscar Issac are all magnificent here. An especially excellent turn by Albert Brookes makes him one of the most memorable villains in a crime film. Bernie Rose is evil, manipulative and psychotic but Brookes plays him with a certain sense of entitlement that makes it hard for you too look at him for too long because you're that afraid of what he might do next. Refn plays with silence much like Stanley Kubrick and some scenes even feature a Kubrick-ian feel to it all, it is engrossing and thoroughly enjoyable. Overall, Drive is a modern masterpiece that is beautifully shot, excellently acted and an all around amazing film.",Drive
189,dallasryan,'Anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours'-The Driver,10,1 April 2012,"What a great movie this was! The chemistry is amazing between Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan. It has One of the best Car Chase scenes because of how it utilizes the power of sound and sound effects. A lot of careful and precise work was put into Drive's Car Chase scenes, and it shows! Drive's Car Chase scenes beat any of the ones the Fast and the Furious movies ever had. For Drive, It's about quality, not quantity like it is for The Fast and the Furious movies. Drive, like Lost in Translation, is poetry in motion, beautiful poetry from beginning to end. The ending of a film is very underrated a lot of times. In any sport, no matter how you start, you always have to finish to get that win. In chess, you have a beginning, middle, and end, and you're beginning and middle can be fantastic or so-so, but if you have set yourself up for a great ending, then you you use that great ending game to your advantage and get the other opponent in checkmate. Drive and Lost in Translation both had so-so beginning and middles. On both movies, at some parts i would say 'I really like this movie' and then at other parts I would say 'I'm not sure I really like this movie'. But if a movie has set itself up for a good/great ending, the ending can make the movie that was just so-so into a great film! Then, when you watch the movie again, the whole movie is great because of the ending(that you know is coming now) that brings it together. Lost in Translation is one of my favorite movies of all time for what it did with it's ending, bringing it together to be great. The same goes for Drive, the ending is very poetic, almost Shakespeare poetic, that it brings the whole movie together, making Drive a masterpiece! The ending can make or break a film.(An example of a movie that started great and had a great middle was We Were Soldiers, really great movie in the beginning and middle and then the last 15 minutes of the film were much too sappy and contrived, making it an okay movie instead of a great one that it should have been). I really like this director Winding Refn too, he's really got some great things he brings to his films(my first of his that I saw was Bronson, also a terrific film). Refn really puts some great music in his movies as well, and he utilizes that great music at the perfect time within his movies. All in all, I loved this movie, Gosling is Terrifc, Mulligan is terrific, Albert Brooks is scary and has never been better, and Ron Perlman has a pretty interesting part too. A must see for all fans of great filmmaking!",Drive
190,masoncheek,A tension filled masterpiece.,10,20 July 2020,Each scene had some sort of meaning or tension to it that kept you engaged. The use of violence was awesome and caught me off guard. And the subtle things in this film were what really made it stand out. I would recommend this film is great. 10/10,Drive
191,noahgibbobaker,Personal.,8,10 August 2020,"Drive is a film that makes me feel something strange. It's not happiness or sadness, it's feels like it could be both at once. I think this is might be because of how much attach myself with and see myself in Driver. I care for him a lot and at times feel like I am him. I watched Drive at a important time in my life, I struggle with mental health and really try to hold on to the people and things that I care for, watching Driver have to throw everything and the few people he cares about away is painful for me. I feel like I know everything he is feeling while having to do this.Music is something I am very passionate about so naturally I loved the music and use of the music, it compliments each scene wonderfully. I thought ""A real hero"" by College & electric youth worked particularly well.Drive is very personal to me and as you can probably tell I'm not completely sure why.
You might notice I have given a 8/10 rating, I'm still rating Drive critically despite how person it may be, after all I still want to presue film criticism.I love the first half of this film it's absolutely phenomenal, I have no complaints. Once it's starts to focus more on the crime story the film it starts to go downhill, I don't like the side characters as much as Irene, and especially Driver. The over the top violence also does not work for me at all and I thought it was very disracting, there is only one instance when the violence does not take me out of the experience.I'm not a fan of typical *crime family plan goes wrong then they need to get the money back type story*, I think it's been done to death, and I am never as invested in these story's.I have a few nitpicks, like, why was the music blaring in Drivers room until he leaves then it gets much quiet when it should have been loud, Irene apologies for the noise why is it quiter in the hallway. Another one is when Bernie kills Shannon he says ""all these priceless cars, you should get better locks"" after breaking into Shannon's place, to me this seems like lazy writing (this is the only time during the film I think it's not written well). I won't go through all of my small complaints as that's not fun to read or to write, they hardly effect my overall enjoyment anyway.Overall Drive is a fantastic movie everbody should watch. I tend to struggle articulating my thoughts so hopefully this all made sense to you. Thanks.",Drive
192,darkreignn,"Beautiful, visually stunning, romantic, suspenseful, thrilling, tragic - a masterpiece",10,2 February 2021,"""Drive,"" directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and starring Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan is, without a doubt, one of my all time favorite films. I've seen this movie more times than I can count, and every time I find something new to appreciate, admire, and fall in love with.""Drive"" is, at its core, an action film - but it's also so much more than that. The movie follows Ryan Gosling's character, a nameless loner who works as a Hollywood stunt driver by day, and a getaway driver for criminals by night. After a particularly thrilling job that is followed in the absolutely riveting five minute opening sequence, Driver notices his apartment neighbor, Irene, played by Carey Mulligan. The movie continues, building up their relationship, and the wrench that is thrown in it when her husband, Standard, gets released from prison. Sound like a plot you've seen done before? Maybe, but never done like this.Nicolas Winding Refn truly directed one of the most dramatic, romantic, and tragic thrillers ever made; the opening scene alone is five minutes of pure tension, coupled perfectly with the nighttime visuals and euphoric score by Cliff Martinez - and the movie only gets better from there. Refn steeps this movie in cinematic fantasy - the bright, divine lighting that casts a heavenly glow over many sequences; the score that permeates through every scene; the long takes and deliberate editing style - the movie truly feels like a hypnotic dream, each piece of Refn's puzzle combing perfectly to draw you in it. This is an arthouse movie, but one that stays plot focused, using the surrealistic cinematic style to enhance the story.This movie has some of the most romantic scenes ever put to film - watching the Driver and Irene's relationship build through subtle facial expressions and wide smiles is so sweet and heartwarming, making the inevitable violence all the more tragic. After all, ""Drive"" is an action film, but its strong focus on character only elevates the action, adding an emotional resonance that hits and sticks with viewers. Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan were incredible here. Carey Mulligan is not only gorgeous, but plays the role of a woman slowly and clearly falling in love to perfection. So much is said between these two characters through facial expressions and actions rather than dialogue - ""Drive"" is the premier example of show, don't tell. You don't need them to express their feelings for each other through words because their actions toward each other tell you all you need to know, and frankly, it's beautiful. I mean seriously, this is one of the best romance movies ever made, and it's not even a romance movie.When ""Drive"" turns into the action movie it is, it is thrilling and tragic. You almost don't want to see the action take place because of how sweet the romance is, but when the action does happen, you can't take your eyes off the screen. Refn frames everything perfectly, making horrific violence look gorgeous to watch. Yes, ""Drive"" is an incredibly violent film, but the violence isn't frequent, and doesn't linger, and most importantly, move the plot forward. Take, for example, a scene where Driver fights a man in an elevator - this scene conveys so much emotion, so much character information, and not a single word of dialogue is spoken. Ryan Gosling has such a unique and expressive face, and you can sense Driver's fear, panic, rage, sadness, love, all through Ryan's expresions. It's masterful acting.Refn chooses style over substance here, and it works marvelously. Refn's gorgeous directing style combined with the fantastic acting and the beautiful music melds together perfectly, making ""Drive"" an emotional experience from start to finish. Nicolas Winding Refn truly crafted a masterpiece here, and if you've never seen this movie, I urge you to give it a shot.",Drive

The bads - everything else but mostly script.It's a boring movie, trying to be art where there's no place for it, and mixed with so called ultra-violence (an expression from Clockwork Organge?). Good cast in the wrong movie (what is Ms. Hendricks doing here anyway?). No emotions or reason. Too slow. You wait for something to happen but it doesn't. Instead, something else happens and you're left with that ""what-was-that-all-about?!"" expression on the face. At least you have an expression. Characters do not. This one should have been made with Jason Statham and called Transporter IV or something. Highly overrated movie that should very soon be either forgotten or will achieve some cult status. Recommendations? None this time. Decide for yourself.",Drive
195,FallenEye,Cruise Control.,7,4 May 2017,"The way Drive was shot was quite fascinating and Ryan Gosling with the utmost ease, provided extra magnetism to have you fully committed in following Ryan's character and seeing where and how this all ends.The pace of this film was quite unexpected, and one would think that given the impression Drive gives, the pace it took would be too sedate, however, it wasn't. If anything, it was definitely far more thrilling and engaging that expected, though perhaps it was due to the fact that, even with it's very steady pace, Drive still did very well in cutting forward to relevant scenes, and leaving the rest to the wayside.About Ryan's character's name, I didn't realize until the movie was over, as to what they did there, which just made me love it more.The story is pretty simple, but still quite fresh. Carey Mulligan was very sweet and inviting in front of the camera, and the music was noticeably capturing. How the movie ended, it is extremely arguable that it didn't need to go down in that fashion. In fact, the argument would lean more towards it being an unnecessary ending, than necessary.Overall however, Drive shifted gears smoothly, and the ride was a well accomplished 5 minutes of cruise control.7.4/10.",Drive

I had choices, many, and narrowed the list to the two I wanted to see. First was Contagion, and the second was Drive. I heard lots of Contagion, great line-up of actors, great vibe, and a cool soundtrack. I heard tons of Drive, FANTASTIC actors, haunting 80's vibe, and a super cool soundtrack. Being my stupid self, I went to see Contagion, disliked it, and the next weekend drove an hour up the road to the next theater to see Drive. My god, have I ever seen a movie like this before? I never saw an artsy film like this one. It was simplistic, but in a styled way. It was haunting, it the weirdest way. People around me complained, probably suspecting a Fast and the Furious film. I digress, and tell you that Drive is one of the best movies I have ever seen. People hated the random outbursts of ultra-violence (which they do have some kind of point, but I personally loved it.) People hated that the film was called Drive, but had two car chases (which adds to the uniqueness.) People HATED the acting, stating that Ryan Gosling was an emotionless killer (really? Do people really not see that that's his part?) And all these points are none credible. Drive was beautiful, it terms of it's cinematography, vibe, and it's lighting. YES, for the first time, I explain my love for lighting. Well, I don't love it, but when films try their hardest to show something, Drive succeeds in it's lighting. It's all 80's vibe, with the hotel (AMAZING) and other scenes. The score, blaring in the background, is a mixture of 80's electronic pop and sometimes has a horror film touch. It's all done to well, and with my dislike of electronic music, I actually loved it in Drive; because it all works. Everything works, and I loved how the film is hated by many, only because they don't understand it. I personally didn't even grow up in the time era it's representing, but I had the picture of it's style and throwback. I love Drive, it's cool, it's new, and only few people understand it's awesomeness. If you look at that elevator scene, and don't like it, then I pray for your future. Drive is the best movie of 2011 and surely enough one of the coolest movies I have ever seen. It's not for everyone though, and that's why it's even cooler.

When the job falls apart, the only way he can keep Irene and her son alive is to do what he does best-Drive.

We realise that he is capable of doing anything if he feels he needs to.The movie plays out to a suitably downbeat ending.Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn unashamedly sets out to make a stylish and indeed arty movie. There are plenty of awkward silences and slow motion sequences, particularly when he wants us to know that the driver and his neighbour ""FALLING IN LOVE"".There are a lot of reason why this movie shouldn't worked but it is so well written, shot and acted that I really enjoyed it.The soundtrack is also brilliant.",Drive

This, in turn, means interactions have more meaning, as well as lending tension to the darker scenes.Do not be concerned that Drive skimps on the brutality: ""Driver"" (Ryan Gosling) is note perfect in his acts of savagery, an unassuming figure but ruthless when required. His clinical nature makes scenes seem cold and calculated, so his new relationship with neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) offers a brighter outlook on his future.

Other than such clichés in the plot and lacking of heart and soul, there were other flaws in the movie. Being a ""driver"" or being a cool hired killer is not that easy! Ryan Gosling's wooden performance and his senseless character are just pointless and has not any interesting or deep element. The violence in the movie was neither artistic nor entertaining, it was sick and sadistic! Also it was pointless! You know Quentin Tarantino makes extremely violent movies like Kill Bill, but it is entertaining and it is artistic at the same time. Drive is not! What about music? Well, oddly, it reminded me Tron, another movie I didn't like, so simply I wasn't impressed by the songs either. Is Drive an action packed? Not at all! The movie has an exciting opening, but then it turns into an empty and dull pseudo-art work with some disgusting violence. The rest of the movie is not a piece of art or an audiovisual feast in contrast with the hype, that's why I was seriously frustrated by the movie! Unfortunately the flaws hasn't finished yet, Drive has an anti climax and pretentious finale that leaves you totally unsatisfied. I am sorry, but the ones who call this as art owe other art house directors an apology.",Drive
205,Christopher_Reid,Pretty engaging and enjoyable,7,6 January 2014,"I guess I'm not sure what the point of this movie was. It's tricky having a character who is so quiet. I guess it's better than vapid dialogue. But it doesn't create mystery by itself. There need to be hints as well, about the past, about feelings and choices. And there wasn't enough contrast between the main character and his surroundings. So he's not that interesting.Anyway, the movie seems to imitate an 80s style or something. The hot pink running-writing titles, the plot and the electronic music all fit in with this. The violence is a bit over-the-top at times but also doesn't feel completely out of place. It makes things more interesting but I guess that's kind of messed up. It's strange why we watch movies anyway, it's very voyeuristic, fantasmer about what you would do in those situations. At least your life would be exciting, right? Even if bad things are also happening.Most of the characters weren't very significant. Their motivations are typical. Ron Perlman, Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks all seem fine, but none of them had amazing dialogue or changes to go through. This is just a crime/chase/revenge kind of movie. The best aspects were the mood that it created (largely through music and cinematography) and the quality of some of the action scenes. They were generally exciting. The quiet moments had a unique feel to them so it wasn't boring. But then you can just sit outside and think about things and achieve a similar effect on yourself. It's not bad, but not that profound either.You can wonder a bit about what the point of it all was but I don't think that there's anything there. It's just a ride, an experience. It's fine at what it does. But I can't help but think how great it could've been if it took some more interesting turns rather than being so linear and unsurprising. And if it made a statement or two and tried to mean something.",Drive
206,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: A Subtle Drive!!,7,18 January 2014,"Drive. A mysterious Hollywood stuntman, mechanic and getaway driver played by over good looking Ryan Gosling lands himself in trouble when he helps out his neighbor. Our hero won't say much, instead he would just smile and smile and so his love interest played by cute Carey Mulligan. Music takes the center stage in this crime drama and subtlety takes over the passion, anger and desperation. That's the story till mid point because in last half an hour, you are shown loads of blood-bath but never the justification of it. Like our mysterious lead actor, for me movie was a mystery in which there was no mystery at all. So if you are not looking for surprises, then it is fine piece of action crime drama and makes a good watch for a holiday.",Drive
207,aprilsfriendorin,Captivating thriller,7,27 January 2021,"A lot of these heist thriller type movies have the tendency to draw on for too long or try to do so much that they get confusing.

The acting mixed with the perfect writing and great cinematography that makes for a very memorable and unique film that ends up being much better then it could have been. This movie is a romance film and a crime film and never seems lite on the 2 genres, it clearly is a well balance between both genres. Drive is a highly rewatchable film with a lot of memorability.",Drive
210,loco_73,Classic,8,21 November 2011,"""Drive"" is a classic movie in all aspects, no doubt about it. The characters, the acting and the story, the soundtrack, cinematography and all other elements collide to create one of the most powerful and memorable movies in recent years.Many will find this movie evocative and even similar to the 1978 movie ""The Driver"" with Ryan O'Neal, while also recognizing some elements from ""Taxi Driver"".Make no mistake, this is Ryan Gosling's movie, an explosive performance cements this man as truly one of the top actors working today, and if his projects continue to be chosen carefully and likewise backed-up by similarly strong performances I won't shy away from calling him one of the best actors of his generation (his follow-up role in ""The Ides Of March"" is no less impressive).He takes the whole image of the quiet, mysterious ""silent type"" character to the next level. Long pauses in dialogue (The Kid does not say much in his movie and he does not have to), are punctuated by either quiet moments of sublime power and beauty or unexpected bloody and wonderfully disturbing explosions of emotions and actions.Albert Brooks, Ron Perlman and Brian Cranston (from TV's ""Breaking Bad"") are solid here and really support Ryan Gosling's tour-de-force in this movie with their own deft and talented deliveries. Christina Hendricks (TV's ""Mad Men"") and Oscar Isaac (Ridley Scott's ""Robin Hood"") have smaller yet still poignant performances. Actually Christina Hendricks's scene was one of the harder to stomach...and that is saying something...mind you it does not detract from the movie but still...ouch!!!! The only weak link for me was Michelle Williams, she is not detrimental to the movie but I am not entirely sold on her as an actress or her presence in this movie. To my mind there were other actresses that could have done just as good or even a better job than her in this instant.The icing on the cake for me, is that ""Drive"" really brought to my mind ""Bullit"" one of my all-time favourite movies. Anybody that can conjure up that movie, and not only that, but also remind me of the unforgettable Steve McQueen with his unequalled talent and cool factor, is notable in my book. Ryan Gosling and ""Drive"" more than accomplish that!PS Come awards season Ryan Gosling HAS to be recognized for his strong performances in either this movie, or ""The Ides Of March""...if not, then Hollywood is truly out-of-touch with reality and their awards and accolades are worthless and meaningless!",Drive
211,somf,Stylish Thriller,9,10 September 2011,"On a pure visceral level the opening scene of Drive is arguably the film's best. Not to say that it goes downhill from there; rather it is brilliant and almost silent, and it gets the audience on the edge of their seat before slowing down into a terrific first act during which the unnamed Gosling character and Mulligan establish their relationship. I have seen Nicholas Winding Refn's Pusher series and Bronson films, and he really knows how to get wonderful performances out of his actors. The ironic thing is that some of the greatest acting scenes in the film come when Gosling and Mulligan have no dialog whatsoever. I am a huge Gosling fan. He along with Joseph Gordon-Leavitt are my favorite young actors working today. Gordon-Leavitt's 50/50 is my favorite film so far this year (Caught it at an advance screening as I was able to see this film as well.) I think Gordon- Leavitt will receive an Oscar nomination this year, not so much Gosling this time around, but he does a terrific job. Strangely enough I could see Mulligan getting nominated for her portrayal of Irene.When watching this film I was reminded mostly of Micheal Mann's ""Thief"" in both style and its' use of violence, but I was also reminded of early John Woo Chinese action film's like ""The Killer"" and ""Hard Boiled"" perhaps more from the weird soundtrack than from the actual style of the violence. And let me tell you, the soundtrack is very weird. At times it works quite well, at times not so much. When the music is instrumental it is perfect. Like Tangerine Dream in ""Thief"". Perhaps it was Tangerine Dream doing the instrumentals here as well, I am not sure, but the 80's sounding vocal songs were just weird. For the most part I found them annoying though once or twice they had a successful effect. I found myself thinking about the director, this guy sure knows how to put together a film, but he sure has awful taste in music. John Woo's Chinese soundtracks also used a lot of odd music to accompany brutal scenes of violence. And make no mistake about it, this film has the most brutal scenes of violence of any film ever made. But I gotta say, they really work.Don't go expecting a pure action film though, it certainly isn't. There are long stretches of silence and pauses that worked 100% for me to understand the characters and their relationships. Some viewers will literally hate those scenes. If you can't wait for Transformers 4, this may not be your cup of tea.I really don't want to give away too many spoilers but I do want to mention one very cool scene at the end where Refn creates this metaphor of a Scorpion via the Gosling character. It really is an image stuck in my head.I didn't recognize Bryan Cranston for a few minutes while watching his character. Since ""Breaking Bad"" is my absolute favorite TV show, I found that very commendable for him and it says a lot about his true talent as a character actor. Albert Brooks whose ""Lost in America"" remains one of my all time favorite comedies, is anything but comic here and he is brilliant. Ron Perlman also delivers a strong performance.This film is not for everyone; but if what you have read about the film from me and the critics and folks that have been lucky enough to have seen it already, make you want to see it, then you are very likely to love it.",Drive
212,patryk-czekaj,A stand-out movie of the year,8,30 May 2012,"In the vast sea of terrible and completely superfluous movies that premiered in 2011 Drive comes as a brilliant independent freshener of the highest sort. It's 80's-like aura, connected with a strong plot, mesmerizing soundtrack and convincing main character, provide for a pleasant, yet somehow unexpectedly thrilling, amount of adrenaline flow. Nicolas Winding Refn took a risky step in mixing a bit of old-school gangster cinema with a contemporary movie about dangerous and hot car rides. I must say that the outcome is more enjoyable than it sounds at first.Unexpected as it may seem, it's Ryan Gosling's time to shine in Drive. The whole plot is generally build on his performance, and it's worth stressing out that his ability to support the picture with his persona and make it look very professional is outstanding. I've never considered him to be a leading man of our generation, but after this movie he really showed the world that his days of glory are only about to begin. The nonchalance of The Driver, as he is known, his eagerness to be very quiet, blended with brutal outbursts in the most promising moments makes him a man everyone should be scared of. I mean, when a guy puts a nail to your head and threatens to push it right through your head with a hammer sounds kind of extreme, right?Carey Mulligans brings a dose of realism to the picture, playing a person so vulnerable, yet so positive in her perception of the brutal emptiness that surrounds her, because of the delinquent husband. His ties to the criminal underworld are the main reason that The Driver suddenly becomes a first-rate offender in the mafia community. I truly adore the seemingly noir atmosphere that can be felt throughout the whole time. The visually suspenseful sequences, collided with the harshly dark tone of the colors, and gripping storyline can partially remind of the good old days of brilliant crime thrillers. Maybe if it wasn't for the stupendous bloody scenes of utmost brutality, perhaps.Then, on the other hand, there are a lot of melancholic moments of utter calmness and tranquility that, along with gorgeously placed songs (my favorite being Nightcall), give a completely different side of the picture. All of those factors combined provide for a cinematic experience that certainly most people won't forget. Drive is a smart thriller of our times that, in the huge crowd of rather tedious movies, may be even called a Scorsese for the modern generation. And that's probably a complement that anyone would want to hear.",Drive
213,krycek19,Pretentious crap,1,6 December 2011,"Drive truly sucks @ss. It's made by an awful movie director who suffers from dyslexia, from my country Denmark, who has an ego the zise of Lars Von Trier but not even a quarter his talent.Drive is a weird crappy movie.It has nice cinematography and atmosphere in the cool opening but completely lets down after wards for the rest of the movie.The first part of the movie is really boring. Ryan Gosling's acting is wooden and he is mumbling his very few lines so it's hard to understand what he is saying and care about him. His so called love interest is played by Carey Muligan. An actress who is about as sexy as a doormat and really annoys me. And there is no chemistry what so ever between her and Gosling. And that makes it hard to believe why his character will kill to protect her and her kid and die for them id necessary.Then Muligans husband gets out of prison and instead of getting jealous because Gosling has been getting close to his wife and son and wondering if Gosling has been banging his wife, he immediately likes him and they become friends. Yeah right!! Where the hell is the realism here?? The last part of the movie is almost non-stop sick sadistic violence. Goslings character turns into a regular Schwarzenegger, killing every bad guy, except the ones that, kill each other, before he can get to them.Refn (the director) is mostly known for a crappy trilogy called Pusher and some even worse American movies.Why this movie is so well liked amongst critics is beyond me. But maybe it's the sloow pace of the movie and the helicopter shots of L.A. and maybe they think thats art but it's not.Similar cinematography can be seen in Collateral, where it looks better and Collateral is a far better movie than this turds of a movie.",Drive

215,tapio_hietamaki,An aesthetic character study,10,2 February 2017,"If you dislike neon colors, brooding urban nights and 80's retro synths, you probably won't like this movie.A friend of mine complained that 'Drive' was too slow. Well, it is a slow movie compared to 'The Fast and the Furious' but not when compared to other movies by Nicolas Winding Refn. 'Drive' has its car chases, its shoot-outs, its damsels in distress. But the hero of the movie does not deliver snarky one-liners, he does not run across showers of bullets or perform jaw-dropping stunts, walk away from explosions without looking back, nor does he reveal a heart of gold underneath a tough exterior.In fact, he barely says anything at all.Ryan Gosling really made a name for himself with this movie, but what kind of name, it's hard to say. The nameless character he plays is handsome, that's for sure, and mysterious and dangerous, but not exactly the kind of guy you'd want to hang around with. He's not the type of bad boy that girls are drawn to. True, there's a girl in the movie who is drawn to him, but she doesn't see the full picture like the movie audience does. Beneath the sense of mystery there is no adventure - there is sociopathy. This is a human being that does not function normally. Behind those puppy-dog eyes is a cold-blooded murderer. We never really make contact with The Driver, never really learn what actually motivates him. He is a mystery to such an extent that I heard a theory that he's actually not human but an invulnerable superman that travels from town to town. We humans cannot penetrate the surface of his cool, wordless stare.The movie created - or resurrected - a beloved retro aesthetic, which I fell for to such an extent that I've collected all but one of the masks in Hotline Miami.",Drive
216,Benjamin_Cox,"Stylish, brutal thriller with little actual driving - 82%",8,10 February 2014,"Just occasionally, a film comes along and does its best to stump me. Not through a convoluted plot but more because I struggle to understand precisely what the film is trying to say. Maybe it's me being a bit thick but this is one film that works very hard to break free from normal Hollywood conventions and has me scratching my head. It's an easy film to admire - very well made, a killer electro-pop soundtrack and stacked with actors giving quality performances in a classic noir tale - but I can't help feel like I've missed something.Pretty-boy Ryan Gosling plays an unnamed stunt driver based in LA who doubles-up as a getaway driver for Hollywood's criminal element. Maintaining an air of enigmatic mystery, he begins a relationship with his neighbour, waitress Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her son (Kaden Leos). But when the boy's father Standard (Oscar Isaac) is released from prison, he identifies the driver as a fellow professional and ropes him in to help him with robbing a pawn shop. But it quickly descends into a violent battle of wits against mobsters Nino (Ron Perlman) and Bernie (Albert Brooks), a battle that the driver seems destined to lose...Anyone expecting a rip-off of ""The Fast & The Furious"" will be deeply annoyed because ""Drive"" is way more cerebral than any of that series. In fact, there aren't many driving sequences in the film although what is in there is brilliantly shot and have a old-fashioned, visceral feel to them. ""Drive"" is more about the characters than the cars - take any of the scenes where Mulligan is making gooey-eyes at Gosling where dialogue is forsaken and stark lighting illuminates their faces like passing street-lights. Gosling does a grand job of playing the driver who switches between cool, calm professional to loving, surrogate father and the relationship between him and his neighbours is believable and organic. But Brooks is just as good, playing very much against type as the brutal gang boss who can seemingly turn anything into a weapon. There is an underlying dark current to the picture that clashes with the possible romance brewing as viciously as the driver deals with anyone who get in his way. His is a classic anti-hero and combined with the retro-sounding music and neon-pink opening credits, ""Drive"" has a strong Eighties vibe to it that makes it feel reminiscent of other movies like ""Bullitt"" and ""Vanishing Point"".Dark, brutal and as enigmatic as its lead, ""Drive"" is a high-quality curio that never fails to let go of your attention. For example, there is a shot of Gosling in his car where he just sits there, sun setting behind him and it took a good few moments before I realised that I was holding my breathe with anticipation. I just wish that I was smart enough to fully appreciate it because the ending felt like an anti-climax and the violence felt grimly excessive at times, such as the scene in the lift. What I do appreciate is the film's undeniable style and look - director Nicolas Winding Refn has pulled out all the stops to fashion a film that has a gritty and yet still beautiful feel to it - as well as the cast who do a fantastic job and the soundtrack which is worth tracking down. But like a Booker Prize winning novel, I just wish I had a bit more smarts about me to ""get it"".",Drive
217,skullhead739,"Tense, immersive and almost perfect",8,31 March 2020,"This movie was real close for me calling it perfect and giving it a 10, you know I obviously liked it.. but read on to find out why it was shy of a 10.Acting/cast:
Wow! he cast is absolutely awesome. A ton of great well known a listers that did so well at their interesting and bad ass characters. Ryan Reynolds seems a bit too awkward at times but I liked that he was subtle with dialog. Characterization was top notch, and you really get a sense of tension, fear, thrill and so much more just from the acting. I really liked the relationship between the protagonists as well. You really care for all the characters and love the ride.Music/cinematography:
Hear is mainly where it goes shy from a 10. The music is way way off and is in my opinion not a good fit for the scenes. It's like edm futuristic music but for what is dramatic or relaxing scenes. Not all the music but most. Next the scenes and shots were great but my main gripe was with that insanely crappy shadow scene near the end.. it's a shadow that looks like a blob, and they play it in the most climatic part, it was frustrating to say the least.Story:
Here's where the acting and plot make for what is a thrilling, intense and beautiful piece of cinema. The action scenes are really well done and spine chilling. The drive scenes and for a car guy like myself are satisfying. My only gripe is when ryan rammed that car 2/3 into the movie once in the rear and then t boned, the car looked absolutely fine.. not even a busted headlight. But besides that, I really enjoyed the plot. It wasnt too complicated but it wasnt simple either, it was a nice ride.Summary:

Mr. Ex-Con daddy soon comes out of jail and, surprise, the bug-eyed, swarthy fool involved with some bad dudes whom the stuntman knows. Because the stuntman has an entirely sexless interest in the at best average-looking single mother smurf girl thing, he tries to get the bad guys off the lovely ""family's"" back.Nothing happens in this movie. The first half hour is a bunch of pseudo- '80s synthpop songs while the stuntman and the ugly single mother chick just stare at things. The stuntman's interactions with every other character consist of him staring. Just staring. Sometimes his mouth creaks an eight of an inch, I think it's supposed to look like a smile.The film has a few violent scenes, but they come so randomly and you have to wait for them so long that you're asleep by the time they happen.A totally pointless film that could've been edited down to forty minutes or so.

219,troy-manatunga,There is definitely something retro about DRIVE and a little bit of art-house!,8,30 January 2012,"Straight Faced – is the only term that justifies this movie. Clearly a disappointment for those who expect to see fast cars and high speed police chases and tuned up American muscle or imports! Instead Nicolas Winding Refn gives us the Chevrolet Impala and just a Mustang with very limited screening time. In no terms does this impact negatively on the Refn project DRIVE! One of the fittest performances, one of the fittest scripts and the most straight faced movie of 2011! Total Films magazine UK considers DRIVE the movie of the year. The Oscar nominations seem to think otherwise. With only one nomination in for the 2012 BIG DAY it will certainly be a hard fought battle. Going up against WAR HORSE, HUGO, and THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO & DARK OF THE MOON are Lon Bender (BRAVEHEART / SHREK) & Victor Ray Ennis (HOMEALONE) in the category of sound editing for the movie DRIVE. Why they deserve to win is entirely debatable considering the contenders, however if you have watched the movie you would agree the sound editing is the essence of the movie that draws the viewer deeper into this abstract production.With the bright pink credits, the Los Angeles skyline and the introductory soliloquy (it isn't one, however since you cannot hear the other end of the conversation its obvious Refn is working on the characterization of the driver (Ryan Gosling)) the tone of and 80s aura is instantaneously set. A getaway driver by night and mechanic by day, the driver is entirely disconnected from the world and lead a solitary low profile life. We are not given a name to him apart from being called the kid or the driver. Evidence of how the Refn refuses the character to connect with the audience more than he wishes to. Very tactful indeed don't you thing? Playing aside Ryan Goslings' surprisingly brilliant driver is the graceful Carey Mulligan. The driver who lives in the same building and the same floor as Irene (Carey Mulligan) connects with her on an entirely platonic level. Their chemistry is worked in with expressions rather than words and the emotions are toyed with the sound editing rather than with touch. This is unique and a very scarce breed of an action/thriller/drama genre. Irene's and the drivers connection is short lived when her husband Standard (Oscar Isaacs) returns home after serving jail time. Standard has unresolved issues and it doesn't take him too long to find trouble. Irresponsible as he is this draws unwanted attention to Irene and her son as well. The driver who observes much and speaks less offers his hand in help to Standard just to make sure that Irene and the son is safe. An obvious lovers twist it may sound, however it's discloses in an entirely unorthodox approach! There is definitely something retro about DRIVE and a little bit of art-house!DRIVE is a must watch drama / action production which will entice you every bit as the last moment. It will be hard to walk away disappointed from this. DRIVE will be to Ryan Gosling what TAXI DRIVER is to Robert De Niro; I am certain! This being said is the race over? Is Gosling the next legend? Is it too soon to decide? I got my money on Gosling and not the Chris boys!Title: Drive Directed by: Nicolas Winding Refn Starring: Ryan Gosling, Carrey Mulligan, Oscar Isaacs, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, Christina Hendricks & Albert Brooks Rated: R for strong brutal bloody violence, language and some nudity Rating: 8.5/10 100 Minutes",Drive
220,Jonathon_Natsis,Intense. Justit'swellit's intense.,8,9 November 2011,"It is so rare that a film that appears to borrow so much of its material from an array of modern American classics can prove to be a brilliantly original piece of cinema in its own right. But, via the sure handedness of unknown Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn, this is exactly what Drive accomplishes. Just how many allusions to classics does this film have? Well, fusing Travis Bickle and Fight Club's Narrator gives you the skeleton of our main character. While many liken the violence to Tarantino, I saw more respect being paid to early Stone and De Palma (if the first thing that came to mind was the chainsaw scene in Scarface, you're on the right track). And yet, the moral of the story (or lack thereof) screams of QT. As for visuals, think Blade Runner, only more grounded in reality, while the tone and pacing reflect my top two favourite Kubrick films.Ryan Gosling is The Driver, a professional stuntman who puts his skills to real use when moonlighting as a getaway driver for hire. He is a man of few words; disengaged from society but possessing an innate need to punish those who deserve it, keeping the universe in balance. Feeling pity for neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her recently paroled husband Standard (Oscar Isaac), he helps the latter perform a robbery so Standard can get his financial life back on track. But when the heist goes wrong and The Driver is left with a bounty he doesn't even want, the local gangsters Standard was working for are none too pleased.The overall feel of the film is one of absolute dread. Just when you get the impression that a newly introduced character is going to be a key player in the story, they get dealt with, often in a brutal, almost sadistic manner. Make no mistake; Drive is extremely gory and certainly not recommended to anyone with a weak stomach. Deaths are not only extreme, but also extremely innovative. Conventional weapons like pistols and shotguns are overshadowed by the creative use of everyday items like hammers, shaving utensils and elevators. But in seriousness, the film's physically graphic nature helps build a paranoid tone, giving the impression that danger lurks in both darkness and plain sight.Often, the excruciating build up to an event is more engaging than the action itself, and this is another area in which Drive excels. Not unlike The Shining, this film likes to tease the viewer by forming immense tension, only to have the scene end abruptly or without resolution. This is not a letdown, but rather a strength, as it climbs towards an inevitable climax in which all belated questions are answered, albeit with a touch of ambiguity. As with Eyes Wide Shut, this movie plods along with long pauses between pieces of dialogue, preferring to let facial expressions tell the story. Again, I found this to be a great tension-builder, but anyone who doesn't like their films too slow, or too violent, probably won't enjoy Drive. The music and cinematography combine to create an absorbing experience for the viewer. The film is obviously set in the present day, but the soundtrack (despite consisting mostly of music released this year) has a distinct 1980s feel to it. That might sound stupid, but you'll know what I'm talking about with a quick search of the standout tracks. Indulgent, panoramic shots of Los Angeles in all its neon glory give the film a neo-noir finish that is hard to criticise, if only for the sheer beauty of the imagery.Many months before its release, it was a relief to hear that Drive was no longer going to be made as a blockbuster, with an independent studio picking it up instead. This change in direction gave the film greater scope for character development, which it delivered. Even at times when Refn appears tempted to turn it into another Fast and the Furious, he treats us to just enough testosterone to ensure we don't get carried away and lose sight of the bigger picture. Finally, with all the critical praise being heaped upon Drive, one might look beyond the events of the film and try to find a moral. Personally, this does not appear to be a film with a message. It simply exists to take the audience for a ride; an absorbing tale of a good guy who's bad, some bad guys who are worse, and an unrelenting world that will not rest until all men have paid it their debt.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*",Drive
221,schroeder-gustavo,Art-house Masterpiece,10,14 July 2015,"Perhaps no movie ever has been so falsely advertised as Drive. People went to see this movie thinking they were getting into a Transporter type of movie, a dumb series of dumb action sequences after more series of dumb action sequences. What they got instead, was a real film.Although Drive does have some great action sequences, it's not what really powers the movie, although they are pretty awesome. The movie follows the Driver, a silent character that is accurate in everything he does, and has a very cold like approach to not only his job, but everything in his life. We never see him smile during the first sequences of the film, and every action of his feels very robot-like. This works great, as it shows us how the character approaches his every day life. But then, he meets Irene, his neighbor who he creates a relationship with. When this happens, we can start to see that cold gaze the main character had, turn slowly into what could be a smile. He is happy to be with her and her son. They are the only brightness in his cold, dark world. I don't want to go into depth, but what pretty much happens is he does a job that affects some bad mobsters and they are looking to hurt Irene and her kid, so Driver does everything in his power to stop them to protect the people he loves.There are some signs in the movie that help us understand the ending of the film. There is one scene where he is sitting watching cartoons with Irene's son and Driver asks him: ""Is that the bad guy?"" The kid answers yes, because he's a shark and ALL sharks are bad. Driver slowly contemplates and thinks, which indicates he knows he is a shark, but he doesn't want to be the bad guy. Also his scorpion jacket is cool and all, but there's a deeper meaning to it. When he is talking on the phone to one of the gangsters that are trying to kill him, he mentions the story of the scorpion and the frog, which is very interesting. The story goes like this: A scorpion asks a frog if it can swim and take the scorpion to the other side of a river. The frog refuses, saying that the scorpion will sting it. The scorpion insists, saying that if he indeed stings the frog, they will both sink and die. The frog agrees, but the scorpion eventually does sting it and they both drown. The frog asks the scorpion before they die: ""why did you sting me?"" and he just says ""I'm sorry, I can't help it, it's in my nature"". All of this fits into the movie, because it illustrates that the Driver (Scorpion) wants to be a better person, he wants to be with Irene and her son, but he can't escape his troubled life.Driver lets the mobster stab him in the end, he kills him and leaves the money behind. He had all this sorted out. The song ""Real Hero"" starts playing and he drives off. The song symbolizes that he finally became the hero he always wanted to be, and not the bad guy.Drive is a modern classic, a movie that is as near to perfection as I ever would want a movie to be. The soundtrack is amazing, the performances are great. The violence, the style and Oh my god that opening credits sequence. I love this movie.",Drive
222,perica-43151,Violent but stylized flick promoting adultery and Hollywood stereotypes,7,24 October 2019,"Drive is about a couple of thugs in LA, a stuntman turned driveway driver turned brutal murderer, his limping fatherly friend, one unfaithful and confused criminal wife, virtually every one in the movie is in fact mob related and pretty cruel. They live miserable lives, and meet miserable deaths, stabbed in the eye, slashed in the wrists and hands (with artful if disg usting mobster ""compassion""), slaugh tered and left to bleed out, stumped on angrily and repeatedly like a cockroach, heads blasted in minute detail, romantically drowned on the edge of the ocean, all these deaths are seen by the wicked sin-romanticizing director as an opportunity to exercise his cinematic style and hypocritical misandry, and are crafted with love and dedication of a mythical sharkopath. Despite of this gratuitous violence the protagonist thinks of him self as a hero, and that he is a hero wannabe we are reminded by some annoying music through the movie, he even leaves a million dollars behind for no logical reason but don't expect logic when you can have f-reaking-art. Just as director thinks of himself as a great master of style, and not some misanthropic self satisfied Hollywood member that vents his hatred of the world using some over the top film violence that he sells as transgressive, just as the movie was sold by a deeply misleading trailer. He failed at the box office, but his cinematographic trickery nevertheless amount to some pretty amusing shots, that people who think of themselves as f-reaking-art lovers, heroes of their own delusions, but are in fact a much emptier bunch, interpret as beautiful.",Drive

Although it draws from and is influenced by multiple genres it molds them together seamlessly to create something of unique beauty. Early noir, 1980's Miami Vice, Michael Mann, Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns and 1970's heist film elements are all present in the film, yet it avoids feeling dated or rehashed.

225,ajit2106,"Drive - A Stylish, compelling, impeccable and an imaginative art-house thriller",9,25 December 2011,"Having watched, Nicolas Winding Refn's Pusher Trilogy, Valhalla Rising, Bleeder and Bronson, I must admit that he has brilliant sense of cinema making and it shows in the every frame of his movies. ""Drive"" is an illustration of the finest cinema with top notch style and proclamation. Technical Specs are impeccable, you will be amazed with contemplative long shots and slow motion zooms. Drive is an immaculately made film, filled with beautiful cinematography.Set in the 1980s, Drive tells the story of stunt driver (Ryan Gosling) with no name who works as a driver for money in the night for Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks). Eventually, he (the driver) finds himself infatuated with his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and befriends with her son Benicio (Kaden Leos). He tries to help Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) to pay his debts, but engulfs himself into a wrong path, now the driver has to shield Irene and her son from the gangsters.The entire cast has been selected sensibly which gives a variety of performers to live the screenplay. All the supporting actors like Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks, Albert Brooks deliver and Ron Perlman have delivered the top notch performances. Carrey Mulligan had proved her caliber previously and this role is no exception. Ryan Gosling is undoubtedly proved himself in every role he has done so far as he is one of the brightest star of modern cinema. Ryan Gosling performance as a smiling, serene and cool driver with subtleness is just unforgettable, and the character's transitions from a serene person to a violent avenger is just unsullied.The soundtrack is fresh and gives soul to the film which makes it extraordinary.Recommended for every movie lover, it shouldn't be missed.My Vote 9/10",Drive
226,TheFilmGuy1,An amazing film with great style.,9,12 February 2012,"When I first saw the trailer to Drive, I instantly thought of Korean cinema. Whether it was the hammer carried by Gosling, or something else, i'm not sure. The influence of foreign film is clear in Drive. The story of Drive is a very simple and perhaps overused one. A silent and reserved getaway driver who doesn't normally get involved with people starts to form a relationship with a woman and her kid, causing everything to go downhill from there. Even though this story has been told before, the way it is told in Drive makes it seem fresh. Drive also has a very 80's feeling to it. The soundtrack is not only amazing but filled with 80's influenced music. It works so well with the movie and will stick out even to people who don't pay much attention to soundtracks. I had heard a lot of good things about Drive and in the end, it lived up to it. Also, I would kill for that scorpion jacket.",Drive
227,Simon_Says_Movies,"A White-Knuckle Exercise in Dead Quiet, Nail-Biting Non-Events",8,21 September 2011,"""Driver,"" as he is unofficially known, is an isolated loner, a quiet, shy, awkward individual that nevertheless brims with a hidden and unexplained fiery anger. The portrayal of said driver (who is actually equal parts mechanic, stunt driver and wheelman) by Ryan Gosling is understated to the point of almost non-existence — not coincidently exactly how his character prefers it. Gosling speaks with his expression, his silence and his demeanor, not with snappy dialogue and quick comebacks, and if you do receive a swift, passionate retort it may be the last thing you hear.In the spirit of full disclosure, I feel it important that those who are wavering on maneuvring their way to the theaters to see Drive that it is in no way an ""action"" movie, nor is it a heist film. Nicolas Winding Refn's film absolutely blurs the lines of genres, but if a label must be placed I would deem it an atypical character study/revenge film with thriller elements. But I strongly digress; that is not to say those of the blockbuster persuasion will find nothing to like about Drive. A plethora of fantastically nuanced performances, stunningly creative camera shots and a pulse-heightening score are only the pillars that support a white-knuckle exercise in dead quiet, nail-biting non-events and impending dread.After dabbling in the criminal world (but with a strict set of rules: exactly five minutes, no gun and he drives), Driver moves to a new apartment where he eventually crosses pass with his shyly attractive next door neighbor (Carey Mulligan) and her son, Benico, a precocious and strong-willed young boy wonderfully brought to life by young Kaden Leos. Discovering her husband is in jail, he grows close to the duo in his own low-key fashion. Events quickly escalate, however, as the reformed felon is released and Driver discovers (after walking in on the aftermath of a vicious beating) that the man is in hot water and owes money to the worst of people. Things go from bad to fubar as the heist to repay his debts goes awry and Driver becomes fatally tied to the gangsters.Drive takes seemingly commonplace cinematic events and spins them like a donut. The love story is one of those complex ""non love stories"" love stories, the relationship between Driver and his crush's husband goes in a completely unexpected direction and one of the mobsters (an incredible Albert Brooks) is more of a weary businessman than a Pacino-esque spittle-delivering ball of rage. In addition, the brief sequences of violence are brutally and graphically realized, as are the two main car- centered adrenaline sequences. One involves a prelude heist which introduces us to the steely nerved driver and the second an escape that is among the best-choreographed action scenes in years. Simply, Driver is not particularly unique in its subject matter but instead in its execution.Drive's faults come almost exclusively from the second act, as driver comes to spend more time with Mulligan's Irene. The shortcomings are not because it represents a lull in tension, but rather because Refn mistakes moments of silence — in what should be a dialogue-heavy exchange between two people obviously attracted to one another — for character development. Irene and Driver are both damaged, quiet people to be certain, but the 25-minute segment is defined by a single word spoken preceding 30 seconds of awkward-glare, fidgeting silence. This is not meaningful content (though I do applaud those involved in such scenes for doing so very well). The director also seems like he needs to remind people this is an independent feature, inserting indie/hipster music at all possible venues, that while unique, rarely fits the scene and serves as a glaring distraction.After that shaky follow-up to the opening, Drive explodes and left me nearly twitching in my seat as the camera insisted on constantly lingering off of important events long enough to drive you mad. Refn's extensive use of slow motion wonderfully serves as a support mechanism to the film's inherent style (and deliberate pacing). When not slowed, the camera leans at any number of distinct angles; one such climatic encounter is filmed focusing on only the shadows of those involved and is among one of the most brilliant executed instances of verité style of filmmaking I have ever seen. Not only because it is shot so uniquely, but also how even the shadows of the actors seem to evoke pathos and pain.I could not entirely lambast an individual who hated Drive, but I truly believe you will find many more of the mainstream-converted than haters, at least until awards season comes upon us, when you can expect Drive to be a major contender in numerous categories. Refn has proved himself to be an auteur capable of great style and an actor's director, and Gosling showcases his abilities as a leading man to reckon with. I would say that Drive officially kicks off the post-summer/Oscar season and if we have more of this on the way, autumn will be a welcome retreat from what has been a lackluster year at the movies.Rating: 8.5/10",Drive
228,dcobbimdb,"I must have missed the boat, sorry ""car"" on this",5,19 August 2012,"On the one hand I can try to admire the semi originality of the look, feel and interaction between the actors during scenes, but sadly at best it just simply reminded me of many foreign films I've seen. Some of which have been good and yet while this film did have so many foreign aspects including lead characters not to mention the director I can't help but lump it in to that category even though it supposedly took place in LA (yet no LA like I ever knew and lived in for many years). Yet this film also borders on the artsy / indie aspect as well. So in that aspect you'll either probably really like or just not get this film.In the end for me it didn't work. Yeah I like the whole idea of this James Dean lead character who played it cool through everything, but it just doesn't come off as realistic, least to me. The social scenes just seemed awkward and I couldn't help but think if any person or woman met this guy in real life would immediately think ""what a freak..."" I mean seriously when you ask somebody something and they just stare at you back you're either thinking mentally impaired or just plain stupid. So while the movie tries to ride this wave and maybe for others it worked, but for me it for the most part went over like a bad 'B' 80's horror flick.That said, the character did start to grow on me after a while and there were a couple decent action and driving scenes, and a part of me can somewhat appreciate this whole artistic approach taken which is the only reason I gave it a 4/10 and I'm struggling at that and really thought the end just sucked and was so underdone. I certainly wouldn't give it a second watch and am pretty amazed at it getting nearly an 8/10 score here and maybe that was my mistake going in was the high expectation. Oh well to each their own and I guess in this one I'm the minority who just didn't get it",Drive
229,mohamedahmzak,Excellent ambiance,8,31 October 2019,"Driver is the story of a driver that works part time un driving for movies and spends the rest of his time in the garage with his mentor, Bryan. The driver meet his neighbor's, a girl with her son, and gets close to them. The driver has a rule in his work which states that he can only wait for 5 minutes before he start the engine of the car and drive away. In these 5 minutes, whatever robbery, heist, must occur or else he'd leave.
This girl's husband get out of prison and get acquainted with the driver. He got beat up one day, and when the driver sees him in this situation, he tells him the story of how he managed to got out of prison by paying 2000$ to a gang and how that gang now wants much more that what he asked them to pay. The driver accept helping him and ty strike a deal with the gang to execute a robbery, each one them take their sum, and they'll leave the guy and his wife and kid alone for good. Upon exiting the pawn from which he stole the money, standard, got shot by the shop owner,and a car that parked earlier to the right of the driver's car begin chasing the driver after he got away with the girl and the money. Things got out of hand and the driver defends himself by shooting two attackers and finally he pushed that bryan with his car over the edge and checked him in the water. He finally gives the money back to the head of the gand on the pretext that he'd leave the girl alone and let him starts a new life,but,out of the blue, the old man pull out a knife and stab the driver in his stomach, and the driver, too stabs him several times in chest until he fi wished him off. Great film. The music, the atmosphere, the shots. All great",Drive
230,Kubris,West-side Taxi Driver,9,11 October 2011,"I'll get it out of the way quick: Drive is the best movie of the year. And while the new decade is young, it definitely belongs on the ""Best of Decade"" list too. Drive mixes quality filmmaking and modern flair, which reflect off each other perfectly. Drive has it all: action, drama, romance, suspense, and charisma.Drive follows a man who lives around cars. He works in a garage, does stunts, and is the getaway driver for criminals. We never learn his name. Ryan Gosling is the Driver, and he's great. Driver is quiet, and content to be quiet. A true professional, thinking only of his work. For the most part, Gosling is subtle. His getaways are done plain-faced, and he doesn't show emotion when meeting new people. But we see a more emotional side of him with Benicio, and every so often a violent side, but more on that later. Down the road, one could see this as Gosling breakout role/performance.The plot is fairly conventional: crime gone wrong. In the middle there is a bit of noir, with too much information exposed. But everything wraps up well- it doesn't close off his story completely and we can make up our own minds about what happens after.This film has many parallels to Taxi Driver, and originally I wanted to expand on that, but it would contain spoilers so I decided against it.If you expect an action film, turn around. Drive is a drama with action scenes. As other reviews have said, action happens when the story calls for it, not because the story needs action. There aren't many chases or killings, but the chases are heart- pounding. And the violence is brutal. Like the Godfather (always a comparison you want a film to relate to) the violence is sparse, but when it comes it comes BIG. Two scenes in particular are jaw dropping, and *minor spoilers* the elevator scenes will become known as ""that scene in Drive"", in my opinion the highlight of the film, with juxtaposition of the two extremes in the film, love and hate *end spoilers*.Speaking of love, Gosling and Carey Mulligan share a nice romance. They speak with small movements, and barely speak. Body language is the name of the game here. Add in Benicio, the son, and you have a family here that is tender to see.Drive is backed by several great supporting characters. Bryan Cranston, a favourite of mine, is the good- hearted but cash-hungry Shannon, the Driver's friend and partner. Ron Perlman is the hilarious Jewish Italian gangster wannabe, whose description of a nice car is unbelievably funny. And Oscar Isaac is great as the ex-con who actually isn't a caricature.Include a few sweet synth songs and great cinematography, Drive is a fantastic modern film that is necessary viewing. I hope it receives some Academy love, it deserves it. You'll probably love it. 8.8/10",Drive
231,adrongardner,"A ""Mann"" Driven",8,11 May 2012,"Here's the deal.Drive is an unapologetic riff of pretty much every loner crime revenge story ever made and total line descendant of Michael Mann's Thief from 1980, . So much so, that thanks to the bubbly soundtrack, it seems they might as well have filmed it in 1980 too. Drive is a small-time crime story told with great restraint on characterizations and great explosiveness when it comes to violence. As far as modern influences go, Drive is a sort of crazy hybrid of Paul Verhoeven's Spetters and Paul Thomas Anderson's Hard Eight (Sydney) throw in the last few Cronenberg movies while you're at it. While I don't quite understand the negativity so many haters seem to have for Drive, I understand why some people could be so frustrated by it. Drive is told with Nicolas Winding Refn's European eye for detail and tone. Drive is the definition of character study with a heavy emphasis on STUDY. There is very little quick cutting between camera setups and absolutely zero sitcom-esque axial cut dialog scenes. It is the antithesis of the way most American movies are made. We have been conditioned as a society to watch boxes of talking heads broken up with pointless jabber and largely bloodless violence. Now how you interpret Drive's way to tell a story is largely a question of style and sensibility. Drive is not for every taste and probably not something you'll be in the mood to watch 24/7, but it is very well done when you have the time to invest in it. While it breaks no new ground - and if you think it does, you must have been born yesterday - Drive is a really immersive odyssey of moments and music. It's essentially the cruise through LA crime movie Michael Mann tried to make with the Hit-Man centered Collateral. Drive is better.",Drive
232,jaimemedina-36288,A classic,9,5 August 2021,Still under appreciated and I kinda love that about it. Gosling is spot on in this deliberate simmering thriller. So many great performances makes the pace a joy to watch. It's a study of character and genre.,Drive
233,jaredpahl,"Muddy Neon Dreck, Drive is the Harbinger of Doom for Real Cinema.",2,25 February 2020,"Drive is representative of an entire subset of movie that has wormed its way into popularity among film buffs. A harbinger really. I've taken to calling it the ""Instagram Filter Film"". Exercises in the style where ""style"" is defined as a neon, washed out, out of focus Instagram filter over bland handheld camera work. The Instagram Filter Film also comes with dreary, meditative, vacuous electronic music and performances so subtle, so bereft of emotive risk, that the characters barely even speak at all. The Instagram Filter Film is king. Moonlight, Waves, Under the Skin, and countless other A24 darlings are routinely praised as masterpieces. Online, people frequently cite these films as their ALL-TIME favorite movies. I am baffled, downright perplexed by this sentiment.Why do people love Drive? It cannot be for the story, which follows Ryan Gosling as a stunt/getaway driver through the seedy L.A. crime scene in a series of drawn-out, boring jobs and stilted-beyond-comprehension conversations. The forward momentum of Drive's plot is broken beyond repair. Dialogue is delivered in long, slow, mumbly fragments. Characters are constantly pausing, staring, freezing in place for seconds at a time. It's a massive directorial failure, stabbing the movie in the jugular and watching the lifeblood pour out. This movie dares you not to fall asleep. People have the audacity to call this thing a thriller. I've seen more thrills in line at the DMV. There are some good actors here, but with the possible exception of Albert Brooks, they are zombies. Ryan Gosling is as bad as he's ever been. I have rarely seen a movie star of his caliber deliver as lazy a performance as this. He fights back against any semblance of human emotion. He's so hung up on being cool, that he forgets the part about acting like an actual human being. I think if director Nicolas Winding Refn had his way, he would have hired a wax statue of James Dean instead. That might have been an improvement.No, people love Drive, apparently, for its style. Because Drive is ""cool"" and it looks ""cool"", and it sounds ""cool"" and the costumes are ""cool"". But is it? Refn is clearly obsessed with the superficial elements, at the expense of everything else. And that would be one thing if the superficial elements were interesting. They are not. The music is not my thing. Whatever, I won't hold that against it. But the look. I simply refuse to believe that a human person can prefer the look of Drive to ANYTHING. Pick any movie ever shot on honest-to-God celluloid and it looks clearly, obviously more pleasing to the eye than this dank, murky digital vomit. Seriously, think of the first movie that pops into your head... Good Will Hunting, Lawrence of Arabia, The Cider House flippin' Rules, all infinitely brighter, clearer, more colorful and alive. The mood of Drive is so turgid and mucky and off, I was repulsed by it.Now the real dilemma I have is that so many intelligent people had the direct opposite reaction. People LOVE this movie. They love the look, the mood, the stillness. It's at times like these when I feel like a Martian. I have no idea what people see in this movie, the same way I have no idea what people hear in mumble rap or taste in kale. Someone telling me they prefer Drive to thousands of other movies is like someone telling me they prefer their food rotten. It's literally unbelievable. I can't see the other side of the argument, sorry. To me, Drive is nothing but a boring, plodding, self-righteous, full-of-crap slog.23/100",Drive
234,dharmendrasingh,A Real Human Being and a Real Hero,9,5 January 2012,"'Drive' is a triumph of style over substance. However, in this case style is the substance. The unexpected pop music, garishly pink credits and mood-filled lighting, all conspire to create a truly distinctive flavour. Without the flourishes 'Drive' would merely be another languid crime drama. It pays homage to the 80s, and if this was made then, we'd be looking back at it as a classic of its kind. It's made to stand out. And it does.Ryan Gosling is the kid with no name. By day a stuntman, by night a getaway driver. Five minutes: that's all he gives his clients. A minute longer and he's gone. He can afford to be so direct because he's the best at what he does. He uses his cunning to elude the cops. When they're metres away he phlegmatically parks the car and turns off the lights, or drives behind them and waits in areas where helicopters can't track him.The Kid has a past. We don't know that, we assume it. How else could he kill so mercilessly? Maybe that's why he's laconic: it's another way to be invisible. There's an economy of acting on display here, which I enjoyed because Gosling is an actor you can quite easily watch doing 'nothing' and still be entertained. Serving this film is a nostalgic bubble-gum pop soundtrack. I never knew this genre could be made to seem so sophisticated. It's not an obvious score but it works beautifully. It brings out the story's pathos. The slo-mos with 'A real human being' playing (now on my iPod) are cathartic.As Irene, Carey Mulligan is perfect as the love interest. She's The Kid's neighbour. While her partner, Standard (Oscar Isaac) is in prison, she and The Kid are free to flirt. Their chemistry is lovely to behold. It's subtle. They interact mostly through smiles, which reinforces the point that communication is done mostly through body language.Standard's release from prison provides the thrust of the story. Some heavies he owes money to coerce him to rob a pawn shop. He resists and they beat him into submission. The Kid intervenes when Standard's son is handed a symbolic bullet by one of the thugs. But it all goes wrong. Horribly wrong. He intuits it's a set-up, and in the final third, the story becomes one of mutual retribution. I want to tell you more, but doing that will spoil it for you.This is a violent film. Scratch that. This is an exceptionally violent film. But I have no qualms because none of it glorified. It repels you and makes you wince, as real violence should. The few violent scenes are accentuated because they are dispersed throughout a deliberately slow-burning film. The whole cast forms a wonderful ensemble. The principal players are cast against type and are convincing, particularly Ron Perlman's Jewish pizzeria owner, who longs to be Italian, and his partner, Albert Brooks, who is more reasonable but no less minatory. And of course the brilliant Ryan Gosling, as a lugubrious loner.So much thought has gone into every sequence, like in the lift when The Kid kisses Irene to relax her before literally bashing in a man's skull, or the close-up of the scorpion on his jacket when we see his dark side emerge, or the shot of Albert Brooks looking as if he regrets a murder, suggesting that the mobster adage 'It's not personal, it's business' is nonsense.www.moseleyb13.com",Drive
235,RobertF87,"Dark, hypnotic thriller",8,9 October 2016,"This is a film that pretty much screams ""cult movie"". It tells the story of a mechanic / movie stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver. Soon his quiet, ordered life is thrown into chaos when he is pitted against the mob to protect his neighbour and her young son.This is a quiet sedate film, that ratchets up to full gear with sudden, shocking bursts of violence, accompanied by a pulsating electronic score. Ryan Gosling turns in an iconic performance as the mysterious unnamed Driver, although Carey Mulligan is kind of wasted in her role as the struggling young mother. The style of the film harms back to the neon drenched 1980s action films, but the story-line harks back even further, and can be seen as an updating and relocation of the classic Western with Ryan Gosling as the Clint Eastwood Man With No Name.Some viewers may be put off by the slow pace of much of the film, and the graphic violence, but if you are willing to go along with it, it's a striking experience.",Drive
236,JimmyCollins,A great film which surprises right up until the very end.,7,5 October 2011,"When I recently saw Drive I went in with not much of an idea of what it was about, just that it had Ryan Gosling in it, he's one of my favorite male actors so I was happy to watch a film with him it. The storyline is something very different than what you'd imagine, once the plot gets going it's certainly a story you are interested in seeing unfold.Mr Gosling plays a tough as nails and confident as he'll Hollywood stuntman who doesn't say much, but in trying to help out his friendly neighbor gets himself caught up in a crime ring, and let me tell you these crime guys are people I'd never want to be associated with. The are read badass guys. But like I said, Mr Gosling is a tough bitch.I found the film to be quite beautiful to watch, it has a stillness too it similar to someone like Sofia Coppola or David Lynch, the use of David Lynch's composer is a mega plus also. The female characters is the film are somewhat underused which is a tad disappointing because Carey Mulligan and Christina Hendricks are great talents, Hendricks has a bit more if a gritty role but both the females are fine with what they have to work with. Another great thing about this movie is the slow techno soundtrack. So if you're after an intelligent film that isn't just car chases and race scenes and more of a quiet study of humans, this one is for you. Enjoy.",Drive

Think Steve Mcqueen for generation ""Y"".""Driver"" gets by quite happily, doing the occasional getaway job, flipping cars as a stunt driver for the movies or as a grease monkey for Shannon (Bryan Cranston). ""Driver"" keeps to himself and lives in a anonymous apartment. Meeting his neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son by chance one day, a connection is made.Irene has a husband in jail, meanwhile ""Driver"" gets to help out around the house and befriends the family, although how far the friendship extends is never made quite clear. There is a lot that is not explained in the running time but that is part of the films charm.The first half of the film is a beautiful character study, with Mulligan proving what a great actress she already is, with Gosling excelling in a role with almost minimal dialogue.When Irene's husband is released, a plan is set in motion. Well intentioned but out of character for ""Driver"", his anonymous and low interaction lifestyle is suddenly at risk. A decision which he may or may not, live to regret.Suddenly the story takes a turn for the dark, graphic violence replacing the character study before. The story remains strong whilst the violence, perhaps not unjustified, is brutal and in the audiences face. Does it add or detract from the story, debatable. Which is a shame because the certificate will limit the audience and this is a good tale, well told.Bad guy duties are performed by ""Nino"" Ron Perlman, who can do this in his sleep and Bernie ""Albert Brooks"" playing very much against type. Both characters are near mid level crooks, just passing the crap downwards as fast as they can, attempting to keep one ""hit"" away from mobbed up unseen characters.Noir in style, neon lights shimmering on still puddles in parking lots, sterile environments reminiscent of Taxi driver in some ways. Urban alienation and lack of a community spirit embodied in the ambiguous ending, that may not please all.Director Nicholas Winding Renfg finds a unique style, which is sure to be copied and to use a phrase, is ""so hot right now"", perfectly in keeping with the current mood and feel.Not perfect perhaps but as close as you might expect, a small film made to feel big in heart and content. Great acting all round including Cranston who moves ever further away from his comic TV persona.Watch the first half happily with the family, the second only with those with strong stomachs.Summary Fine work from a young director with more to say and an unusual way of saying it.Film Noir for the younger generation, a fine thriller with plenty of depth and interesting themes, not for the feint of heart in places.Recommendedhttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",Drive

If they'd left it at that, I'd have been fine. But, of course, they didn't and we learn later on that he is, in fact, supposed to be a badass. I just didn't see it.The film never really explains his past, or why we should buy him as a tough guy, but I guess that's because they wanted the character to seem a little mysterious or something.Carey Mulligan plays about the most Mary-Sue love interest this side of ""Twilight"". What was so special about this girl that interested Ryan Gosling's character in her in the first place? The fact she's his neighbor? What's the appeal? Is it because he's a driver and he can save gas not having to go far to pick her up? What? Bryan Cranston's character is almost a complete waste because we hardly see him. It's still sad to see his character get killed off, but we haven't really had any real chance to get to know this guy to feel too sorry for him.Albert Brooks plays a surprisingly effective villain, though. Usually, he's a comedic actor, but I could totally buy him as a jerk. Although, I was a little disappointed in Ron Perlman's character, Nino. He, too, got too little screen time and I didn't think they did his character justice by having him go out the way he did...it just didn't seem ""big"" enough to me. I don't know.In the end, I guess I'd say I was just a little disappointed in the movie. I had heard good things about it and I was pretty psyched to see it, but in the end, I just felt like ""Drive"" ran out of gas. What I found most annoying about the movie was that for it to be called ""Drive"" it had a surprisingly small amount of exciting chase scenes in it.On a one-to-ten scale, I'd probably give the movie about a six. You can check it out if you want to, but personally I thought it was a bit of a letdown. If you want to see what this movie should've been, go rent Ryan O'Neal's ""The Driver"" instead. It's actually a good flick unlike ""Drive""!",Drive
239,tbmforclasstsar,"a thrill ride of style, sound, romance, and emotion",10,27 February 2012,"If I had read the script to ""Drive"" before seeing the film, I'm convinced I would never have walked into the theater at all. I'm not saying the dialog is cheesy or poorI'm saying that the driving force (poor pun, I know) behind ""Drive"" is the immense emotion conveyed by all of the actors and actresses in the film and the use of soundtrack and sound mixing/editing to keep intensity at a high and an atmosphere that almost exceeds the powerful images on the screen.""Drive"" is the story about a heist driver (played by Ryan Gosling) who gets caught up in something much bigger than chauffeuring criminals away from the police. The Driver (as his real name is never given) has lived a rather organized and careful life, until he starts to grow closer to his apartment neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio.Irene is married to Standard, a former criminal who returns from jail a few weeks after The Driver and Irene have started to become close. Standard tries to return to his home a new and free man, but his past follows him close. One day, The Driver comes across Standard bleeding and scarred in the garage of the apartment complex, and he finds out Standard has some debts that need to be paid. When that threat turns towards Irene and Benicio, The Driver decides it's time to give Standard the services he has given to many criminals before.For the first half of ""Drive,"" there is a quiet and subtle atmosphere. The Driver is shy and quiet and the relationship between Irene and him is full of chemistry, yet a seemingly dull relationship. However, the lulls and silences between the two are never awkward or forced. The chemistry between Gosling and Mulligan is very strong and makes the decisions and sacrifices The Driver will make for Irene completely believable and realistic.For the quiet and lowered tone of the first half of the film, there is a completely opposite and raw atmosphere for the second half of the film. During a scene that has no extreme relevance to the plot, an old passenger of The Driver sees him at the counter of a diner and sits next to him, discussing the possibilities of a new job. Suddenly, the rather reserved and controlled driver turns to the man and tells him ""Why don't you shut it or I will knock out all your teeth and shut it for you."" This is the longest sentence The Driver has delivered to this point and a sign that things are about to change drastically.As you can imagine, the heist with Standard doesn't go exactly according to planto say the least. The Driver is now thrown into a situation where he must defend himself along with the woman and little boy he cares about so much in a manner he doesn't prefer: with violence and weapons.I don't want to dig any deeper into the plot, but I can tell you the second half of the film becomes extremely violent, and The Driver becomes a controlled madman, all from the pressure and desire to protect the two new lives he has become so fond of.As I mentioned before, much of this must be credited to the amazing performance of Ryan Gosling. For easily having the most screen time in the film, Gosling may barely have the most dialogue. Much of what The Driver is feeling and thinking is established from the facial and body expressions expressed by Gosling. It is rather amazing to see and understand the slight differences in The Driver's tone from a slight squint or flare from Gosling.The film's director, Nicolas Winding Refn (who won the Best Director award at Cannes for this film), is never afraid to hold out a shot or sequence longer than need be. Whether it be heist sequence or a simple conversation between Gosling and Mulligan, Refn holds many shots and close-ups much longer than what would be customary. This is extremely beneficial to the film, as these long takes and long shots allow for the actors and actresses to display the characters' humanity and morality without over-exaggeration.Another credit should be given to Bryan Cranston as The Driver's close friend and auto shop boss, Shannon. Cranston, with a slow gimp and charming/humanistic quality, creates a very sympathetic character in Shannon and allows the audience to connect with someone a little more outgoing than The Driver and Irene. His character becomes essential to the tone of the film, and his presence is felt throughout.The other strong suit of this film, as mentioned before, is the soundtrack and sound mixing/editing of the film. The second half of the film changes rapidly in images and sequences, but also in the sound effect department; gunshots are deafening, tires squeak in high pitches and volumes, and punch impacts and broken bones make you cringe. The effect from this is substantial on the film, as the impact of the scene on the audience would be less significant if the sound effects weren't realistic and at a high level of volume.Likewise, the soundtrack and score of the film is extremely important. With an '80s feel to style and story, the soundtrack reflects this brilliantly in bassy and driving (again, bad pun) rhythms that are melodic and eerie to the shots on screen. One particular song (""A Real Hero"" by College feat. Electric Youth) becomes a sound motif, rising up at silent montages of Gosling driving or Mulligan walking through the apartment hallways. The lyrics ""you have come to be a real human being, and a real hero"" echo throughout the theater, encapsulating so much of the narrative on the screen...Read the entire review at CustodianFilmCritic.com",Drive

242,Michael-Hallows-Eve,Great movie that would fit well in the 'Action/Horror' genre!,8,28 July 2012,"This movie actually comes under the 'Action' banner but after seeing it, it should be under the 'Thriller/Horror' banner, it would be well placed there. There has some great blood and cringe worthy moments in it and I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The acting was great too as each character played their part well. Ron Perlman ('Hell Boy') played a stand over man in this film, and he did that well too. Some of the action shots were well done (there's a great slow-motion shooting scene) and the gore factor would put some so called 'horror' films to shame. The story (although not original) was done well and the cinematography was great. I heard the movie was made for 15 million dollars, well spent in my opinion. So I give this movie an 8 out of 10. I recommend it.",Drive
243,piratecannon,Don't Mess With Stuntmen,8,26 December 2012,"Drive is a movie that's been on my radar for quite some time (especially after it showed up seemingly out of nowhere and garnered almost universal critical praise). After a colleague mentioned in passing that it was unexpectedly dark and well worth a look-see, I set aside 100 minutes this past Wednesday night to finally see what all the fuss is about.The movie follows an enigmatic figure known only as ""Driver."" He's a mechanic and Hollywood stuntman who spends his nights as a wheelman for people pulling burglaries. He's quiet and, aside from the death-defying nature of both his day and night jobs, doesn't seem to have much of a ""normal"" life. He doesn't have any friends—apart from the gnarled shop owner who hired him some years prior—and seems consistently lost in thought. When he speaks, everyone listens (including viewers), because there's something magnetic about his persona. This is due to Gosling's impeccable depiction of an apparently tortured protagonist—I say ""apparently"" because even though we don't get any real back story it's clear that said Driver is constantly trying to overcome his own demons— and the crisp writing and direction. Things progress deliberately (which doesn't necessarily mean slowly), and each frame is saturated with emotional resonance.Much to my surprise, Drive is, at its heart, a crime drama. The plot is fueled by an east coast/west coast mob fiasco that's directly related to a botched robbery attempt our Driver was involved in. There were moments where this nebulous MacGuffin felt a little cliché (echoes of a A History of Violence abound), but make no mistake: the tension is tangible from start to finish. In fact, I can't remember a recent offering within this genre was so methodical while also managing to foster a never wavering sense of dread that something horrendous was just around the corner (okay, maybe The Departed fits the bill, but you get the point).Drive is like an otherwise perfect piece of fruit with a few minor imperfections. And like the bruised pear these are easily pared away, and what's left is one of the more engrossing crime-action thrillers of the past decade. Be sure to check it out.",Drive
244,DanLives1980,Driven by creative brilliance!!!,9,10 August 2013,"Two years after this movie is released, I sit down to watch it, for the first time, in the early evening with the false impression that I'm watching a kind of remake of Walter Hill's late-seventies cult classic 'The Driver'.Now that I know it's based on a 2005 novel, I can safely say that it's more a most unabashed tribute, bearing similarities in characters and filmmaking style. Nicholas Winding-Refn, you have done a fantastic job, not just in bringing a classic to a new audience, but by also making one of the most quality thrillers I have seen.This is also the first Ryan Gosling film I have been able to appreciate and good god, does he deliver. It's not just that he had the element of surprise over me, Gosling and Winding-Refn seem to have a legendary working relationship in the making. Film and actor direction are a tight unit in Drive and a testament to conveyance of character psychology.Drive is the story of a Hollywood stunt driver and garage mechanic by day and a getaway driver for hire by night. The mysterious and somewhat lonely ""Driver"" finds himself enchanted by the arrival of a mother and young son until their husband/father gets out of jail and brings trouble with him.Throw in a shaky deal by Driver's manager (Bryan Cranston) and the local mob bosses (Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman) and a robbery set up with disastrous consequences, and Driver is thrust into a deadly face-off with the LA mob, in his efforts to protect the young family he has become so attached to.What's brilliant about Drive is how it's sold to the audience. It's a neat, colourful and musical package that could easily come off as a Grand Theft Auto movie based in the 80's and yet we do not expect the level of thrills, drama, quality action, violent extremity and sheer psychotic shocks.If you're one for a good psychological thriller cleverly sugar-coated in pretty pink romance, and you're most likely to be delighted by how demented a movie can become, see this! It easily could be Walter Hill, but it could also be Alfred Hitchcock also. The support cast is brilliant, and combined with the retro style and comic book storytelling, all of these things work to create a movie you feel like you've seen before even though you're likely to be shocked and surprised.We really could do with more of this, and with a budget of $15,000,000, its formula really does threaten to kerb stomp the poor competition of recent blockbusters.Thank you!",Drive
245,Ziglet_mir,Loses appeal as the years go on.,9,16 September 2011,"As a young adult, very much into artsy things and low-key films, I remember the day a few of my friends and I were deciding to go see the recent remake of Straw Dogs and I convinced them to go see Drive instead-which none of them had heard of. Not totally knowing what to expect myself we were entertained mildly until the scenes at the motel and the elevator. If you've seen Drive, it is needless to say why. After the watch, it was all we could talk about, especially how great Gosling was in his role-a role certainly made for him due to the lack of speaking and physical language.On a rewatch as an adult, those scenes that put us over the top into loving this film certainly make less of an impact now, but the message concerning Gosling's ""drive"" and what it means for a family to have a man who can protect them still stand. As do the more simpler compliments about the Refn's style and directorial choices.The subtle yet hypnotic 80's retro soundtrack pulls you into a different world that screams cool (possibly a smidge too much). Even the unique retro feel of the hot pink credits add to this art-house vibe we are being induced with.It isn't much, but I think Refn does a credible job tying in character ""drive"" with the main plot of the story and conducts a wonderfully artsy show-offy film (whatever that means!). Carey Mulligan is adorable and plays a woman in a hard place. Bryan Cranston plays a poor, sleezy mechanic who aids Gosling's character. The whole thing is relatively low-key, until those certain scenes I already mentioned pop out you in the ways they are meant to. The greatest compliments for this film go to how Gosling's character harkens back to the golden age of cinema and how the tense romance (between Gosling and Mulligan) is the spark that lights up his meter of tension to do the right thing (in the sense to protect this vulnerable family).In other words, I think Gosling's character goes down in the same category as Travis Bickle in Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver""; a great antithesis/antihero. As I already mentioned, the way Gosling's character shines in Drive is reminiscent to the mysterious desperado from when the greats of the golden-era of Hollywood reigned (i.e. Gary Cooper, John Wayne, Charles Bronson, William Holden, Clint Eastwood, etc.), which we do not get wnough of these days.A film I initially gave a 10/10 has moved down to about an 8.5-9/10 for the appeal it has lacked for me ever since that initial viewing. Dare I say, it was something I overhyped? Possibly, but still worth the watch.",Drive
246,howie73,Style over susbstance -,1,25 October 2011,"Nicholas Winding Refn's Drive stars Ryan Gossling as the nameless protagonist (much the same conceit as Ryan O'Neals nameless driver in Walter Hill's The Driver (1976). Critics have fawned over what could be described oxymoronically as an art-house movie; and Refn even received the prestigious director's award at this year's Cannes (nothing to do with Von Trier being persona non grata, of course). All in all, I was expecting a masterpiece. Instead, I was left with a limp, lifeless and boringly self-conscious menage of cinematic motifs, borrowed heavily from Tarantino, Lynch and Walter Hill. The result is an uninspired, embarrassing mess of a movie. It doesn't deserve to be seen in the same league as the infinitely superior Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway, which Refn has plundered for purely aesthetic gains and nothing else. He even had the temerity to use Lynch's ex-musical partner, Angelo Badalamentti, who uses his typically Lynchian sounds to little effect. Intringuingly, at one stage, even Lynch's music from Inland Empire seems to have been deliberately mimicked as some kind of in-joke on Badalamentti's behalf (or perhaps an ironic riposte for not being chosen by Lynch to provide the Inland Empire OST). While Lynch offers abstraction and depth, Drive is all surface gloss and bokeh – there is no mystery to behold or engage the viewer; just the bland, vacuous features of Gossling, who is a blank canvas and nothing else. Critics have predictably lapped up its style and gratuitous violence as heralding a new talent, much like they fawned over Tarantino a decade ago. Take away the violence and uninspiring story, and what's left is nothing. Drive is ultimately all style and no substance. Avoid.",Drive
247,Gloede_The_Saint,Less of a film than I had hoped it would be,6,30 November 2011,"It had a lot of elements I enjoyed, and I was entertained throughout - but after seeing it I can't really grasp it's extreme popularity. The very story feels incredibly tiny and insignificant. We meet a getaway driver, he kinda falls in love with a girl, then he gets in some trouble - the end. It was basically like they just wanted to make a movie and threw a screenplay together. A lot about this movie is just plain off.Excluding some odd song picks, the dialog is really plain, at times even cringe worthy. I assume it was mainly by choice, as the acting style is also quite off in an oddly stylized fashion. Gosling and Mulligan makes it work, Oscar Isaac, who plays Mulligan's husband, isn't as lucky and delivers his uninspired lines quite awfully.We get some set pieces that might seem important, primarily the scene in which Gosling, hidden under a prosthetic mask, seeks revenge. However it turns out the mask wasn't needed at all, and very little is done with it, but the visual vibe is unsettling enough. Brooks get a lot of credit for his performance, I find him rather mediocre. Many people in this were way worse than him, and he certainly out-acts Pearlam, who is quite poor.At the end of the day I wanted to like it more than I ended up doing. Though well made enough, a lot of it felt plain ""simple"". Still managed to pull me a long, and it did get my blood pumping a few times, so it's certainly a good enough film - but I wouldn't go further than that.",Drive

249,blazesnakes9,Drive is the best action film of 2011,10,1 March 2014,"The Driver is a man without a past. He doesn't have a name. But, he has 3 occupations. At night, he moonlights for a getaway driver for robberies. At day, he is a stunt driver for major, big-budget Hollywood movies and a auto mechanic. But, he's alone.Add that, smart script-writing and energetic action sequences that really pushes this movie to the max. Drive is a very entertaining film mainly because it revolved around only one character and several others. The Driver (Ryan Gosling) doesn't talk much and doesn't seem to have any relationship with anyone or anything of his past. He works three jobs. At day, he's a Hollywood stunt driver for action films. He is also a mechanic and also a best friend to his boss, Shannon (Bryan Cranston). At night, he moonlights as a getaway driver for robberies. His only relationship that he has is only one person. That one person is his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan). Irene is a young mother, who is dragged into the gritty and very dangerous underworld of Los Angeles, mainly because her husband is being released from prison. At first, Irene seems to be attracted to the Driver. But, when the Driver encounters Irene's husband, he becomes a getaway driver for him. Irene's husband wants to knock off a pawnshop and he knows that the Driver is the right man to do the job. After the heist goes wrong and Irene's husband is shot to death, the Driver finds himself driving himself to defense for the girl he loves. Even more worse, he is also being tailgated by a syndicate of deadly criminals. One of them is a local gangster/loan shark named Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and the other is Nino (Ron Perlman). Soon, the Driver realizes the gangsters are after him and Irene because of the money that was stolen from the pawnshop robbery. This throws the Driver toward offense as he tries to go after the men who wants to hurt Irene and tear down their relationship.The movie is photographed like a neo-noir picture because of its shiny and fluorescent lights that illuminates the City of Angels. Drive is one of those movies like Michael Mann's Thief or Manhunter, where the style creates an atmosphere for the movie's premise. It also illustrates how dangerous and violent this underworld is to Irene and especially to the Driver. Those nighttime scenes are very well photographed and very well directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. He sure does know how to create a 1980's atmosphere for a movie that is set in the present era.Another aspect that makes the movie works is the performances by Ryan Gosling and Albert Brooks. Gosling is right for this role because we can see just how gentle and humble he is when he is first introduced to Irene and her son, Benicio. He is sort playing in the acting field as a young Steve McQueen, where emotionless responses toward the other characters creates a original identity to the Driver. There is also something to point out about Gosling's performance and his presence. He is not playing the pretty boy role that he played in The Notebook. This is particularly way more different than the character he played in that film. Here, he takes the screen by storm. Brooks, on the other hand, is very intimidating as the local gangster who puts the Driver and his girlfriend in danger. Brooks has been playing comedic roles in the 80's with films like Lost in America and Modern Romance. I was very surprised just how scary he was playing Bernie. He is relentless toward the people he distrusts, yet his presence makes the movie works perfectly fine.The action sequences in Drive are very well choreographed and perhaps probably the car chases I've seen since Steve McQueen got behind his 1968 Ford Mustang Fastback in Bullitt. Refn has said that he shot the car chases without CGI. Well, I can't argue with that statement. So many movies that do included car chases are done by CGI. A lot of them are done very horribly and doesn't generate the kind of energy that is in store with this movie. That's probably why Drive is the best action movie of 2011. It's realism in the chases that creates an energetic response to the audience that is watching it.All in all, I must say that I enjoyed Drive very much because of the action sequences, the cinematography that makes the movie look like a neo-noir film of the 80's and especially the performances by Gosling and Brooks. You know, after watching Drive, I've been thinking of two things. One is that I like to see another movie like this again. The other thing is that with the exception of Drive consisting of 80's atmosphere, I think that there can be a way to make great movies again. If movie directors can learn from this movie, then films like Drive can extend just how cool it is to create a vibrant style through a decade of film-making. ★★★★ 4 stars.",Drive

253,Hawkensian,Seldom has my opinion on a film changed so drastically,8,26 February 2013,"I first saw the film in Romford on the way back from picking up my new car in Enfield, North London. Getting there had been hell. I was on the M25 and running late, but I decided to commit to seeing it, so I left the motorway and began to penetrate the Essex town. To my intense frustration, the roads were full of road works and were subsequently jammed, but by then it was too late to turn back, I had to see it through. Once the road works finally ended, the sat-nav kindly took me straight through the middle of the Romford shopping area, which was a cobbled street full of people, a place where I'm pretty sure cars weren't allowed – I must have looked a right berk.After much embarrassment and stress, I finally found the cinema and arrived at the screening just seconds before it began. The timing was great; however I was now in no mood to be watching a film.'Drive' has a very simple premise. Ryan Gosling is 'The Driver', a quiet, enigmatic mechanic and stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver for the underworld. His lonely existence changes when he meets Irene (Carey Mulligan), a sweet young mother who lives down the corridor from him. There is a clear connection between them, however her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) returns from prison before their not-so-platonic friendship comes to fruition. Standard is being stalked and threatened by criminals, to whom he owes a mounting debt, a debt which can only be paid through a pawn shop heist. For the sake of Irene and Benicio's safety, The Driver conscientiously lends his getaway skills to the job, which of course goes horribly awry.Gosling's performance is good, he has a steely aura about him that is cold and convincing. However, I don't think one should get carried away when steeping him in praise, I felt it wasn't a particularly demanding role. While it is clear that he fits the mould of the laconic anti-hero, I was slightly bothered by the extent of his utter lack of conversational skills, particularly when he's speaking to Irene. There are moments that are so painfully awkward that it could test the plausibility of their relationship. Gosling is reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's iconic 'Man with no name' roles, but I also made a connection with Dustin Hoffman's performance in 'Rain Main'.I was very ambivalent about the film. I liked the exciting car chase in the introduction, I liked Cliff Martinez's stylish, haunting soundtrack; I also liked the visuals and the film's unforgiving, visceral nature. The film is spattered with torrents of claret, stark shankings and devastating gunshot wounds – there's also a spot of stomping. The film dishes out violence as it is, ugly and nasty. However, I had reservations with the lead character and particularly with its thin plot and meagre ending. I left the cinema feeling hollow and thinking it was all rather vapid.Despite all of this, the film had definitely got under my skin, I was thinking about it regularly. Eventually, I had to give it a second viewing.Being at home without the aforementioned stresses and knowing the framework of the film, I was able to enjoy it a whole lot more. I was engrossed from the start, relishing the style and edginess of it all. My past reservations took a back seat; it had gone up in my estimations two-fold. It was on my second viewing that I was able to appreciate the innate coolness of its leading actor. How on earth did he possibly make a white padded jacket with a yellow scorpion on the back cool? Oh and the driving gloves, they just reek of cool, oh and that black roaring Ford Mustang – I am so impressionable. It really got my heart pumping; I couldn't believe how the film had grown on me.Ultimately, though, like so many films, especially those that fall into the revenge/retribution format (think Death Wish/Taxi Driver), they're good until the last stanza, they're hard to wrap up. However, I even preferred the ending on second viewing – out of the ways they could've ended it, this was probably the most appropriate choice. While it is indeed a trifle shallow, if you watch 'Drive' on a massive television with an equally massive sound system, it is guaranteed to be a visual and aural treat.www.hawkensian.com",Drive

No, this is not is Fast Furious.Drive is an excellent movie that exemplifies perfectly how good directing goes a long way to tell a great story. There are many scenes with little to no dialogue where a lot is said or shown to the audience regardless.Gosling - who in 2011 was probably know to most people only due to Notebook - plays masterfully a troubled stuntman / getaway driver who finds in Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benito a comforting he seems to be longing for.When a heist goes wrong and those relationships are at risk, all of the characters are really put to the test and the narrative goes off, explodes. Without any of it being obvious and requiring being spelled out.A great thriller which takes time to build the tension, because it instead chooses to creates deeper characters.Closer to an 9/10 than a 8/10 in my book, to be fair.PS: If you liked Drive, I'd really recommend trying out Nightcrawler (2014)",Drive
256,rebecca-ry,More than a car film.,9,19 February 2012,"You wouldn't expect 'Drive' to be so subtle, you would expect it to be a high-octane thriller with a new twist every step of the way. I'm glad it was not as I had expected, I was pleasantly surprised with this film. The acting is good, the down-played dialogue between practically all of the characters works well for the most part. Ryan Gosling is excellent and because this is the first film I have seen him in I would be convinced to watch more of his roles. The main thing that I noticed with the dialogue was even when Gosling and Carey Mulligan's characters were not talking, you couldn't help but smile. It's very difficult to evoke emotion from the audience with hardly any dialogue. At some points it can be slightly frustrating however, there are some points where you desperately want someone to say something! The car chased and car scenes in general are brilliant. For too long we have seen the CGI routines of the Fast and Furious series on the big screen and we often mistake that for talent. 'Drive' shows us how a car chase should be shot! The music has a great impact on this film, the 80s style techno music alongside the beautiful camera work in scenes with Gosling and Mulligan convert LA's littered streets and landscape into sheer beauty. The script is extremely clever, for at least an hour the film is slow moving but good, with the characters all getting along well and slowly we see the protagonist become more and more violent - the violence in this film can be quite shocking and is extremely graphic in some points.I have never been a tremendous fan of car films but this is an exception. I wouldn't even say it is a car film, it focuses a lot more on human relationships despite most shots being in the interior of a car. I can see why this was one of the films of 2011, it fools you on numerous occasions and leaves you thinking 'wow'. I would strongly recommend this film to anyone, even if you're not a fan of car films, you will still enjoy this film greatly.",Drive

Unfortunately, this movie did not live up to that hype and the most frustrating thing was the sound quality - quiet dialogues were being followed by loud engine roars, even synthpop influenced soundtrack was loud compared to most of the dialogues.The movie is called ""Drive"" and the getaway after the heist scene at the beginning was promising - made me expect a lot of cool car chase scenes but that plot was barely touched again.

259,raphaklopper,"Best Art-house movie ever made, with shi#t blowing up!",9,26 September 2013,"Nicolas Winding Refn, the Danish director of ""Art -House"" genre, who already had explored various themes in his films with a beautiful-looking: the Danish mafia in the ""Pusher"" trilogy; a violent prisoner in ""Bronson""; a mute-dumb badass Viking without an eye in ""Valhalla Rising""; all with a beautiful direction and full of metaphors on the subject on study, and FULL of violence. But his greatest critical success and ultimately the public's attention would be with this masterpiece! ""Drive"" tells the story of Ryan Gosling's character, a mysterious man with several jobs: one as a part-job being a movie-stuntman making stunts with cars; the rest of the day as a mechanic; at night he enters in the world of crime as a getaway driver. Everything seems to change in his life when thanks to his boss of the workshop, Shannon (Bryan Cranston), the driver begins to approach his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan), who has a long nurtured passion. Days pass and the driver gets closer and closer of Irene and her son creating a great relationship. But everything changes when Irene's husband returns from prison bringing with it immense dangers to the only family that the Driver ever had.I know, the synopsis sounds like another cliché action movie with a badass character, but that's where the genius of the film begins. Nicolas Winding Refn is known for putting in his films varied metaphors in the topic to be explored. And what is the topic of the movie? Well, it is simply the action genre (a theme exploring another theme, intriguing right?). Perhaps this is the reason for the poor reception that the film had with the young crowd, the trailers and synopsis sounded like a good action movie just for good popcorn, and ended up going much deeper than that, but all the clichés are here.Gosling's character is the typical movie's action hero: don't talk much and when he speaks are phrases that make you crack a smile on your face and think (wow, what a badass); know how to handle weapons well and never gets hurt after a fight; drive cars as a master engaging in awesome car- chases; and of course, has a soft heart. Nicolas along with screenwriter Hossein Amini try to explore the human side of this type of hero, they are human with its good and pure side, but at the same time dark and violent side. Giving the film a lot of metaphors.Nicolas is known for its intense moments of silent in his films that many consider boring, but serve as reflective moments. Here, these moments are not only reflective but show the reality of the film (come on, ask yourself, how many times have you been in a room with someone you doesn't know without saying word embarrassed? Neither the badass hero escapes this.). And this is possibly the film of Nicolas with more people talking, even the driver (no main character of the films Nicolas almost never said a word), giving the film an excellent, realistic and even humorous narrative to its characters.In technical aspects, the film is almost perfect. As always, Nicolas deliver's a beautiful direction and the right use of lighting and slow motion at the silent and dialog moments, and also the superb action scenes. And the movie contains a varied and beautiful soundtrack; all songs have the same theme, what is to be a hero, also serving as a metaphor.In performances, all exceptional: Ryan Gosling predictably has an extraordinary performance, even not speaking much he shines as the troubled-badass hero in the quest to be a good person; Bryan Cranston, if you ever watched ""Breaking Bad"" knows how great it is here. He also another cliché in the movie, at the same time he is the old mentor he is the comic-relief; Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman as the villains Bernie and Nino, both superb but also serve as a metaphor for the story, even the bad guys are human villains with their own problems.Surely, the masterpiece of Nicolas, a magnificent direction, with a great narrative, splendid performances. All together and put into a theme that seemed inexorable, that ended up being an excellent aesthetic and human study of the action genre in perhaps the best art -house movie ever made, with amazing sh#t blowing up.9/10",Drive
260,chaz-28,Outstanding direction creates existential study of a driver,8,18 September 2011,"The driver in Drive is just that, he drives. He has no past and even no name. One would guess prison was a part of his past but that is just a guess. The driver only has two distinguishing characteristics, he is extremely adept behind the wheel of a car and he wears a strikingly odd white jacket with an orange scorpion on the back. The scorpion's meaning is somewhat explained and furthers a philosophical undercurrent in Drive which is not apparent in the previews.The audience I saw Drive with on a late Saturday night opening weekend started to laugh at the screen and mock the actors, the direction, and the jacket. Their expectations did not match what was unfolding on the screen. They expected multiple car chases between the driver and the cops, backstabbing crooks, and action sequences just for the sake of action sequences. Well, those clichés are not here and it transforms what would have been just another Gone in 60 Seconds to a film which operates on a different, more introspective plane.The actors in Drive are well known as true actors who respect their craft: Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, and Albert Brooks. Gosling has shown his chops before with The Believer, Half Nelson, and Lars and the Real Girl and might have the fewest lines of dialogue ever by a film's main character. Carey Mulligan, still resonant from An Education, pulls off a sympathetic next door neighbor who needs the driver's help even though she may not know it. Bryan Cranston is assigned a more stock character and Albert Brooks who usually plays bumbling schlubs gets a turn as an antagonist for once. The only sour note is Ron Perlman who just plays an extension of his Sons of Anarchy character.This script requires true actors to flesh it out. Scenes with words are few and far between so that facial expressions say more in conversations than dialogue does, especially between Gosling and Mulligan. There is a reason you will not see Jennifer Aniston and Ryan Reynolds in Drive; there is now way they could just sit in a room, stare at each other, and talk to each other with their eyes and cheek bones.Drive's director, Nicolas Winding Refn, won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival for one reason, necessity. If the film does not need it, it is not there. For example, when the driver is waiting outside while a robbery is going on inside, there is no sound. If you were waiting in a car with the radio off, it would be exceptionally quiet, just like in the film. There is no background noise, no radio on, nothing. The audience was absolutely quiet right along with the film straining to hear what was going on in the building next door. Refn could have extended the car chase scenes with more screeching tires, made the scenes between Gosling and Mulligan more romantic, and turned down the accompanying existential philosophy. By choosing not to do these things is why he won Best Director.Existential is the most apt word to describe the driver. He gives his own life meaning and purpose. His background is never brought up once, but something in his past has shaped his actions. He lives his life sincerely despite the myriad distractions of obviously crooked associates, menacing goons, and the unfamiliar terrain of romantic feelings towards a woman. What truly makes Drive so good is all of the pitfalls it avoids by just focusing the camera on Gosling on Mulligan and letting it go from there. Mainstream audiences looking for standard car chases and fist fights on a Saturday night will not understand Drive; the philosophical undercurrents here make them uncomfortable. Drive is for those who appreciate diving in a bit deeper rather than wading in the cliché kiddy pool.",Drive

262,TheGreatMarkukini,The most insane hit and run of my life,8,6 March 2019,"I have tried to watch the movie for three times but the main culprit of my quitting was a very bizarre sound work where ambiance is twice as loud as dialogs and you cannot distinguish a word...Nevertheless I gathered my will into a fist and put the pedal to the metal! Let's go!Alternating action with moments of serenity has an outstanding effect that surprises you, kind of like driving on the narrow mountain road with sharp turns during the night. Pitch dark cliff on one side and the high wall of rocks on the other, you expect the oncoming vehicle but still are agitated by it. That's exactly what is happening: cruising with Ryan Gosling, you are prepared to skilled and dangerous driving but with an extremely bewildering notion of getaway.But then BANG! You cannot understand what's happening. Everything seems different but the same; characters are there but not exactly. You try to get up from the ground and shake the shock away but your arms limply fall back as you keep watching. The events have a great deal of connection between them but the way that the hero reacts to the occurring situations doesn't want to comfortably fit into your head. It is truly amazing how a character can be so mercurial.The feeling of astonishment stays with you up till the wheels of the movie keep on turning, because the shots are so stunning that you want to pause and make yet another screensaver. Besides a total brain elation and visual ecstasy, you will get the musical euphoria as the soundtrack is right on point.
Concluding everything, ""Drive"" actually was my only hit and run experience. I was left there for some time not being able to understand what happened and what to think except for a nudging masochistic urge to watch more.",Drive

264,WasiReviews,An Introvert's Dream,10,6 September 2020,"Going into this movie as an extrovert I was shocked by the fact in the first twenty minutes the main character says almost nothing. Ryan Gosling is a getaway driver without a name we just see him referred to as the Driver. When a heist goes wrong his past shows back up we never learn about it but from what he does to the antagonists you get a quite a vivid idea. This movie requires a lot of patience, understanding and accepting this Driver character is an introvert. His love story with a single mom with a child shows how much weight is behind each scene in the movie from an introvert's perspective. The visuals are insanely pleasing even nine years later and I'm glad this film did very well at the box office so that films with the same dark Los Angeles vibes like Nightcrawler were made.",Drive
265,Treyroo,Wheelman extraordinaire,7,24 November 2012,"Precision driving can mean the difference between a long prison sentence and a clean getaway. For the right price and with the right connection, those are services you can obtain once and only once and Ryan Gosling provides them.Starring as a character that is never given a name, Gosling works as a mechanic for Shannon (played by Bryan Cranston) who also allows him to use vehicles brought to his garage for servicing for his illicit activities. In addition, he does the occasional bit of stunt driving for Hollywood films. Not to mention the fact that Shannon's (Cranston's) associate Bernie Rose (played way against type by Albert Brooks) is considering a proposal Shannon made to have Driver race professionally with Bernie (Brooks) as their benefactor. Things appear to be going swimmingly until Driver offers assistance to a neighbor being coerced to perform a robbery. The neighbor, Standard (played by Oscar Isaac), was recently released from prison and fears what his associate will do to his family. A family that Driver became quite close to in the time between when he met them and the day Standard was released.The violence is a little gruesome, and the surreal nature of a character with no name is something that didn't actually strike me until after I left the theater. That said, the story is interesting, the performances spectacular and the general feel of the film is right on target. It is light-years ahead of films like The Transporter that seek to turn their characters into superheroes.",Drive
266,eve_dolluk,Decent Film,9,1 November 2011,"Well I was a bit unsure what to expect with this film, I saw the rating which was high and then I looked at the reviews. There was more hated it reviews than loved it although the hated it reviews seemed to be expecting an action film. The loved it reviews waxed lyrical at its art and talked about film noir feel.Well all I can say was it was a decent Film with good and bad points.The Soundtrack was brilliant and this did a lot of the storytelling, whatever was missing from the dialogue was covered brilliantly by the soundtrack. For this alone the film may get a second viewing.Cinematography was very good, I heard people mention film noir which I didn't really see and art house which again I never saw. For me it was just atmospheric and the shots merely gave you a close feeling to what was going on. You always felt close to what was happening rather than looking in from a distance.The action in the film was good and to the point rather than long drawn out action scenes that I find boring, there are only so many crashes and explosions I can take and to be honest I've seen it all before. If I haven't seen it before then its usually something that is beyond belief and then I lose interest.The acting is decent, the dialogue is rare at times and the film-makers rely heavily on expression and the 80% of how we communicate without speaking, something that film-makers forget about at times.The story is basic so there is nothing new there at all and sometimes you struggle to believe it fully. So there is that added situation where you start questioning things and saying to yourself "" that wouldn't happen "" e.t.c There is at times a lack of momentum although in some reviews I read it seems people have no patience at all, the lack of momentum is replaced by atmosphere and feeling which is a refreshing change for most of it but at times can feel a little contrived.If I'm being honest I preferred the film Bronson from the same director but this was in my opinion better than Valhalla Rising or Pusher. This guy certainly has an eye and ear for the audio and visual experience but I wonder if it only works with a certain type of viewer.Overall I gave it a 7 out of 10, The IMDb rating seems slightly high and then there is a lot of reviewers who gave it a 1 which is madness.If your expecting a high adrenalin action popcorn flick with nitro boosters and lots of crashes in all the gory detail then you won't find it here. If you want to watch a decent film about a stunt driver/getaway driver who has affection for his female neighbour and who gets himself a bit too deep then this will suit you fine. There is a little bit of action a little bit of violence, a little bit of romance, and lashings of coolness but very little emotion.If you do find the first 30 or 40 mins slow then bear with it just don't expect the Nitro's or explosions !!",Drive
267,toll-8,Gosling proves he really is damn good,7,27 September 2012,"Set in present day LA but with a large finger pointing towards the 70's & 80's, Drive stars Ryan Gosling as an unnamed driver, alongside Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Christina Hendricks, and Ron Perlman. An all star ensemble cast you would have to say. Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, of Bronson fame, Drive is an action thriller with a hint of old school movies as an influence. For me A Clockwork Orange seemed to be on show here.Driver works in a car garage, drives cars for movies, and getaway cars for robberies. He is the best driver around and is soon to be the racing for Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks combined adventure into NASCAR racing. However our anti-hero soon becomes distracted when he strikes a connection with a woman in his building, Irene, (Mulligan) and her son. He soon finds out her husband is to be released from prison and when he is the husband is instantly threatened unless he does one last heist. Out of his infatuation with Irene, Driver decides to help her husband in order to protect her from this violent mob, only the job they undertake goes array and Driver is left holding a million in cash of one of the most dangerous men in town. Our Driver must act fast using cunning, speed, and ultra violence to be able to escape these men and protect the woman and child he has fallen for.For starters the acting is fantastic. Gosling is given very little dialogue, very little back story, and very little characterisation. He spends most of the film silent, talking only when he is spoken to. His thoughts and emotions are portrayed through his expressions and his body language alone and this is something we haven't seen Gosling do before. He shows that he really can lead a film and without much to say as well. His character change about half way through is also handled excellently, from the quiet, subtle character in one line becomes frightening when sitting in a diner he snaps at a man, 'shut your mouth before I kick your teeth down your throat and shut it for ya!' This is the moment Driver finally shows some emotion and in one line Gosling has intrigued us into who this character really is. Mulligan is sweet as the girl next door and Cranston really shows how good an actor he is, once again not showing us any signs of any other character he has played in the past. Another star was Albert Brooks as the primary villain. He may seem as an odd choice considering the whole way through you will hear him as Nemo's Father from Finding Nemo. But in some violent actions we realise he certainly isn't a clown fish. The acting really does drive this story that actually has very little substance in terms of plot but delivers in performance and direction by Refn. If I had to criticise a problem with the characters it is that I never particularly felt hooked by them and by the end of the film I didn't feel overly moved I just felt like I had watched some top acting in a good film.The music certainly has to be mentioned. From the opening scene where the music purrs in the background along with Gosling's heart rate and car engine during an eight minute chase sequence through LA, to the booming songs from the Chromatics, Vincent Belorgey, and College. The music gives you a sense of where you are and a big hint to the 70's and 80's. It fits in perfectly with how the film is told and the visuals. Gosling's attire is very thirty years ago and his actions whilst wearing it reminded me of Alex from A Clockwork Orange. Even the feel and look of the opening credits sets the style of the movie instantly, the letters being as if scribbled on and in fluorescent pink. A nice touch from Refn.Overall the film is a must see. It maybe isn't quite as out of this world, like many have said, in terms of story but the acting, music, and vision are things you have to see. The direction of the opening scene alone is also worth paying the money for; the camera never leaves the car whilst Gosling attempts to escape the cops during a getaway. It throws you into the film almost instantly. The slight problem is that after this it does become quite slow whilst we learn the placid nature of our Driver, and his emotional connection with Irene. Here we never feel like they totally connect and I was never drawn into these scenes. When the action kicks in about half way we are treated to a severe case of the ultra-violence, and despite being very well done it doesn't particularly make us care for the characters. That being said you shouldn't see this for the story as it is one downfall in an otherwise very good movie. Gosling alone makes this worth watching, and combine that with the excellent music and great direction and you will be very happy with the film you have just watched. Recommended to all those out there who would love a hint back to the 80's.3.5 / 5 For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",Drive
268,twilliams76,They don't get much better than this,10,28 September 2011,"The Best Picture race has begun ... although I fear this one won't survive the Academy's final cut (I'd venture to say it's ""too cool"" for The Academy). Drive is a wonder to behold and watch.Drive is a film about a driver who is a film stunt man and a random getaway driver for various people who needs his services for a short yet solid five minutes of work -- the film's opening cat-and-mouse scene sets the tone for what's to come. The Driver is played by Ryan Gosling (The Notebook, Half Nelson, Crazy Stupid Love) and he is a man of few words. He appears to drive simply to have a purpose.Driver soon meets a young mother, Irene(Carey Mulligan - Pride & Prejudice, An Education, Wall Street 2), who lives in his apartment building ... and the two become quasi-friends as they both tend to be guarded and rather quiet although their facial expressions and body language tell us everything we need to know about them. Driver quickly befriends her young son ... but their friendship becomes strained upon the arrival of his father/her husband, Standard, (Oscar Isaac - Robin Hood, Sucker Punch) ... a recovering criminal with ties to some total losers who don't want to allow him to exit/leave their line of work so that he can honestly provide for his family.Believing that he has the ability to help Standard obtain a life of respectability, Driver sets out to help him on one final heist ... only things don't go as planned ... for anybody. Albert Brooks (Broadcast News, Mother) and Ron Perlman (City of Lost Children, Hellboy) play some fellow wannabe-thugs and Mad Men's Christina Hendricks shows up briefly as Blanche, a fellow co-hort in crime.With a pulsating soundtrack (featuring some awesome songs!), the film comes alive and becomes ripe with feeling as Driver (himself) experiences a rebirth of feelings that had long been dormant. At times gentle and at time brutally violent ... Drive is an artistic triumph as it is a mesmerizing watch. Layered with metaphor (note Driver's jacket), superior lighting and sound editing, and an ingenious use of character names (Standard, Blanche, Irene means ""peace"" etc.), Drive is one of those RARE films that make you glad to be alive in this time of cinema.Drive is one of the few films I have seen in recent years that remind you of life ... and what it means to feel and have a sense of worth and belonging. It does seem to be a film of few words ... but extra words were not necessary ... as Drive is alive. And thank God I am too.",Drive

Given this summary, you would expect exciting chase scenes, a dumb plot and probably some likable but slightly sleazy characters.The film is nothing like that, though. There are action scenes, certainly, and some of them are quite exciting, but the focus is very much on the human drama, and especially the relationship between the (unnamed) main character and his single-mother neighbour, played by Carey Mulligan.All this is filmed beautifully by the rapidly rising director Nicholas Winding Refn. It's visually quite a stunning film, and the main character has an underlying innocence that sometimes bursts through his near-autistic social awkwardness. I wouldn't go as far as some who named it unequivocally Film of the Year, but I look forward to more from Gosling and Winding Refn.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/drive-2011.html",Drive
270,robinski34,Far Beyond Driven,9,2 August 2013,"Jaw-dropping piece of cinema from Nicolas Winding Refn, there isn't a weak link in the chain from the top-billed performances of Gosling and Mulligan down to the knuckle-dragging henchmen, everyone brings their A-game. Refn has a unique voice as his previous work (including Bronson and Fear X) ably demonstrates and this must be his strongest outing to date. Gosling's performance is beautifully empty, the epitome of 'spare' while Mulligan effortlessly illuminates the screen, making it impossible to tear ones eyes off her in much the same way as in 'An Education' (or anything else she's been in).These two performances alone would make an excellent film, but it is in the 'supporting' roles that 'Drive' is elevated from a good movie to a definitive piece of modern cinema that will stand out for years to come as a beacon of what can be achieved with total belief in a good project. Ron Perlman and Christina Hendricks know how to captivate an audience. Hendricks owns every one of her scenes in the peerless 'Mad Men' and Perlman is the godfather of the twisted soul, but thankfully is given the chance to play it straight up here and does so to brutal effect, whereas Hendricks delivers a nicely judged if brief appearance transitioning from bravado to a much truer, baser emotion.These four performances are to be expected from the individuals in question, but the standouts are those ones that come from left field. Albert Brooks was for so long the straight man in funny movies but who knew he had this in him. His turn as Bernie Rose is every bit as menacing as De Niro at his best/'worst', but Brooks' foil is possibly even more surprising. Brian Cranston, for so long delivering howlingly funny slapstick comedy as Malcolm's dad, in 'Malcolm in the Middle', turns in a beautifully nuanced performance as Gosling's mentor Shannon. None of the main characters is entirely good or evil, with the probable exception of Mulligan's 'Irene' and Perlman's 'Nino' and it is perhaps that facet that makes 'Drive' as enthralling as it is.'Drive' could be seen as yet another demonstration that so much that is exciting in modern storytelling is coming from Scandinavia, however I think it is actually a vivid illustration that the best cinema comes from the melting pot, with no barrier preventing directors, actors, writers and all the other creative fields from coming together. It's strong stuff in places, but if you can get past that you are in for one of the most memorable films in the last 20 years.",Drive

I felt as if Gosling was asleep throughout the entire film and the director must have been heavily sedated. Imagine my shock when I saw all the rave reviews on IMDb. I was watching TV last night and came across this movie on the ESPN channel so decided to give it another chance. May be I was tired when I first watched it or didn't have an opened mind. Plus it's been 3 years and I've changed so why not.Boy am I glad I decided to watch this masterpiece again. It drew you in with the car chase and kept you hooked with the beautiful and hunting scenes and music. Gosling was perfect as the reserved and mysterious neighbor.

273,StonedMagician,Incredible: 10,10,27 July 2019,"""If I drive for you, you give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window. Anything happens in those five minutes and I'm yours, no matter what. I don't sit in while you're running it down, I don't carry a gun. I drive."" Such are the words of the nameless main character of the film Drive, from Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn and portrayed by Ryan Gosling. This is a character without any explanation or backstory. He balances two jobs: a Hollywood stuntman and heist wheelman. Both involve driving. And that's that. On the surface, Drive sounds quite a bit like a typical, run-of-the-mill action film. Car chases, bloody action, hot chicks, and lots of money are common sights in modern films of this type. However, Drive manages to rise heads and shoulders above its contemporaries using three things: direction, acting, and style, employing all three with an artfulness that is all too rare these days. Especially in action movies. The director, Refn, has made quite a few films before this one, most of which involved crime of some type or another. As such, Drive is not entirely unfamiliar territory for him. This is a fact that is apparent in every frame of the movie. In no shot is there any space that is not filled with something unimportant or uninteresting. It has been edited down so that there is no dull moment, no scene that is any less than riveting. In every scene, you know exactly what is happening, and you can feel everything. The quiet scenes are filled to the brim with emotion, with all characters remaining reserved yet strangely expressive throughout the whole movie. These scenes in particular seem to have been filed so meticulously that you can see the dozens of takes it must have taken to find just the right angle. Occupying these sections and others are actors who seem to have been made specifically for their roles in Drive.These include the aforementioned Gosling, Carey Mulligan as the tender and beautiful Irene, Albert Brooks as the profane Bernie Rose, and Bryan Cranston (a singularly phenomenal actor from the equally awesome TV series Breaking Bad) as the Driver's employer, Shannon. Every one of them bring their own flavor to their scenes, in a way making them the stars of their screen time, rather than star Gosling. Cranston infuses his scenes with a hint of desperation, as he is a man struggling to get by with his auto-repair shop business. Mulligan is a subdued, beautiful, and caring woman whose love for her son is her main (ahem) driving force in the film. Brooks is a man of overt menace, who makes you shiver even when showing off his nicer side. Gosling has simultaneously the most and least significant role in the film. He reflects the emotions of those around him, but manages to subtly twist them into his own, and conveys more with a single glance and fewer than twenty lines of dialogue than most stars manage in entire films. Whenever he is on the screen, you might be focusing on someone else, but the Driver will always be making you wonder what he'll do next. The style of the film is ultimately what is the most notable aspect of Drive. Colors are comic-book rich, making each object in a shot instantly noticeable. The alternating atmosphere of the film is extremely, and fittingly, jarring, with genuinely shocking violence preceded and followed by quiet, meaningful dialogue. Refn does not exclude anything: entire conversations are shown, unedited, complete with the long silences in between lines. Concurrently, the violence is unflinchingly graphic. ""Viewers with an aversion to blood and brutality need not apply"" is a good enough way to sum that up. However, in another masterstroke, absolutely everything feels like it means something. Some of the film probably does not mean anything. But it all feels important, a fact that will keep you riveted to this visceral, unique, and emotionally rewarding triumph.",Drive
274,austin-takahashi,Drive - 4.5 Stars,9,23 April 2013,"One scene that defines the stylish and disciplined vigor of ""Drive"" transpires inside a slim, narrow elevator. Our heroes enter the elevator; the doors slam shut. By the time they open again, we have been taken through a hint of suspense, a moment of intimacy, and finally, a burst of ultra-violence. That the movie was able to depict and contain three different moods in a limited space and time astounds me. This is the rare kind of movie that fully values its existence, using every second of its running time for its benefit.""Drive"" stars Ryan Gosling, the Oscar-nominated actor who was given more international appreciation in his previous work as Jacob Palmer in ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". Here, a name eludes him as promotions only refer to his character as ""Driver"". The inquisitive effect of a screen name like Driver reminds us of Edward Norton's character in Fight Club, who was only identified in the credits as ""Narrator"". Both evoke the same aura of ambiguity, although the Gosling character is more subtle and composed.Driver's professional and personal life is centered around cars. He occupies the role of a stunt driver for the movies. He also works as a mechanic, fixing cars when he's not flipping them on set. Beyond that, he also participates in robberies by agreeing to be the getaway driver. Driving seems to keep Driver occupied. He hardly ever speaks. Ask him a question, and his words halt after the answer is given. There are not more than two instances in the entire film where he speaks three sentences in a row. His quiet nature strays away from conventional personalities and takes us to a person so perplexing, even his fellow characters join the audience in trying to understand him.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/drive-movie-review/",Drive
275,winak,Boring !!!!,4,31 January 2018,"If I were allowed to summarise Drive in short, I would say. Extremely slow paced movie, ordinary dialogues with sleep inducing long awkward pauses. Ryan Gosling does not have either the voice or persona for the character he plays in the movie. Albert Brooks looked more like a literary character than a killer. Ron Pearlman and Bryan Cranston were underutilised, while Carrie Mulligan was more or less a wallflower in the movie. This movie had a promising start but meanders into a dull, boring affair with an ending that flat lines. Thank you for wasting my time.",Drive

Don't take the word ""derivative"" to be a criticism, it isn't meant that way. Its OK to be derivative, when one is deriving inspiration from some of the best there is. I didn't know anything about this film before viewing and for the first half hour I was convinced it was a re-make of Walter Hills 1978 classic ""Driver"" The characters of Cowboy and the unnamed driver are virtually identical, both have an icy cold detachment from the world which only thaws when viewed through the windscreen of a speeding car. Both live in low rent apartments or hotel rooms with seemingly no personnel possessions and both have the same Achilles heel. (is it a co-incidence both leading actors are Ryans? Probably ) The other lead character, LA, specifically LA at night is pure Michael Mann transplanted from Heat and Collateral, the strange 80s soundtrack and green neon title graphics a nod to Miami Vice and later Man Hunter. Mann and Hill were contemporaries, influencing each other, where Hill had his Driver, Mann had his Thief and both clearly have influenced Winding Refn, which is a very good thing indeed.",Drive
277,kevjfarrell,What a surprise!,10,17 October 2015,"Somehow managed to miss this one and catch it on late nite TV and I'm really glad I did. This is an atmospheric and stylish action-thriller.If you enjoy movies like No Country For Old Men and 100 Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead, then this one will probably appeal to you too. I loved everything about this movie. There are a number of scenes which require you to squirm.What this movie lacks in dialogue, it makes up for it with sheer style. Think less is more. It takes a superb director to pull off a movie like this. What a great job. You really need to give it your full attention as every scene is worthy of your appreciation and understanding. The storyline in itself isn't that unique, but there's something about this one that really hooks you in. The soundtrack is very stylish too!! I loved everything about it and really can't find fault with it, hence the top rating. Classy movie - and I think I'll buy the soundtrack too.",Drive
278,Franklie,Love the story. Hate the violence and the vocab.,6,25 November 2014,"I really wanted to like this movie and wanted to recommend it to others because the story and the actors are so great, but the violence and the vocab make it barely worth watching or sharing.I watched the DVD version and the TV version and neither works well. The violence in the TV version is still horrific and the dialogue given to cover the foul language is usually pathetic. Why not just write decent fierce vocabulary in the first place? Definitely appreciated that the edited TV version exists though. It would be great if all movies were readily available in their edited forms.The story of Drive is great though. If you love having someone to root for and hoping that the baddies get their comeuppance, then you find that here.Some complain about the pace of the film, that wasn't a problem. I understood and appreciated the artistic genre behind it. But intense stories have been successfully told and loved for centuries w/o the need for graphic violence or foulness.

280,danjakubik,An action film for those who usually don't like action films,9,22 June 2012,"""Drive "" is a film, very much about mood and style, that exceeds the usual genre expectations for action films. It's an action / art film.. Ryan Gosling plays a quiet, loner, movie stunt driver and mechanic, simply known as driver. He occasionally works as a getaway driver for robberies. He meets and begins to fall for his attractive female neighbor, who's husband is in prison. Driver befriends this woman's son. Her husband shortly returns home from prison and driver decides to help him out with his problem. Unfortunately, this problem involves gangsters. I'm not a fan of the action genre, but this film set in LA, impressed me with it's style, mood and use of music. The cinematography is very creative an effective. I found myself absorbed from beginning to end. The opening robbery is definitely an adrenalin rush. ""Drive"" works as action, drama, thriller and mystery. Driver portrays the loner protagonist character, as Clint Eastwood was in the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns of the 1960's. As characters, driver and his female neighbor have little dialogue, which lends itself to building mood. The minimalist music score is very effective to enhance mood.Overall, ""Drive"" is a film that pays homage to noir mythology and combines it with modern day extreme violence, which some may not find a likable combination. I was a little shocked by the brutal scenes of violence, but these served for character.""Drive"" was nominated for the Palm De Or and Best Director at The Cannes Film Festival, winning for Best Director.",Drive

282,dmasursky,Extremely disappointing,4,20 March 2012,"I hated this movie, mostly because it could have been so much more interesting than it was. It was very stylized (a la Tarantino), which is memorable in its way, but ultimately there was so little ""there"" there. I thought Ryan Gosling's performance was a real tour de force - you never doubted that his character was all the many, many things that he revealed himself to be. But the intriguing relationships, between Driver and Irene, and especially between Shannon and Driver, and even between Shannon and Bernie, were introduced and then abandoned for a trite gangster plot that's been done about a thousand times before, though (minor spoiler alert) the shot of the 2 men's shadows at the end was almost worth sitting through the gruesome endless violence - this movie had more corpses littered about the stage than a Shakespearean tragedy. I was enthralled during the first half of the movie, but just irritated by the second half, and so disappointed. Is that all the filmmaker wanted to say?",Drive
283,nlytnd_1,Character development with little dialogue.,8,9 September 2012,"I can't think of any movies off the top of my head that builds characters without the use of dialogue, but somehow this director pulls it off. The actor who plays the driver dude does a kick-ass job, just with the use of facial expressions. His likability makes this movie that much more enjoyable. I'm surprised there aren't more people on here talking about how bad the 80's sounding pop theme music was throughout this movie. There is little excuse for something so unfitting and wretch-id! Some of the undertone music throughout was good and the opera music towards the end was fitting and I understood it's purpose. But the intro, the middle and the outro your forced to listen to several minutes of this weird pop crap that was even painful back in the 80's when they would do that crap. Anyway's, I didn't deduct it in my rating as much as I wanted too, because this movie is definitely not a 7. But what were they thinking!!!",Drive

285,DJRMewzique,An unexpected enjoyable ride.,7,12 February 2012,"Despite good reviews, good box office and starring Ryan Gosling, I had very little interest in seeing ""Drive."" But, with an Oscar nomination for Best Sound Editing, it finally ended up on my list.And it's a pretty good film! I found it interesting that from the opening of the film, with the old-school electro beats and a title font that is reminiscent of old 80s films like ""The Flamingo Kid,"" my expectations went up. And they weren't necessarily let down.""Drive"" is about a guy, played by the ever-gorgeous Ryan Gosling, known only as, you guessed it, The Driver, who works as a stunt driver on films and as a mechanic...and on the side, he is a for-hire getaway driver for criminals. After meeting his lovely neighbour, Irene (played by Carey Mulligan, Oscar-nominated in 2009 for ""An Education"") and falling for her, when her husband is released from prison and needs help on a heist, The Driver steps up to help the woman he has fallen for and her son by helping her husband. And the heist goes terribly wrong and subsequently puts everyone in his life in jeopardy.With an absolutely amazing soundtrack and some graphic uber-violence, along with a couple of very effective car chase scenes, ""Drive"" is a pretty good action film that has it's moments and is extremely well-written and well-acted. Gosling is stoic but effective as the mysterious Driver while Mulligan continues to impress. However, many speculated that Albert Brooks , nominated for a Golden Globe for his role as a mob guy, would get an Oscar nomination, but I felt the performance by multiple-Emmy-Award-winning Bryan Cranston was far more memorable. Rounding out the effective cast is Oscar Isaac, Ron Perlman and ""Mad Men""'s Christina Hendricks.A very odd story about a real left-of-centre hero, ""Drive"" is a surprisingly enjoyable ride.",Drive
286,FlorisV,Passable,6,18 January 2017,"This film was OK. Often slow and understated, it looked good and had some mystery to it because of the main character. Unfortunately he gets less and less believable. He's not just a great driver but also an excellent stuntman. Oh and he's also a natural born mechanic. Oh and he can take out any random mafioso muscle with his bare hands and knows how to quickly grab any handgun or rifle they're carrying, as well as easily grab their knives out of their hands, even when just stabbed and heavily bleeding....Refn's films had a reputation for dreaminess, don't look for realism in this picture. But I did emotionally connect with the neighbours of the protagonist like he did himself. Plus there's a nice atmosphere, nice synth soundtrack but it doesn't fit too well with the brutally violent crime story narrative.After having watched part of Neon Demon I felt this film would hold my attention for longer and it did with some shock moments but it was rather those of the cheap kind and certainly not cinematic splendor.But mostly the film does what it was probably intended to do, to keep you on the edge of your seat at least a little bit like a decent crime thriller, rather than all sorts of raving about the next cinematic masterpiece. If only it had more suspense, a lot of things just went way too easy for the protagonist as if he had been killing bad guys all his life.",Drive
287,DVR_Brale,Character oriented psychological neo-noir slow burn criminal drama with romance as underpin,8,8 February 2019,"This movie is not about cars and driving. It's about something in man's nature which makes him susceptible to downfall to darkness and violence. That downfall can lead to problems with ones identity and so we're symbolically never told what is the name of our main protagonist since names can carry meanings. He is simply 'driver' who wears a famous scorpion jacket which is a substitute for a name the meaning of which we have yet to discover and verify.So we follow a driver that looks and behaves as a pretty normal guy who, inter alia, works as a getaway driver for criminals. He doesn't carry a gun or participate in heists but rather only drives criminals to a safe zone. We see him working in the introductory scene and later very rarely. What we see for the rest of the movie is how this 'slight' involvement in criminal activities affects him and people around him.Tone of the movie is neo-noir, a mixture of Lynchian dialogues and Fincher's darkish colors. Both of these are important. Since driver doesn't speak much you have to read his face and manoeuvres to try to understand what he thinks and how he feels. Besides, remember that he sometimes wears a jacket with a famous large scorpion sign on his back which has an important meaning and role. Concerning the overall dark and sometimes very violent milieu, I came to see that it's not gratuitous. It's role is to horrify you for the sake of better understanding of driver's character and decisions he makes. Violence first occurrence splits the movie into two parts which in turn adds to sharper contrast between amiable driver we got to know and his dark side. And that leads to greater shock value depending on the image of driver you had created throughout the first half. That shock can be pretty effective and lead you to reevalute your assessment especially if you had put driver's involvement with bad guys in second plan and put his tenderness first. Ultimately. I'd say Drive is a character oriented psychological neo-noir slow burn criminal drama with romance as underpin.Furthermore, there are other two things worth mentioning: soundtrack and camera angles. First really stands out and even plays a role because sometimes words used in a song depict directors intentions. Second is harder to notice at first but I urge you to take a look at YouTube analysis for better insights which will certainly make you appreciate Drive more and maybe make you watch it more than once. The point is that camera angles used in different situations reinforce a particular aspect of driver's character, e.g. low shots making him look superior and dominating.When we take everything together, Drive turns out to be a pretty solid and serious movie about driving forces behind some man's actions. If you're looking for a slow and more or less sophisticated multi-genre journey into darkness and violence, you've come to the right place.",Drive

289,vishaal811,A Modern Taxi Driver,10,12 July 2015,"Drive is an art-house film that not only manages to keep the viewer engrossed throughout the movie but also manages to captivate audiences by the unexpected violence and the ambiguous ending.It features Ryan Gosling in the lead role as a part-time movie stunt driver. The character portrayed is strange and psychologically troubled. He is magnificently portrayed by Gosling which certainly deserves recognition. Overall, the casting is brilliant with each actor perfectly suited to their respective roles. Albert Brooks is a wiseguy and he gives an Oscar-worthy performance in a relatively small role.Unlike most mainstream movies, Drive has major portions of the movie without any dialog. The eclectic, groovy soundtrack perfectly fills the silences and manages to set the mood. Drive is a unique movie and the only comparable movie that I found was Taxi Driver which is considered as one of the greatest movies of all time. Due to the ambiguous ending, this certainly has a great repeat value and I only expect it to be better on a second viewing.",Drive
290,kismit,Didn't get it,6,17 September 2011,"I kind of think they wanted a little bit of Transporter, maybe a bit more of The Professional. What I saw was a main character that spoke so little he seemed mentally handicapped at times (no exaggeration). The driving aspect was shot to minimize the ""car chase"" theme but in so doing they took an element of excitement away. Good that they stayed away from Gone in 60 Seconds corn, but they didn't have to go quite that far. He hardly speaks to the love interest, so her interest in himis almost confusing. Anyways. not a bad film but this has to be Goslings most wooden performance yet although he didn't write it so I am not blaming him.",Drive
291,Thunderbuck,"No. Just, no.",3,17 September 2011,"This is an awful movie. Perhaps all the more so because there were the ever-so-slight hints that it might have been good.Watch the first half-hour. Gosling's (unnamed) character, when spoken to, takes ridiculously long pauses--upwards of 10 seconds--to respond.>>>Spoilers ahead The story is, um, flimsy. Porn-movie flimsy. There is a central crime to this story that never really IS explained very well (sure, it looked really cool when that other car showed up, but... wwwhy was it there, exactly?), and is really the product of a monumental coincidence. Think about it: Gosling just happens to be the driver for a holdup where his neighbor is robbing cash from a pawn shop in a heist that's really been masterminded by... the guy who's bankrolling his race car? Huh? (and, no, the story makes absolutely NO effort to explain this).As much as I love Ryan Gosling, he's just plain bad here. Maybe not ""just plain"" bad; spectacularly, pretentiously bad. I know what the creative intent was, that the character was just something of a ""blank canvas"" that others project their wants and needs on to. The biggest problem here is that Gosling can't tone down the smart and charming enough for us to believe that he's as socially isolated as his character really should be. And, again, he tends to try to substitute blankness for intensity. It doesn't work.Carey Mulligan is okay, but her character is pretty one-dimensional as well. I got zero chemistry off of the combo of her and Gosling. The kid is basically a prop. I'm sorry, I got absolutely nothing to say why this guy develops an attachment to these two.When Mulligan's husband appears, there's actually a little tension for a bit, and I began to hope for some substance (especially since he has considerably more chemistry with Mulligan than Gosling does). Sadly, ""Standard"" is killed off fairly quickly.There's no shortage of great performers in this movie, and they're mostly wasted. Ron Perlman is so awesomely menacing! And so completely under-written! And what's there is clichéd! God, what were these people thinking? Bryan Cranston has a supporting role as Gosling's partner/boss. A huge opportunity is wasted when his character's interest in the stolen money is just casually discarded. That might have actually GONE somewhere. As a ""Breaking Bad"" fan, I know just how good he can be, but the writing here is nowhere near as good, and his character, as well, is left adrift.And Albert Brooks. Who I've loved since ""Lost in America"". It breaks my heart, because he's actually awesome in this movie. One of the most compelling cinematic criminals since Brando, I kid you not. Thoughtful, emotional, utterly believable, but since he's the only character that we develop even the remotest sympathy for, he's not quite enough to redeem this mess.I was hoping for some action, at least. And there really isn't much. For a movie about a driver, there honestly isn't that much driving. The movie opens with a not-bad robbery getaway, but there's only one more serious chase later on, and even IT isn't especially noteworthy. Did none of these people even WATCH ""Bullitt""? And, speaking of car action, there's one scene where Gosling's character repeatedly rams another car. Hard. Hard enough to send it rolling off a small cliff. And yet, afterwards, we see the front end of his car, seemingly undamaged. Are mid-70s Chevelle parts really that hard to come by? There are legitimate flashes of creativity in ""Drive"". There are some genuinely original scenes of violence (and, to be fair, well-executed). Had the story and characters risen to a level where the audience might have cared, well, this might have been a different movie.This is one of those ""emperor's-new-clothes"" things the movie industry pulls on the public every once in a while. Don't fall for it.",Drive
292,blackmambamark,An art-house action flick at it's finest,9,16 September 2011,"I think we all remember hearing about Ryan Gosling right after 'The Notebook' came out. Most men, including myself, neglected the man on his acting ability. It's not a good reason to not really appreciate an actor. But when it comes to romantic flicks like that, i'm not really keen on the subject, or it's actors for that matter. But film by film, this man is starting to impress the hell out of me. Now it's about time to see what kind of chops this man has when it comes to an action film.Believe me when i say this.......it is the coolest damn action flick i've seen in quiet some time. It's not your basic shoot em' picture. It has this slight 'noire' edge to it that makes it shine much brighter than the rest.For starters, let's talk about the pace of the film. Most may call it slow, whereas i call it hypnotic. The lead played by Gosling, is a cold and quiet fellow who barely even speaks, blinks, or give any reference to his emotions. The film is littered with these somewhat awkward pauses by his character........i personally wouldn't call them awkward, because the way the film is presented, it makes them look beautiful. Case in point......in the movie ""Heat"", you know how Dinero, Kilmer, Sizemore, Trejo barely speak to one another. But the overall feeling is just so entertaining to watch? That's the exact same feeling you get when you watch this picture.But as the film rolls on, Gosling's character becomes a bit more vibrant. And by that, i mean more gory. It's not the kind of gore you would expect. Not like Tarantino gore, but more like a David Cronenberg gore. (History of Violence, Eastern Promises). You know, the settle, yet explosive gore that you really weren't expecting......which i love. And then the movie does nothing but climb higher and higher with it's level of intensity. It took this stone cold character, and molded him into one cool ass superhero.But what really sold me on this film was it's overall FEEL. The best example i can give is this........it's a cool mix between ""Heat"" and ""Taxi Driver"", with a very artistic edge. I already said that the movie is hypnotic, and i cannot stress that enough. Once the picture starts, your eyes are literally glued to the screen. The cinematography is fantastic, the musical score is hip and awesome, and the acting is top notch. All these elements were executed to perfection.Bottom Line.......i may go and see this movie again. I rarely ever do that......THAT'S how awesome this was. It's an art-house action flick at it's finest. Both men and women will drool over this movie. If you get the chance, go and see this movie......you will never regret it.",Drive

A guy smart as he proves to be during the first 90 minutes should AT LEAST have left the money to the poor widow!

294,adeckofcards,Cool - Neon - Noir,10,31 July 2020,"I once read a critic define this movie as ""the coolest of the decade"". At first it seemed like a crude statement, but after watching the movie and witnessing its first scene and opening credits, I fully understood the term and couldn't agree more.
Nicolas Winding Refn's film is tinged with pure style. Pop-eighties style, with lights and neon letters; narrative style, with a fluency of envy; visual style, with planes measured in seconds and millimeters, forming symmetry with the streets, forming proximity with its characters or simple, generating silent frames that hide more emotion than their words.
The film draws from cinema noir in an obvious way, but a modern stylization that gives it an inimitable atmosphere. However, it also influences silent movies and the film itself could be silent. The words lose their relevance and give the baton to the images, turning this film into cinema in its purest state, where images speak and transmit emotions.
In this sense, 'Drive' would not only be ""the coolest movie of the decade"", since its scope goes much further and has become an instant modern classic.",Drive
295,fluturoj,Good action movie with some good points that make you think but lacks character depth.,6,17 April 2017,"Real- life lesson: Get yourself away from dangerous men. Irene and most importantly her son were at risk for life and violence because they were the family of a criminal and same story again when they became the most important things to the driver which again is a criminal. Stay away from criminals because sooner or later you'll end dead like Shannon did or you'll be the target of their anger like Cook was. And lastly, even if you are a mafia like Nino you can't be protected 24 hours and enemies will find you and kill you. Even if you are a mafia like Nino you are no more then a human being when your arms and troops are no where to be seen. Plausibility: good. Only good because we don't know anything about the driver to judge if he could actually be that good and fearless. Plausible that a mafia can be beaten by a single man if this men waits for the right moments and circumstances. Storytelling: a bit slow at the beginning but takes off very well after the robbery. Everything connects very well and has its interesting moments. Something that is done excellently when the story is told is how they show as that the driver is good at not blinking for a long time, then they show us that Bernie is very good in killing with one stab so then when Bernie stabs the driver and he does not blink we don't know if its because he is good at not blinking or because he is dead. A powerful scene that have never seen before (or at least don't remember). The ending is an enigma too. The driver is not home when Irene knocks on his door which makes you think did he drive away for good or was he coming back? Character development: poor. The driver does not develop a bit. We don't know why he is so good at driving, we don't know why he gets involved in robbery, we don't know any of his motives. All we know is that he cares about Irene and Shannon and the kid. We don't know why he is so cold and why he kills so merciless. Acting/ Casting: Ryan Gosling is great. Makes you like a cold character, a criminal. Carey Mulligan is also good as Irene. The chemistry between Ryan and Carey is great and makes you like the couple. Overall, a good action movie with some good points that make you think but lacks character depth.",Drive
296,rhefner2002,Pretentious garbage,2,15 October 2019,"I'm losing respect for a lot of movie critics. I watched _Drive_ after seeing the 90th percentile Tomatometer ratings and reading a dozen gushing, obsequious reviews about its brilliant acting, cinematography, and atmosphere. I was not rewarded.
_Drive_ is basically a grade B slasher movie pretending to be an art house film. It starts out with an intriguing car chase and a potential developing romance, but in the second half, it degenerates into a repulsive gore fest that undermines any and all viewer credibility.
A lot of people think violence in films can be artistic. Directors like Peckinpah and Tarantino have made millions from it. Nicholas Refn is clearly trying to join the club. We get to witness a man getting a fork stuck in his eye, a knife jammed into a man's throat, and a man getting his head stomped until his head implodes like a pumpkin. Oh yeah, they're all bad guys, but are you having fun watching this? Please explain why. Sorry, folks; its just gratuitous, bloody crap.Ryan Gosling's acting consists almost entirely of staring at people with a toothpick in his mouth. Yes, laconic leading men can be interesting--Clint Eastwood, Bruce Willis, et al. Not here.
It's also shameful to see the great Albert Brooks, who built his career on creativity and comic wit, taking a role as a nasty criminal scumbag. It just doesn't work.Carey Mulligan is not the least bit impressive as the love interest. Other than the fact that she's cute and has a cute kid, there is no plausible reason why Gosling's Driver should fall in love with her. Her character is a cardboard cut out.To make matters worse, we're subjected to insipid techno-pop music on the soundtrack, including a song in the last scene about ""heroes,"" which was apparently written about Sully Sullenberger, the airline pilot who saved 155 lives by landing his plane in the Hudson River. This does not compute. Sully was not a violent murderer.Some movies are bad, but they're still well-intentioned, amusing, and entertaining. _Drive_ is just plain bad. There's nothing well-intentioned about it. It's inhumane, gratuitous, pretentious, and nausea-inducing. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one .",Drive
297,DubhDoo,A modern classic,10,3 July 2012,"This review has taken me a long time to think out, and even so I don't think I'll be able to do it justice, but here goes.Since Drive has been premièred at Cannes over a year ago it has been heaped with undying praise; during that première, it received cheering and afterwards, a ten-minute and rapturous standing ovation. Then came the reviews upon release: unanimous praise; I was hooked when a few critics compared it to The Driver and (the brilliant) Vanishing Point. Even my favourite critics - Roger Ebert, Mark Kermode and Philip Molloy - all sung its praises. Notably most critics spoke of its influences - John Hughes, Walter Hill, Gaspar Noe, Michael Mann, Alejandro Jodorowsky and even Risky Business. Influences, which if you have no knowledge of or appreciation for you may not 'get' the film. Because, make no mistake, this is a film which embraces cinematic nostalgia to its brilliant benefit; something Refn's fifth film, Bronson, also wonderfully utilized.Then there's that cast; not just the obvious star, Refn has a truly impeccable troupe of actors before us. Gosling is truly a marvel in it, making the difficult role of 'the mysterious man' magnetic, mesmerizing and utterly convincing. For me, his performance evoked memories of Clint Eastwood's The Man with No Name or Alain Delon's protagonist in the classic Le Samourai. Carey Mulligan is reliably great, perfectly portraying the love caught betwixt two men; Bryan Cranston is fantastic (what else would you expect from the best actor on TV?) in a small, but vitally significant role; Ron Perlman is predictably a joy to watch as the ""Jew running a pizzeria""; even those with less screen time, Oscar Isaac and Christina Hendricks still manage to impress and make a strong impression on the viewer. Even Kaden Leos is good as the young son, Benicio. But then there's Mr. Albert Brooks - an undeniably brilliant performance. All the more impressive when you take into account his largely comedic background (""A psychotic Woody Allen"", as Refn remarked). He is sinister, dangerous and fully-fledged; deserving of all the praise and awards he picked up.Newton Thomas Siegel's cinematography is a thing to behold; beautiful, enticing and authentic; which I found somewhat reminiscent of Paul Thomas Anderson's favoured use of grounded and firm shots or Peter Suschitzky's cinematography in Cronenberg's Crash. The pacing also, is a wonder; it is slow, yet hypnotic, and even as things intensify in the latter half, nothing feels out of character, thanks to the brilliance and naturalness of the pacing.Then we have the euphoric 80s tinge: the ultra-cool music stylishness of Cliff Martinez, Desire, College, etc; the clothes, especially that now-iconic satin jacket; or even the architecture, which was actually cheap stucco and mirrored glass, carefully edited to leave out more contemporary buildings. Refn has stated that the chaste romance at the heart of the story was partially inspired by the films of John Hughes, which is beautifully and aesthetically evident, to the effect where it is one of the most nuanced, convincing and human love stories I've witnessed on screen. This love also marvellously plays out in one of the most tender, brutal and flawless sequences I've ever seen on screen.This film blew me away, I hadn't seen a new film that impressive since Inception. It really is a modern classic as many of the critics hailed it, anchored not only by Gosling, but by Refn's impeccable and incredible direction. I eagerly anticipate Only God Forgives.",Drive
298,marcotiero,Bumpy ride,5,5 January 2021,"Revisiting this movie after a few years, so feels like the first time again. I recall everyone hyping this movie, yet my attitude both times is ""meh"".I like the visual aesthetics and the sound track, and think the concept of the movie is decent, but that's about it.There's an absolute lack of dialogue for the most part, and too many unnecessary dramatic pauses (in real life people are a lot more vocal), and the acting isn't the best (yet many applaud it). Half of the actors don't do anything, yet others are over the top like cartoon characters. For the most part, they go through the motions (especially Gosling and Mulligan) with little in the way of emotions and I just have no care for the characters whatsoever.It feels as though the movie starts out as one type of movie, then evolves to something else, but don't with no panache at all and feels disjointed.If you're in lockdown and looking for ways to pass the time, then by all means, give this a watch, otherwise there are plenty of other movies out there that are far superior to this.",Drive

300,jpozenel,Dropped my rating of 8 to 6 because of the terrible soundtrack.,6,8 February 2012,"There seems to be a growing trend of using ""pop"" songs as a bigger and bigger part of the soundtrack in movies. I've seen quite a bit of this being done on television shows and increasingly in movies. It just seems lazy to me.If they had paid someone to create a ""real"" soundtrack, the movie would have been so much better. I was watching the extras on the DVD and someone (I think it was the producer) compared this movie with ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" and ""Bullitt"". If they had been using this silly technique to create soundtracks from a mixed bag of ""pop"" songs back then, what a sad experience watching those movies would have been.I would love it if they would re-release this movie with a real soundtrack. And I'm pretty sure that all of the actors involved would support that idea. They probably thought that they were going to create a pretty good movie but were disappointed when they saw the result with that lousy soundtrack. For me the movie went from a letter grade of ""B"" to a ""D"" (80% down to 60%) because of that alone.Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen, Roman Polanski, The Coen Brothers, Paul Thomas Anderson, and all of the other big time directors will start doing the same. Nah...I don't think so. Why? Because it would be stupid! Just imagine if the greatest movies from the past used this technique. It's laughable.",Drive

I see people giving it top marks so I watched this (well as much as I could) with my wife and to say we were bored was an understatement. I don't need loads of Hollywood special effects to like a film but this was ridiculous. It would be more fun watching paint dry.The beginning was good and cleverly done but after that it just seemed to grind to a halt with long lingering scenes of nothing. It seemed like the crew had gone to lunch and left the actors in front of the cameras to just stare at each other.I admit I never watched it right the way through so maybe it got better later but we could only stand so much.,Drive
304,BillSims28,"Five-Word Review: Slowly Hypnotic, Fantastically Compelling, Intelligent",8,12 November 2015,"Drive, from director Nicholas Winding Refn, (Bronson) concerns a mysterious, unnamed getaway driver/stuntman played by Blue Valentine's Ryan Gosling, who despite his strict personal set of rules becomes empathetically embroiled in the life of a woman (Carey Mulligan, An Education) and incites the wrath of brutal crime boss Albert Brooks (Broadcast News). Drive is a certain opinion-splitter. Some will write it off as a boring, pretentious art-house film whilst on the other end of the spectrum there are those who will proclaim its glory to the heavens as the greatest film of all time. Of course it's not either, though it leans considerably towards the latter.I really loved Drive. Having never watched many art-house films I was a little apprehensive before watching it, having heard such varying things about it. The best thing to do is watch it without knowing much about it. However, the chances are you have heard of it, so all you should know is what you will get. Which, in essence, is an intelligent and supremely acted crime drama which hinges on neo-noir, blended with an incredible soundtrack, brutal bloody violence and some exhilarating scenes of driving action. It's very easy to see how Drive inspired the fantastic, hypnotic indie game Hotline Miami, in addition to 2014's Nightcrawler. The pulsating night-time city setting and sociopathic protagonist is a clear inspiration for Jake Gyllenhaal in the latter, whilst The Driver's iconic jacket and car, plus the spell-binding retro synth soundtrack and über-bloody, compelling violence are what makes the 2012 video game what it is. Gosling and Mulligan are wonderful in their roles, though they are overshadowed by the tough, murderous psycho brought to terrifying life by Albert Brooks. Unexpectedly scary, Brooks' crime-lord character dominates the screen in all his scenes. Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston, along with Oscar Isaac, Christina Hendricks, and Ron Perlman, round out a stellar supporting cast.However, Drive is not perfect. Winding Refn's direction is for the most part good, though there are undeniably too many scenes where the camera lingers far too long, usually on the face of Gosling's character, or where characters sit in silence. The decision to limit Gosling's dialogue is a great decision for his character, though the lingering, silent scenes are a little too common to make Drive truly extraordinary. But for the most part this is an incredible film, hypnotising and mostly compelling, boasting one of the best soundtracks ever out in a film, with a plot that never fails to interest and full of emotional connection. 88/100",Drive
305,sickofenjoyingmyself,Stunning Movie,8,5 November 2016,"Drive is a stunning movie. It is violent, action packed and has a quality of depth to it that makes it unique and engaging. Ryan Gosling is superb. He plays a man that is disconnected, who involves himself in things above and beyond what is necessary. An intriguing character who we know very little about, save his willingness to live on the edge of control. Ryan is the main man but the supporting cast all deliver excellent performances that make this movie a cult classic. For me, Albert Brooks is absolutely standout - his no frills portrayal of an unassuming criminal controller is raw and hard hitting. There is an intensity and unconventional quality to his performance that makes it sobering and real. There are vital visual moments that coincide with a fitting soundtrack to make this movie, quite frankly, unforgettable.",Drive

It's not that the movie was terribly made. It's because I'm sick and tired of movies built on shock value. I'm tired of having goriness thrust upon the viewing public until it has desensitized us to the point where cold blooded murder doesn't bother us anymore. I'm tired of movies where the ""good guy"" is just as bad as the ""bad guys"". I can't feel what the main character feels when I abhor him. I don't care for his plight when he is moving in on another man's wife. Movies like this are brainwashing us because you have a ""hero"" that starts the movie out in mid-heist, running from the police. You don't really care when he exacts revenge on the ""bad guys"" because he's one too & it's all a wash. One last thing, writers & producers need to realize that having a bare breasts in a shot is a foolish idea.

This is a great film and could have been even better had they taken the time to finish it and come up with an ending. What we have is so many interesting characters that keep you guessing. There's some interesting segments that build up to excellent confrontations. Many actors developed their individual characters quite well. My reservations come from the lack of a successful ending. (SPOILERS) The ending left me convinced that I could have made a much better ending than the movie left the viewer to watch. As it ended I even realized that the makeup mask wasn't even incorporated for it's best use. A better ending would have been ...the Driver, upon meeting Albert in the parking lot while wearing a metal sleeve shakes his hand as Brooke's attempts to gash his arm but...SURPRISE!!! The Driver kills Brookes with his own knife during the struggle. While we're at it, the kill off of Nino was anti-climatic.Still, this is a very well made film with quality contributions from directing to camera layout and powerful acting.",Drive
310,donuthaters12,One Of The Best Contemporary Films,10,9 October 2013,"I heard a lot about this film either being really great or boring as hell. After watching this, I definitely belong to the former camp. Drive is not an action film but rather it is a stylish executed drama that contains intense action. So if anybody who has been sucked in by the title, poster and trailer thinking that it's a thriller action film; change your perception of the film before going in because it may ruin your experience with this film.Drive's screenplay was written by Hossein Amini and was based off the book by James Sallis. Amini's screenplay is not exactly the most unique piece of work in Hollywood at the moment but he was working with such a great story and a character that people can immediately love regardless of his personal qualities. I'll start with the film's plot; the plot definitely feels like a thriller and if it was written or directed by someone else then it would definitely feel generic and bland. The film has it's moments that stick with you and if watched enough become iconic. It's not the plot that makes me want to revisit this film but rather the portrait that is being shown of the protagonist. Straight from the start we feel detached with the character as he doesn't show much and is closed off with his emotions, until he meets Irene (Carey Mulligan). Immediately from the start, I have this attachment to this character as I want to be him. Ryan Gosling's character is so cool and the moments when he does show a side of him that we didn't see in the first half of the film, it doesn't push me away but rather make us admire him much more. A lot of the audience may be annoyed with this film as it takes it's time to show the main complication of the film as the first half of the film establishes the character and his relationship with Irene and his career, both night and day. I felt that this approach was very effective as it allowed me to care about his problems and his decisions later on the film.The film was directed by Nicolas Winding Refn who has made notable films before Drive, Bronson and Pusher, but I have yet to see those films as this is my first experience of his work. This film definitely grabbed a hold on me from the minute it started and I give most of the credit to Refn's direction towards this film. Refn has definitely made an action film that was stylish and explored more of the characters and story rather than creating adrenaline fueled set pieces that are commonly found in mainstream action flicks. The film's action may not be as wow or extraordinary as The Transporter or the Fast & Furious series but instead Refn approaches it in a much more intimate level. Without Refn's vision, the film then loses it's unique and stylish touch.The film's cinematography is handled by Newton Thomas Sigel who is more commonly known as the director of photography for Bryan Singer's films. Sigel definitely did fantastic work here with shots that look beautiful, in particular night scenes and the ending of the film, and shots that are patient and allows us to take in the image even if there is nothing much happening on screen. The beautiful moments of the film are the moments when the lighting are intimate or hyper-realistic, these moments are the parts that I adore most about the film's photography and makes me want to watch it again just for those scenes alone.The film's musical component is very 80's driven, but the songs and the score are not from the era but rather taken major influences from it. The soundtrack of this film is the highlight and feels sweet and catchy. The songs that play throughout the film are definitely by indie bands or artists which fits with the film. The songs are synthesizer driven which I think is a great choice and adds on to the unique style that the film show off. Cliff Martinez does the score for this film, though his work doesn't outshine the soundtrack choices, it does follow the style of these songs and make it his own therefore it doesn't feel out of place when it comes on.The film's cast is great even if their parts aren't large. Though the film has a size of a cast, the film doesn't shift it's focus from Gosling's character which is very center focused on him during the first half, exploring the relationship between him and Irene. The chemistry between Gosling and Mulligan was great as it didn't feel too dramatic and repetitive. When they first converse with each other and build upon that during the next few scenes, feel like a relationship that must be established. There was an elevator scene between the two which in my opinion is their best scene together. The supporting cast of Perlman, Brooks and Cranston was great. They brought their all to the roles, Brooks in particular, and their hard work paid off.Drive has an excellent cast, shot beautifully, amazing synthetic driven score, and a story that was delivered with style and flourish; making this one of the best contemporary films I have ever seen. Cannot wait for me to watch it again.",Drive
311,dschlatter,"Empty, sort of",5,12 November 2012,"This movie is just so slow and empty. Good God! It's always (ALWAYS) a bad sign, when I couldn't care less about what happens to the characters. The good guys, the bad guys; any of them could have been killed after an hour and I wouldn't even have blinked. That's because even your average straight-to-DVD-Steven-Seagal movie has more character development than this ""masterpiece"". The movie does nothing to make you care about its characters. There's just NO storytelling at all. Am I supposed to feel for the guy (Gosling)? Hope he makes it at the end? How could I, when all he does is posing in his scorpion jacket (with his toothpick), speaking even less than Rambo and sometimes brutally killing a bad guy? Please. Give me something to work with here... Who is he? What does he want? What is his motivation? What went through his head, when he turned some guy's head to mush right in front of ""his"" girl? And her: Why would she be interested in a guy who hardly says a word to her? Shouldn't she assume that he's bad news? The apartment scene was so socially awkward. Is she that desperate? Or stupid? Or both? We don't know. Well, she's cute. By now you can probably tell that I didn't like the movie. Go see it, and judge yourself. Maybe you'll disagree with me.",Drive
312,intern-88,A true triumph of style over substance,8,13 June 2012,"Among the films that triumphed at Cannes this year, Drive seems pretty out of place. While the Palme d'Or and Best Actress awards went to Tree of Life and Melancholia, two films that respectively tackle the beginning and end of all life, Drive, a film about a stuntman who moonlights as a getaway driver, won Nicolas Winding Refn the prize for Best Director. But while it may sound like a wobbly premise for another The Fast and the Furious movie, Drive is an intense, affecting and prizeworthy thrill ride.The plot combines all the aspects of violence, romance and revenge one would expect. While living alone and working as a stuntman, mechanic and getaway driver for hire, the unnamed protagonist (Ryan Gosling) becomes enamoured with mum-next-door Irene (Carey Mulligan). But just as they're hitting it off, her jailbird husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) is released. The driver takes a respectful step back, yet gets pulled into helping Standard do one last job to pay back his protection-money debts from prison. Needless to say it doesn't go to plan, launching the driver into a brutal fight to save himself and the family he has come to adore. Clearly, the premise isn't all that original, but it is saved by the intelligence and style with which it is executed.Adapted from James Sallis' 2005 novel of the same name, Drive has been in the works for a few years. Originally an action-mystery vehicle for Hugh Jackman, Ryan Gosling was brought in as the new leading man in 2010 and asked Refn to direct. With both Gosling and Refn unaccustomed to the action genre, there is a noticeable reluctance to make just another throwaway explosion-filled flick, as Drive deftly embraces and deflects action-movie convention.The film opens with sweeping aerial shots of the Los Angeles skyline, yet this moody image is accompanied by synth-drenched pop and pink Risky Business-style titles. This juxtaposition of the stern and the kitsch runs throughout the film. A case in point is the protagonist's signature jacket: a quilted, cream, satin number with a large scorpion on the back, which stands in flamboyant contrast to his otherwise blank and inexpressive manner. Gosling's character is also one of the few action- movie heroes who you're likely to see wearing rather sensible driving gloves.After a relatively tame opening, the second half of the film becomes outlandishly gory, yet this constant mediation between the serious and the surreal prevents the film from descending into self-indulgence. For instance, one scene in which the driver attacks the owner of a strip- club with a hammer is offset by the bizarre presence of 20 naked strippers all staring vacantly at the horrific sight.However, this constant play with convention never threatens to compromise the film's intensity. The driving sequences are understated yet very thrilling. Similarly, despite the sparse amount of dialogue, the romance which brews between the driver and Irene is particularly affecting. While Drive incorporates some of the action genre's most tired clichés, Refn excels at taking these standard components and putting them into an odd and more interesting space. The constant fluctuation in tone is at times perplexing, yet the film is all the more engaging for it.In recent years, action filmmakers have either opted for high concepts, epitomised by Christopher Nolan's Inception, or attempted to give us more bang for our buck with action-star ensemble pieces, such as Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables. Drive does neither. With an inventive eye, Nicolas Winding Refn proceeds to make a conventional plot line unrecognisable and, more importantly, enjoyable.Like all great action films, Drive is a triumph of style over substance.",Drive

314,jhigginbotham151,Drive is action at its best,9,25 April 2014,"Drive is interesting. Drive is beautiful. Drive is intense. Drive is wonderful. These are the simple words I use to describe Drive. The story of 'Guy', an unnamed stunt driver by day and getaway driver by night, as he gets caught in a web of blood and money all surrounded by his love for a married women whose husband is in jail. 'Guy' is the character for which we spend most of our time with, he's not very interesting at first, he has only one expression, he shows no emotion and he's pretty much mute the entire film. But this is what makes him interesting, his lack basic human expression leaves him a canvas for which we can paint ourselves on, allowing ourselves to be fully immersed in the film... that is until 'Guy' gets a little bitter and by bitter I mean down right psychotic. He's stabbing, shooting, slapping his way around and still with that expressionless look on his face. The film does catch you off guard with how violent it is, one minute 'Guy' is interrogating a woman and the next her brains are scattered across the floor from a shotgun blast to the side of the head. This isn't your average, over the top action movie either. In an elevator, after having shared a very strong, loving kiss with his love interest, 'Guy' proceeds to stomp a hit-mans face into the ground, I swear you can actually see his foot go through the guys face, its that disgusting.The use of the song 'A Real Hero' as a recurring motif throughout the film is a great cherry on the cake. We question is 'Guy' a real human being by the end of the film, with tears in his eyes, as the song may suggest?, is he a real hero as the song says?. Was 'Guy' the hero of the story?, was he just insane?, was he a man so used to a strict life of being told what to do that he snapped when the foundations of structure came down around him?.

There's hardly any dialogue for driver throughout and yet you can feel all emotions. Rage, love, sadness. The underlying moral dilemma for driver lies within each frame of the film, he never enjoys doing what he does, even if he succeeds in the task, which is just a brilliant way to structure a film and character that's clearly inspired by Taxi Driver.

317,Bek204,"""You give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window""",8,1 July 2021,"Drive is such a great film that has so many little details that are so beautifully connected to the story and characters of the film. The most beautiful thing too is that these little small details are given in a way that the viewer won't notice which brings me to the only issue I had with the film.I didn't like the way these details were given and felt like if they were given in a way that is a little more clear, it would've given the story and characters more meaning and made them more interesting, because when I read about the meanings behind these details I loved the movie more. But, I understand that the filmmaker might have made this on purpose which I get his purpose and that's why I said that I liked & didn't like that these details were given in an indirect way.The cinematography of this film is beyond great. This film is one of these films that I would call ""visually stunning"". The camera angles alongside the production design created some amazing shots that are stuck in my head. And let's not forget the custom designs especially Driver's jacket that has a scorpion on its back.Finally, the music. Every single song/music that I heard in the film was a great choice especially if you listen to the lyrics that matches perfectly with the story and characters.

318,med_1978,What was all the fuss about,6,17 August 2014,"I Saw this movie last night on DVD and I have to say that I did not see what all the fuss was about.Drive is a decent enough film but not in the same class as ""The Driver"" with Ryan O Neal which is a more realistic portrayal of someone in this line of work.Here are some of the issues I had with the the film.In ""Drive"" we have a protagonist who is a Stunt Driver, Garage Mechanic & part-time getaway driver. The character has very little dialogue and appears to be a shy loner and at times seems rather cold, and yet he develops a friendship with his neighbour without saying much at all. Then inexplicably he offers to drive for her husband when he is released from prison and beaten up, even though he barely knows the guy. Now we see in the beginning of the film how professional he is when he tells the guys he works for that 5 minutes either side they are on their own, and indeed he leaves the robbers in the parking lot and walks off just as the police arrive and presumably they were arrested. But now we see him put aside this professionalism putting himself in situations that he cannot control and risking himself for strangers. This seems to me to be a complete contradiction of what his character is about.He shows an extreme naivety when he offers to give back the 1 million thinking he will be out, when most people would know that in the criminal underworld these people depend on others respecting & fearing them, and therefore they will not just say thank you and be done with it.Then we have the sudden bursts of unnecessary violence, I mean when he noticed the gun in the guys inside pocket in the elevator, he kisses the girl and then attacks the guy slamming him off the wall and when he falls he kicks him and starts stamping on his head more than six times, killing him. Would it not have been easier just to dispossess him of the gun and if need be, shoot him.Also when the guy comes up to him in the bar, to find out if he would do another job with him, he is unnecessarily nasty when all he needed to say was that ""I make it a rule to never work with the same person twice"" thats it. It seems to me there is no need to make unnecessary enemies of people.I noticed quite a lot of people commented that they liked the soundtrack. I found the soundtrack very annoying and to me and at times did not really suit what was playing out on screen.Finally the car chase sequences were okay but not as good as The Driver, Ronin, No Mans Land, The Bourne movies etc.So for me at the end of day it was an entertaining but flawed movie which was watchable and interesting, but at the same time I would not really recommend it to most people as it is not really a mainstream film. I would give it a 6.5 out of 10 but I would suggest that anybody who liked this check out The Driver with Ryan O Neal a considerably better film in all respects.",Drive
319,eragonbookfan,"Boring, Boring, ...and MORE Boring!",2,17 January 2014,"Just going by the reviews, this movie became a giant LETDOWN for me! First off, I'm a film snob, yes. I watch A LOT of movies, and for sake of argument, I know a lot more movies that are a lot more entertaining & make more sense than this one. This film totally seems like a rip-off of many other cool movies, filled with clichés about drug dealers, profanity, fast driving, catch phrases; but these LONG shots and the feel of the movie fails in every way to make them seem entertaining.I like Ryan Gosling, he's done well in other films (i.e. Remember the Titans, The Notebook, etc.). But okay, in this film, he's supposed to be the ""COOLEST guy in the WORLD!"" No way hosay! And Bryan Cranston is in this film too, but he's so much better in Breaking Bad; as well as Albert Brooks Albert Brooks & Ron Perlman. In this film, there're all TOTALLY void of acting, depth, being likable, and interesting. It's almost as if M. Night Shamalan directed this movie. NO ONE lightens up in this movie! The entire feel of the film is void of any character development, interesting plots, likable characters, sense, or situations.Usually the film focuses on LONG takes, just forcing to BEG that something will happen - and when they do, they're not nearly as interesting as anything that happens in the Fast & Furious series.I'm not kidding: after watching this movie, I took a nap for about an HOUR! It was THAT boring. It was totally surprising too.BAD movie! NON-interesting, Ryan Gosling has BETTER films he should be known for, NOT THIS! 2/10",Drive
320,Jules45,The Best Film of 2011 (so far),10,25 September 2011,"For a year where the lack of spectacular has been crushingly disappointing Drive stands out even more impressively than it normally would. Tonally consistent, staggeringly hypnotic and beautifully stylised (but not detracting from the sheer realism) Drive marks itself as a clear contestant for one of the best films of the year.The story is simple, an anonymous driver who works as a stuntman for the movies is also a heist driver who gets drawn into a world of crime. It's not the high octane adrenaline fuelled ride it markets itself as, but a richly characterised and carefully handled story. Not as experimental or misdirected as Bronson, it operates far more precisely; whereas Bronson never gave the impression it knew what it wanted to do with itself Drive maintains gritty realism throughout, never dawdling on irrelevance and offering us some truly captivating moments.Its lack of superficial (or rather Hollywood) elements is greatly reassuring; Fast and Furious eye-rolling implausibility this isn't. Instead we get some genuinely real moments that we never question as eye candy and always has relevance to the story. Gosling is terrific, Winding Refn even better, do everyone a favour and see this best film that's hit cinema's this year.",Drive

322,asphyxion_,The best wheelman movie in the genre.,10,3 April 2019,"DRIVE is a white-knuckle, unbuckled thrill ride from the very first frame to the last. Automobile aficionados will savor DRIVE's cinematography, atmosphere and the way Refn's visual style accentuates the inherent strength/beauty of each car Gosling whips throughout the film.DRIVE may have a dozen cameos and a star-studded cast, but it's Gosling who absolutely steals the show with his Gary Cooper stoicness and sparse dialogue. Refn's script is light on lines but heavy on action. It's amazing to see the way Gosling brings his nameless characters' personhood to the forefront of the screen--his most effective scenes in the movie are the sequences where Gosling says nothing while driving/fighting. The energy one sees emanating from Gosling's Driver is palpable and it permeates the entire film. Despite the constant threat and ominous tone enveloping Driver and his love-interest Irene, Gosling emits a cool-as-ice persona that really gives the movie's best moments an extra dimension. Interestingly, I don't think anyone could have portrayed Driver half as well as Gosling did, and it is easily Gosling's singular performance in this titular role that makes Drive an absolute must-watch.My favorite part of the entire film is the very beginning: Driver(Gosling) on a job trying to deliver his clients to safety. The entire sequence must be 10-15 minutes long and it's shot in such a claustrophobic way that the viewer actually feels like they're in the car alongside Driver, if not feeling like Driver themselves. The authenticity of the stunt driving and the way Gosling reacts to everything he sees on the road creates one of Hollywood's all-time best chase/driving sequences on film.I actually watched DRIVE first last night and then watched BABY DRIVER for the first time ever today. In almost every conceivable way, BABY DRIVER was a carbon copy and near identical clone to DRIVE, and not even half as good (despite BABY's massive success). DRIVE's OST of hypnotic Horrorwave/80s Synth sets the perfect tone for what transpires throughout the movie, where as BABY feels nothing short of strained and suffocated due to the overload of music in the background of the film -- most which have no real fit in the modern car scene. When I see a stuntman burning rubber in an 04 ZHP Sport with alcantera interior, the last kind of soundtrack I'm envisioning is Motown. Motown may suit the car scenes of the 50s-60s, but it sure as hell feels out of place in BABY and this alone is reason enough to kill that movie's atmosphere in every way possible. It's also a huge reason why DRIVE is a much better film.I know what you're thinking: a movie about a guy driving sounds pretty boring. But DRIVE is anything but boring. It's a high octane, pulse pounding injection shot of NOS straight to the brain. 10/10 A+; DRIVE lives up to the hype and then some. I imagine I'll watch this movie at least a few dozen more times before I kick the bucket.PS. Don't expect Gosling to eat his cereal here either",Drive

Anything is better then the start as a member of the Mickey Mouse Club. He was outstanding in The Notebook but once again, not a film guys admit to watching, or heaven forbid, liking. So it makes sense he see him in a film like Drive where he gets to play a brooding intense character. Unfortunately what he was playing appeared to be more of a character that was not sure when to speak or what to say. The long non-dialogue scenes where a waste of time and did nothing to enhance this film other then make you wonder when it was going to end. The violence when it occurred was ala Sam Peckinpah but not anywhere as well done. This story could have moved along much faster. The title Drive mistakenly led me to believe it was about driving, or vehicles, race cars or anything like that. It was not about any of those things. It was about 1 hour and 50 minutes of drivel.

326,MosHr,"Moody, stylish and quiet movie. Weak and unsatisfactory story.",6,9 September 2011,"Driver is a story of an unnamed laconic protagonist - all action hero minus the one liners and more than that all the conversations kept to a bare minimum. In fact, the lack of responses and the silence between scenes of immense cartoonish violence drew laughter out of the audience; possibly because there is room left for reactions but we are given none, just swathes of silence. The story is perhaps secondary to the vibe and style deriving it's ingredients from mob logic of why all the cast dies or is slated to be killed.One thing that Driver doesn't strive towards is the standard action fare of Transporter series or the car-mod scene of Fast Furious movies. The few car chase scenes are well done, the highlight being the first one evading the police but really isn't enough of it to be a car chase fan's movie. Most drivings are like videos for pounding 80s-insipired synth-pop soundtrack. It dwells heavily on the brooding and moody ambiance that never leads to any sort of payoff.The biggest fault of the movie is that it doesn't tell a story, everybody does their thing and then it's over. Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan look gorgeous all highlighted by the lingering and lengthy close-ups. Oscar Issac manages to exude an unlikeable vibe and Ron Perlman does his thing stealing a few scenes. The movie won't have everyone cheering in the theater but will leave audience with little bursts of uncomfortable laughter and then a vibe rather than a story when it ends.",Drive
327,tlooknbill,"If Steve McQueen played De Niro's part in Taxi Driver, well sort of...",10,20 September 2011,"Only ""Steve"" (Ryan Gosling) along with his cool and controlled under fire demeanor shows his closet psychopath in some scenes which shocked and then confused me as to what kind of guy Gosling's character really was. Another mismatch that confused the hell out of me is the ""Driver"" character shows great skills at driving and working on cars but terrible reading when a person's about to kill him.Sometimes the ""Driver"" acts like an innocent, lost boy in some parts of the movie, switches to nerves of steel and genius behind the wheel, then stomps the hell out of guy's head and uses a claw hammer on another. But then didn't we all think that of Deniro's ""Travis Bickle"" in Taxi Driver excluding the '70's ""French Connection"" and ""The 7-UP's"" car chases?Or maybe he's so crazy he doesn't know who he really is or doesn't care to know and just rolls with whatever is thrown at him and adjusts his state of mind accordingly in order to cope. I know the complex situation he's put in as the plot unfolds would probably make me act like that as well. The plot is pretty brilliant on its own which actually does most of the driving in this movie and supports Gosling's character's multiple personalities.Don't you think it takes a very well made movie to get someone to wonder about a character's intentions like that and have that conversation even after viewing the movie? And that's why I gave it 10 out of 10. It's a very smart movie with minimalist acting (similar to Bruce Willis' stillness style used in ""The Sixth Sense"") that complements the action and violence sequences you never see coming. The tension craftily built up in the movie is just incredible.",Drive
328,Jerominator,Super Stylish and Original Crime Thriller,10,2 June 2013,"The story follows a stuntman/mechanic who moonlights as a getaway driver with a very strict personal code of practice. It's not covered in the movie but there's something a little off about him - perhaps mild autism or Asperger's syndrome - and it serves to make him a dedicated and intense, if sometimes rather aloof, character. This either seems to translate as detached serenity or psychopathic drive, perhaps a double meaning on the movie's name?In what seems to be an uncharacteristic move for him, he takes an interest in his female neighbour whose husband is serving a prison sentence. While his involvement with her and her young son is initially a source of great joy for him, this unwittingly sets off a violent chain of events that unfolds throughout the rest of the film, and there on in it's really about him trying to set everything straight while protecting his neighbour and her son.I really enjoyed this unexpected gem. It is the most unique, stylish and original film I've seen in a good long time. It breathes new life into a genre that has painted itself into a corner.Within minutes I guessed it was by the same director as Bronson from the extremely stylish visuals and audio. This director seems to have a predilection for European electro-pop music, so if you particularly dislike that music, it's probably going to murder the film for you. I think it works really well on some level. Along with the striking visuals, it serves to reframe otherwise grotty or unpleasant subjects in a more sanitised and elegant, albeit completely fake, context, but one which somehow translates into an enticing alternative reality that sucks you in and makes for a hell of movie experience.Some well thought out, beautifully choreographed and acutely memorable scenes result. The originality and impact of his movies kind of reminds me of Michael Mann's early films - in particular Manhunter.I had seen Gosling in Fracture years ago and mistook him for a Hollywood pretty boy. Every film I see him in convinces me further that's not the case, but that he's an intense and talented character actor. The focus and determination in his face during the chase scenes, the innocent scenes with the lady and her kid, the brutal transformation from the start of the lift ride to the bottom. Very subtle stuff. Suffice to say Gosling was really well-cast in this part and he *became* the character - totally convincing. The female lead, Gosling's garage boss, and the gang boss are also strong in support.For my money this movie uses the full potential of cinema to transmute a potentially grim and angry story into truly beautiful art. My advice is go and see this for yourself and make your own mind up. Just one thing though - there is a lot of graphic violence so I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone under the age of 16 or anybody who opposes violence.",Drive

Gosling plays a character reminiscent of Travis from Taxi Driver. The focus of the film isn't chrome spinners or 10 second booty-shots, as a modern car film would suggest. It's smart and stylish without coming off strongly in either direction. The supporting cast were effective as well, especially Mulligan and the unusually cast Albert Brooks.

Think Death Proof or A History of Violence as far as the action/thriller pacing is concerned.The music and sound in general rivals Tron Legacy or even this year's Hannah.Drive will more than likely be looked over considering what it's up against, it's box office pull will undoubtedly reflect this.

331,facebook-124-955845,Art house at its best,8,20 September 2011,"It's a rare event when one goes to a movie, expecting to see an action movie littered with mayhem and violence, only to be subjected to an artistic achievement in directing. Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is not only artsy, but is also one of the most gritty and violently graphic films I've ever seen.Drive starts off leisurely, and you're drawn into Refn's creative direction. In one scene, you follow Ryan Gosling's nameless character as he walks into a supermarket and goes up one aisle and down another; it's minutes later when he leaves, and throughout the whole sequence a word is never spoken. Drive is restrained at times, but just when you think the seat belt is a little too tight and needs to be loosened up, you are broadsided by brutal violence.Ryan Gosling gives a simple performance as a stunt car driver and mechanic by day and getaway driver by night; and in both jobs he excels. Gosling's character is very low key, sporting a very 80s like scorpion jacket in many scenes and chewing on a toothpick. Gosling's name slips under the radar when speaking of the top actors currently in pictures. Most likely it's because of his somewhat short resume, when compared to his colleagues; however upon scanning over his list of films and seeing his performances it may be time to start including him in those conversations. Carey Mulligan is enjoyable in the short amount of time she's on screen; the same is to be said for Bryan Cranston. Albert Brooks gives one of the best performances of the movie; his Bernie Rose is a welcome addition to great supporting characters.Drive is more art-house than your typical mainstream thriller. The story is well written, and the cast and director perform at a high level. Refn was very smart by incorporating a riveting high-speed getaway to start off the film, because I think he would have lost a majority of his audience without it. Although the movie moves at such a laid-back pace, I still felt drawn to what was happening and couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen; and this was after having already been sitting in the theater for over 6+ hours for two other movies. If you're squeamish, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a high level of action, this isn't for you either. If you're looking for a well scripted, well directed, wonderfully acted movie that's extremely violent, but all done within reason during the film, then this is a film made for you.Grade: B+ Award worthiness: maybe a supporting actor nod Age appropriate meter: 18+ (graphic violence) visit our site at www.twodudereview.com",Drive
332,MercurioKnight,Like an art movie without an interesting story to tell...,2,7 November 2011,"I heard good things about this film from a couple different sources. After a fairly well done opening, I was geared to like this movie. But then every scene following the opening... just... very... slowly... gets... sorta somewhere. We'll get to why in a moment.The cinematography is beautiful to look at. Everything looks fairly well composed.The acting. I don't see any flaws here. Every actor is on top of things and delivering.Action (any scene with action-like elements, whether fighting, or bank robbing, etc), for the most part, this stuff is all good, what there is of it. No complaints here. This probably comprises 20-25 minutes of the entire film.Then what's my problem? The story. It is such a simplistic story stretched out over its running time and almost all the dialogue scenes are slowly paced. Meaning, an actor says a line, seconds pass, and then the other actor responds or makes some kind of facial reaction. A few seconds later, another line. And this accounts for most of the dialogue scenes, stretch that across the hour and 38 minutes, and the film drags. What might have made a really killer 35-45 minutes is agonizingly boring at 1 hour and 38 minutes.The pacing reminds me of maybe an art-house film, but without an interesting story (with preferably weird moments, even better if they are preferably weird wtf moments) to back up the slower pacing, what am I being rewarded with sitting through all this? I want to clarify one thing, before anyone thinks I'm just one of those action junkies or MTV generation types who can't stand slow movies... not so. I absolutely love Road to Perdition, which is full of well composed shots, beautiful cinematography, superb acting, and actually has a lot more interesting and emotional things happening through its length. It has many slow moments, but these moments add life to the canvas. Drive, on the other hand, is just boring.",Drive
333,markdroulston,Fantastic retro action with art-house flair!,9,27 August 2011,"It seems to be the case nowadays that film audiences, particularly at this time of year as the summer winds down, are left with a choice of seeing the latest broad appeal movies filling the multiplexes, or venturing to the local independent cinema in search of more intellectual fare. Very rarely will a film transcend these boundaries and offer a mix of Hollywood-style action and art-house flair, which is what makes Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive so unique and something to be celebrated.Drive tells the story of an unnamed stunt driver (Ryan Gosling) moonlighting as a getaway driver for a crime syndicate run by Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks). Seemingly a loner, the driver becomes involved in the life of his neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benicio (Kaden Leos). After agreeing to drive for Irene's newly paroled husband Standard (Oscar Isaac), and finding himself on the wrong side of assassination contract, the driver embarks on a mission to protect Irene from the vicious gangsters who would seek to harm her to get at him. It's a well-worn plot line which in the hands of someone less adept than Refn would likely be nothing more than a forgettable thriller, yet the massively talented director, who picked up the Best Director prize at Cannes this year for Drive, crafts an engaging and thrilling throwback film elevated by masterful performances across the board.Refn, previously known for the fantastic Bronson, and the lesser known but equally excellent Pusher trilogy, is a man who has very clearly studied his Kubrick. Certainly most modern directors could do worse than imitate the style of one of history's greats like Stanley Kubrick, but rarely does one pull it off with the skill of Refn. In Bronson, the influence was a little more obvious, with the resulting film seeming like something of a spiritual successor to A Clockwork Orange. With Drive however, the traces are a little more subtle, visible in the impeccable technical touches, and the use of dissolves, pensive long takes, and slow zooms, a hallmark of Kubrick's catalogue. Drive is a flawlessly crafted film, filled with beautiful imagery of the Los Angeles underworld seen more often in the work of Michael Mann.The technical achievements of Drive are more than matched by the acting of the entire cast, and Refn shrewdly selects a wide variety of performers to populate the story. Top notch support comes from Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks, the ever dependable Ron Perlman, and particularly Brooks, who jettisons his familiar comedic persona in a truly frightening and villainous performance, which will surely be on the radar of voters come awards season. Mulligan shows characteristic heart in a largely overlooked role, yet the film unquestionably belongs to Gosling. Often heralded as one of the finest actors of his generation, in Drive Gosling delivers his best work yet as the driver; a quiet role that is all the more effective due to the subtlety of the performance. He displays an ability to ratchet up the tension using just the slightest widening of his eyes and tensing of his jawline, and when the character is pushed to act more forcefully, Gosling transitions from almost silent observer to brutal aggressor so swiftly that it leaves one breathless. It's work that he makes look easy, yet it's the most focused performance seen in an action film in quite some time.There's something undeniably retro about Drive, with its neon opening titles and 80s infused soundtrack, but the film seems remarkably fresh. Smart action filmmaking is so hard to come by these days, so Drive delivers refreshing variety, beginning the time of year when the so-called prestige pictures are released with a bang.tinribs27.wordpress.com",Drive
334,raimund-berger,Lovely little thriller ...,8,5 December 2011,"... specifically for those tired of stereotypical action movies.Interestingly enough, this film does contain all the ingredients Hollywood trash is usually made of. Like cars, guns and the magic jacket. But it thankfully refrains from making a fetish of any of those. No elaborate talk about car engines, gun models or any of that mindless rubbish.Instead, the film focuses on character portrayal and the creation of atmosphere, albeit in a minimalistic and somewhat distant fashion regarding the former. We're just learning enough to get an idea of what could be driving the protagonists, and why the story's developing as it does. Literally no rubbing into our faces of obvious points, which I found to be a thoroughly pleasing experience.Apart from that and some other notable features, what I really enjoyed was the film's color palette for one. Which constantly contrasts warm orange and brownish tones against blues and greens. Like mirroring the ambivalence of some of the male characters resp. the world they're living in. And the rhythm of the film. This movie really has a great rhythm and specifically succeeds in gradually building up a convincing climax.A round of applause is in order I'd say. Every once in a while, with me being on the verge of abandoning all hope already, there's still a little gem to be found and appreciated. Thanks.",Drive
335,GoodErsatz,"The Smug, The Pretentious, and the Absurd",1,21 January 2021,"The Smug:
Ryan Gosling is a too-cool-for-school guy that speaks in a delicate voice and tries his hardest to convince anyone watching that he can act. He failed and so did his director. The match-chewing effeminate super-cutsie approach Gosling took on for this film must be difficult for him to watch. Oh, and he wore GLOVES to drive. He didn't want to hurt his lil hands! Just awful.The Pretentious:
All the really trite scenes where Gosling and Mulligan were staring into each others eyes was stomach-turning. I mean holy cow - how far their own on backside are these people? Again, Gosling and Mulligan are partially at fault, but don't blame them alone. They were ""directed"" by not-very-competent director (Refn). BONUS: Read the trivia about how Refn made everyone sleep at his house during the production, and how Refn started bawling when he first met Gosling. A very artsy and emo guy this Refn must be. DEFCON CRINGE LEVEL ONE!The Absurd:
Why would Mulligan fall instantly for this guy that says about five words? (Answer: it's because he is so damn dreamy and they got lost in each others eyes. Blech)Why would this super quiet yet super-sexy-hot dude instantly fall in love with this girl with her kid?Why did he wear the STUPID MASK in the latter part of the movie? That only made sense to the director because he thought it looked suuuuper spoooooky.Why would Gosling IMMEDIATELY became a surrogate father-figure to the kid he met after about half an hour?Why would his boss tell the bad guys where Gosling lived? Why would he further elaborate to the big bad guys about how Gosling is dating Mulligan?Why did Gosling the ""in-touch-with-his-feminine side"" man almost start to cry in the restaurant at the end? Is it because he is SO SENSITIVE but yet so MANLY that he was ready to die for this chick he met literally two days previously? No. It's because he and the director came up with this ABSURD movie idea and then massaged it into the piece of garbage it remains to this day.A few other Absurd points:Gosling works for Cranston at a gas station.Also, he is also a Hollywood stunt driverAlso, he is an up & coming NASCAR driverAlso, he is an underground getaway driver for criminalsAnd yes, he also teaches blind kids how to read, teaches elderly widowed women how to Salsa dance, gives frequent TED talks on the power of being super-cute-and-super-quiet, and is heavily involved in the Committee for the Promotion of the Indigenous Peoples of Alaska.Refn (the director) deserves most of the blame for this ridiculous film. A quick glance at Refn's jobs in Hollywood after this film indicates no studios or producers wanted him to have anything to do with their scripts.

342,zkiko,"Instead of a tribute to the Eastwood'esque movies, it felt almost like a parody.",3,5 January 2020,"If you want to watch a better version of this modern throwback type of movie. Then go watch 'The Drop'.Nobody in Drive was realistic. The story lacked too much to give any type of real connection to the characters. The woman was almost only crying the entire time, the kid was a kid, the driver was a clint eastwood type of cowboy and the bad guys seemed like a parody of bad guys (which may be on purpose but even then it failed).The beginning is what made me give this 3 whole stars. The beginning had a very nice action sequence and an nice introduction to what sadly soon after comes to fall flat.'The Drop' however does exactly the opposite with the same type of storyline. Introverted damaged good guy, saves damaged woman and fights the bad guys. But done the right way. With added originality to an old and much done story arc. Drive hasn't added anything, except for replacing horses with cars and modern visuals.

343,Johnny-113,Entertaining but flawed,5,5 October 2011,"First of all, Ryan Gosling is no Steve Mcqueen, although he is trying to be. There are great actors who can reveal their characters without a large amount of dialogue, but Gosling is not one of these actors. I didn't buy him as the scorpion jacket wearing loner Travis Bickle type. We learned nothing about what made him become this person.The music was completely wrong. A brooding score would have been more appropriate to underscore Gosling's character. This would have helped tell us who he really was. Instead, Cliff Martinez delivered a ""Traffic"" knockoff that was focused on the implausible romance between Mulligan and him. As for the 80's songs in the film, I found them offensive. I believe these filmmakers were using 80's sounding songs and 80's titles to be quirky. They probably thought it was a great idea because it's unexpected and retro, but it was inappropriate and embarrassing. Why did they do that? Albert Brooks was excellent as were many of the supporting actors. This could have been a great film, but it is not.",Drive

Being an indie film lover, I was fine with the limited dialog and use of body language to show the chemistry between Gosling and Mulligan. I loved the introduction of the Standard character and the tension he brought to the mix. Perlman, Cranston, and Brooks were all very convincing and well cast. According to my calculations, everything fell apart during the Pawn Shop scene. The fantastic coincidence was too much for me to take. I didn't realize LA was such a small town. From then on, everything devolved in to a mob film and became a tedious mess. I felt like Albert Brooks nailed it when he said to Cranston's character, ""I was so excited.""

Nice performances from Cranston and the young goose, a miscast Albert Brooks, né Einstein (that always tickles me), as a character-type best played by Joe Pesci (think Nicky Santoro from Casino). Ron Perlman dialed his in. Film has less dialogue than 2001: A Space Odyssey, but alas no story. Things happen.

There's plenty of that.You like a story that makes sense? Sorry, it' makes no sense.It starts out good with a cool drive scene. Then the star meets the lady next door. Suddenly I thought I was watching the 1st Harry Potter movie, where Radcliff just smiles when you expect him to say something. Then wait 10 seconds and say a word or two. Then wait another 10 seconds for the neighbor lady to say something.I was beginning to think this was a David Lynch film. There is even a diner scene like in Mulholland Drive.Too much time is wasted getting to the nitty gritty. Then when it happens, nothing makes sense. For example, Why does Gosling wear a mask if he's going to kill somebody by ramming their car and then drowning them in the ocean at night with nobody around? I could talk about the ending scene, but since it makes no sense, let's just say, it's no surprise with such a weak script, that they simply didn't have one.",Drive

Refn obviously just tried to produce a long 1980 music video. Unfortunately the film itself is so much less creative than the better videos of that era. All characters stay shallow. That would not be a big issue if the pictures would be suggestive enough to let you forget that. And this is the problem of the film.Either you actually produce a music video. A flow of a pictures and music (electronic music considering the decade), dialog minimized to the bare necessities. Or you try play it cool like an Leone western.Every minute of watching this film one can sense this conflict.

351,jackharding89-1,an instant cult classic and a career defining film for both Refn and lead man Gosling,9,9 April 2012,"""You don't need to know the route."" states a mysterious figure down a phone while standing in the window of some trashy L.A motel room. ""You give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window. Anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours. No matter what. Anything happens a minute either side of that and you're on your own. Do you understand?"" What follows is a slick yet savvy getaway drive handled by the film's nameless and soon to be iconic hero (Ryan Gosling). This edgy prologue is rounded off by the word ""Drive"" scrawled across the screen in fluorescent pink to the thumping sound of some electro eighties throwback track. The opening credits role and so begins the coolest film of 2011.Director Nicolas Winding Refn revs up the romance in this retro metro, neo noire reverie. Drive is an instant cult classic and a career defining film for both Refn and lead man Gosling: measured, memorable and ultra violent. A modern day Taxi Driver with shades of Memento and like a 1970's Scorsese, Winding Refn appears to be a cut above the current crop when it comes to producing compulsive indie pictures with a semi-mainstream lure. In the hands of a lesser director, Drive could've had the facade of a straightforward, pedal to the metal Hollywood action flick. Instead, it has the look, sound and feel of something familiar yet somehow different: the heart and soul of a esoteric European art-house film in the guise of a romantic, idyllic American b-movie. There's a guy, a girl, gangsters, guns, chase scenes, heroes and villains. And Ron Pearlman. And what can only be described as an ""epic"" soundtrack. ""The studios wanted me to use more western, 'radio friendly' music with guys like Kayne West"" snarled Refn in a recent BBC interview, ""which proves they don't know what the hell they're talking about."" Amen.Make no mistake about it, Refn's unruly rendition of James Sallis' noire novel is his own kind of movie. It's not one for the low-brow, dumbed down Hollywood crowd. Nor the squeamish. He's done it his way. This is a character driven tale of good vs. evil and not necessarily the power of love, but the idea of love. The near inaudible relationship between Gosling's driver and the beautiful Irene (a radiant Carrey Mulligan) is more spiritual than physical. It forms the basis of the plot and is simple enough: Gosling's enigmatic mechanic (who's something of a beast behind the wheel) strikes up a bond with neighbour Irene and her young son Benicio. A surrogate dad appears to be on the cards but then jailbird bio-dad shows up and derails the dream. He owes money and favours to the wrong kind of people. They want him to handle a heist for them. Dad needs a driver. You can see where this is going. The job goes tits up and our driver goes to great and gory lengths to protect his new found loves. Escapism. Fantasy. True Romance. Take your pick.Drive is a subtle yet savage masterstroke. A pure dream and Refn's most accomplished work to date and surely Gosling's signature role. He is to Drive what Eastwood is to Sergio Leone's Dollar westerns. A deep and ever present anti hero with a badass wardrobe who just has that look about him. He needn't say much. He needn't say anything. But when he does its compelling. Much like the film itself. Bronson director Refn's recurring urge to explore complex characters with psychotic, ultra violent tendencies to the sound of some killer tunes invite comparisons to not just Scorsese but Tarrantino. Drive is, after all, a cool genre cocktail riddled with crime, revenge, suspense, death and love that's clearly inspired by styles and eras gone by.Ryan Gosling's measured turn affirms his brewing reputation as one of the most gifted leading actors in modern cinema. Expect more from him. Expect more from Mulligan, Refn and expect to hear a lot more about this absolute gem of a film for many years to come. See it.",Drive
352,krisrox,Fascinating,7,6 November 2011,"This is a flawed if fascinating movie with ""future cult classic"" written all over it.To begin with, it doesn't look like anything else, only then it does. ""Drive"" shows flashes of prime David Lynch (Twin Peaks, Mulholland Drive), spaghetti Sergio Leone (Fistful of Dollars), Hong Kong ultra-violence and 1971 Kowalski, lacquered with the gloss of a sleek car commercial. I'm not sure if director Refn really designed it that way, I'm not sure it works, but it is interesting, to say the least.In such a high-concept environment, the actors seem almost secondary. You'd be hard pressed to call Ryan Gosling the star of this movie; he hardly stars. The script is astonishingly weak. If anybody should win an Oscar, it's sound designer Cliff Martinez.About the score... A lot of reviewers cite its ""80s retro"" sound. I'm not sure if they were thrown off by the opening credits (which are very 80s), but the music has the analogue synth sound which is a hallmark of the 70s.

He perfectly connotes the driver's hollow and broken persona so effectively that at times you are able to virtually feel the subtle tension leaking from his stare and can sense the Bryan Cranston impresses too, however his role is certainly nothing unprecedented. Drive has extremely violent moments, though on the whole Refn executes these to a commendably high standard. This is in part due to Refn's masterful handling of tension. On numerous occasions did he raise the level of tension, prior to relieving the tension, prior to delivering the climax. Additionally, nearly every violent sequence felt varied and adopting a slightly different style than the last. Through masterful cinematography, Gosling's exceptional lead performance and some excellently crafted violent sequences, Drive is a high quality experience, if not quite the absolute masterpiece some have hailed it as.",Drive

The movie was an awesome watch with some catchy music throughout, very realistic screenplay and funky editing - the ""vice-city"" model titles in the beginning was fresh and aberrant.The story about a stuntman doing ""transporter"" model getaways at nights,and leads an isolated life was so remarkably filmed, considering the fact that it was all without any trace of surrealism, whatsoever. True, Taxi Driver came to my mind at times - those on the road scenes, the traffic lights, the isolated life choice, and even wearing the mask which reminded me Robert De Niro's Mohawk hairstyle - it never hindered me from enjoying the movie, felt more like a classic being revisited with style! Carry Mulligan was just okay as the female lead, but a mother!! that didn't go down well with me - perhaps i still got memories afresh of a confused teenager in ""An Education"".Car Movies are known for action, thrilling chases, and rocked up music.

363,Vinegaroon3,"Fresh take on the ""Action Movie"" formula",8,20 September 2011,"I enjoyed this film....From the previews, it appeared to follow the standard action movie formula wherein the protagonist was impossibly tough, impossibly cool, and impossible to swallow. In one sense, ""Drive"" does follow this formula. In a broader sense however, ""Drive"" was one of the most original movies I have seen in a long time.I think what made this film different were largely the characters. They had believable dialog, believable motives, and most importantly believable relationships with one another. Unlike most action movies, ""Drive"" did not try to carry itself on mayhem and special effects. Make no mistake, this is a violent film. But action and violence were simply part of the story, rather than being THE story. The film starts out almost as a ""slice of life"" that examines the lives and relationships between the central characters, with little story apparent in the first third of the movie. But gradually the story comes together, and everything for the characters falls apart, in a relatively petty bid for money and self interest. The way everything occurred almost reminded me of one of the ""real life"" crime shows one sees on TV. The plot in ""Drive"" is truly more believable than it is glamorous.I thought Ryan Gosling's portrayal of driver at times took the moody silence thing a bit too far. There were times in the film where I wished I could shake him and scream ""Speak!"" But I gradually began to like the character he portrayed. I suppose he was a bit too confident, a bit too competent, and a bit too much of a ""bad-ass"" to really be believable. But this enhanced the movie rather than detracted from it. I guess that part is where the ""suspension of disbelief"" comes into it.There has been a depressing lack of originality in the movie scene for some time now. I believe they are doing a re-make of ""Spiderman"" to go along with the remakes of ""Batman"" and ""Superman"".......""Drive"" is not only an enjoyable film, it deserves extra credit because it is original, it is something different from the standard movie fare.I recommend moviegoers who are not put off by extreme violence go see this film.

We see driving stunts that defy the audience's credulity if not the laws of physics. In one chase scene the driver flips his car 180 degrees and speeds away in reverse from his pursuer. I would not have believed that remotely possible, had a friend of mine not assured me that Burt Reynolds once performed the exact same stunt; apparently it's difficult to execute safely and extremely hard on a car's transmission, but nonetheless possible. In a later scene we first see the driver rear-end a car and then T-bone it so violently that the car flies upside-down off a sand dune to land on the beach below. Amazingly, having delivered so much kinetic energy to the target car, the front of Ryan Gosling's car seems virtually undamaged and still has both its headlights working! A tank might have performed that stunt, but no car that I've ever heard of. Our hero seems to have a bizarre code of ethics, rather like the Javier Bardem character in ""No Country for Old Men"".

Winding Refn is becoming one of my all time favorites quickly - as is Gosling, who stuns here, speaking more words with his eyes than his mouth ever comes close to. The soundtrack, as has been said, is brilliant, although it may take some people repeat viewings to catch why.

The movie is not complicated - very simple plot of a ""no questions asked"", mysterious driver for hire, who gets involved with a woman, her son, and a husband with serious baggage. The acting is stoic, appropriately, so it's hard to tell if the actors are solid, or are just taking a pass. The script is cohesive and engaging - but simple. The soundtrack is different, but engaging. For me, the real problem was the over the top gratuitous violence. And I'm not a guy who disdains well-placed violence in a movie, nor gratuitous violence in the right movie. But when it's over-the-top AND gratuitous, it's (as my 16 year old son said), ""nauseating."" It was purposefully plot driven, and I get that. But the degree was so shocking in places, it made a movie I could easily have given 9/10, into 7/10. It was so disgusting, the shock value actually pulled me out of the movie.

371,ferni-tierni,You give me a time and a place and I give you a 5 min window...,10,9 May 2020,"Drive attempts to hit a pace and atmosphere and succeeds spectacularly. Underground, dedicated, moralistic, faithful, limited, passionate: so many admirable features to describe the film. A faint experience of averageness morphed with passionate faithfulness and dedication, the need for belonging and naivete to the level of risking one's life for the wellbeing of others. This movie is a metaphorical love story; a love story for the beauty of dedication and selflessness. The gestures presented in the movie and the seemingly lack of desire of the character to exude any form of histrionics. The character is taciturn and seems to know exactly what he wants, and it is willing to die for it, clearly.The movie is driven by almost non-verbal expression and imagination. There is a conspicuous lack of dialogue, at some points disturbing. The Unnamed protagonist (Ryan Gosling) had to interact with short phrases and stoic faces. At some point I thought this character must have some form of trauma to be so reserved, but it is as if he decided to be like that and lived perfectly with his decision. Maybe he was habituated to a life of rejection and misunderstanding. A woman like Irene (Carey Mulligan) had to be graceful in the awkward silences and try to trespass his sturdy carapace: vulnerable, lonely, familial, sensitive.The unnamed protagonist was ready to absolutely demolish anything that threatened him. He is not a shy person, and he exuded that starkly in so many scenes where appropriate action was needed to place limits or make a statement, but he was also noble and selfless: a character willing to sacrifice his personal success or benefit for others, for a greater cause. He exudes many of the values that are seen commonly in superheroes, but in a real, sanguinary way, where his mortality or lack of superpowers gave him even more credit for his actions.The slow burning pace of the movie gave us little time to digest the life of the protagonist. The lack of dialogue allows us to use our imagination and try to deduce his mysterious nature. Instead of being a clear shortcoming the lack of dialogue becomes a prominent quality for the movie and a facet that raises the protagonist to an iconic level of stalwart unrelenting integrity.",Drive

Exceptional casting, wardrobe, photography and production values overall. Drive is also exemplary in Its tightness - only 100 minutes long, no time wasted, no time to get bored. In my book this film belongs to the same league of modern crime classics as Heat and To Live and Die in L.A.",Drive
374,devcybiko,Robot Zombie Ryan Gosling sleepwalks through snooze fest.,3,16 September 2011,"WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : DRIVEONE-LINE REVIEW : Robot Zombie Ryan Gosling sleepwalks through snooze fest.RATING : Don't Waste Your Money (Rating Scale: ""See it in the theater,"" ""Wait for the instant download"", ""Don't waste your time."")A Hollywood stunt driver (Driver, Ryan Gosling) works as a mechanic by day and dabbles in getaway car action by night. He lives down the hall from very cute Irene (Carey Mulligan). She has an adorable son Benicio (Kaden Leos) who is befriended by Driver and Driver takes a keen interest in Irene as well. However, Irene's husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac) is released from jail and is being forced to rob a pawn shop to repay protection money from when he was in the slammer.Meanwhile, back at the auto shop: Driver's boss is hapless shop owner Shannon (Bryan Cranston) who goes into business with local mob boss Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and partner mob boss Nino (Ron Perlman). They want to employ Driver to race cars and make legitimate money.Driver decides to help Standard and so becomes intwined in a twisted tale of bad guys and badder guys. And we're off...I am always nervous when the title credits for a movie are in fluorescent pink. I believe ""Cocktail"" with Tom Cruise set the standard for me. And the harbinger of bad flicks still works as this movie was the dullest movie I've sat through, ever.I saw Ryan Gosling for the first time in ""Crazy Stupid Love."" I guess he's some sort of heart-throb. I liked him in that movie as a sleazy lounge lizard who has a change of heart. However, the actor that performed that part was nowhere to be seen in ""Drive."" In fact, his performance was so bland anyone, even a cardboard cutout could have played the role. He literally never blinks an eye in this film. He never displays much more than the slighted bit of emotion.And for a movie about a stunt driver, and named ""Drive"" for that matter, there is a shocking lack of automobile action. The movie opens with a car chase of sorts that never gets over 35 MPH. I've seen more car action in children's movies than in this.I believe director Nicolas Winding Refn and writer Hossein Amini were shooting for something like ""Taxi Driver."" There, the lead was a complex character with delusions of grandeur. Driver is no such complex beast. He is as emotionless when driving as when kissing and killing.This is such a non-movie with no substantial roles for any player in it that I recommend you ""Don't waste your time.""",Drive
375,MartianTom,Drive is what this film needs....,5,7 October 2011,"...and, sadly, what it lacks. Has there ever been a film with a less appropriate title? Or maybe they were going for ironic overstatement.I read one national newspaper review that called this a triumph of surface over depth. That's about right, I'd say. Surface is what we get, all the way through. No depth at all, of either plot or characterisation.Aside from the European influences, there's a strong pedigree for films of this genre. 'Bullitt' obviously comes to mind. But, for me, the classic - and the one this director obviously struggled to emulate in terms of style and mood - is Walter Hill's 'The Driver'. He doesn't make it... not by a very long shot.It's not the fault of the performers. Ryan Gosling is a good actor, and he does his best with what he's given. But long static pauses, blank stares and half-soppy/half-smug grins do not a brooding, complex, enigmatic anti-hero make. O'Neal nailed it. Gosling had a brave stab.But the true fault lies with the director, who's self-consciousness dripped like treacle through every lingering shot - and there sure were plenty of those.By all means go see it. But don't expect any special addition to the genre - or even any spectacular car chases (not that they're necessary - but they're kind of implied in the premise).You'd be better off renting out 'The Driver' again - if you can still find it.5/10",Drive

The elevator scene was totally unnecessary as well as some others. For a movie titled drive it doesn't have much driving in it- all in all if they just toned down the violence where it wasn't so over the top would have been a lot better.

378,Habibi-Universe,Thrilling Action and Extreme Brutality!,6,30 September 2020,"Nicolas Winding Refn's 'Drive' (2011) is a crime drama about the mysterious Hollywood stuntman and mechanic (Ryan Gosling) moonlighting as a getaway driver and finding himself in trouble when he helps out his neighbor.This R-rated insanity of a film has a fantastic opening underlined with a great score and showcasing what our protagonist does at night.
I really love Ryan Gosling in this role. I think he did a phenomenal job!The screenplay is pretty good too. There were quite a few things that I did not expect to happen. Sure, it follows some typical storylines, but for the most part, it tells a unique story with unexpected twists and turns! For that alone, I definitely need to commend the film!However I do think that the pacing of the film was, at times, a bit too slow.
There is sort of a romance in this film that I just couldn't buy into.Nevertheless the cinematography was really good and I absolutely adored the soundtrack!Overall, 'Drive' is a action drama with extremely brutal action scenes (unnecessarily brutal for me) that will definitely please a lot of genre fans out there. This film's main weakness lies within the writing of the characters.
At the end of the day, 'Drive' still is a really entertaining and fun film for the older demographic! 6/10",Drive

380,synevy,Good. Not great.,7,12 January 2012,"Drive is that kind of movie that you'll either like it a lot or not (cause if you were so - so about it, you should've stopped it when you started getting bored). The plot is interesting and harsh. It makes you want to see what happens next.The music is unbelievable and it runs all over the film. One thing i liked about it is that, even when i was paying attention to a conversation, the music would stick to the background. You can listen to a whole track! The photography is amazing. Warm and cold colors blend beautifully.The performances weren't extra-ordinary in this movie, in my opinion. Ryan Gosling is very talented and he's making a major break through these last few years but i didn't see something special. He also seems to already have a leading role in another film by the director of Drive, Nicolas Winding Refn, in Only God Forgives that's in pre-production. Nice supporting performances from Carey Mulligan (Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps) and Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad TV series, Contagion, The Lincoln Lawyer).Be prepared for some slow rolling movie rhythm. Don't get caught up by the title. There is some good driving in it -and i've always wanted to see a Chrysler 300 chasing and bumping on a Mustang GT 5.0- but that's just about it. Plenty of cars to see, though!",Drive
381,mikeburdick,"A Porsche of a cast, driven into a brick wall",4,10 July 2016,"These days, it's pretty easy to put lipstick on a pig in Hollywood. Get a great DoP, which Newton Thomas Sigel is, and it'll look fantastic. Assemble a bunch of great actors, which this film has, and they'll make you feel some emotion. But at the end of the day, this is a squealing pig of a film, and the fault lies almost entirely with the script.I'm not going to mince words: this is a terrible script. One can't help feel that it was written by a 15-year-old kid who'd seen a few movies and thought, ""Hey, I can do that!"" And this was his first go.Without giving anything away, Gosling's character is a tough-guy stunt driver who moonlights as a tough-guy heist driver who—by some ""unexpected"" twist of fate— gets himself mixed up with the wrong guys and has to drive his way out of it. He's a man of few words, largely because the writer of the script couldn't come up with an interesting piece of dialogue if his life depended on it. And we're meant, I suppose, to care about his fate.Now, a bad script coming out of Hollywood wouldn't mean much were there not such a stellar cast involved. There's not a bad actor in the bunch, and a couple of them are amongst the best around (Oscar Isaac, Carey Mulligan). What a terrible waste, the banal lines coming out of these talented mouths. Of course, it's Hollywood and so long as there's a lot of violence and a love interest, it checks the boxes, right? Not exactly. First of all, you have to care about the characters —not because they're cute and appear to be attracted to each other or because there's a gun pointed at them, but because they are real and honest human beings. There is simply zero honesty here. On top of all this, the soundtrack is inane. The style was seemingly chosen because the director either really liked '80s movies like ""Beverly Hills Cop"" or believed a music director who told him ""the '80s are coming back"" and using '80s-style music would be hip. It was certainly a conscious choice, since the type matches the '80s theme. But why? Was the movie set in the '80s? No. Was there a character who was obsessed with the '80s? No. And that sort of sums up ""Drive."" Why? Why does it exist? Even were you to say, ""Don't look so deep, it's a pure piece of catharsis,"" before you can experience catharsis, you still need to develop characters you give a damn about. And frankly, I feel a bit cheated.",Drive
382,ToThePointPR,Deeply Emotional and Poignant,10,31 August 2018,"Drive is a slow burn action flick that focuses more on the main character's social anxiety and the difficulties in the life he has chosen.

383,stephparsons,A mash up of thriller and 'artsy'/alternative movie genres; not sure if it quite succeeds at either,6,24 May 2013,"I can't really decide whether I liked or loathed this movie. I think a typical lover of thrillers will probably be disappointed as will a typical lover of 'artsy'/alternative films. 'Drive' really is a mash up of the two genres but it's hit or miss as to whether it succeeds at either. Ryan Gosling's acting certainly doesn't disappoint and, despite a weak and rather clichéd script, he portrays 'Driver' excellently (an introverted stunt car driver whose minimal verbal style is both unusual and at times rather awkward to watch). The pros of this movie boil down to its intelligent directing; well filmed and thoughtful scene settings and, of course, the understated acting by the main characters, Gosling and Carey Mulligan. The cons however, teetered on the brink of ruining it for me; the hackneyed script (in which the characters reel out the same old clichés that every other mobster says in every other bad mobster movie and the fact that one of them basically spells out the plot for the audience, despite its simplicity, just in case you didn't 'get it'). But, the worst crime of all though that Drive perpetrates is the ridiculous 'celebration' of 'blood and guts' in glorious Technicolour, carried out with a no-holds-barred in-your-face brutality ; gallons of the red stuff spurt at every opportunity, and bone-crunching nastiness has you questioning the Director's motives (was he really aiming for a display of 'pornographic violence'?). Yes, we all know 'mob movies' involve violence and it's not a pretty sight, but does it have to be flaunted, with such gross attention to detail? I don't think so. And this endlessly gratuitous violence is where 'Drive' nearly drove me away. There are many ways to covey brutality in a film, I just don't get why Daniel Monzón (the Director) chose to focus on the obvious ones and have his cameras honing in on all the nasty knifings, pouring blood, and bone crunching savagery. My other issue with 'Drive' (although minor compared with the blood and guts) is the soundtrack. Whoever chose it was obviously trying really hard to be 'different' but sadly missed the mark and all that warbling about 'heroes' and 'human beings' was frankly a bit embarrassing - not the most intelligent of choices. However, despite the flat script and gratuitous violence, 'Drive' is not an unintelligent movie and Driver is not a one-dimensional character. The driving scenes are phenomenal and yet not 'over done' or over extended; Driver's skills on the road are a great contrast with his introverted, self-effacing personality. Mulligan's character is also understated in a good way but occasionally verges on 'vacant'; she has little to say and her emotional responses are perhaps too muted.Gosling is by far the star of this show and saves it from being a bad, run-of-the-mill mobster thriller. I would not necessarily recommend 'Drive' as a 'must see' film, but I would suggest it as worth viewing for its un-Hollywood portrayal of an ordinary man who gets caught up with the mob and reveals another side to his character that enables him to stand up against mindless bullies and extortionists. If you don't mind blood-spattered scenes and can overlook the underwhelming script, you just might get something out of 'Drive'. Maybe.",Drive
384,cestleilacherradi,Must be a men's movie,4,11 May 2014,"I carefully read some of the reviews that say this is a very good movie. And I am not sure I understood. Must be a men's movie... From the very beginning of the movie, I felt disappointed : the tone of voice of Ryan Gosling - sort of one of a gangster giving instructions to someone - already bored me to tears, and the music that was played at the same time seemed to me too déjà-vu, and too cliché.Now, Ryan Gosling is a man I am in love with. He has something phenomenal in him and he feels and transmits feelings I forgot I had!He's so endearing that even if he breaks someone's head, I still wanna go with him, sic!But I'm not an action girl. I don't like to see cars fast driven. I don't enjoy free violence.So! But, there is a moment when I got into the movie and that's when Ryan is really challenged and when characters that touched me were in danger. I loved that part! Too bad there is an unhappy ending! I hate unhappy endings! Plus there were some clichés in the movie, and I felt they were ridiculous (sorry) : when you see Ryan driving with Mulligan to a river, and riding on the side : that has been done numerous times. when Ryan says something about the scorpio while you see his jacket and again he speaks with such a serious voice that it seems over the top.and the most important of all is when Mulligan touches her lips after thinking of Ryan. Excuse me???? Do you know any girl who ever did that? Do you know in how many movies there is a woman who touches her lips while she's thinking of her lover? Too bad! I'd like to never see that kind of scene again. My conclusion, especially since there is that scene, is that this is a man's movie, with his fantasies, one of them being a woman touching her lips while thinking of him... There's nothing wrong with that. Not my thing...",Drive

She seems miscast since in the trivia notes it says the character was originally Hispanic. There are no sex scenes in Drive but there are plenty of scenes of violence. Plus a few car chases. The pacing is deliberately slow & moody. This is a movie that knows it's a movie. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. The dialogue is minimal. The direction is minimalist. The music is subliminal. The night photography is washed out & watered down. This is not the kind of movie you might enjoy.

I am so glad I watched this film - this is a hidden gem. The direction and casting are faultless. I could not imagine anyone else playing these roles. The slow motion in parts is handled superbly and helps to bring the story alive. I can see why the film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Achievement in Sound Editing. If you are a nerdy sound person like me, this is a real treat. The soundtrack. Man, the soundtrack. When I heard Riz Ortolani's ""Oh My Love "" sung by Katyna Ranieri my head raced. Where had I heard that before? ""Goodbye Uncle Tom"". The Hero is quiet. But we never know his backstory. So we can only imagine. This adds to his charm.

387,FSfilmblog,A Modern Western,10,2 February 2013,"Drive. A simplistic title for a movie where the lead character main asset is his driving abilities and from this point it may seem like the plot would be all about cars and driving fast. Luckily there is more to this than going 0-60 in 3 seconds.A narrative which is based on classic westerns themes, a nameless hero who falls for a local woman and gets mixed up with the wrong crowd and endeavours to make things right. Except this is located in modern LA and his speciality is his driving skills. Ryan Gosling plays our nameless hero who is a getaway driver for hire and a stuntman and mechanic by day.The opening scene shows us his impressive talent and his quiet, strong persona that commands the screen and grabs our attention immediately. He is impressive when he talks and equally brooding when he doesn't. The nameless protagonist is cool, calm and collective. His life is simple and with little or no desires only to carry out his job and to do it well... that is, until he comes into contact with Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son, his neighbours.They become friends and connect through unspoken glances and Gosling's character feels an emotional connection with Irene and her son Benicio. The Driver has found something that has been missing in his life but unfortunate that is short lived as Irene husband is released from jail and he is in heavy debt to some very dangerous men who intend to collect one way or another.With the film shot in a highly stylised way you'd be forgiven in thinking it's all just flash in the pan, fast edits with little or no substances to character or story but in fact the opposite is true. With a mesmerising soundtrack and a very authentic 80's feel to it, the director has made it feel cool and never contrived. Even down to the opening titles, a pink neon typography adds to the appeal.The strongest focal point to the film is Ryan Gosling's portray of the lead character. As mention before he comes across as strong and passionate man with little or no weakness. A believability and a measured control of his emotions allowing a remarkable performance where he can show you what he is feeling without saying any words. Fine support comes from Bryan Cranston (from Breaking Bad) as his only friend/companion.I warn those of a weak disposition that there are some gruesome acts of violence amongst the beautiful shot imagery. If anything, you won't forget the contrasting image of a kiss and a skull being smashed in the same shot. A haunting and powerful film with an outstanding performance from Gosling, one of the best film of 2011.",Drive
388,keal,"80's pop flavor, with hardcore sci-fi undertones",9,5 February 2012,"The 80's music, coupled with the pink, flamboyant font for the intro credits, just put this movie in a retro mindset for me, which is a nice escape from modern mainstream movies. Add the occasional overhead nighttime city views that make you feel like you're watching Blade Runner, and add the main character's nice-guy looks, and you have a movie that filled with likable movie elements that have never been put together quite like this. Very, very enjoyable! It's easy to see that this movie is not going to win any major awards, simply because it doesn't fit the current criteria. A lot of viewers who enjoy the movie throughout will most likely be left hanging at the end, wondering 'what happens?' but if you think about it, you know, the main character is now entrenched in his current life of cleaning up the underground mess. He's a no-name guy with nothing to lose.Bottom line, this is an essential film for real movie buffs. You won't feel like you're wasting a single minute of your life watching this.I'm stuck in the video game world of Skyrim, and this was the ONLY movie I sat through in the last 6 months, besides Mamoru Oshii's Assault Girls. Skyrim fans would understand, it takes a solid movie to pull you out of the beauty of Skyrim.There could be a Drive 2. Look at the director's Pusher trilogy.

The best thing about the movie - the chase sequences are boring as well. The lead actor whispers his lines and it's difficult to hear what he is going on about.

I award bravery married to timing, tone and that rare commodity, allowing actors faces to nuance a role. This is a paced movie that stays slow and builds at the same time. Something more common in a horror film. Tension. Kudos to director Nicolas Refn.Drive is a surprise. I didn't realize Ryan Gosling acted this well. Perfectly cast because of his look of innocent boyishness, not too handsome but nice to look at, he could be anybody you've known who's a pleasant guy.In this movie he is, you assume, an introverted and lonely man, completely wedded to all things cars. He is a master craftsman of driving, be it stunts or race tracks, chases or get aways. We don't really know what is going on inside him as we watch his character respond to a very odd set of circumstances put before him. He steps outside of his comfort zone and he falls for a neighbor, Carey Mulligan, whose husband is in prison. She has a son he also adores. But it is restrained. They barely speak. They look at each other. Volumes of desire.Loser husband gets out and owes big money to bad people who beat him up and give him one chance to get their money. He has to rob a pawn shop for them. Gosling offers to help as the getaway driver, doing the only thing he knows how to do in order to ensure the wife's safety.Things go bad. It's a set up. At this point, we realize that in every scene, things get deeper and deeper, more out of the element of this man who drives. He carries no gun. He isn't a ""wise guy."" He is gentle. Restrained. Careful. Cautious. Yet he rises seamlessly to each situation. We notice how aware he is of every person, every car, and we realize he has had some experience of which we know nothing and we begin to wonder what he did before he showed up five years ago to become a grease monkey, get-away car driver, wanna be race car driver. But I didn't think about it too much, the movie was too engrossing.All of this is played softly, subdued. Gosling probably only says 15 sentences. Maybe 20 tops. Mulligan, reminding me a lot of Michelle Williams, probably says about the same. The plot is interesting but not of major importance. A man of few words, he is an action person. All of a sudden, we have swung over into The Man With No Name territory. But it's so low key the only action is violence. Major stomp your head into a rotten tomato violence. Whoa. Where did that come from?Albert Brooks is a cheap hood who has become a nice guy but is actually a professional killer and a cheap hood. Ron Pearlman is his partner who knows he's a cheap hood. They're a nice foil. Brooks probably has the most lines, as is apropos. But everything comes to a head, of course. And you are left wondering . . . who is this driver guy?

Acting is beyond wooden (despite the cast!), and gore is used grotesquely, as a substitute for actual drama.

394,kevin-miller447,Drive is style over substance,5,20 September 2011,"Drive back in 2011 was hyped up beyond the conventional blockbuster. It came from a relatively unknown director but had Ryan Gosling in the leading role. Women everywhere had a substitute for their vibrators the day they saw this. This film unsettles me in a few ways, but first i will give credit where it is due. Winding Refn frames almost every shot with perfection, the cinematography is gorgeous to say the least and the film overall is edited to precision. Now that being said, I'll pour some hot water onto the ice cream cone character Gosling plays. And by ice cream, I mean stiff, and in the need of some licking. Being an aspiring filmmaker, I completely understand the concept of ""show, don't tell."" Now that being said, there are for sure some areas of this film where I was begging for him to say something. I recommend for anyone who saw this and enjoyed it, to watch Broken Flowers. In that film, Bill Murray plays a character that isn't totally different than this one. Except I liked Bill Murray a lot more. I have nothing against Gosling. He's a great actor, no question; but dude, would it kill you not to look constipated for one scene? Additionally, it would have helped to know what the f**k Cranston's disability was so that when he died, I actually cared. Instead it was more like ""yep, saw that one coming."" Carey Mulligan is a beautiful woman with a lot of talent, and she and Gosling made a nice couple. But if I was her, I would have steered clear of the guy because he came off as the quiet creepy type that ends up being a sociopath with no life. Gosling is given no backstory so we have absolutely no freaking idea why he does what he does and what motivates him. This doesn't help me when I'm supposed to care about him possibly dying. His character develops in a generic fashion in a generic ""it all went wrong"" film. I wanted to see him do more stunt car driving for the movies since that was technically his day job. Just one example doesn't cut it. This movie is style over substance as much as Sucker Punch was except there are no special effects in this film. I watched this a second time because I wanted to revisit the film after all the hype had died away and the Oscars were through. I found myself enjoying bits and pieces more than I had the first time, but my overall experience was the same. It is an OK film. And usually in my book, a 2.5/5 means it's forgettable. Well, it's kinda hard to forget a film when everyone's gushing over it like it's a low budget version of ""The Dark Knight"" (a film I adore). I'm not saying it's bad to like this film since I'm one of the few who enjoyed Transformers 2. I don't now and never will understand what people love so much about this movie. Everyone says ""it's different"" when it really isn't. It's a generic movie with Refn's touch. A love story in a nutshell. A really creepy love story. Thank you for reading and have a nice day. I'm gonna take a Drive.",Drive

396,iheart_ny,"Drive: What ""The American"" should have been.",8,25 September 2011,"Last year, there was a film called ""The American"", that was distributed by Focus Features, and had George Clooney in the role of a hit-man who had lost his way, and was hiding out in a gorgeous Italian landscape, waiting to go on one last mission. This was something of an art film. It meant to be subtle, and emotional, and beautiful, and at the same time, somewhat surprising. It did none of these things. I tend to be the occasional film snob, enjoying the kind of film that relies on subtlety, rather than either laughs or violence, or something like that, that the average audience is more likely to enjoy. However, I hated ""The American"". Nothing happened in it. It was dull and boring, and too snooty for even me to enjoy. I mention all of this, because ""Drive"", a film I saw yesterday, was fantastic. It displayed exactly what ""The American"" was going for, but missed completely. This is a fully realized version of that movie. One reason why ""The American"" failed, is because I am completely tired of George Clooney. He's had his time in the spotlight, and that was one of his weakest performances.However, Ryan Gosling is the heartbeat of ""Drive"". He's charismatic, charming, sexy, and one hell of an actor. You never know where his character is going to go, and that's what this movie wants of its audience. His charm isn't something easily accomplished, he becomes his character, like only the best actors do. ""Drive"" follows an unnamed man, who is a stuntman for Hollywood movies. On the side, he moonlights as a getaway driver. He never works for the same person twice, and works anonymously. He falls in love with a woman (Carey Mulligan) who lives in his apartment building, whose husband (Oscar Isaac) is in prison. Somewhere in the film, Jewish mobsters (Albert Brooks, Ron Perlman) become involved in the story, threatening the lives of everyone.The story is a slow-burner, taking awhile to set into affect. However, that's the way it should be. Unlike ""The American"", the story eventually does go somewhere, and it has an ending that packs a huge punch. Unlike many action films that I've recently seen, it has undeniable style. It has a Tarantino-esque feel, and a look that separates it from a lot of other similar films. It has a somber, and melancholic feel, and yet has many ""gasp"" moments. Its final act is unforgettable. Story lines overlap, and crash together in an almost classical way. It is definitely not for the faint of heart, though, as quiet moments in the film are broken by moments of brutal violence. However, that's one of the things that makes this film so good. However, there are a few moments that lag the pacing, somewhat. A few things could have easily been cut out, because they don't bring the story along at all. But that doesn't hurt the overall product. Once you see how it ends, it more than makes up for its flaws.Grade: B+",Drive
397,covington_c,Exquisite Noir Cinema...,10,12 August 2019,"For those who gave this movie a low rating... you CLEARLY missed it. Shaw & Hobbs is probably going to be more your speed.Drive is an EXCEPTIONAL noir piece. Ryan Gosling is PERFECT as 'the driver'... the same way he is in Only God Forgives & Bladerunner 2049. He CARRIES those movies... the same way he does THIS one. He never over acts... & does cold-blooded grit with a superb nuance. I can see how many actors would pass on such a violent movie role, but I'm glad we have an actor who steps up to the plate & DELIVERS, time & time again in such roles.Easily one of THE best wheel man movies, ever made. I gave it a 10 to counter all of the unnecessarily harsh criticism.Hop in the driver's seat & give this movie a spin! Hope you enjoy & APPRECIATE it as much as I did!",Drive
398,austinfromdahood,"NWR's best film, one of my all time favorites",10,29 July 2018,"When I started to get interested into film, I somehow started watching movie reviews on YouTube, and my favorite YouTube movie critic was and still is, Chris Stuckmann. After binge watching many of his videos, I found out that one of his favorite films is Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive. I decided to watch it one day, and I was very mixed on it at first. I then watched Chris Stuckmann's Analyzed video on Drive, but after that, I still didn't understand the movie too much. Then, one day, I just had the urge to watch it again. I don't know why, I just did, but watching it the 2nd time was a very mesmerizing experience. The soundtrack, the cinematography, the acting, and it's complex story makes Drive one of my favorite films of all time. Many people did not like this movie upon its release, and I think it is because of its misleading marketing. The trailers for Drive make it seems like the movie is a straight up action film with the utterly handsome Ryan Gosling in the leading role. The movie is actually a meticulously crafted neo-noir film that doesn't concentrate on the action, but on its complex story. This film is not only one of my favorite arthouse films, but one of my all time favorites.",Drive
399,moviefreak2010,Makes you want to get in a car and just drive.,10,17 September 2011,"3 1/2 out of 4 pointsLike a lot movies now a days, DRIVE belongs in a genre that has been done so many times. Ryan Gosling is a driver by day and a driver by night. He is a Hollywood Stuntman during the day and a getaway driver during the night. He has no emotions until he meets a special woman that lives next door to him who has a kid. Almost immediately they bond. He then pulls off another job that goes wrong and now he is marked for death. However, what is great about DRIVE is that it is a fresh take on the genre. Yes, it has car chases but not a single moment is CGI which is a nice break. The action of the chases is plausible and the director understands geography very well. But it is the character study of The Driver as well as everyone else and that is what holds the movie from falling apart. Otherwise it would of been all style and no substance. Ryan Gosling and its supporting players are colorful in their roles. Especially Ron Pearlman but its great to see Albert Brooks out of his comedic roles into a role that is serious and scary. The director is Nicolas Winding Refn who made only two films that I saw, BRONSON and VALHALLA RISING. I didn't finished VR but it was excellent so far as well as BRONSON. He made more movies prior to the two which I would love to see. He is a great art house director and DRIVE does not hide away from that. In fact, bringing the art house style is what help this movie. Any other way would NOT work. Overall, an excellent film that refreshes a genre that is dated and maybe...just maybe Hollywood will learn from this movie and make more movies like this.",Drive
400,AttilaD87,Long Live Real Heroes!,9,7 April 2012,"The movie is a perfect contender to be later a great classic. Drive is somehow capable to bring back something from the Dollars Trilogy. It is felt like Ryan Gosling continues what Clint Eastwood did in his famous trilogy. Protecting the weak ones.Gosling's character is an unnamed Driver who also works as a mechanic, stuntman and getaway driver. He has a little bit strange personality ,not to talking ,just doing his job... Later he meets his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and starts to have feelings for her. When Irene's husband ,Standard (Oscar Isaac) comes back home from prison he finds out that Standard owes protection money to a gangster, Cook. In order to protect Irene and her family it gets start the war between the Driver and the mob that will come with superb action ,some ""The Fast and the Furious"" like scenes and some hard core violence. The scene when the Driver comes in a mask to take out one of his big targets Nino, a Jewish mobster (Ron Perlman, who also I would to ad matched perfectly with his role), is one of my favorites, I knew then that the movie has what has to have a classic.Most of all Drive's great value is the never ending fight and the morality that the driver has to fight off the trouble between people. And of course the great romance.The ""A Real Hero"" soundtrack is perfect in the movie , makes a beautiful atmosphere to it, Clint Eastwood's legacy can long live on.",Drive

An hold-up going out of control, dangerous girl, impossible love. Every most basic cliché is included.The actor Gosling (driver) is bad at playing desire, or fear, or anger. In fact, being dead, he still acts awfully bad. Mulligan is a better actress, but the ancients Brooks and Perlman are the ones saving the casting.What will remain from this movie ? that crime does not pay. Or only maybe for film producers.",Drive
402,aaronjamesmaximus,Literally One of The Coolest Movies Ever Made,10,10 June 2020,"The arthouse violence the simple plot of mysterious boy meets down on her luck girl, boy kills criminal thugs who threaten them, boy drive off into the night like an avenging wraith. The mysterious driver is such an awesome character like many mysterious characters in cinema we don't need to know their backstory in fact that would take away from their character there mystique that makes them relatable by them being vague. He's like a ghost he come from nowhere and leaves the same way. Great, no spectacular performances by Ryan Gosling as The Driver Carey Mulligan as Irene Bryan Cranston as Shannon Albert Brooks as Bernie Rose Oscar Isaac as Standard Gabriel Christina Hendricks as Blanche Ron Perlman as Nino Kaden Leos as Benicio and James Biberi as Cook. The movie oozes that feeling of exoteric bliss that awe like seeing the vast beautiful cosmos in a single breath the striking color the contrast it feels like art painted by a master like Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel Da Vinci and The Mona a masterwork and nothing less. The music also exudes hypercharged jet fuel for the soul and heightens the experience of watching art and also hearing it. Like the best films of the vhs era this movie feel like it is beyond it's time a callback to an era of great movies taking you to another world much more appealing than our own. Like you want leave your mortal coils and enter a new world beyond our own. Sometimes the best movies and soundtracks are also the simplest the best way to represent something is to simplify it and unlock new complex understand. If something is near incomprehensible then that door is locked and you cannot immerse yourself into a brave new world you cannot full enter and receive new understanding. The movie is amazing we need more movies like this perhaps not the same Mtv era arthouse feel but also made with craft and skill and written exceptionally well.",Drive
403,licktheenvelope,Perhaps not for all? But sooooo good.,9,5 February 2012,"Nicolas Winding Refn's drive has caused some very mixed reactions (as you can see from all these reviews!). I will say straight out that I never saw a trailer for this movie. I'd seen a few reviews from critics, mostly on the positive side with the general impression that most consumers would be upset at how the trailer portrayed it.Having never seen the trailer and being very busy I decided to finally sit down and watch drive at 1 AM. Usually I throw a movie on and fall asleep (2 nights before I managed to get 30 minutes into Captain America... dozing off right as he had got the serum... something) and I will say it's now 3:15 AM and I am still thinking about drive.It's very very hard to find good films these days. I find myself heading back into my film-noir vice, Hitchcock flicks and other films that most people my age don't even know exist (mid-twenties). I am not an art student. What I can appreciate is solid craftsmanship and work that leaves you thinking and instills emotions you don't find from your average Michael bay film and Drive certainly did that.Ryan Gosling's central character is never named, providing intrigue into his character. Very few back-stories are presented anywhere in the film which, for me, had me reminiscing about Clint Eastwood films. Gosling's portrayal is solid and he manages to pull off the 'this guy is tougher than he looks' attitude very well. Many mainstream movies would force feed you a back story. ""He was ex-military! Got off the radar to start anew in LA working cheap as a mechanic, when things got real! and the mob is after him!"" Many here don't seem to understand the point of the dialogue... (which I find surprising)... the lack of dialogue is MEANT to keep you waiting. It builds tension to absurd levels then drops you off a cliff you very short, very deliberate violence or action. Some compared it to horror films? (really?) Aside from one shot (literally one shot) most of the violence is tame and often completely out of the shot (see the ending).I would have given this film a 10/10 if not for some casting and dialogue choices which worked okay, but I felt could have been a touch better.In brief, if you really really want to see an action movie DON'T SEE THIS FILM. If you have no patience for deliberately slow pacing, DON'T SEE THIS FILM. If you want to engage your senses and don't mind the occasional stabbing or two people staring at each other for a minute to draw you into a scene then give it a go. I am well aware that many people I know will hate this film, and many others will love it.",Drive

405,andymcneill75,Absolutely Brilliant film!!!,10,27 September 2011,"I absolutely loved Drive and think this is honestly the best film i've seen in the cinema in a long, long time. This is a modern classic of great film-making and has everything in it - it is a haunting, retro- styled piece of ultra-cool film noir and has great acting, superb visuals, great direction along with a superb soundtrack mixed in with emotion, suspense, tension and some shocking moments of violence. Ryan Gosling is fantastic in this and plays Driver as a quiet loner-type with a very dark side that you'd never think he was capable of and his performance seems very calm, peaceful and a lot of what he does comes off in nuances and when he goes off he truly explodes, he could win the best actor Oscar but a nomination is the very least he deserves. The support is excellent in the film from Carey Mulligan as the troubled neighbour he has a soft spot for and young Kaden Leos as her son is great, Bryan Cranston is cool as Driver's confidant and garage boss Shannon, Christina Hendricks brings a bit of sassiness to a small role as Blanche and Ron Perlman is good as the partner of Albert Brooks, who is just amazing as the shady criminal boss Bernie Rose. Brooks has had a long career of playing the funny man but he is deadly serious in this and they should just hand him the best supporting actor Oscar now because he was brilliant!!! Nicolas Winding Refn has come along way since the Pusher films and is on his way to great things starting with Drive and there is every chance he may get a nod for best director at the Oscars! I think it deserves shots for best picture, director, actor, supporting actor, cinematography, music and theme song ' A Real Hero' by College featuring Electric Youth, which is a great tune. Anybody who doesn't like this knows nothing about what makes a good film and has gone into this without thinking about what they are seeing. This film is unlike anything else and is cinema it's finest. "" I Drive """,Drive
406,Marjeez,Refn chooses style over substance when the style isn't nearly as good as the substance.,8,20 September 2011,"If I were to describe my thoughts on Drive in one sentence it would be that... it's probably the best film I have ever been so disappointed with. Yes, that pretty much sums it up. I hadn't been this excited to see a film in a long time. Needless to say, I expected a lot out of Drive. However I left the theater disappointed.The first half of the film is simply beautiful. You sort of envision what's to come. The characters are interesting, the scenes are tense, and the story builds along smoothly. The acting is wonderful. Despite what many say, I thought Gosling had a certain presence and mystery to him that a different actor might not have had. He played his role to near perfection and made it easier to imagine being put into his shoes. I enjoyed the subtlety of his performance when he's with his neighbor and her son; the way his face lights up when it's never shown but rather more ""felt"" on-screen. Carrie Mulligan also did a wonderful job. I would say that the acting was spot on throughout. Even the little boy had the acting chops, and Bryan Cranston played his part as good as you'd expect (although a bit weird seeing him in a different role than Walter White from Breaking Bad).The story is well-told. The story has a lot of things going for it. You care about the characters and are interested in where it will head. Unfortunately, it ends on a very anti-climactic ending that takes a lot of the atmosphere away from the film, and it felt a bit rushed.I also thought the direction was hit-or-miss. Not being a fan of Refn (the director), I was surprisingly loving the direction he was taking the film by the mid-way point. After that, it seemed clear that he had run out of ideas. He over-uses the same shots and it gets tiring. The music, although in the first half of the film was extraordinary, in the second half it is borderline cheesy. It took me right out of the atmosphere, which is disappointing. Refn in my mind has always been the most pretentious filmmaker today, and sadly I still feel the same way after viewing Drive. He seems to love being different and doesn't care if it hurts or enhances the film, which in the case of Drive, his decisions do a little of both.To give an example, I thought the Refn's direction was sort of like how a child thinks. If a child does something funny, and you laugh, they will continue to do the same funny thing over and over, expecting you to keep laughing. You'll laugh, but only to make them happy. This is the same feeling I got from the direction. Refn throws something cool at you, then throws it again and again and again, while at the same time you're trying to focus on the story. It just doesn't work and for a relatively unknown director it's inexcusable, especially when you're engaged and immersed in the story.I still enjoyed Drive. Although leaving the theater I was disappointed by the missed potential, it was still a ride worth taking. Although not the best film of the year, it will still be one of highlights of 2011. Which is sad, because the outstanding first half made it seem clear that it was going to be one of the best films in the last few years.I would also like to warn the viewers about the trailer. I'm sure most of us have seen trailers for comedies that tell all the jokes, and same holds true with the trailer for Drive. It gives away many of the best scenes in the film, including my favorite scene. It is best to stay away from the trailer.That sort of sums up my experience with Drive, a lot of potential but doesn't deliver the whole based on the sum of its parts. Refn chooses style over substance when the style isn't nearly as good as the substance.",Drive

410,willhaskew,Art house meets exploitation,8,11 August 2016,"Driver is an old type of story. At it's heart we see a loner on a mission of vengeance. Ryan Gosling's Driver like Shane, not much back story is given to this character. Driver lives in a small apartment building where he befriends his neighbor (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio (Kaen Leos). The Driver is a mechanic at Shannon's service garage but also a part-time stunt drive and double for films. Shannon runs an illegal getaway service for criminals on the side which he uses the Driver to operate. The Driver has a very specific modus operandi when he act as a wheelman: he shows up at a predetermined time and place, the client has a five minute window to make their way to his car and if they don't make it to his car in the time allotted then he leaves.Shannon also has ambitions to build a race car with the Driver competing for him. He seeks out financing from a pair of gangsters, Jewish mobsters Nino (Ron Perlman) and former low budget film producer movie producer-turned-gangster Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks). At the same time, Driver meets Standard Gabriel (Oscar Ramirez), Irene's husband who's been recently from prison. Driver finds Standard badly beaten one day and he admits to the Driver that he owes an Albanian mobster money paid for protection while he was in jail. The Driver makes a deal with the mobster called Cook and agrees to help Standard rob a pawn shop in order to pay back Standard's debt but the job goes violently awry with the Driver stuck in the middle trying to protect Irene and Benicio.Ryan Gosling (Half Nelson, The Place Beyond the Pines) gives a riveting performance as Driver. He's an outwardly calm almost detached seeming persona but he demonstrates a volcano of emotion especially when he's seen taking violent action to protect Irene and her son. Carey Mulligan does holds her own in the story as well considering her character seems a little underdeveloped and maybe even here just to play a damsel. Ron Perlman imbues Nino with a special kind of bitterness. Nino is a man in his mid-50's who feels ineffectual and has an almost adolescent reason for setting everything up in the whole scam out of some desire to prove how truly smart he is. Albert Brooks' Bernie Rose is a no nonsense sadist despise his reasonable businessman persona. Bryan Cranson gives probably the best acting performance as Shannon, the garage owner who employs the Driver and is also the unwitting architect for the events that take place in the second half. Nicolas Winding Refn has an incredible eye and this film is photographed in a beautiful high gloss way. It's style has been compared to the American and European neo-noir of the late 1960's to late 1970's in particular the 1978 Ryan O'Neil film Driver, the 1967 French film Le Samourai and 1967's Point Blank with Lee Marvin.",Drive
411,mrda1981,"A friend described this as ""Shane in a Michael Mann skin"" and I'm inclined to agree.",8,21 January 2013,"Powered by a superficially tranquil energy, this Western-on-wheels story has much bubbling beneath its sleek, taciturn outer layers, much like its nameless protagonist. The long, subdued stretches that characterise the narrative serve to make the sparse scenes of action and romance all the more savage, stirring, and memorable when they arrive. Although the detached, resolute anti-hero speaks sparsely and softly, a lot is conveyed of him through his barely spoken affection and regard for his lone mum neighbour and the ruthless, brutal lengths he pursues to keep her from the claws of the mobsters he finds himself entangled with. As such, this film works not only as a gritty crime drama and atypically touching love story but also as an engaging character study which relies on the aforementioned elements to reveal the protagonist's (and, to a lesser extent, the support cast's) multiple layers. Is he, as the excellent synth soundtrack suggests, a ""real hero"", a troubled and tortured bloke hanging by a thread, or some semi-integrated blend of both? At once haunting, arresting, and poignant, Drive is the cinematic equivalent of the very best synthpop: cool, celestial craftsmanship punctuated by harsh, pounding beats, both belying the raw, organic heart pulsing at its core.",Drive

413,AlukardsCastle,"""A Real Hero""",10,20 September 2011,"Driver is about a stuntman driver (Gosling), who literally does what the title suggests. He drives. The opening is a heist and car chase that is just perfect with an engaging soundtrack in the background. Later he meets his neighbor and her son. Then the love story portion of the film sets in. This is mostly to get to know the characters so when they die or are in danger later on you feel for them. When the neighbors husband comes home from prison it sets off a chain of events that make the last hour of the film a roller coaster of an experience.This movie is a modern tragedy done right. The acting and directing is top-notch. I was literally walking out of the theater emulating Ryan Goslings performance in the movie. That's how good he is as an actor, and he barely speaks throughout the entire movie. He deserves to WIN the academy award for best actor this year.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 was my favorite movie this year prior to this. However, 'Drive' has punched that film aside as the best movie of 2011, and possibly the decade. It is officially my favorite movie of all time right now. I don't say that to just any movie.This is like an Art House Action Drama-thriller(at times it has horror elements) film that was released into the Mainstream. Many people in the theater I watched it at were making impatient sounds throughout the movie because of some of the longer drawn out scenes. They are obviously the people who assumed this was a 'Fast and Furious' type film. This is not just a mindless action movie(though the blood and guts spew out like a horror movie in some scenes). Another man behind me was whimpering during the ending stab scene because they didn't show it up close? The directing of the said scene was masterful and a good example of 'less is more', leaving the stab scene to our imagination. This scene is also effective when its your very first time watching the movie because it makes you wonder which person survived, Driver or Bernie? Oh and this movie is also the only movie to make me jump multiple times to the sound of gunshots (which I knew were coming). The gunshots and bashing effects are the most realistic I've heard in any film.Most of Goslings acting is in his eyes, and let me tell you, this is one good looking man. I am a straight guy and would never go gay, but Gosling is just a man's man in this film. He is now one of my favorite actors. People (Mainly wannabe macho men who can't score chicks) knock him down for being in 'The Notebook'.Did I mention the soundtrack? It was dreamlike and fit into every scene. The song 'A Real Hero' must garner a nomination for best song at the Academy.Seriously, in a shitty year for movies, this film makes up for it all.Imagine Taxi Driver (De Nero), the final 10 minutes of 'The Departed', Car chases similar to Fast and Furious, and a silent hero protagonist that just kicks ass. Now put all of these elements in one film with an original story and great music to back it up.I promise anyone that whether you love this movie (who wouldn't?) or hate it (mindless people that want nonstop action with no plot), you will walk out of the theater in a dreamlike state.The way the director presents L.A is as if it was some fairy tale world gone bad. This is a good thing.I really can't think straight right now to make any further coherent remarks about this amazing movie. It's just that good.Just know that if this isn't at least nominated for: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Gosling), Best supporting actor (Brooks), and Best Original Song or Score.... Then the Academy is officially run by idiots. *I am revisiting this review in light of the recent Oscar nominations for movies of 2011 having been released. I am very disappointed that the only nomination this gem of a movie was for sound editing. This doesn't change my opinion about the movie, but it drastically makes me loathe the people in charge of the Academy Awards.*",Drive

It hooks the audience right from the very start as our mysterious protagonist explains his work rules, to the very end, as he drives off into the night, making the audience crave more, leaving everything open to interpretation.Beautifully styled, shot and edited, Drive has many miniscule details that the audience will only pick up on with their subconscious.

The driver was a complete cipher. Every character except him had a brief scene where he (or she) revealed one thing about his past that gave his choices and actions some context. Thus, when the driver lashes out into extreme violence halfway through the film, the viewer has no peg to hang the actions on, and no reason to continue sympathizing with him - he's just as brutal a scumbag as every other character, except we don't know why he is what he is. All we know about him is what we see on the screen, and it's not very pretty.I could have accepted it as a stylish genre exercise - a comic-book movie - except the too-hip-for-you artsiness blew that right out of the water. Didn't work as an art film, didn't work as a heist/car flick. No moral center at all.",Drive
417,salmon62,disappointed by the hype,3,28 April 2012,"This film was well-reviewed here on IMDb and in the LA press. I was shocked to see such high reviews for a film. Some of the reviews were excessively positive, i.e. ""best movie I've ever seen"", etc.I watched the film and was underwhelmed and surprised by many technical errors and ""leaps of faith"" I had to make to believe this storyline.The director seemed to favor awkward pauses in the dialog of the two main characters, Gosling and his neighbor. This wasn't natural. Sometimes there was no dialog when there should have been, and other times there was superfluous and unexplainable dialog, such as the scene in the coffee shop between Gosling and some former client who recognizes him.The screenwriter wants us to believe that the Gosling character, in his 20's, possesses some sort of innate ability to drive from crime scenes, expertly navigating Los Angeles, avoiding the LAPD, while working as a stunt driver and mechanic in Hollywood. In reality, most of these stunt drivers are older, seasoned, unionized veterans and not mysterious young ex-cons or mechanics. The intent was to create mystery and awe for the Gosling character but it just doesn't work. This is right out of the ""Jerry Bruckheimer playbook of romantic character development"" (See Gone in Sixty seconds)and I just wasn't buying it.I expected technical expertise in the driving scenes, but they were average and were fraught with technical errors----- visible skid marks where the scenes were rehearsed, inappropriate ""foley"" effects for the cars, and the worst case---- where Gosling's character rams Nino's limo at least twice at high speeds, yet his Chevrolet still has functioning headlights and no visible damage! The plot asked too much to believe. All those dead bodies and no police investigation or attention? Why did Gosling's character wear a Hollywood disguise of a bald guy to kill Nino, when the bald crook was already dead------- having been killed in Nino's restaurant? Why does Gosling's character repeat the phrase, ""you got me for five minutes"" when each job may be different? Gosling's character seems to operate in a vacuum free of police scrutiny. This movie tries to duplicate characters like Steve Mcqueen, Clint Eastwood, and other mysterious men of few words.The problem is it doesn't work in ""The Driver.""",Drive
418,katie-sirles,Drive - Simply the Best Movie of 2011,10,30 December 2011,"Why was DRIVE my favorite movie of 2011? Was it Ryan Gosling's awesome satiny scorpion jacket that I now have my very own hoodie version of? Was it the totally boss soundtrack? Was it Albert Brooks's complete lack of eyebrows? I would say it was a grand combination of these things and more. Ever since THE NOTEBOOK hit theaters I have always said to myself ""Gee, I'd really love to see Ryan Gosling kick some guy's head in. Just stomp it to pieces."" The story is a simple one that really just brings the awesome. Basically Driver (Ryan Gosling) does stunt driving for the movies. Malcolm in the Middle's dad AKA Breaking Bad AKA Bryan Cranston plays Shannon, Driver's boss at a garage where they work and his pseudo manager for his movie career. Shannon borrows money from Bernie (Albert Brooks) for a race car that Driver is to race. Are you keeping up with me here? Nino (Ron Perlman) is Bernie's business partner and is also a real nasty gangster type.Then there's Irene (Carey Mulligan). She is Driver's neighbor. Driver and Irene totes have crushes on each other and so he helps her out with things and looks after her son. When Irene's husband is released from prison, he comes home and promises to make a better life for his family. Like ten minutes later he blows it and is a bloodied mess in the parking garage. Driver happens by and presses him for information. Anyone with half a brain – which may be more than Driver has – can figure out what is going to happen. Driver has to help Irene's husband get some mob guys off his back so they won't kill him or Irene and the kid. Did I mention that Albert Brooks has NO EYEBROWS? A mob story about a guy who drives for a living and wears a scorpion jacket all the time what's so special about that? Well, if you drink when you go to the movies – like I do – then you know how easy it is to turn to mush at the smallest thing. Whether it's a vacant stare shared by two socially inept people, or a man's face completely lacking any kind of brow over the eyes. Ryan Gosling is perfect in this role. He's calm, cool, and collected at all times. He walks through the streets in a blood-stained jacket and everyone just assumes that he knows what he's doing so there's no need to worry.It's that icy, blank gaze. The movie has plenty of action and a great soundtrack to go along with it. Cliff Martinez had the joyous task of creating a score for a driving movie and did so incredibly well. Every beat fits like a glove. I also tend to enjoy a twisting, turning plot that I can follow while I'm buzzed. I knew what was going on the whole time. Good on you, Hossein Amini, for writing a screenplay all types of audience members could enjoy. Even the ones with a tummy full of rum.Basically, DRIVE tops my list for best movies of the year because it combines all of the elements necessary to create a movie that you'll remember. It stays with you. The story flows well and the movie doesn't drag on for an unnecessary 45 minutes. It jumps straight to the point. Still not convinced? Then you just go straight to hell.I'm kidding. In all seriousness, a great screenplay and performances that are strange but superb have this movie lined up to win Best Picture at the Oscars this year, in my humble opinion. Some award shows just don't know what they're doing. I'm looking at you, Golden Globes.",Drive
419,Prabhuraj,An instant cult classic.,8,10 May 2020,"Cast's Performances, Music and Photography. Everything is just perfect. This movie does all of those things perfectly in my opinion. Ryan Gosling is damn near perfect playing a soft-spoken man with some inner demons. Some of the stylish, sleek, and seamlessly cool imagery in this movie gave me chills.

420,vegeta-julian,100 Minutes of Ryan Gosling staring into the distance,3,19 November 2018,"Seriously, it is ridiculous how often you get a shot of Ryan Gosling staring into the distance in this movie. If you enjoy just looking at him in awe then this movie probably is for you, because you won't get much else.
The shots are annoyingly long, they really celebrate each and every single one of them by overextending the duration. The dialogues are slow and shallow as well. Gosling doesn't portray any kind of emotion for most of the screen time, but is rather looking like he is always bored to death in whatever situation he is in. I was hoping to get any kind of information during the story of why his character seems to be absolutely distant and emotionless and would have liked to know more about the characters driving motives behind his actions. But you also won't get any of that.
It is very different from most of the contemporary movies, but different does not always equal good.",Drive
421,Miasmakoala,Almost flawless,9,22 September 2018,"The only issue I have with the movie is the Driver. The main character is just laughable in the beginning of the movie, Ryan Gosling does a great work portraying the mysterious Driver, but he is just so damn awkward. Of course it's obvious that Nicolas Refn wished to portray the character this way, but in the first 30 minutes of the movie (exclude the intro scene) the Driver just seems to be a prop saying things to characters around him.When the movie picks up the pace and the conflict begins, the Driver finds his place in the movie's world. The drama, the thrills, the atmosphere, everything in the movie is built perfectly to support this decadent love story in the life of a man who just wishes to drive.Carey Mulligan as the sole female in the movie is placed like the mediator in the Driver's life, bringing balance to his life.I especially like that in the movie every (male) character is either an anti-hero or a villain.I would like to write much more about the film but I'm tired",Drive

Loaded with masterful sequences that are not copy of anything, it develops in its own tempo, swinging with much precision from the car chases of the seventies to the triangle of love between characters who, although little developed, are interpreted with much sobriety by the actors that defend them. Very well taken the measure to the silences and not only in the dialogues. Outstanding artwork; For its palette of colors, for its lighting, for its sound and for its very remarkable soundtrack.

424,pjlb2008,Adequate,5,7 February 2012,"This movie did not match its hype. Gosling is wasted in this movie. He is a Clint Eastwood cowboy cloned into a modern setting. His character is so enigmatic, he comes off as a boring and possibly ""challenged."" Because he does not stand for anything, it is hard to care about him, making what should be a climactic ending, an emotionless exercise for the viewer. Oddly, his early speech about being loyal for exactly five minutes to the people who employ him to drive them from crime scenes is not foreshadowing of a later plot development but banal banter to build style. The violence is extreme and off-putting. It detracted from the story and caused you not to root for the ""hero."" Clint Eastwood's success in this same type of role is because he fostered respect, aiming his cruelty to those who deserved it and when it was meted out, it was not shown in explicit form. There was an extended, gratuitous scene of topless women acting like no women would act under the circumstances. Again, it was a distraction, not an attribute of the movie. I did like Bryan ""Hal from Malcolm in the Middle"" Cranson. How could you not. Finally, what was that with Albert Brooks as the godfather? Please! A watchable movie that you would not likely watch a second time.",Drive
425,CaptMTS,Drive moves slowly with lots of violence,7,6 October 2011,"Trailers made Drive out to be a car heist, action-type movie (probably to attract a wider audience), but the trailers were misleading.Drive is a slow-moving, violent drama. Ryan Gosling's character spends much of the movie listening or thinking, often while driving, which tends to really stall the movie (especially with the recurring slow-motion camera work). But, Ryan does a good job with an introverted character who tries to help out his neighbor. He makes you want to root for him.Ryan's awkward love interest is played by Carey Mulligan. She didn't do much with a rather lifeless character.After an hour to setup the conflict, the movie quickly devolves into a series of very violent encounters which are at odds with the first half of the movie. The stark contrast heightens the violent feel of the film.Overall, I enjoyed the movie, though it was not what I expected. Ryan Golsing was the highlight of the movie with some great visual camera work and a good soundtrack.",Drive

From it's very subtle action scenes to its crazy ones, there was nothing unrealistic or too over the edge with the fight scenes which made them perfect. You can see how Gosling changes throughout the film from them also. The plot was kept simple but still great and kept you on your seat.

427,nyancatcandy,A perfect Saturday night's date movie,8,26 February 2019,"Usually when a movie is being made about cars and action, especially with a title as cheesy as ""Drive"", you'd almost immediately expect it to be a Fast and the Furious esque film with a bland story, bland characters and a whole load of seemingly unending car chases and explosions. Drive is a car movie, but it is de excat opposite of what I just described, and it touched me right in the heart.Drive is a surprisingly cozy movie, with sequences with the two main characters simply going for a drive in the city. These ""montages"" might seem unnecessary at first, but the soothing neon and traffic lights, peaceful and relaxing electronic music creates a special tension between the two, as well as to the audience, like I have never felt before. It is a love story at heart, and it is these little scenes that really make me fall in love with this piece. Another thing that could have turned out terribly wrong, was the cutting of almost all of Goslings lines. But as cool and calm as ever, Gosling does notably deliver a really good performance doing nothing. Playing a mysterious character that doesn't say much could easily lead to a dull performance, but he seems to have a talent for this (as proven once more in ""Blade Runner 2049), constantly making us fall for him.Storywise, it further impresses. It might seem to lack length and depth, but it is infact a short, charming, little story. And as we get deeper into the movie, we see the full story evolving and turning into a memorable and unique story. Actingwise, it still surprises. Altough sometimes the lines are somewhat poor, the acting isn't bad, neither is it that overwhelming. It fits right in for a story like this, nothing over the top. But one of the most impressive thing about this film is its attention to different sounds, like a carefully organized orchestra, where every little instrument plays a a part. From the clenching sounds of Goslings leather gloves, to the music and the lovely sounds of the car - that aren't at all overdone, like most car movies - earning this movie a well deserved OscarThe only problem I had while watching this movie, was the partially unrealistic gore and bloodshed. That was infact overdone and didn't really fit into the rest of the movie. It made the killing feel slightly silly, taking away some of the otherwise realistic feeling about the movie.All and all, this movie is a charming little piece, that had me caught from the first second to the last. It is not a movie that thinks it is more than what it is, the character of the film is as charming as the film itself. A perfect saturday night's date movie, that will leave you feeling both shocked and satisfied. This has grown to become one of my favourites and will undoubtably become a classic in the future, even more than it already is.",Drive
428,artalmarcelo,The art of telling a story through images.,9,2 February 2012,"This is a great example of why cinema is an art, of why stories get compellingly better when they are told brilliantly in a succession of magnificent images. This is what Driver is, a string of unbelievable, unexpected and harmonic sequences, and It needs basically nothing else than that to shine. This is what movies are about: telling stories through images, and when someone does it at its best using a vast combination of resources, it's amazing how suppressed dialog can get. The saying states that one image is worth 1000 words, and Driver is a wonderful example of it. The director here doesn't play around, just like the main character. Every car sequence, every slow motion shot, every unpredicted action scene, every expression in the characters' face captured by the camera, every single part where music plays, seems to be perfectly crafted and polished. Yeah, OK, may not be an original story, and that's the only reason why this movie is not a 10. However, it's a good reminder that the key element in movies are is not to have an original story, but mostly how it is told. The art of telling stories through images clearly deserves more than the 7th place this time around.",Drive
429,timothy-pinzone,Driven in top gear (in a cinematic way),8,2 April 2015,Drive. This has gotta be one of my favourite films of all time. Not only does it contain some of the best car chase scenes in probably all film history and all mediums but it has a story that absolutely leaves you in several situations at once when you reach the 2nd act. Driver trying to become a changed person and a good man after reaching out to the neighbour a few units across soon has his life estranged and placed into a situation he never saw coming when his next door neighbour's husband returns home after time in jail. A classic art house film. An excellent portrayal from Ryan Gosling as his character changes several times in the story.A very hard film to analyse without going into pages and pages of detail but anyone that thinks this is full of generic car chases and action packed story lines will be left disappointed as it is much more then that and is the definition of character storytelling.Rating: A+ Comments: A classic that all future film lovers and wannabe directors have to watch.,Drive
430,guedesnino,"Everything in ""Drive"" is very interesting.",9,3 July 2017,"Everything in ""Drive"" is very interesting, from the disturbing gaps proposed by the script, its soundtrack full of synthesizers with descriptive messages of the characters, the neo-noir style (neon) adopted by photography and the impeccable frames that refer to the Tarantino style.""Drive"" is a script adapted by Hossein Amini, inspired by the books of the series ""Diver"" of the American writer James Sallis, having been directed in 2011 by the Danish Nicolas Winding Refn. A curiosity is that Ryan Gosling, protagonist of the film, indicated the director for the studios of FilmDistrict.In ""Driver"" Ryan Gosling lives the unnamed protagonist, who is not mentioned or named at any time in the film, this already punctuates the mysterious characteristic of the character, who has nocturnal habits and sometimes makes vigilante figure of the streets of the city of Los Angels, who he knows very well, so well, that the film starts with Ryan making clear his skill as a connoisseur of the streets and of a driver, and that he comes down to that moment, the service for which he is being hired or to come After that service does not interest you. All this initial speech of the protagonist is captured in asymmetrical cuts of a window, with a play of shadow and light characteristic of the film noir and that collaborate for the construction of a prologue that presents a situation, does not explain anything, what the public can count It is with that moment and that situation that sets and presents in a small dose, one of the faces of the protagonist.It stands out in the prologue a concise presentation of the film proposal, being very clear that it intends to be and the form that will use for that. A magnificent work of script and direction that added to the photography, editing, art and soundtrack promote an exceptional and deservedly top 10 of the best films made in 2011, yielding to Winding Refn the award for best director at the Cannes Film Festival . Still on the prologue, among other highlights, the appeal of joining the escape of the assailants against the police, where in the car Ryan hears the narration of a basketball game, which will serve as narration of the escape and helper for thieves if Disperse, in the car where the two bandits escape being led by Ryan, we have a camera that records all the moments inside the car and reveals the driver through the rear view mirror and reflection on the front panel of the car. After the successful escape, we have a stylized sign with a pink neon color that entitles the film and having as background the suggestive ""Night Call"" (Kavinsky & Lovefoxxx), notice that from the musical choice the insertion in the title, the clippings and the Neon photography, everything is very well thought out and structured, collaborating even more to prepare the terrain of ""Drive"" that does not only mean driving, that is to say also impulse, motivation, the latter being the primary characteristic of Ryan Gosling's character, he is a A hero who rides around the city in search of motivation, something that drives his life and makes him a real hero.The dialogues in ""Drive"" are constructed by an originality and punctuality very rare. So much that it is a film of few speeches and several moments of silence that say much, mainly by the game realized by the actors, where the interpretation of a subtext is much more important and evocative than any other speech. Among the performances Bryan Cranston - as Shannon - stands out. The versatility of this actor, famous for playing Walter White in the Breaking Bad series, once again shows his ability to create differentiated characters with a careful attention to the details and subtleties of a smile or the discomfort of a mancar. The rest of the cast promotes a precise job, but Ryan Gosling as a driver, leaves at various times an inaccuracy of proposals, are several plans showing the actor with a neutral physiognomy that does not express anything, nor do they evoke any dialogue or collaborate for a Narrative, its inexpressiveness turns into empty moments and that generate a certain annoyance before a break in the action that says nothing.""Drive"" is a dark film with nocturnal shots and alternates with clear internal plugs with an abuse of orange and yellow tones, its prolonged silences taken by a transmission of suggestion of the actors / personages that alternate what is said with what if That is to say, a story that presents a plot initially with a romantic bias and turns into a brutal violence, with strong scenes and its takes and plans that reminisce much the Tarantino films, mainly by the use plongée and against plongée, the use of a symbology Suggestive, such as the figure of a scorpion allied to the character of Ryan and the conversation with the child Benicio, where a villain is seen from the perspective of a children's drawing, in which to be of evil is an inherent condition of being, in short, in the Dualities that ""Drive"" is constructed we have a coherent film, that is worth very much for the omission of answers and that make of this film a real work.",Drive

432,drz,Steady decline over 100 minutes,4,6 February 2020,"The Driver starts fairly well, a mysterious hero, a promising plot, suspense, action, and an atmosphere that could make it noteworthy (maybe a bit Light Sleeper like).As the story slows, we get warning signs that this film will be bad (I do like many movies that are slow with little or even no dialogue as long as they explore something meaningful - this one one is sadly not one of those): the annoying pauses get longer, the acting is getting worse, the chemistry is getting lost and the melodrama just grows and grows and grows: silent movie stars did not exaggerate their acting to this extent. That would still make it an acceptable movie: what do you expect from Hollywood, after all.But things get worse than expected: the 5-minutes getaway warning gets repeated (word by word, though it still does not make sense), our hero gets violent (not in a believable way), the music is getting bad (do we need to learn from the lyrics that our hero is a great ""human being"" - repeatedly?) and the nonsense gets unleashed. ***SPOILERS from here - but really there is nothing to spoil***Senseless graphic violence (gangsters get serially killed by a single person armed with a hammer, a shoe or bare hands - and what about the fork in the eye, really?), long faux-artistic meaningless shots (e.g. scorpion on his back - let's not forget the insult to injury committed by the misplaced scorpoin-frog tale), idiotic lines of action from almost all characters (and the plot in general, like the mob calling Blanche seconds before shooting her?), completely random scenes that are neither believable nor seem to be part of the plot (e.g. kissing and killing scene in the elevator)... all the expectations from the beginning are lost: this is no film noir, no crime movie, not an action movie, not a thriller and not a parody of either of those. Just bad.And the climax: how come the main villain is completely unprotected during the scene at the beach? And why on earth was Gosling wearing the mask then (when no one can see him: he only covers his face from his victim whom he kills in revenge - how does that make sense?) And how did his car's headlight made the dramatic backlight after the frontal crash when it T-boned the other car off the cliff? And the final scenes with the other bad boss?

One thing that to me makes the movie stand out is the music it works completely throughout the whole of the film giving it a sort of motivational feel but keeping with the 80's theme.My last words are this is how a movie should be made so all though directors who think that they are great filmmakers really need to watch this film and learn something or just not bother being a director.",Drive

435,Gray_Balloon_Bob,An art-house and gritty genre reconciliation that takes you on a blood-splattered ride through an LA fairyland.,10,2 March 2015,"In re-watching this film for the first time in three years, I think what helped turn the key in this slick retro engine and build a momentum where I didn't feel there was one before, is my understanding of Ryan Gosling's performance. I had expected a Tarantino exercise in verbosity of pop culture shenanigans and quick wit laced with escalating levels of violence, what I instead got was some love story in an idiosyncratic world that was punctuated with endless silences where the people felt like marionettes in stasis, and all of this carried by a glum and solidarity unnamed protagonist who seemed to me like an anthropomorphic equivalent of the toothpicks he was so fond of. But of course, one does not forget Drive.Whether it's the intense, eye-lid stapling opening sequence that burns itself in your mind, in which the journey through the dark neon-tinged streets under the looming presence of the cityscape is both furiously thrilling - as we sit passenger, both accomplice and overwhelmed audience in this high-speed pursuit whilst the police scanner and sports coverage on the radio duets and becomes a countdown and a challenge - and a smooth and casual ride in the calmed presence of our Driver, Ryan Gosling, as he effortlessly navigates us through this cultural labyrinth, the retro ambiance of the soundtrack and the city which creates a timeless quality which mythologises Los Angeles as some cinematic world, or maybe just the Driver himself, Drive is the antithesis of a forgettable movie.Until re-watching this, Gosling was still completely an enigma to me. Granted I haven't seen any of his other works, and as far as I'm aware this performance doesn't exactly encapsulate the man, he does appear to have been working in a versatile selection of films for a while now, but there was always something I felt whenever I would see him in picture or in trailer, that felt a little lacking. Maybe it's those impenetrable eyes. But it must be my greater cinematic understanding since first watching this film, because I realise now that an actor can convey just as much through physicality, expression and general demeanour as they can through dialogue. And Gosling excels in this. His Driver, a Hollywood stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway one, seems to be a descendant in the long line of silent heroes, another creation of the Hollywood mythos that favours actions over words. And this is something fascinating that this film creates, as it is a clearly very cine-literate piece, far more so than me, in that it plays between the fiction of its setting and the actual real emotion of its people. The Driver is caught somewhere between some being a confused young man without precise direction and a lovelorn white-knight that continues the legacy of our filmic heroes. There are many why's that you could throw at this character and his world, but I think it's important to accept that he is a product of this place, and in falling in love with his beautiful and dainty and reticent neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) and subsequently in finding himself taking responsibility for her and her son, he is fulfilling the necessary journey as a protector, or hero, because that is all he understands. Both the most grandiose and intimate moments come from their all-to- brief time together; in one triumphant sequence that feels like we're gliding along the golden light of a dream, as the synth-y triumph of 'Real Hero' plays, The Driver takes Irene and her son out on to the LA riverbed, and they soar along existing outside of any reality but their own. The silences between these characters, like when the son stares up at the driver, in wonder and adoration, challenging him to a no-blink contest, and when he shares the company of Irene, nothing necessarily needs to be said, because in the silences that they cultivate and share they are at peace in the mystery of each other. He is a man without a past; she is a woman who seems to maintain an emotional composure despite her difficult domestic situation with a husband in jail. The husband who is released from jail and brings with him criminal residual that he cannot escape just as these characters are bonding seems like a convenient catalyst for the plot, but the film takes delight in these genre conventions and entrapping the Driver in this pre-determined cinematic journey. When Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) who seems relatively sincere about making an honest lifestyle yet is still caught up in crime, there is only one course of action we know the Driver can take. The film loves its contrasts and contradictions. The Driver never carries a gun, a principle that seems weirdly pacifist, but then we learn he favours far more personal resolutions. When Christina Hendricks fails to answer his question on whether she set him up on their heist, he slaps her, pins her to the bed, and all intimidation and all power is achieved through one pointed finger. He points it furiously at her, like a gun, and it seems to be a conduit for all his anger and heroism. When things are complicated further, later on in the film, he and Irene share a tender-most-probably-good-bye-kiss in an elevator they share with a man the Driver knows he is going to have to immediately kill, Irene still present. This valiant white knight will go to psychotic levels to protect innocence, and it's an irony that the world enforces. All this is without even mentioning the talents of Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman, their characters each a little more dubious than the next. Ultimately they each serve bloody purpose in this offbeat LA mythological genre love odyssey that within so little time has found a place as an iconic film, something it will not fail to maintain because it exists in the beating heart of cinema itself.",Drive

437,Opalville,"Timeless, Charming, Brilliant, Witty",10,29 September 2011,"This is a moralistic message movie if ever there was one. I, for one, was left mortified and unimpressed. Its flaws could be easily spotted by a cheap robotic drone flying over my native Pakistan.The picture begins with a bland interlude, a tone poem, if you will, a-la-Joel Schumacher, wherein we are plopped squarely in the middle of a second-rate heist that goes unfinished: interrupted by a nauseatingly 1980's title sequence, replete with a centered hot-pink Casmira 72 point font.Ryan Gosling uncreatively reprises his role as a Disney television matinée idol, namely ""Young Hercules,"" as he attempts to right the wrongs of the world in one or two fell swoops, using many props, including a hammer, a bullet, a slim-jim, a pair of dainty pleather driving gloves, a watch, a rubber mask, a pair of tap-dancing shoes, and a continual five-o'clock shadow.The movie evolves from a sweet and tender bildungsromance into a full-fledged remake of Mommie Dearest, wherein Gosling mercilessly torments those who dare to cross his unpredictable moral boundaries.But if his behaviour is unpredictable, the film is not. On more than one occasion, we are treated to the blaring electronica of a soundtrack of which Giorgio Moroder would surely approve, since he composed the nearly identical score for ""Midnight Express.""Suspiciously, none of the characters ever seem to use the restroom unless they are about to get shot in the head. Perhaps they were too constipated with their internal monologues and preoccupied with how their mannerisms would look in slow motion.Albert Brooks does a grave injustice to his own weak repertoire. While I would agree that ""Taxi Driver"" was tepid and effeminate, Brooks fit the bill there perfectly. But in Drive, he has re-cast himself as a leading alpha-male mobster and dying patriarch of a now-defunct cinema empire. It is most unbecoming, and his shameless audacity hurts the film tremendously. Brooks has taken the punch out of what could and should have been an Oscar winning character had the role been performed by, say, Penny Marshall or Austin Pendleton or Robin Williams.How this film ever managed to get a green light without Golan-Globus is anyone's guess. Had Miramax's precursors been around today to offer much needed guidance toward this project, it surely would have been a far better movie, instead of a simplistic infomercial for muscle cars and monster trucks.",Drive

There are long brooding scenes then moments of Sam Peckinpah style violence.The main character doesn't have much emotional range, perhaps this is done as a means to justify and explain his contemplative nature. The effect however loses something as it gives the character a somewhat flat performance. Given that The Driver character is initially set up as a clever get-away driver for hire, as the story progresses it doesn't make much sense that he would risk everything to help out some ex con who he barely knows and in whom he has no vested interest.It's not the worst movie that I've ever sat through, but is surprises me that it was rated as highly as it was.",Drive

440,teajel,an exhilarating and stylish action movie from start to finish.,9,26 September 2012,"Driver is a man who usually being hired for any kind of job that related to driving. his identities is mysterious since he is only been called driver or kid by his boss through the entire movie. In the opening scene, a discovery shot was made to show the viewer an action that focus on the driver slowly make some kind of preparation on the bed. the scene is being shot with a style of film noir, showing a mysterious man wearing a jacket. after the scene, an opening credit was played with a retro music as its soundtrack.it is clear that ""Drive"" is not the typical modern Hollywood action movie, judging from the beginning of the movie and the opening credit. some viewer will find this weird because its like watching an old episode of the 60's or early 70's TV series. I find this to be unique because there were few director that open up his action movie with film noir style and retro music nowadays. In the time where action movie is dominated by fast car or a group of flamboyant entourage, ""Drive"" come out with something different. while many filmmaker use many action clique or trying to imitate the other successful action film. director Nicholas Winding Refn didn't follow this pattern of typical action movie, instead of stealing or imitating, he try to experiment the action genre with his own movie that simply entitled ""Drive"".by using retro music as the film musical background and the camera technique of film noir he has made an exciting retro style and post noir action movie. as the result, he was awarded a prize for best director on the canes festival. it is an evidence that the critique appreciate his vision, but other critique such as veteran top film critique Leonard Maltin perceive his vision differently. he said that director Nicholas Winding Refn has chosen style over substance. some of his saying were partially true,at some degree the substance of the movie is kind of a letdown since the plot of the story was a little too linear and also the character driver seems pretty much empty in term of personality during the first part of the movie. despite his good criticism, I slightly disagree with him because I thought that sometimes a good action movie didn't need any high concept or an emotional aspect on its substance or essence. Sometime it is just need a cohesive unique style of filmmaking that was creative and original just like director Nicholas Winding Refn managed to poured his creative vision in this movie.Driver was well acted by Ryan Gosling,he is a men who just wanted to get the job done,but all of that change when he meet Irene played by Carrey Mulligan and her son Benicio. Irene was currently living on her own until his husband Standard Gabriel came back from jail. after falling in love with Irene, Driver has change the way he see his life because for the first time he felt the need to protect and care for Irene and her son. Driver,a lone wolf was finally found some meaning in her life. This kind of story has some similarity with some of the classic Clint Easwood film where in the end the lonely man find the love of his life or people that has some meaning for him. Everything seem turn out great when Irene and her son has shown affection toward driver and he also satisfied with his current life. Suddenly everything change when Irene husband standard Gabriel got back from the prison to stay with his wife Irene. not knowing the unexpected, it turns out that he had trouble with some criminal while he serve his prison time. as the result he has endangered not only his life but also Irene and his son Benicio life after the criminal threatened their life. the desperate Gabriel come to driver to ask for his help in cleaning up the trouble that he had made in his past by getting a job from a thug named Cook who somehow has a connection with Gabriel. Driver agree to help him,later in the movie he and Gabriel become trapped in a heist that resulted in the death of Gabriel. Knowing that he was being trapped, he traced the criminal job that was given by Cook and it turned out that the job was set up by a guy named Nino played by Ron Pearlman who happened to be his beloved boss Shannon current client and business partner along with Shannon long time friend Bernie played by Albert Brooks. The first part of the movie started rather slow until its brilliant climax where driver killed both men that was trying to assassinate him in the motel. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Segel managed to shoot the action scene perfectly with a moving discovery shoot and he finished up the scene with zooming the driver while he shot the shotgun toward the last thug on the front door. It was a great action scene in which the film changed its slow pace into fast pace action movie through the rest of the movie.all the acting was solid enough to entertain viewer , but the breakout role lies in Ryan Gosling where he played the stunt driver turn into some sort of anti-hero. While Carey Mulligan also bring solid performance despite her short time in the movie.as usual Ron Pearlman get the job done as a supporting actor even though his character Nino, a confident old mob that use a lot of swearing through its screen time. last but not least, comedian Albert Brooks also becoming a well-worth addition for the entire cast playing Shannon long time friend Bernie whose character was the only one that has a long conversation with many character in the movie. ""Driver"" was an exhilarating action movie that is worth a watch and an almost pitch perfect action when it comes to the style of the movie.",Drive
441,adamray101,This movie completed my summer,10,25 September 2011,"I was a little bummed over this summer's blockbusters. I must admit, I walked out of Pirates 4. But Drive, aww man. Talk about a movie...You've got Ryan Gosling, all the girls are going nuts over him, so everyone's tricked into thinking this is a quasi-spin off of some Fast and Furious film. WRONG. I have a completely different respect for him now. He's real cold in this film.If you like mobster flicks, your classic Tony Scott films, with a blend of cold-as-nails Michael Mann films (pre-Miami Vice) then this is the film for you.It's gritty, it's fast, and it's a soon to be a cult classic.The music, by the Chromatics is a personal favorite. The pacing and the brute violence really grabs the audience by the balls. It's a must for the theaters. The long takes in the film are killer. Refn did an amazing job with character development and exposition. It's torn edges in and torn edges out.I was not disappointed at all. Check it out right now.",Drive

Despite being a man of few words and few emotions we see him warm to a woman and her son that live in his building. This chip in his tough exterior could lead to his downfall.Drive is a kaleidoscope of cinematic prowess with its nail-biting plot, enticing use of colours, immersive soundtrack, a solid anti-hero who's story we follow with an immense level of smoothness and style. All of these aspects make for a trippy, trance like atmosphere that pulls you in right from the get go. It also makes the ultra violent experience very unique to itself as the violence at hand here has never appeared in such a meditative form that I've seen anyway. The effect of this film is hard to describe other than a experience you fully invest in. Ryan Gosling's anti-hero has very little dialogue yet you completely get his character intention and a journey/ arch is prominent. You also see the stakes being raised at certain intervals without a major cinematic turning point kind of moment. Everything remains in this limbo-esque atmosphere throughout and I think that is the key to the widespread appeal that Drive has, a milestone in the approach to genre. Drive definitely solidifies Nicolas Winding Refn as an artist with a movie camera as his paintbrush.",Drive
444,troubledyouth66,Umm..Watch Drive,7,6 November 2013,"This movie was interesting, having combined an action movie with a plot fairly well, however it kept the viewer drawn into the character, not because of this, but because of his innate ability to hold his feelings so well. Throughout the movie one would think what is this guy doing, just give up the money...what, you're satisfying your own ego for life or death? and why? The mysterious incognito persona of the character makes one wonder what his true intentions are...and at the end of the movie it is revealed to save a friendship. A def of a hero is one whom leaps over the bounds of confined clichae culture clicks. For anyone whom wants a quick blockbuster (which appears to be a movie set in the 80s btw), with a comical style twist and a simple narrative I rec this movie. This film fits best with Film Noir tied up with Action in a surreal setting or simply put 'new-age' noir.",Drive

Well crafted story, great writing and great direction. I rented this movie yesterday at Redbox and found it to be so well crafted that I watched it again (I don't usually do that.I grew up in Los Angeles and when I loved about this movie is that it gives you a real sense of the city and it's dirty underbelly that is usually missed in more common films.Ryan Gosling is so good in this movie because he isn't the prototypical bad ass that you usually would see in a movie like this and that is what I loved about it. Here is a character who is equally quiet but nice guy who obviously has a lot of history but nothing is mentioned or anything acknowledged up front.The tone is fantastic and I love that the director avoided the classic clichés that are so rampant in movies like this by giving us what is essentially a ""B"" movie and fills it with great actors and allows them to do what they do best. WOW!Albert Brooks is the Oscar snub of the year by far and I don't know how. Here is a guy who is always good at what he does and is a brilliant comedian but here he is a former small time movie producer who has deep roots in the criminal underworld and is so convincing that you have a hard time believing that this is the same guy from Lost in America or Nemo's dad. Nuance is the best tool in the performance and I can tell you that this is an understated performance that is so layered you just can't help but feel for the guy even though he is a brutal killer. He wants to be a nice guy but his actions and his business don't allow him to be.No movie was as cool and more riveting from start to finish than this one. It is my favorite movie of 2011, case closed.",Drive

Through different reviews there are so many different focus-points, approaches etc. And most of them fits perfectly with this masterpiece. I just cite some of them - considering every single on of them absolutely true: - This is a man with no name film. He is an old fashioned (action) hero. - intelligent adrenaline - For starters, let's talk about the pace of the film. Most may call it slow, whereas i call it hypnotic. (and from time to time it accelerates as if it had gotten a turbo boost.) - But what really sold me on this film was it's overall FEEL. etc.Reading the reviews one can understand, that whole lot of people simply did not get this film. It's not for everyone to recognize something truly remarkable at once. But 80% did. And it is really hard to understand, why Drive was candidate at only ""best supporting actor's"" category at Golden Globe. It's probably movie of the year. Actually the best movie I've seen since ""The Hurt Locker"". and some of my own thoughts: - This movie is beautiful. And it's beauty has a tremendous power in it. - Humanistic, yet stone cold character with noble ideas and methods, that put him right on the same line with his enemies. And he knows it. One may call it as an ultimate sacrifice. And the coolest thing is - he does not pity himself for that. The choice has been made. - This movie gives Clint Eastwood's ""silent hero"" character/stereotype a new, intellectual dimension.This is one of my top20 movies ever, no doubt about it.",Drive
447,bmerrett,Should be Drivel,3,16 February 2012,"I get it that Ryan Gosling is trying to shed his past acting jobs and move into meatier roles. Anything is better then the start as a member of the Mickey Mouse Club. He was outstanding in The Notebook but once again, not a film guys admit to watching, or heaven forbid, liking. So it makes sense he see him in a film like Drive where he gets to play a brooding intense character. Unfortunately what he was playing appeared to be more of a character that was not sure when to speak or what to say. The long non-dialogue scenes where a waste of time and did nothing to enhance this film other then make you wonder when it was going to end. The violence when it occurred was ala Sam Peckinpah but not anywhere as well done. This story could have moved along much faster. The title Drive mistakenly led me to believe it was about driving, or vehicles, race cars or anything like that. It was not about any of those things. It was about 1 hour and 50 minutes of drivel.

448,Aodhanrooney,A genre-defining masterwork!,10,19 March 2018,"Ryan Gosling and Director Nicholas Winding Refn are in for a career best piece of masterwork in ""Drive!"" It is an absolute genre-defining masterpiece, offering limitless set pieces, character development and gritty action. Also, a classy soundtrack and heartfelt presence. Without giving too much away, Ryan Gosling is a Hollywood stunt performer credited as 'Driver.' He is a jaw-dropping presence in the movie, as the main storyline goes into play. With a great performance from supporting leads: Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Oscar Isaac and Albert Brooks, the main plot includes a failed heist and subsequent actions leading to gritty circumstances. Ryan Gosling's mysterious 'Driver' steals the show with his unique portrayal and set of skills.The relationship between Gosling and Mulligan is so melodramatic, especially with his connection to her young son. Though Gosling's gritty approach of his role suggests 'Driver' has a dark and sufferable past, it is seemingly not enough to secure a relationship between the pair - especially when Gosling has one last up front score to settle with villainous mobster Albert Brooks. Nicholas Winding Refn offers a lot of magnificent attributes to being an achievable filmmaker here. He accomplishes this by delivering a unique, questionable, intense and gritty action thriller that will leave audiences on the edge of their seat.",Drive
449,droberthayward,Junk,2,23 February 2019,One of the most boring movies ever. Ryan Gosling is just plain awful and Ron Perelman is completely unbelievable in his role.,Drive
450,austincoleman-66971,A masterpiece of perpetual tension,10,18 April 2019,"Drive is directed by Nicholas Winding Refn and stars Ryan Gosling as a mechanic and part time Hollywood stuntdriver who moonlights as a getaway driver for various heists. The driver has his own specific set of rules and is able to maintain a life independent from the crime world, until a heist goes terribly wrong and he is forced to deal with the fallout.Much has been said about Drive's marketing, which is perhaps the only goof related to this production. On the surface, it seems like this is going to be another Fast and Furious type action thriller. Many reviews have been negative likely because of these high expectations. The fault here lies mainly on the advertising but also on those who enter with tunnel vision.We didn't get another Fast and Furious. Instead, we got a deeply layered work of art that by all standards should be considered one of the best films of the last decade. Instead of loud explosions and epic CGI chase scenes, we get a deeply intimate look into the story of a man trying to find which side of the fence he belongs on. Drive is a pure cinematic masterpiece.Ryan Gosling gives the performance of a lifetime here. I mean I'm not sure I can find the right words to do it justice. The fact that he is a man of (very) few words will frustrate some, but it becomes clear that this characteristic is central to who he has become through his experiences. Additionally, a lack of words does not necessarily mean lack of characterization. The way that Gosling is able to communicate his thoughts and feelings in a given situation solely through facial expression is sensational.While there are no explicit flashbacks to show for it, it is implied that the character of ""Driver"" (we never get his name) has been through some traumatic and life changing experiences. Whatever has happened to him has led him to his dark, seemingly emotionless persona that fits in with the criminal underworld he operates in. This all begins to change when he meets his neighbor Irene and her young son Benicio. The three develop an immediate connection and for a short time and we can see how Driver's persona and outlook on life begins to soften a bit. Unfortunately, it is short lived when the news hits that Irene's husband Standard is returning home from prison. Upon Driver's introduction to Standard, a series of events happens that lands him in hot water and ultimately he begins his descent back into darkness.Driver is desperate to live a normal life again, and the situation he finds himself in makes it impossible for that to happen. However, by the end he is able to find his own kind of redemption by killing those who are after him and leaving the money he stole behind. He becomes the kind of hero he wants to be and is able to get another chance to start over. Needless to say, I haven't done the characterization of Driver any justice by this description, but it truly is brilliant. It is something you have to see for yourself.From a pure directional standpoint, this is one of the most well-crafted films I have ever seen. Nicholas Winding Refn's work here is truly phenomenal. Not a single minute detail in the movie is left to chance. From the euphoric soundtrack (seriously one of the best I think I've ever heard for a film), to specific character decisions, all the way down to the types of clothing the characters wear and how they wear it. Everything serves a purpose. It blows my mind how much attention is given to small details. There is nothing that slips through the cracks of Refn's control. Where this shines most is in the ability to maintain a haunting tension nearly the entire time. The cinematography is also great and helps bolster the tension as well. There are some painful, yet gorgeous shots throughout.For the die hard fans of Fast and Furious and all of its thrilling cousins, there probably won't be much to love here. I urge viewers to come with an open mind and try to view the film in a different light. It won't have you on the edge of your seat or perhaps even entertained the entire time, but with the appreciation it deserves, it will have you captivated. Drive is a masterpiece in characterization, storytelling, and perpetuating tension. It is the kind of film that belongs in classrooms where the art of direction is taught, because on that end, it rarely gets better than this.10/10",Drive
451,urbanlegend23,"A very cool movie, bound to start a deserved cult following, and featuring a brilliant leading performance from Gosling.",10,27 August 2011,"Ryan Gosling is fast becoming one of the most exciting actors working today. It's nice to see him overcome the 'heartthrob' status achieved thanks to his role in the overrated ""The Notebook"" and work on genuinely interesting, and challenging projects like his latest, ""Drive"".The film thrives on his excellent performance. Whether getaway driving or charming Carey Mulligan, he's nothing short of riveting to watch. As an action hero, this guy makes Liam Neeson in ""Taken"" look like a whimpering pussy in comparison. Simply put - he's awesome, and utterly sells this character. I look forward to another quality performance from Gosling in the upcoming ""Ides of March"".I was lucky enough to see this film at its (apparently) second screening in the world, at the Wellington International Film Festival in New Zealand. It was obviously massively popular during this screening, rousing an opening introduction speech (it was the festival's closing night film) and an enthusiastic clap from the audience at the climax. It's not hard to see why audiences embraced ""Drive"". It's both an unpredictable and exciting outing for action fans, but all the same well-observed and gritty, which will no doubt appeal to indie viewers.The film's stunning cinematography envelopes the audience in the proceedings. The adrenaline-fueled car chases are furiously shot and nothing short of thrilling. Director Refn's camera also beautifully captures the Los Angeles skyline and the sprawling lights of the city. It's some of the best photography there's been of this city that I've seen in a film.There are a couple of really well-filmed ""shock"" moments worth mentioning. One is in a car parking building and one a hotel bathroom, both featuring gunshots. Both are jump-of-your-seat scenes at their very best. Refn constantly keeps the audience on their toes, and there's no way to predict what will happen next. That's one of the most refreshing things about ""Drive"".Carey Mulligan could've been utilized a little more, especially in the film's final third, where she sort of just disappears. It's disappointing because she really gives the movie a heart in her handful of scenes with Gosling. I was glad she wasn't reduced to a typical ""damsel in distress"" role (the film actively avoided action movie clichés, much to my delight), but she could've been included somehow.Overall, it's small complaint in a very ""cool"" movie that a lot of people are going to love. Is the movie likely to be a little overrated and over analysed? Probably a little. Is it going to start a cult following and does it deserve said following? Most definitely. It's a refreshingly unpredictable and well-made roller-coaster ride featuring another excellent performance from one of Hollywood's hottest talents in Gosling, who is proving himself to be one of the most reliable leading men in modern cinema.",Drive

Some nice lighting and shots but film was mostly hype.It baffles me to why people like Ryan Gosling as a actor, maybe he's easy to work with or is cheap.

There are a couple of things, that I'd like to emphasize and that perhaps stand out in comparison with other films.First would be the music, which is slow and beautiful. Like the characters, action and other parts content-wise, it suits excellently with the theme – driving.The beginning provides the undertone. Despite the later tranquil parts, one can sense the ominous nature of the cadres. The film is divided into two different chapters: one is homely and slow and peaceful, that all of us know, and the other is full of violence. But the movie doesn't overdo it with the latter. The racing bits are relatively short bursts that end quickly. They are nonetheless sharp and help create the overall atmosphere.",Drive

But when one robbery doesn't go as planned, he's left standing alone as he fights back for his life and that of the people he loves most.I have to admit that for the most part I kept holding my breath for Gosling to speak throughout the whole movie, but every time he opens his mouth he manages to barely stutter out a few words here and there. His character was the least likable lead role we've seen for a while. For the most part, he strikes the viewer as a weird lunatic most likely as a result of a rough childhood as an orphan.The movie fails to make us relate to any of the characters in anyway; the plot's a cliché and there is hardly any dialogue in the movie for us to even consider evaluating the non existing script. Carey is as cute as ever here, but every time she comes up on screen she gives us hope that maybe the movie will take an unexpected turn for the better; but whatever hope we have is taken away just as quickly. Throughout this film I couldn't help but ponder on what in the world carey saw in this socially awkward weirdo.All in all, ryan gosling does a good job of acting out this awkward introvert of a character; but even him and his good charms can't save this movie from it's inevitable demise.This movie sucked in all levels and how it got such a high rating on IMDb is beyond me. Please don't let me stop you from hitting your local theatre to catch this so-called ""masterpiece""; but when you come out of it thinking what a waste it was, don't say I didn't warn you.

It combines some of the greatest car chases, gut wrenching scenes of violence and brutality, humor, and loads of cash in a heist gone bad. Oh yeah, and brilliant acting by Ryan Gosling and his beautiful neighbor Irene played by Carey Mulligan.This movie starts out with Ryan Gosling making a living as an auto mechanic, Hollywood stunt driver, and you guessed it one bad ass getaway driver. Ryan Gosling portrays swagger while remaining grounded with his nonchalant edginess. Things go sour when his Irene's boyfriend comes home from prison. That's when things hits the fan. Gosling is required to try and save Irene and her boyfriends family, their son that's 8 years old.Forced into a heist to try and save Irene's family. Which goes very very wrong.This is when the calm cool collective Gosling turns into a pseudo psychotic maniac driver from hell, yet still remaining his poise. But develops such a gruesome edge.After this things become very intense, and some of the most brutal scenes of violence ever recorded will be imprinted into your brain. Imagine a fork to the eye, and then 3 stabs of a butcher knife to your neck, blood squirting profusely from your arteries.This movie has everything, I could sit here and type out everything and why it's such a damn amazing movie.

457,spikey_jap,An Absolute Great Art House Film,9,7 June 2012,"There have been many outcries and many complaints about this film not being nominated for any big film awards, such as the Academy. After watching this film, I have to say that I agree because this film was simply absolutely amazing! Before I get started, this film is an art film, so not many people will be amazed as I was with this great film. Everything was well shot, well edited, and well directed. First off, the opening sequence will simply blow you away. Once you see The Driver (portrayed by Ryan Gosling), set out the rules and does what he does, you will find it hard to not even feel a sense of excitement while watching the opening. It really brought the excitement, the thrill, and will definitely get you pumped to see what will happen next. After the opening, the film does slow down the pace; however, this does not cause the film to suck. By watching the opening, you just can't wait to see more of these intense moments; however, the film doesn't exactly take that route. Rather than following a typical action film route, the film focused more onto the characters and environment. So, instead of an action film, you have a story that does have some intensely brutal action sequences and having the characters involve themselves with some gangsters, but the main focus is with The Driver and Irene (portrayed by Carrey Mulligan). Based on how well detailed and well focused director Nicolas Winding Refn, focused onto these characters, you will buy everything that you will see. He added depth, characteristics, emotion, and heart toward these characters to a point where you will buy the chemistry between the two characters and will care/like for the characters. I won't go to the point to say that the story is great, but the chemistry between the characters and having The Driver being involved with the main antagonist with the film is what keeps the story alive.There are several flaws that some people may point out and view it as a weak point. One is the pacing, as it drops to a point where some people will loose that excitement that was brought during the opening sequence. Another, which I can see many people complain about is the film to be called an ""action art film,"" but to barely have any sort of action. If I remember correctly, there is a total of 2 car chases and several violent moments. However, the total amount of time of the action was at least 20-30 minutes max. I do agree with the lack of action; however, this really didn't bother me as much as some people have put it. As soon as the car chase starts, you'll feel that adrenaline rush and will enjoy the car chase scene. Once you see The Driver snap and go after the bad guys, the director brought the intensity and will make you fear the protagonist. It will definitely be hard for you to not to be amazed or to have your jaw dropped during these moments.Without good acting, you can't have good characters and this film had a extremely great cast. Carrey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Ron Pearlman, etc. were definitely great as the characters and how their characters were portrayed really made these characters stand strong. Albert Brooks, portrays the main antagonist of the film and I can say that he played a very good villain. He wasn't the typical gangster that just wanted to rule the turf or to take control; he had this Michael Corleone vibe, coming in as your friend, but not knowing when he will strike his blade against you. Now, onto the man who was great, Ryan Gosling. He barely talks in the film, but what makes him great is that you can understand the character and his emotion without him speaking it out. Just by looking at the face, you know that The Driver is either sad, happy, or is angry. His character is great as he is calm, but yet menacing; once he snaps, you will be happy that you are not the villain that is getting the beat down.The story is not what keeps the film into drive mode, it's the characters, the great directing, incredible acting, and the focus of detail that makes this film a great film. Not many will like the film, especially with the pacing that drastically drops after the opening and with the lack of action. However, for people that enjoy art house films, this is definitely worth the watch.",Drive

The uber-violent yet yearning-to-be-innocent lead, a blend of Lynch's Sailor, Scott's Clarence and Besson's Leon, while Irene plays the iconic purely innocent compensatory female support which was manifest, in some form or fashion, in each of these films. The result? Something which, like Shelley's tragic/ironic monster, wants to live and love in a meaningful way, but instead simply lurches about mindlessly without pulling either off very well at all. Toward the end, had to fight the strong impulse to simply put the poor idiot out of its misery...i.e turn off the t.v. before the credits rolled.",Drive
460,keshavptl,Overrated Mediocre Film,6,13 December 2020,The movie has nice cinematography and decent a ctors. I am a kind of the viewer who appreciates slow movies if they have twist or something which makes you feel it. This movie was not only slow but it lacked a good storyline too. The storyline is extremely mediocre & predictable. I felt deceived. How can people rate it so much? There are plethora of movies way better than this. I think cast was the reason why the movie worked otherwise I do not see anything great in it.,Drive
461,Klaus Silberbauer,Classic Winding Refn,9,10 November 2011,"Once again Winding Refn gives us an aesthetically pleasing movie with little depth to it. Only the great acting brings a little depth to the shallow characters. The violence is almost cartoon-ish and the plot is not the strongest. 99 % of the time, Drive holds up, but a few times, the style slips, the references don't work or the storyline over-steers a bit.However, contrary to most of Winding Refn's Danish movies after Pusher, Drive works. Refn's style just fits LA better than Copenhagen, I guess. This is retro in a cool way - like an action movie from the eighties (pink Miami Vice-like titles and all) retrofitted with the cynical world view of a post-911 century. Like Miami Vice meets Reservoir Dogs meets Heat with a twist of Vanishing Point... - only a bit more rough to the edges. The excellent sound track and the movie's beautiful imagery is absolutely worth your time.",Drive

First, Ryan Gosling. I liked his performance very much, is calmed but when the moment is tense, he becomes in a very violent and brutal dude.
Second, the cinematography. It is amazing how the colors are an important fact in the story.
Third, the mood. I felt this movie like a kind of modern Taxi Driver, I mean, the lonely protagonist, the dirty mood of the City, that pretty blonde girl that the protagonist likes and that bloody final.And Fourth, the final. Oh God, I cried so much in that final scene. He lost everything, he has a deathly injury in his stomach and the girl that he liked is very far of him. I interpretate that he died at the end, but it just break my heart when you can see him tearing down.10/10",Drive
463,Samirsbureau,When you perfectly mix Art with Action,8,17 March 2017,"Nicholas Winding Refn is knowing for his hidden messages and his artistic style/vision in movies. And certainly it's well known that his movies aren't for everyone, but let me tell you ""Drive"" is one of those that people experience in totally different ways. So i'm just going to write my own opinion and my thoughts about the movie.Let's say the movie is split into 2 equal acts:The first one is the buildup, we're introduced to the main characters of the film including Ryan Gosling (A skilled stuntman who falls for his neighbor) and Carey Mulligan (A mother whose husband is imprisoned and she lives with her only son). Nothing big happens in that act except building up the characters and the events that will lead to the second act.The second act is one of the most brutal, violent, gory and suspenseful you can see in any action film. It's filled with jaw- dropping shocking scenes, and it carries on that way till the last second of the film.The ending of the film is open to the viewers interpretation, but that's the way Refn decides to make all of his movies.Everything else in this film is great, from Phenomenal acting to beautiful scenery, also the soundtrack of this film is to be remembered.The movie definitely left me thinking about it when it ended but that's just my opinion, so check it out and see for yourself, I'd definitely recommend it.",Drive

I suppose the answer is when it's directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, scored by the best synth soundtrack of the century and starring Ryan Gosling in a career-defining role.PS the sequence in the elevator is up there with The Master's ""processing"" scene as one of the best in motion picture history.

466,crberme,Just brilliant,9,15 October 2017,"I gotta be honest here: when I started watching Drive I was expecting to see an action movie with fast racing scenes and some crime going on. What I got was something really different (and better).Drive is about guy that's a mechanic, a stunt man (though this doesn't have a big relevance in the plot) and a getaway driver. Basically he starts getting to know his neighbor when work and love mix up. You can guess the outcome.The driver has a charismatic personality. He's neutral, quiet, calm, almost like a robot, but not in a unrealistic way. The way this character is done and how Ryan Gosling brings him to life is the key of why this movie is so good... but it's not the only reason.The camera work is also really good. This movie is full of slow, broad and breathtaking scenery, sometimes accompanied by an awesome retro soundtrack that sticks to you even though that genre is not your thing. It's really unique.So yeah, I could keep saying good things about this movie, but it would be better if you just go watch it. I'm sure you'll like it.",Drive

The first half of the movie has some really slow scenes that kept me wondering when the movie was going to pick up steam. I thought some of the violence was needlessly graphic.The R rating is quite appropriate to due very graphic violence, some coarse language and some nudity, though very little sexual content.Overall, it was an OK movie for a $4 matinée on a cold cloudy Friday afternoon, but I would not recommend spending nighttime movie prices for this show.",Drive
470,torchwood949-166-552404,Miles Ahead Of Anything This Year,10,2 October 2011,"The man with no name is a term used mainly as protagonists in westerns, most notably being Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone's 'Dollar Trilogy'. We are introduced to The Driver who holds no name and no emotionally attachments, he is there to drive and driving he is. By day his job entails as a Hollywood movie stunt driver and by night switches to that of a getaway driver. He shows no contrast been the two, he drives. Nothing more and nothing less.'Nicolas Winding Refn' recently directed 'Valhalla Rising' and this film feels like a modern companion piece. It features little dialog and focuses on character emotions physically to express their feelings. He has a fantastic sense of directing characters into showing emotion through their body movements. 'Ryan Gosling' sits in behind the wheel as the Driver who is represented as the modernized man with no name. Little is spoken of Gosling as he calmly soaks up the screen with little emotion. A toothpick lies between his lips in which if set within a western setting could be replaced by straw. You imagine he was just placed here with no background, no childhood and no family but merely to drive. A connection is developed early on with his next-door neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son, Benicio (Kaden Leos) in which without expressing himself with words we see through long stares, subtle smiles and the occasional touch he has grown close too. But as a sour heist threatens him and more importantly Irene and Benicio his character opens up and shows through extreme acts of violence and his skills as a driver he will endanger his own life to save theirs.We are never given any background detail on Gosling but we see through long focused shots on his calm exterior that a dark past lies behind those pale eyes. 'Newton Thomas Sigel' did a fantastic job with his cinematography his beautifully crafted shots depict of very little happening physically but on an emotional level the characters are shown to be considerably deep and complex. Goslings character reminded me of 'Josh Brolins' portrayal of Llewelyn Moss in 'No Country For Old Men' in which he says very little but he has one clear goal and we are shown it and taken on the path that he follows. However the Driver manages to make us feel sympathetic towards him mainly through the way director has crafted his film. The camera is very rarely detached from Gosling and in that sense, neither are you, his decisions are very clear and because of the amount of screen time we are given of our Driver the way his expression changes, no matter how subtle is clear for us to represent so we can be attached and relate to his motives.At it's heart 'Drive' is an art house picture, it looks and sounds beautiful, a thumping 80's soundtrack plays through the background with it's electronic beats and vibes representing much to the state of a mechanical nature of a vehicle. A particular scene is when Gosling expresses his emotions through driving as he takes Irene and Benicio on an off road experience as the uplifting, 80's tune 'A Real Hero' by 'College' serenades within the background. Though the way the film is shown it's art house style lies within some director choices, imagery which could very well become iconic is shown and each shot is blessed with given care and subtle details like mirrors placed strategically in the background to show other characters out of shots. During driving sequences we are made to feel as a passenger of the car and part of the experience as POV perspectives are shown twisting around the interior and out of windows while various car components are glazed over. It's given a slick, sexy feel and inanimate objects are made to be humanized.'Drive' portrays the dark side in characters and what they will do to protect what they care for and want but even throughout this, Gosling's character remains relatively calm even through intense moments. At times the film hits exploitation film levels as scenes of extreme violence are shown and the film builds up to these moments to deliver them in the shocking and painful vision that they are intended to be. It's much similar to how 'David Cronenberg' uses violence within his films, giving a realistic and emotional depth. 'The Fly' for example used gore to create strong sympathetic values towards 'Jeff Goldblums' character where as Drive uses it to show characters anger and pent up emotions that are built up to brink through slow, moody scenes until it can't be caged anymore.This is not an action flick. There are no CGI set pieces, there is no mindless violence, it's quiet and moody but at the same time it's not an easy watch. Sigel has a created a dark, complex film showing basic human emotions through deep body language and motives. Gosling's uses every part of himself and the vehicles in which he inhabits to cause you to feel sympathetic and engaged towards his character. It's a film that takes multiple viewings and each viewer will have their own interpretation as to what has been perceived. 'Drive' is an example of powerful directing, brilliant acting and most importantly an engaging story line bringing an experience that is miles ahead of anything else this year.",Drive
471,HerrDoktorMabuse,Have Seen Better,5,18 March 2012,"I don't why I'm adding the 848th review to this thread, but here goes. Count me in the this-movie-is-overrated camp.I absolutely hated the international market minimal dialog approach to screen writing. Not only subliterate, but it gives Ryan Gosling an opportunity to do a bad imitation of Keanu Reeves. I'd never really seen Gosling before, but have no reason to seek him out in other pictures. I also couldn't get over the idea of Carey Mulligan as a struggling waitress with $500 haircuts.I Netflixed this on the basis of rumors of Albert Brooks' performance. I found it competent, but oddly bland. Dare I suggest that Barry from ""Storage Wars"" would have put more edgy psychotic humor into the character while retaining the West LA marginal showbiz player gone wrong persona? The pacing was odd. It took forever to get the movie started, but did pick up after 30 minutes.Plot clangers. There is no way to get a car onto the LA river for a casual drive. The Chevy Impala is not best selling car in Southern California. Every one I've seen has a rental car barcode in the back window. The Toyota Camry has this distinction as sales leader, but you'd get tripped up on installing sufficient horsepower into this muffinmobile. And who in the movies is dumb enough to steal a million dollars from the Philadelphia mob? Could be trouble! Finally, what's with the Star of David garage door in Shannon's shop when Brooks slices his veins open? That and Brooks reassuring him of the lack of pain and finality of this killing method suggests Kosher butchering technique. I haven't read all 847 previous reviews, so I'm probably not the first person to detect antisemitism here.

472,puzgolac,"Slow, boring and pretentious",3,7 January 2019,"Very mild spoilers here, so it is OK to read if you haven't seen the movie, and want to be spared from that experience.After the high rating and rave reviews here, this movie was a huge disappointment.The pace is excruciatingly slow: for an hour pretty much nothing happens. We are mostly treated to empty stares, scenes that (I guess) were supposed to help character development, but really lead nowhere, and long, meaningless pauses during the few dialogues.
After an hour the pace picks up a bit, but without much more meaning to it.The main characters are one-dimensional and lack development. Gosling's character seems to be a sadistic psychopath, who was also scratched by autism just enough to take away all of his social skills. He spends the first hour doing nothing but looking mopey or just plain stupid, then, out of nothing, he starts to show bursts of anger and violence. That scene in the diner with a guy from a previous heist - what was that supposed to be? I guess it was meant to be a sort of transition, to show us what a badass he really is, but it was really lame and done badly.The plot is mostly nonexistent, and when it is there, it is completely ridiculous. Protagonist's actions and motivation make no sense. It seems that, apart form being a psychopath and autistic, he is also stupid, but, hey, at least he is good at brutally hurting people.Some people praised the music, but I found it unnecessarily loud, and mostly annoying, and the lyrics were so in your face, that I can only view them as parody (""A real human being and a real hero."" Really?)The graphic violence also seemed out of place and put in only for shock value.To sum it up, this movie had no plot, no character development, no sense, so it tried to be artsy, but only managed to be pretentious.",Drive

I was caught off-guard and was completely mesmerized by the pace, the suspense, and the European-style direction. The minimalist dialogue and the ""jump-out-of-your-seat"" violence knocked my socks off. Ryan Gosling plays the lead as a conflicted, tortured, possibly Aspergian protagonist who falls for his neighbor, but resorts to extreme violence when he feels threatened. The only caveat is that Carey Mulligan is under-used. She is a terrific actress and her few scenes are powerful and wrenching, Albert Brooks is a revelation. Remember him in Broadcast News? Lost In America? Mother? This is a whole different actor. He's menacing and terrifying and may be getting an Oscar for this.",Drive
475,crazy-ben66,Solid proof that driving doesn't have to be exploited to be enjoyed,10,24 September 2011,"Within modern cinema, cars have become pornography to the eyes. Warn-out franchises such as 'Fast & Furious' and 'Transformers' milk the parts for the visual candy their viewers need, tossing aside 90% of their cinematic functions to simply excite and explode. Not since the 80's has driving been taken as seriously as it is in 'Drive', a decade well remembered by the film's director which has a clear and distinct stamp on the final motion of the piece.The opening alone is art of the highest calibre. Ryan Gosling's silent Driver simply does exactly that, he drives; but it's the way he drives that so captivates and ultimately enthralls our eyes into a frenzy of sheer wonder. Gosling is so fluent in his execution, so unfazed by any aspect of his role that he's instantly believable and so, we cling to his now legendary white jacket. We cling and we never let go; we never want to let go. Director Nicolas Winding Refn not only creates this longing, but amplifies it and uses it to great effect, forever tugging on our loyalty to Gosling's Driver, forever reminding us of how unimaginably cool and composed he is, and in doing so creates one of the greatest and most memorable characters of all time.Despite being possibly generic in some views, the plot allows room for Refn to truly showcase his uncanny ability to amaze. The story ticks by casually, merely a vehicle to expand The Driver, to test him, to watch him, but always offers plenty of meat for both the cast, the crew and the viewer to chew on. Shocking acts of brutal violence are also sewn into the lining of the tale, but only surface when necessary and only extend to realistic effect, never once do we see Refn get carried away, he's calm and composed just like his star. It is this composure which helps to highlight his true talent as a director. The movie could have been taken in a number of different directions, mostly ending up horrifically uniform and too Hollywood to fully swallow. Instead Refn veers off down a radically different turning adopting heavily tinted night-shots, pumping 80's electronica and hot-pink titling. It is here where 'Drive' finds its true originality, its place amongst the other car-related features; it's an art-house character- driven crime thriller, and never tries to be anything more, or anything less.Although Gosling steals the show, strong and memorable support is handed by the sweetly innocent Carey Mulligan who, despite her lack of input, matches her co-star's innate ability to capture the viewer's attention with a simple eye flicker or facial movement. Long, lingering shots of the two simply gazing into each other's eyes, devoid of dialogue or movement, stand out as a mark of their excellency; never once are we bored, our eyes forever transfixed on every muscle, waiting and demanding movement and so so grateful when it finally comes. Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman all make able and gracious performances, not a foot out of place but far from the same league as the lead.The most fragrant feature of Refn's 'Drive' is however, the very existence of The Driver. Even if he's just simply sitting and staring vacantly out of a muddied windshield, he is demanding your vision and your thoughts; and he always gets what he wants. It is only within the several moments of sheer terror brought upon by the fantastically sickening sound work that we get a real glimpse at the fearless fiend that lies beneath Gosling's pretty-boy exterior. These moments are the ones that truly allow the multi-layered Driver to show most of himself, to show his hidden vulnerability as the beast takes over. Although revolting to some, the violent and frenzied action sequences are hereby necessary and present an unmistakable path to truly absorbing The Driver as a character.Ultimately, 'Drive' is possibly the most originally approached and awe-inspiring collection of celluloid to reach screens this year, and due to one of the most finely tuned and thoughtful performances ever captured (by Ryan Gosling, of course), it will no doubt sit unbelievably high on the list of films considered to be the greatest of all time. Nicolas Winding Refn has created something truly beautiful, packed with nerve-wrecking tension, shocking brutality and simple artistic passion; 'Drive' is in many ways a masterpiece, and solid proof that driving doesn't have to be exploited to be enjoyed",Drive
476,davebest2001,Predictable and overrated,5,20 December 2011,"I had high hopes for ""Drive"". It had a similar feel to ""Collateral"". The cinematography was good. The graphics indulgent - not dissimilar to the Grand Theft Auto Vice City game ! When I saw the list of actors involved, in the opening credits, I was happy. However, most of their talents were wasted. Albert Brooks gives a serviceable enough portrayal as a gangster boss. Ron Perlman plays the usual bad guy. Carey Mulligan's character is very one dimensional, as is Ryan Gosling. I think his character was similar to a modern Steve McQueen in ""Bullitt"" or a Clint Eastwood 'Man With No Name' aura. Lots of menacing stares and very little dialogue. If you are watching this film, there's a tendency to want to give in after half an hour. Everything plods along. You're waiting for something to happen. When the robbery takes place, and the violent aftermath, it's rather disappointing. I am all for ultra violence in films, if the plot is clever.

477,vladtopliceanu,Not the movie I expected,8,16 January 2012,"This is another movie I heard so many great things about and I was expecting something incredible. And because I had such high hopes for this film is the reason I gave it a lower rating than I would have probably given it. Is it a good film? You bet it is. Did I like it? Sure. Did I REALLY like it? Nope. But let me talk about the film a bit.High praise from me goes to Nicolas Winding Refn, the director of this film. He did a great, great job and he is the main reason why this movie was good. I congratulate him. Also, I liked the plot of the film. It's clear that Hossein Amini, who wrote the script, did not write it as the movie was moving forward. He came with a well written screenplay from the beginning and he knew what he wanted from the film, and I believe that in a certain degree, he got it. Undoubtedly the best performance in this film is that of Albert Brooks as Bernie Rose. He is the second reason, after Refn's directing, I gave it a positive rating.Another thing I liked about the plot was the Driver's anonymity. I personally found it cool how this character is being offered to us, with no information about his past. We needed to figure out the type of person he is just based on his actions. And after the first half of the film, you finally think you got to know him. But after that, he does something completely surprising and you begin to wonder again about who this guy really is.Now let me talk about what I thought were the weak points of this film. For me, one of them was Ryan Gosling in the first 3 quarters of the film. I know he got high praise for his performance in this movie, but I didn't like him. I don't think he was completely bad because, as I mentioned, I liked him in the final act of the film. And I hoped the movie would bounce up with a performance from Carey Mulligan, but it didn't. Carey Mulligan's performance just added another misinterpreted role in the film.Bottom line, will it get nominated for any Oscars? Well, it will probably get nominated for Best Director for Nicolas Winding Refn. Also it surely will get nominated for Best Supporting Actor for Albert Brooks. It might even get nominated for Best Picture considering there will be a maximum of 10 nominees. Other than that? I would be out of my place to say. Will it be in my top 10 best films of 2011? Most likely, it won't, because there are so many other great films out there. But who knows? I had great expectations for this film too and I gave it an 8.",Drive
478,GWilliamLocke,An Incredible Exercise in Style and Nuanced Storytelling,10,17 September 2011,"Going into the theater I knew I was in for a treat. The little bits and pieces I'd seen of the film were clearly from the brush of a highly stylized, truly eccentric filmmaker with much to offer. And it looked beautiful - the lighting, the LA scenery, the poetic stillness. Needless to say, me and my crew walked into the theater for the first screening of the day, ready for something big, fingers crossed and hopes high. One hundred minutes later we celebrated the Christmas feast we'd just taken in, Refn and Gosling's brilliance clogging the holes of our soul. We'd seen a masterpiece - a film that certainly nods here and there (John Hughes, Heat, A History of Violence), but was also wholly original and stuffed full of style and understated grace. A story told in an inventive manner, not unlike Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs over 10 years ago.Rather than discuss the many turns and layers of Refn's crime drama, I'd like to talk about the style of the film and, eventually, the crafty storytelling textures that most likely won't pick up on. First, the brilliant style of the film As the film's action segments play out, we see the Driver turn from a handsome shadow into a blood-soaked scorpion, striking quickly and confidently at all the right moments, taking down the danger in his way without losing his breath. He moves from person to person, conflict to conflict, each scene lit, framed and composed in a beautiful, poetic manner. The technique in this film is the stuff of legends, Refn and his crew's work standing high above that of the average modern film. If nothing else, the movie is a clinic in lighting, editing and sound design (much of the Driver's emotion is told through the cracking sound of his leather gloves - no joke). We see blood and love and cars. Villains and heroes and victims - and it's all beautifully composed. Mostly, we see Gosling's Driver, an unmarked loner who reminds a bit of the George Clooney character in last year's great The American. We see him fall in love and take care of business.But here's where things get interesting: after the film a friend suggested a new layer. As the story plays we're led to believe that, on the surface at least, the Driver is a normal guy put into extraordinary situations - a naturally cool, calm, collected guy seemingly capable of anything, so as long as it keeps his new love (Irene) out of harm's way. That he handles these intense situations with such grace, precision and confidence seems, again, on the surface, like a dose of Hollywood fantasy. Led by a series of clues throughout the film, my movie- going pals and I figured some things out. If you've seen the film, you'll remember the following bits of information: The Driver just showed up one day, got a job with a semi- connected garage owner, and began working for peanuts; the three additional male principals (Nino, Bernie and Shannon) all share an organized crime-infused history that we're told links back to a Jersey crime family; the Driver leaves the catalyst for the tension in the film (a bag full of unmarked bills) behind with the final bloody body that stood in the way of Irene and Benicio's safety. Those details in mind, we decided that the Driver was planted in L.A. to observe Shannon and his criminal friends - whom we learn feel unappreciated by their Jersey- based bosses. Sure, the Driver was there to put in work, too, but he was more or less a skilled spy, sent by the Jersey family. When the things get messy he acts - not as a quiet man who can drive cars, but as an instinctive and trained driver with a presumed history in the muscle game. One of the shadow men who keep things moving - a deeper variation of the Jackyl character in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.The final scene, featuring a silent performance by Gosling, is the cherry on top. We see the just-stabbed Driver in his car, still, not moving, covered in the blood of himself and the three men who stood in his way. We sit starring at the still screen for a 30-second stretch that feels like an eternity, wondering if our hero is dead. Then, suddenly, the Driver blinks. Then starts his car. Then drives away. Probably towards Jersey. Irene and Benicio are safe; and thus the job is done. We're left sad that the believable love-at-first-sight between Irene and the Driver didn't come to fruition, but moved by the lengths our man went to in order to assure the safety of the films only two pure and innocent characters. The quick blast of love he found flipped a switch that, as movie-goers, we hope helps our man move up, on his way towards a more emotional, connected, human existence.More at ZeCatalist.com.",Drive
479,gid_rulz,best film of the year....so far,10,27 October 2011,"After reading reviews (both the best and worse) i had to see this film. This film had a great retro vibe to it from the word go. Ryan gosling is absolutely superb, I enjoyed his performance in the notebook (I'm proud to say that) but this put him on a new level. The supporting cast was also great, especially Ron Pearlman. Not only was this film visually stunning, but it also had an incredible soundtrack to go along with it.After reading what people were complaining about it was all so stupid. Either people were complaining that they thought it was an attempt of a remake of some old driving film. NO clearly it isn't so why have an issue with it?? Also people are complaining that they thought they were ready for some type of fast and furious movie. Well no because this is an art film, not some stupid cars going fast for 90 minutes. Or people complaining that it is slow, or Gosling being awkward, or the action scenes being to fast. Well this film is a bit slow paced but it suits it brilliantly, and gosling isn't awkward but he just portrays this closed off character stunningly and the action scenes aren't quick but just laced well in the film to add to the plot. This is easily the best film of 2011 so far (although I'm still waiting to see 50/50, Warrior and Tin Tin) and this is a pure masterpiece. Refn has clearly hit the scene hard while gosling should have easily earned an Oscar nod. The perfect film for me and I'm sure for those who love a great piece of cinema, but for those blockbuster who cant stand story lines or character development (e.g. fast and the furious, anything by Michael Bay) this will probably not please you at all. 9.5-10/10",Drive
480,Gobobo,More like 'Dirge',3,20 October 2011,"This movie starts out superbly. The opening 10 minutes grabbed me with gorgeous, urban cinematography and a very tense, superbly executed chase scene that emphasizes how to avoid being chased on the road. We were in overdrive. The night shots were superbly framed and the colors fitting. It's an intelligent and well thought-out scene and I had high hopes for this movie.From there, the story stutters into neutral. Gosling spends most of the time seemingly on methadone; staring at people or giving monosyllabic answers after 'contemplating' for what seems like minutes. Occasionally we get into second or third gear, but using impossible driving techniques (like a car changing up whilst racing in reverse) or improbable violent scenes where people's bodies and heads become unrealistically soft and squash-able. It seems as though the movie is directed at disturbed, violent and inarticulate young men who think they can drive well (to be honest don't we all think that?), and who see these character traits as possibly being attractive to the right woman. This may be true although I doubt they would ever come into contact with the right woman if they acted like this, because you don't find many women in the State Penitentiary.",Drive
481,almonetts,"Suspenseful, Brilliantly Directed, Well-Paced, Oscar-Nomination Deserving",10,25 October 2011,"Directed by Nicholas Winding Refn; Starring Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks, Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks; Based on the book, ""Drive"" by James Sallis.""Drive"" takes its audience on a journey that is seemingly avoid of road signage. Fortunately, the movie is not a wreck! It challenges its audience through an an unrelenting, unapologetic vision: In doing good, or trying to make things right, does the consideration of moral consequence really matter? The answer is found by the end of the film (though subject to your own personal philosophy), Refn uses Los Angeles as if he were Michael Mann (see ""Heat"" and ""Collateral""). Anyone who has seen ""Bronson"" or the ""Pusher Trilogy"" can attest to the capability of this man to stage slow-burn or demonstrate patience (though perhaps to the chagrin of the audience) in accomplishing his design. The city, predominantly seen through a pane of glass whether a building window or windscreen, is harrowing. Its characterization is the foundation of the lives of these people who are called to make choices, which either they regret, have to run away from, or follow-through on. The film is shrewdly edited, allowing extremely vivid depictions and downplaying others, leaving the narrative and actors to work in that space via languid film shots, contrasted with sporadic bursts of action. The use of natural lighting appropriately softens the film as needed, especially as we grow to understand what ""drives"" or is important to the characters played by Gosling and Mulligan. The narrow hallways, confined and cramped spaces, colored filters all give tremendous depth to the feeling that things are not perhaps as they seem.It is yet is in these precisely the well-crafted moments of anxiety, despair, hope and shock that we the audience are placed squarely at the centre of the movie's heart, Ryan Gosling. Anyone who doubts whether this man can act, needs to see ""Lars and the Real Girl"" to put that question to rest. At once, he is charming, boyish, harmless, frail, strong, principled and purpose-driven! His mere act of chewing on a toothpick or putting on gloves conveys the essence of this character. Mulligan's role whilst important is grossly underplayed, but I think this is on purpose; I may have to revisit that assessment though, noting that lone other important female character (Hendricks) is underutilized, but effective. The movie really does belong to Gosling. Brooks and Perlman, are as usual very dependable and a delight to watch. Further deliberating on Mulligan's performance, I have come to appreciate it, as this is where the film works on another level....its Soundtrack. The opening credits of the film looks like something out of the 80s, so I gather synthesized pop sounds (making great use of the fader, by the way), and lyrics would be the order of the day is the order of the day! The effect though is mesmerizing and even heightens/advances the relationship of Mulligan and Gosling and pre-supposes what could be possibly going through their heads at precise moments. In essence, operating almost like a musical!This is truly film making at its finest and ""Drive"" is definitely one of the year's best films.",Drive
482,monkeyboy12121-414-225890,Mind is blown,10,12 July 2012,"This film blew my mind. I was seeing all these reviews popping up at one point saying that the film was amazing but i kept putting off watching it because i didn't like the pink 70s style title writing and ryan gosling didn't look rugged enough to be a hero. But, man i was proved so wrong. This film is amazing, the soundtrack, acting, camera shots were all fantastic.From the start of the film it really does give some good master shots, sets the scene really well and especially with the 70s style music from kavinsky, it really sets the mood of the film. The storyline of the film is pretty mysterious where Gosling is simply known as Driver and has a mysterious past.The acting is brilliant, Cranston is great as Drivers only real friend and father figure, Mulligan is Drivers neighbour and Perlman is the main antagonist. All the actors and actresses pull of their role really well and the scenes really shine through- but Gosling has to be the star of the show and no one they put him in the front seat!! He's cool, calm and calculating and is really an anti-hero. We are never told much about his past except that hes insane behind a wheel which is demonstrated in a few scenes. We see two sides to Goslings character, one being cool and kind and the other being protective and violent.The story is well set out and the music is put together so well! I really cannot fault the film, even though there is no backstory to Drivers past it adds to the mystery of his character but also gives us a sense of realism because we wouldn't really know anyones past in reality and we only see what is on the surface of a person-which makes the film so good.Overall: this film is really enjoyable, tense scenes and a few good action scenes. the best part of the film is the character development of the Driver as the film progresses. Gosling is brilliant and his other films do show his great potential.",Drive

A world he can't seem too escape from... until he meets the damsel next door.A single mother named Irene, breathes life into him, humanizes him, if only for a short time. After her boyfriend, Standard, is released from prison, the thought of a relationship with her is broken. This boils him to a rage yet it's not easily apparent in Gosling's stoic face. ""You shut your mouth or I'll kick your teeth down your throat and shut it for you"" is his response to a well-meaning stranger. She was the one to get him out of the pit he's in, now he's lost her.Soon he finds himself in another situation where his skills as a stunt driver are needed. Standard is at arms with some sketchy people. In order to prevent them from hurting Irene and her son, he must once again go into the frey. There's no reason for him to risk his life for people he hardly knows, but maybe he feels he has to complete a mission in order to win the girl. In one brilliant shot, immediately after a shootout at a motel, his blood-smeared face is shown creeping slowly back into the darkness, slowly returning to his world of darkness. As the following events unfold, the driver's skills are put to the test. In one instance he's forced to show Irene just how brutal he can be by stomping a man too death. She backs away in horror. The driver then looks like a sad puppy who has just upset his owner. He doesn't want the girl he's grown to care so much about to look at him as if he's a monster, but what's done is done.Eventually, he spirals so deep into the belly of the whale that he has to go on the run.

There was nothing in it that would make it memorable to me.I'm not going to deny Nicolas Winding Refn his Best Director Award. The direction is certainly exemplary. There isn't one shot of this movie that doesn't look good.Drive is, in fact, a very ""artistic"" movie (as opposed to a ""commercial"" one, if these distinctions mean anything). It has a dreamy soundtrack, stylish and moody lighting, a slow beginning, long shots, few dialog.

This film is about a Driver, simply known and credited as 'The Driver,' that is a stunt driver by day and a getaway driver for hire by night. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but I didn't know he had it in him to be this kind of lover/friend/maniac. That is, what I feel, is the jist of this film, regardless of a plot or a love story, is the overall driven emotion Ryan Gosling has for every person he interacts with. Whether its the friendship he has with his boss, played wonderfully by Bryan Cranston. Or whether its the budding romance developing with his neighbor (Carey Mulligan). Or finally, the violent, maniacal man that interacts and swiftly responds to the perceived threats of danger he or any of his friends or loved ones encounter. The Driver isn't just a driver, he is every emotion that has ever existed to every extreme you could possibly imagine, played PERFECTLY by Ryan Gosling.

And while action is minimal (which may upset some people), it works as a good drama into a look of character. The acting is pretty good, and works with the slow burn character development that's in this film. What I like is how there's also some quiet moments in the movie where a character doesn't say anything, but you can feel their emotions with what they're thinking. The one flaw that I have are that I feel like you don't really spend enough time with the husband of the driver's girlfriend. Like he was just thrown in there just to kickstart the plot into motion. You can leave him out of the picture and still have a movie about our main character protecting his girlfriend and her kid. But other than that, this is a good movie. Just don't go in expecting it to be an action movie because it ain't, it's a character piece mostly. A very enjoyable one that you could probably watch again to try and figure out the ending.",Drive

490,kgmarra,Classic action film,8,25 September 2011,"Fasten your seat belts. Ryan Gosling stars in the new crime drama ""Drive"". Gosling plays a nameless driver who stunt drives in movies during the day, and is a wheel man at night. He is extremely quiet and quite emotionless; he very rarely cracks a smile.The driver becomes close with his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her son, Benicio (Kaden Leos), whose father is in jail. Eventually, the driver becomes a little too caught up in the father's unfinished business.If you saw the trailer for ""Drive"" and you're expecting an action film like ""Iron Man"" or ""Fast Five"", you'll be disappointed. This film is very different from most current action films. It's classic like Clint Eastwood movies. There is action, but in a much more artistic way. The director, Nicolas Winding Refn, used several interesting and unique camera angles that make you feel like you're in the room with the characters.Even though Refn is known for using an immense amount of gore in his films, it was a bit over the top in ""Drive"". I've had my fair share of violent movies, but this is the goriest movie I've ever seen. If hardcore violence bothers you, do not see this movie. It's disturbing.Ryan Gosling is stunning. Most people agree with me that this is his best film to date. We see a completely different side of him. Everyone was cast perfectly, in my opinion. Some might say that the characters weren't developed enough, but I think Refn left a lot for the viewers to find out on their own or to imagine for themselves.""Drive"" is a unique, authentic film that is incredibly crafted. I give it an 8 out of 10 for its exceptional cinematography that almost lets you forget about the unsettling scenes.",Drive
491,5h4d0w,Very beautiful but flawed movie,8,25 September 2011,"It seems many think of this movie as a fantastic piece of cinema, so instead of talking about the beautiful cinematography and interestingly done scenes, I will focus on why I felt that while it is very well done, it is ""just"" entertaining.It is basically an average crime story with only very slight drama attached to it. The twist to it is obviously the personality of the main character and I suppose it is also unusual for a semi-big budget crime movie that much of the time is spent with calm scenes. But the personality of the main character is also what I simultaneously love and somewhat dislike about this movie. I love it because there are very, very few movies made about quiet guys who you still shouldn't mess with and who will do whatever it takes. But that is at the same time a big problem. For one, a criminal stunt man who is also a modest introvert? Not likely. Secondly, he somehow manages to be invited to Irene's apartment even though he is hardly talkative? Unlikely yet again. And even though he is very concise, much of the dialogue was too minimalistic too seem authentic in my opinion. And to finish it off... there is this theme song that seems to suggest that this story is unique because it is not about some unrealistic bad-ass but about an average guy who simply does what he must. But he is not. Irene's husband is the average guy who does what he must. A tiny fraction of men have the personality of the driver.Because of this, the huge plot holes (not ONCE in my life have I ever complained about that but here they are so gaping that it bothered even me) in roughly the first third of the movie and the lack of criticism or depth (the drama seemed more a nice thing on the side than profound), ""Drive"" is in my view a very beautiful and entertaining movie that may have been more but is not. For people who wish to see more authentic Thrillers with heavy Drama aspects, I would recommend Cronenberg's latest (""A History of Violence"" and ""Eastern Promises"") instead. But for those who have already seen them, I think ""Drive"" would still be a worthwhile watch as long as one doesn't have very high expectations.",Drive
492,jtprius510,Breathtaking Minimalist Thrill Ride,8,24 September 2011,"With a pulse driven soundtrack pumping from the speakers of Ryan Gosling's GT, Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is instantly a contemporary cult classic thrill ride written in blood stains and pink.The color of Drive brings to mind a quote made by Cameron Diaz as the femme fatale in 'The Mask that she addresses towards Jim Carrey during one of their first meetings. It brings to our attention the polluted skies she admires so much for its' accumulation of purples, pinks and greens. In retrospect this quote can now be considered a foreshadowing of what would later become a tradition in twenty first century film.Not only does Refn follow this foreshadowed tradition, but he sets a new bar for it by using this scope to create a new-wave, stylistic action thriller. Drive is a crash collision of vibrant colors inspired possibly by video games like Grand Theft Auto's Vice City, movies like Scarface, and maybe the minimalist script and shot decisions of Andrei Tarkovsky. For those that are unfamiliar with the last name, think of David Lynch or more recent films like 'Enter The Void,' 'Biutiful,' 'Blue Valentine,' or 'Tree Of Life.' The broad pov shot from Ryan Gosling's windshield creates something special. By the street lit product placement of names like rite aid, Ross, and Food 4 Less Refn's Drive puts me in an all too familiar place of oppression. However, seeing it from the perspective of Refn and Gosling illuminates and exposes it for all of its color and possibility. Refin knows how to capture optimism. Its one of those films that makes you proud to be a part of these fluorescent polluted times we are living in.With direction this good, the characters do not need to say anything. Drive's main character has no name. Everyone surrounding him has a name. Some of these circumstantial misfits are titled that way by choice, or just plain circumstances and all of them want some type of favor from our hero. And our hero will do it, no matter how absurd, without any questioning of things like what is in it for the misfit asking this favor of our hero.There are no hidden agendas behind anything that he says or does. Everything he does is done because it is the right thing to do. College's theme 'Real Hero' fits into this so well because it echoes exactly what this movie is all about and that is real people and real heroes. In this way Drive's main character is an example of a cinematic hero that can and should be followed.Less is more in 'Drive.' Their actions in this post apocalypse are what speak volume for their characters. Move over Emilio Estevez and Robert Deniro because Gosling is this years 'Repo Man' and 'Taxi Driver.' And while Gosling is today's hero in film, Refn is our post-modern and apocalyptic philanthropist.",Drive

494,kmevy,"""It's Bad Luck""",10,1 October 2011,"Wow. I was pretty surprised. Drive is certainly not your average, fast cheap-shot action film. It takes its time and rightfully so! The pacing is refreshingly smooth and composed, building slowly up to the sporadic and short outbursts of violence or action. There isn't much violence but it is very direct; realistic would be the right word. Especially the use of it is (which is a big plus for me). There is a quite surreal, dreamlike quality to the film. Even though it has a lot of realistic elements, it still doesn't feel entirely real. There is something off, which isn't a bad thing! In that context ""A History of Violence"" somehow comes to my mind.The trailers might give a wrong impression; the film is much quieter than they suggest. There is a clip from the opening on youtube, the getaway scene, which gives a much better feeling for the atmosphere.Anyway, this is really a fantastic production! The cast is very good. They all made up a rock-solid ensemble, great performances! (If you want to see more of great acting by Ryan Gosling, ""Blue Valentine"" is highly recommended) The minimalistic and tense soundtrack is a perfect fit (maybe sometimes slightly on the overly-sentimental side), the cinematography is excellent(!) and the director; well, I certainly have to write down his name.All in all it is truly refreshing to see a film which is simple and minimal but at the same time highly effective. That's the reason I give this film a 10; it doesn't need a much more complex story. For me it perfectly managed to reach what it aimed for. There is real focus and concentration, something you rarely come across these days. For me it's a masterpiece, for sure.",Drive

Carey Mulligan is horribly under-utilized in a role that needed someone just a touch more haggard to be believable; explaining that she's two years younger than her husband thinks she is helps, but doesn't solve the problem.

I'm not usually one for action films, but something about this really caught my attention. It was kind of off putting at first how little Ryan Gosling's character seemed to talk.

It just looked like a fairly conventional Hollywood action flick, and I'd never seen anything approaching interesting from Gosling himself. Turns out I was wrong on both counts. I'd previously criticised the man on the basis he seems to have little to no emotional range, and mumbles a lot, but, in fairness, that is perfect for this surprisingly touching noir-style flick. The plot doesn't have much to it, and it doesn't really matter; I quite like that. Even though the characters don't speak that much, their body language alone, in particular that of the two leads (Mulligan is fantastic opposite Gosling), conveys far more than pages full of unnecessary, trite dialogue could have done. Add that to your other noir staples of a beautifully lit up setting, a mesmerising, ethereal soundtrack, and just the right amount of gratuitous violence, and you really have something worth watching. There really is an art form to elevating seemingly run of the mill plot lines, characters, and events into an 'experience'. The genius cinematography gave me the same mystical feeling of wonder and just that vague, far-off something that Blade Runner gave me - the sort of thing that's hard to put into words.

Even in his behavior was disconnected from how people work, unaware of what he was getting into, and indicated another level of being detached and sociopathic, but not in the Tony Montoya or Travis Bickle mold. (I and the friend I saw this with both think this was a much better written portrait of a disconnected, sociopathic character.) The two scenes where this is evident is how his smiling face turns into a grimace when he tells a guy in a bar whom he previously did business with to go away or face the consequences, and when he looks up from his handiwork in the elevator as to say 'I'm Sorry/Surprise.. this is who I really am.' It is a fantastic scene and does show that the man can act, and the entire portrayal, and flow of the movie shows the writer can write.The Driver knows what he is, and although the imagery is a bit heavy handed, it can be excused for everything else in this movie. It delivers in intrigue, car chases and aesthetic. The scene in the garage near the end of the movie is one of horrid honorable beauty. The only flaw I see is the mismatched soundtrack.I suppose the American audience needs some loudmouth moron of a main character (The Rock, Vin Diesel, Steven Seagal) who acts as if they are aware they are in a movie, it's outcome and of everything going on around him(their identification with such characters says a lot about their own behavior and intelligence). I'm sorry audiences have to be led to every step, and can't fill in any gaps themselves.And Layer Cake? Are you serious?",Drive

The implementation is shite. The slow-mo action that pervades the movie is terrible, and Ryan Gosling's performance the worst I've seen in a long time. I understand that he's not meant to show emotion, but he didn't do that. He just showed nothing. At all.Slow? Oh my god is it slow.Yet I feel bad putting the movie down, because it's way better than other 'action' movies - compared to Fast and the Furious it's great.

509,Spyan,Scorpion with a toothpick,1,20 January 2012,"This has got to be the hate it or love it movie of 2011. It reminded me of most of Lynches movies. It's not about characters or plot, it's about the mood.Great music, good actors...but about 30mns in the movie, I felt this unexplained, creeping...boredom taking the upper hand. Somehow putting a white jacket, a scorpion and a toothpick had a powerful impact on everyone. I guess it added ""personality"" to a passive, dragging, BORING plot less movie (a skilled driver loses control when his life becomes entangled with a love interest, a professional opportunity and a botched up robbery thanks to working with losers that no one would consider). The character(s) are thinned out to concepts, and somehow I never cared about anything that was happening, except when gosling's character came alive when it was all about being cruel and merciless. There's nothing interesting in a film when you're left to rooting for a cold blooded, sadistic cut out cardboard piece. Will someone please explain to me why this movie had so much impact? I guess it's that Danish ""je ne sais quoi"" that put me off, but in abstraction I found that ""Songs from the second floor"" was much more successful. Verdict:flat as a frozen lake(imho).",Drive

I hear people talk about Drive having hidden meanings and is heavily metaphoric. That's fine, but don't make the movie all about metaphors. I can't enjoy a movie if it isn't fleshed out or entertaining. Drive feels like someone else's dream that only has meaning to him who is dreaming it. Anyone who steps foot into this dream is lost and confused. Drive isn't terrible, but it's certainly not my cup of tea. It's not like nothing went into making this film. Obviously this movie means a whole lot to somebody. It's a very artsy film and if you are into that kind of thing that's cool. Go ahead and break down all of those hidden meanings and metaphors.

512,CrazyRaccoon777,very good but just not great,6,28 July 2013,I love Ryan Gosling since watching The Notebook and was highly recommended to see this movie by 2 women friends.Gosling plays a dark mystery guy in this movie who speaks as much by silence as by words. He is a stunt driver by day and getaway driver by night for local thugs.There is a kind of ethereal mystery quality throughout and the soundtrack helps in parts and over plays it in others in my opinion. Some of the city nights and lights overhead camera shots remind me of the movie Heat and there are many other movies that spring to mind at various points.Gosling gets drawn into an ever decreasing circle of violence after trying to help his neighbour Carey Mulligan whom he likes and her ex-con husband -the violence is graphic and intense at times so be warned Mel Gibson Payback springs to mind.There are a few other characters all playing stereotyped roles in this movie and all do a good if not great job.Overall the movie is haunting bleak and dreamlike but no real warmth or love of the characters develops and at the end I am left feeling a bit empty and unfulfilled but it is moving at the same time.I have not watched many movies recently so this is my first review in a while. This movie made a big impression on me if not a great one -Definitely worth seeing as it is a bit different although reminds me of other movies at various times.

514,citizen-caveman,Slick and stylish thriller,8,4 August 2013,"Ten seconds in it grabs you: less than a minute more you know what you need to about the protagonist. The rest of the opener is a get-away scene so slick you don't notice the exposition. After that the pace of the film slows down some. Ryan Gosling's performance is understated giving the Driver an air of someone who is sufficiently self-possessed that he doesn't feel the need to prove anything. But the Driver is perhaps not wholly self-possessed. Whether his appetite for extreme violence is down to simply being ruthless or anger issues isn't clear. The central character is an enigma. He certainly doesn't have an appetite for talking much. There are brief, but lingering silences where you expect him to say something, which eventually he does but only speaks a few words. Cary Mulligan does a decent job of playing the damsel-in-distress. Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks are off the shelf mobsters but their performances are solid. This is an action flick whose spectacular stunts at times give an artificial feel to the film. The hand brake turn in the chase sequence is eye-popping but how does it help shake off the pursuers? The violence is brutal without warning, always popping up out of nowhere to make you wince. In a country where guns are widely available there are a lot of sharp objects used instead. The violence of the antagonists make you wince more than that of the Driver perhaps to make the bad guys badder and thus making the protagonist more sympathetic. The music adds to the ambiance and moods of the film, especially the tension and menace at the beginning. Overall, a good balance of drama and action with spectacular, if jarring, stunts. The drama is more convincing than the stunts. The violence will put off some people.",Drive
515,pierrefonds_athlete101,One of those rare experiences you get from an indie feature,9,2 October 2011,"I never heard of Refn. I've heard of Gosling. When I saw the trailer, I assumed that it was going to be a typical Hollywood action feature...I was wrong! In fact I was more pleased if anything and I was entertained on Refn's film basis which is more style than it was substance. Cannes definitely made the right choice in picking him for the best director award. I'm a big film buff and I noticed the little references he kept in the movie so he can film in respect to what other filmmakers did...especially the head stomp scene which he adopted from Gaspar Noe's extremely graphic and controversial film 'Irreversible' (2002). Forget about the pace of this movie when watching it because this film is like a slow time bomb just waiting to explode! Gosling is a combination of what many critics say which is Clint Eastwood's iconic 'Man With No Name' character and Alain Delon's calm and cool 'Le Samourai' (1967) and I was deeply impressed with the character development which made him drive to do the things he had to do for Mulligan's young, cute and innocent maternal portrayal of Irene. The actor that I was most impressed with in this movie had to be Albert Brooks because you can typecast him for all the other movies he has done. Now he has a surprise in store for those who knew him as actor an back in the day.The lighting was well done and I was impressed with the symbolism that brought the movie along to it's final conclusion. Watch out for the scorpion and the shadow's that Refn pays close attention to. This is what the movies main idea is. The soundtrack is amazing! Cliff Martinez has really tried to make this movie a fairy tale portrayal of Los Angeles and he does so beautifully with his synthesized score and careful selection of songs. I was almost reminded a bit of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City with the music but also because of its characters and the environment that Driver has to navigate and pay close attention to.Definitely not for all tastes since the shots have been considered to be a bit pretentious and the pace is a bit slow but we can't help but let this pretentiousness slide away because it's an independent film experience we don't often get to see.

The action is minimal and gruesome, there's no chase scenes or anything else you would expect from story and characters. Basically, it's still shot of protagonist's face with some dark ambient soundtrack for most of the time.This... makes no sense. And isn't entertaining or fun in any way.

522,gutsy_gibbon,An overwhelming movie with a subtle undertone,7,10 October 2011,"If taken at face value, Drive can seem overwhelming to most people and leave one with a nauseous feeling at the end. Drive is indeed an incredibly bloody movie, however, it is not very hard to come away from watching this with a feeling that maybe all this completely wrong? Sometimes, to provide a critique of something, one only needs to present the thing in all its reality and the critique appears all of its own. This can be said of the latest movies from the likes of Tarantino, in whose movies, blood and gore are pretty much the order of the day.In Drive, Ryan Gosling provides an average, unemotional performance as the anti-hero: he is a sociopathic young part-time criminal who gets into a ""contract"" to commit a crime to help a neighbor's ex-con husband and realizes that the ""contract"" has more than what appears on the surface. Carey Mulligan, in my opinion, proves to be the saving grace in a movie whose characters all appear to be stereotypes and provide mostly average or poor performances. In scenes where she meets Gosling for the first times, she provides a real on screen charisma and chemistry similar to the performance provided by Gosling and Michelle Williams (whom Mulligan uncannily resembles) in Blue Valentine. Though Drive does not get onto the level of Blue Valentine's sublime story lines and acting, taken from the perspective of just this pair of actors, this movie is a very good successor to Blue Valentine, providing what might very well be the next tragic stage in the lives of Dean Pereira and Cindy Heller.",Drive

""More than just an action movie"", ""Amazing action scenes"", etc. I still had hopes at the beginning when the driver was evading the police. Great suspense, apparently interesting lead character, etc. I started wondering soon after whether staring emotionless was the only thing this guy could actually do. I found that many of the scenes lingered too long on him, with the intended effect of revealing something deeper about him, I guess. But it didn't work for me; I felt nothing for him or anyone else, for that matter. I had the feeling that they were trying to create a character like in Taxi Driver, who is on the edge but is somehow still a person. Not this guy. Like a cardboard cutout. The only lingering thought I had regarding any of the characters was ""Man, that Ron Perlman REALLY looks like a monkey"".The movie finally lost me for good when they went for the day out in the canals. 'Lets skip some rocks on the garbage strewn pond'. I could just smell the place, which just ruined any sort of believability there was to this scene. The later car chase scenes were equally weak for me. I just cant handle it when the only thing they can add as sound effects is the car accelerating and changing gears. How many gears does this car have? I counted at least 10... Oh, and when you broadside a car at what must be at least 20 miles an hour you don't just get out ready to whoop some ass. You will be stunned for a good while.I echo others that say the rating here is baffling and unjustified.

526,Indie_Locker,A style that's hard to resist.,8,13 July 2013,"The greatest thing that can be said about Drive is that it would have been a completely different film if it were not helmed by Nicolas Winding Refn. The film takes a story we're familiar with in movies, a guy gets mixed up with the wrong kind of people and has to take matter into his own hands. Its a rather typical plot, but the film doesn't try to be anything different than that. Instead, Refn chooses to give each moment such life and style that it draws us in.Ryan Gosling stars as a man simply known as Driver, because we don't find out what his name is. We don't know anything about the man for he maintains this constant aura of ambiguity. We only know a few things about this character: He experiences joy when he's around his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son, he has an intense burning hatred inside of him and he's very good at his job. Gosling is wonderful in keeping his character mysterious, cool, collected, meticulous and intense.Driver and his partner Shannon (wonderfully played by Bryan Cranston) get themselves involved with a couple of mobsters, delightfully played by Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman. Brooks's Bernie Rose makes for an interesting villain. He isn't afraid of anybody, he cares about his money and his ego and he has a thing for knives and other stabbing weapons. The film takes an interesting stance in down-playing the use of guns, only using them in a couple of key scenes.The film is technically very impressive, nearly every frame of the picture contains blue and orange hues, which Refn must have visioned for this film. Even the green street lights have a blue tint to them, and the glow of the orange street lights reflect off of the character's faces in a wonderful fashion. Cliff Martinez uses a wonderful somber score which adds to the quiet moments of the film, while more pronounced moments feature synth pop songs which adds to the allusion to 80's crime films.Refn deservedly won the Best Director prize for this film at the Cannes film festival. He creates a wonderful vision to a rather standard crime film and appreciates the quiet, personal moments of the film while brutalizing the violent aspects of the film in Tarantino fashion. Violence can erupt from a moment of quietness, much like the boiling intensity can seep through the innocent gaze of Driver.",Drive
527,MovieShrink7,Truly breathtaking if you can stomach it,10,12 February 2012,"Drive is surely not for everyone. What starts out as a mild film evolves into a genuine bloodbath with a quirky, sort of eighties, soundtrack. If you can handle the gore, by all means, see this film. It is beautiful and haunting. Gosling delivers an incredible performance even though his character is unnamed and barely speaks throughout the movie. He brings the character of ""the driver"" a depth that I would not have thought possible before seeing it myself. While watching this movie you to come to respect, fear and love Gosling all at once. Stacking up nicely is Bryan Cranston in his supporting role, which is a far cry from his character on Breaking Bad. Carey Mulligan is not brilliant in this film but the great thing is that she doesn't need to be. Aside from the acting, the film is a beautiful masterpiece. The driving sequences are incredible and the music, though unorthodox, fits in somehow. The directer conveys a story to the audience by using visuals and conveying emotion without heavy dialogue. It truly is what makes this film a stunning work of art. If you're looking for a stereotypical action flick, this is not it, if you're looking for a beautiful doe eyed love story, this isn't it either. If you're ready for something different, beautiful, intense, and mesmerizing, this is what you should see. It definitely deserved more than one Oscar nod.",Drive

529,Perse_phone,Boring.,3,31 May 2015,"I am sorry to say this, but this movie and me didn't work at all. Don't get me wrong, the acting is superb -- and although I've never understood the hype around Ryan Gosling as a ""womaniser"" (yep, I've got a number of friends who would faint at his feet) he really knows his stuff.Some reviewers complain about there not being enough dialogue and/or acting on Gosling's part to call it ""acting"" in the first place, but I have to disagree. I see where the director/producer was going with Gosling's character -- the mysterious, gentle man of few words who cares deeply, but who can turn into a lethal weapon in an instant if he has to.I actually like the slow pacing and the sudden turn from calm and quiet to fast paced and violent.. usually. Some of my favourite movies share those qualities.But here? I gotta say that I was utterly bored throughout the whole film. And believe me I tried. I even gave it a 2nd chance thinking that when I last watched it a year or so ago I simply might not have been in the right mood for this. But sadly no.Contrary to some reviews here that claim this to have more depth than your average action flick I've got to admit: I don't see it. Sure the ""driver's"" character has mysteriousness going for him - starting with him having no name - but seriously, that's hardly new. I really can't understand what's supposed to be that original (in this ""time and age"", so to speak - considering the fact that this is deliberately recreating the style of some 60s-70s movies back in the day...) or crafty about this film. This has all the ingredients of today's average action film, only with fewer words, slower pacing and no explosions. Which isn't a bad thing - quite the opposite actually. I sure can appreciate the one or other explosion or shoot out scene the action genre usually seems to be so fond of, but to be honest most action movies use those scenes way too generously. Most of the time it seems that they want too distract from shallow script/plot more than anything else... And no, I didn't miss those particular action scenes here at all, as those wouldn't have made the plot more interesting or captivating.

I believe that this movie focuses on the aspect of one man's silence, inner thoughts, and conflicts as he tries to cope up with his social responsibility. The main character didn't talk too much because his actions spoke for himself which were interpreted well by the other characters in the movie. What is so good about this movie is that it is able to communicate its story to the viewers even with less words. It was so generous enough as to provide attention to one of the misunderstood means of communication: silence. The story line was good. The cinematography was great. The characters were so perfect.

The character just felt flat, he felt lazily written. And with a film like this you need to connect to the character, much like Taxi Driver and A Clockwork Orange.Overall, I enjoyed it and I would recommend it.

It also serves to add to the air of mystery surrounding the nameless Driver. In terms of plot, the film has much in common with other escalating ""vengeance"" thrillers. There is - despite the title and subject matter - very little in terms of car chases, which may surprise viewers simply searching for an action blockbuster. The gratuitous graphic-novel style violence is often sudden and shocking, in contrast to the leisurely pace of the film and beautiful day-and-night vistas of Los Angeles. The use of space is one of the elements that marks the film out as more than a slick action flick, along with its highly-stylised text and colour palette. A trademark of cinematography is noticeable: the characters are rarely portrayed directly in the centre of the camera. This deliberate attention to detail elevates Drive into the realm of arty action films. The use of music is admirable - an 80s-inspired soundtrack is used sparsely to emphasise certain (often tense) moments, also allowing the film to float anachronistically in an unspecified time period (the makes of car and lack of visible technology leave the setting of the film as vague and mysterious as the main character). Music often flows between diegetic and non-diegetic, weaving between what the Driver can hear and what the audience is caused to feel, enabling the audience to identify more with the silent character's mood and emotions. The diminishing mood is expressed through ever-darkening lighting and subtle mise-en-scene portraying the Driver's descent into a bleak, harsh criminal world. The film's successfully minimalist soundtrack and arty cinematography, along with its use of space, make it stand out as a uniquely cult genre-defying film, reveling in influences from neo- noir to grindhouse to fairy tales.",Drive

This is just an awful, awful movie with no substance, this is the most gimmicky movie i have seen in my life, i can't even take Ryan Gosling serious, he looks so stupid as a violent guy.

537,MrMuffinMan,"Had potential, but let down by poor storyline, dialogue, direction and leading performances.",4,2 April 2012,"Very slight spoiler - apart from the crummy review - but the film itself is it's own biggest spoiler. ""Drive"" seems to have been marketed as a modern take on the dry, sometimes semi-documentary style crime/road action centered movies of the seventies, so you could be excused for thinking the quality is going to match ""Bullitt"", ""The Driver"" or even (God help me for making the comparison) The French Connection duo. If so, be prepared to be disappointed - very, very disappointed. Decent performances by the supporting cast: Bryan Cranston (Hal from Malcolm in the Middle) as the garage owner, Albert Brooks (pitches his role as a local hood nicely) Oscar Isaac (did a great job with a small part as Mulligan's squeeze, a small time crook trying to go straight), Christina Hendrickson (a nice turn in her few minutes as the devious moll), Mr Shouty Ron Pearlman (but less shouty than usual) couldn't save this flick. However, Gosling (Driver) and Mulligan (Blond Next Door With Kid) don't come out of this looking good, both seem very weak and uncertain as to what was expected of their roles and delivery, but as they have put in much better performances elsewhere I suspect this is the director's doing. You know, just staring a lot doesn't make automatically make you come across like Eastwood as the Man with No Name - you have to have the charisma to back it up, whether that comes from great character build through storyline and scripting or sheer force of personality. No sign of either of those here unfortunately. The storyline was very weak, and while other films have come good with worse, this isn't one of them, as it has neither the taut direction, the entertaining dialogue or the big personality leads to carry it off. Some of the action scenes are fairly well done though. The short, action driving sequences are OK but given the movie is called ""Drive"" you feel a bit robbed by the very few minutes of these on offer. Sadly the few good bits just highlight the general weakness and make for a disappointing experience. I don't know if this makes sense, but I have the strange feeling I've enjoyed much worse films than this one much more. I started out giving it a 6, but the more I think this one over, the less I appreciate it. In fact I recall fast forwarding about two thirds of the way in, and I really hate having to do that. If this was a free to air movie on TV I would have switched of within 20 mins. This is one of those rare films I recommend people NOT to watch, which I hardly ever do, as even real stinkers usually have something to make you keep watching 'till the end. A poor 4.",Drive
538,mpdmartin,21st Century Classic.,9,21 January 2016,"Drive (2011) Reviewed by Martin Davis. Retrospect Film on Facebook. It's not hard to see why Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn's superb adaptation of James Sallis's 2005 novel won him the best director award at the 2011 Cannes film festival. 'Drive' is no mindless action film heavily reliant on CGI. The car chase scenes are filmed for real but more importantly the characters and their lives have credibility too. 'Drive' is a slow burner and takes a while to get up to full speed but once it does it's relentless. The unnamed Driver (Ryan Gosling), who lives in an Echo Park, Los Angeles apartment, works repairing cars and as a stunt driver for action films. Managed in both jobs by auto shop owner Shannon (Bryan Cranston), the duo also provide a getaway driver service. With Shannon organizing the events, the Driver gives criminals only five minutes to perpetrate robberies and reach his car. Meeting his new neighbour, Irene (Carey Mulligan), the Driver soon becomes close to her and befriends her young son, Benicio (Kaden Leos), while Irene's husband, Standard Gabriel (Oscar Isaac), is in prison. After her husband is freed, Irene stills asks the Driver to visit them. And then things get complicated. Standard is heavily in debt to the mob and agrees to rob a pawnshop of $40,000 to pay off the debt. The Driver, concerned for the safety of Irene and Benicio, steals a Ford Mustang and offers to act as the getaway driver for the pawnshop job. Suddenly, two thirds in 'Drive' moves up a gear, actually several gears. This is not a film for the faint-hearted. When the violence comes it is brutal and uncompromising. With dazzling cinematography and an evocative soundtrack 'Drive' was destined to become an instant classic. Ryan Gosling brings just the right amount of quiet brooding intensity to the leading role and Carey Mulligan is excellent as Irene. The supporting cast, Brian Cranston, Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman also give memorable performances. If you like classic crime/heist/thriller films from the 70's and 80's you should spend 90 minutes watching this. Highly Recommended. Martin Davis. Retrospect Film on Facebook.",Drive
539,gardoma,"The Movie I Always Wanted to See, and Nobody Had Made Before",10,17 January 2013,"Drive is the movie I always wanted to see and nobody had ever directed before. It is the story of an unnamed, lonely stuntman who moonlights as a getaway driver. The driver falls in love (or at least he seems to) with his neighbor, but an attempt to help her ex-con husband triggers a deadly chain of events.Drive is a great movie because its style is as important as its plot in telling the story. With only a few scattered lines and lots of silence, the extraordinarily gifted director Nicolas Winding Refn is in charge of telling most of the story through his cameras. And he does, and well! Refn's way of framing every scene is exceptionally powerful in conveying the character's emotions. The exchanges between Ryan Gosling and Corey Mulligan are loaded with unspoken emotions. The occasional bursts of violence are intense and explosive, hard and unforgiven, without the cathartic overtones of Tarantino's. The car chases are focused and intense, because they feel what a real car chase should feel like, concentrated on the goal of saving your own life, and not on the roller-coaster's thrill of driving fast.The entire movie's style is based on the tension between the dryness and brutality of the character's interactions on screen, and their emotional world as communicated by the visuals and the movie's score. In fact, Drive's music (sophisticated, nightly, electronic) is the off-screen main character. Its retro style gives the film a dreamy atmosphere, keeping it half-way between the gritty reality of the story and a wonderful and poetic heroism that makes up fairy tales and knight stories. The movie keeps these two distant worlds apart and strangely connected, which is what makes it movie so powerful in the first place. Some commentators compared this movie to ""Layer Cake"" or ""Lock, Stock"". They are seriously mistaken. The only thing in common with ""Layer Cake"" is that the main character remains unnamed. The only thing in common with ""Lock, Stock"" is that the director is European. ""Drive"" is not a crime story, at least not in a strict sense. Drive is distilled movie about an archetypal lonely hero. It is a movie about whether we really have choices in our life, or we are bound to follow our nature. And it is one of the few masterpieces I have seen in many years.",Drive

It's tense and involving- almost impossible not to get immersed in. Nicolas Winding Refn is a Director to definitely keep a tab on.Ryan Gosling is the embodiment of some kind of cold fire at the heart of the matter- his ""Driver"" character is a well-intentioned but unstoppable force that will surely end up as a cult favorite for decades to come. Carey Mulligan, Albert Brooks, Ron Perlman, Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks and Oscar Issac round out an excellent cast that's pretty much in support but extremely well-utilized.Those wanting to check out a quick and disposable, mindlessly fun popcorn flick need to steer clear- this isn't what you're looking for.

542,hunter_kudjo,Expecting Fireball-Explosion-Gun-Sex-Drugs? Expect something more meaningful,8,2 January 2012,"{{{{{{{{{{Spoilers? Yeah Probably}}}}}}}}}} First off, you can't argue this to be a classic. I'm pretty sure a ""classic"" sits around a while before becoming just that. So to you who blab ""classic!"" and those who say ""over-rated minimalist p.o.s."", give it a rest, and give it some time. We'll see.Secondly, great! Some action addicts need a transforming robot three stories tall to level four skyscrapers in a nuclear battle sequence in order to be happy. Some spiritualist movie-goers only need long pauses, reflective looks, no action, and a good story to appreciate a truly human theme. And some need a little bit of both. I'd say Drive does offer both. Without tension from the pauses, emotion from the characters apparent struggle (physically & internally), and the unexpected climactic action that bursts in your face, yes, Drive would be nothing but a minimalist bore.Thirdly, is what I'd like to talk about.I see some people here say this film has no emotion? Eh? And what kind of emotion did you get when you walked out of Mission-Impossitransformers-Alien-vs.-Lantern-Fast-Five-The-Sequel? If you even got a feeling, great, but don't slam other worthy films of 2011 as devoid of emotion or character attachment, when in fact it is quite obvious that they do. Even if you aren't a fan of the M-Bay Explosion Homeboys, take a step back and think about.Did anyone else notice Gosling's ""sacrifice"" in this film? That there is a huge example of emotion, is it not? The Driver gave up his security, incidentally his friends, his money, his career both legal and illegal, and nearly his life, for what? For her.It's a pity that some people these days expect every assisting female protagonist to get banged in a happy-do-ditty sex scene.I'd like to see more films where the male antagonist is a turned honorable man, protecting what's right in the world, even if it brings him to a bitter fight with evil itself, and even if there is no rewarding sexual gratification, money, or happy ending.To call all of that, in this story, devoid of emotion, is a gross misunderstanding and insult.To call this cliché could be a sin.To call it your opinion - I guess that's okay. ;) 8.8/10",Drive

544,Greigx3,Tarantino would be proud,9,9 January 2012,"Nicolas Winding Refn has obviously been influenced a lot by Tarantino. Not just because of the intermittent scenes of graphic violence, but because of the use of a widescreen aspect ratio, long shots, a mostly still frame and slow cutting. This visual stillness and the disquieting introverted calm of Ryan Gosling's character provide a sobriety which balances out the occasional bit of mutilation. Drive handles some of the most disturbing portrayals of cold-blooded murder in cinematic history with undeniably cool style. I was immediately most reminded of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs but the film could be paying tribute to any one of Tarantino's twisted takes on gangster drama.An 80s-esque electro soundtrack mixed with the neon-pink titles and cityscapes cry out to placed next to Tarantino's filmography as well as classic gangster dramas like Scarface. Like Al Pacino's Tony Montana, Gosling's driver starts the film as a nobody. Unlike Pacino's egomaniacal anti-hero, however, Drive's hero is consistently relatively meaningless. The main song in the soundtrack, A Real Hero by College, sums up the driver's story as it plays over an unsurprisingly down ending with the lyrics ""you've proved to be a real human being and a real hero"" repeating over and over.Gosling, along with Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman provide captivating characters to drive along a fairly minimal plot. As much happens off-screen as it does on-screen in this film and that really allows the audience to invest their own imagination into the film to fill in the gaps; making for a more rewarding viewing experience, in my opinion. A very solid effort by director Winding Refn, Drive is satisfyingly sure of its genre and cinematic influences.http://ionlyaskedwhatyouthought.blogspot.com/",Drive

I was enthralled watching Drive unfold; my favorite movies don't tell you where they're going, and Drive is one of those. The movie has superior building tension, with patient and paused dialog and characters that are caring and full, but with menace lurking just below the surface. Some might say this movie starts as 'boring'; I say intriguing. And in the middle of the slowly building tension, juxtaposed against the calm and comedic personalities, stunning violence erupts - short in duration but extremely disturbing. Wow.For me, Albert Brooks is tremendous - lulling us into his mild comedic personality and dialog - and then spinning our head with a burst of chilling violence. Rank 9/10 - must see.",Drive

The main character, who looks like Daniel Craig on the movie cover, but is in fact Ryan Gosselin, is a quiet, 20 something stunt driver for movies, and a mechanic on the side. He doesn't say much; this stoic mask adds intensity, intrigue, and a certain degree of unpredictability. The soundtrack is amazing; so much of the movie's tension is built on the music, and it really hooks you. The basic idea is that he gets involved with a nice girl and experiences some very bad aftermath after dealings with an unsavory person from her past. It seems to be a remake of a an earlier film, and there was definitely a somewhat retro feel to the parts where he was driving, with the soundtrack bridging into some 80's hits. This film carried a unique flavor; perhaps I would discard this view if I'd seen the original, but that aside, it's really a great film. Raw and powerful.",Drive

Why the empathy and the helping hand? Because he gets beaten and is kindly asked to re-pay his previous employers for the service they'd provided him with while in prison (they want the protection money with, of course, interests).Things go from bad to worse and Ryan suddenly becomes the overprotective neighbour; the hero who saves the day by going after the bad guys one- by-one. At this point the film's slow pace quickly changes and while it'd normally take time to enjoy the different circumstances the creators made sure I got disgusted by Drive's gruesome handling of every situation where two enemies meet.This film is full of gore. Ryan's one liners make it even worse. Oh, but wait, sometimes he smiles! There is no need to say anything; a smile can really tell you everything. Drive is an awful film: from start to finish; it's pacing, the plot, the characters (development?) and an unsatisfactory ending that cries out for a better screenplay.It is a shame such a movie is given high rates. It is OK if you don't want to follow the good-old clichés and if you want to try out something different. It is OK if you employ techniques, effects, cinematography that keep the audience focused. It is NOT, good, however, if you go off the beaten track. Perhaps, next time more emphasis will be on the plot and less on the excessive use of violence.",Drive

551,xfirerushx,Drive- A Great Movie,9,24 September 2011,"It is quite hard for me to review this movie. Everything that can be said HAS been said. Why would you even need another opinion? Drive has suspense, romance, great dialogue, and more that will just take up WAY too much time to put into full detail. Even though this movie is very meditative in nature, there are some really cool action scenes. The opening getaway scene may be slow, but has so much suspense in it as The Driver, whose name is never revealed, is a wheelman with a 5 minute window. He starts the clock, listens to the Police radio, and waits for the criminals he is driving for to be done with their heist. One of them gets back while the other is still in the building. This scene causes a ton of suspense. Will he just drive off and have the mission go off? Will the cops arrive? There is also an amazing car chase scene after a critical event in the movie which I thought was awesome.Like the protagonist, the film's actions speak louder than words. There is dialogue, but what is really memorable is the atmosphere, however, the dialogue is also brutally realistic even though I did think it was a bit odd how The Driver and Irene, the love interest, have huge pauses when talking, but that just adds to the mood of their relationship. I think the director described this movie as being Romeo and Juliet in a modern day setting which is true to some part. Even though The Driver is the bad guy and never talks that much, something heart wrenching comes when you see him get sad or get hurt.Drive is a great movie that has care for what it wants to be and executes everything well. It isn't flawless. It does some things that bother me. Sometimes I get the feeling that the film is just TRYING to be too artsy and I just can't stand it when films do that. You know what I mean. The violin/opera music starts to kick in and everything goes in slow motion or super fast. I am probably false accusing the movie and I know a complaint like that is super lame so I wont look down upon the movie for something it never did wrong. I also have a problem that the movie is ultimately missing something. This movie is short. It is a little over an hour and 30 minutes. Some more would have done this movie good and I thought a little more development in the villains would have been nice. However, those are all nitpicks to a great movie.",Drive

554,jorn-truyen,Brilliant and hypnotic,9,27 August 2014,"Nicolas Winding Refn has created a masterpiece, with the 2011 crime drama 'Drive'. Ryan Gosling is a mysterious, unnamed stranger (sound familiar?), who just drives. The plot is certainly, with moments of romance, excitement and horror. Just as 'Mulholland Drive', of which 'Drive' often reminded me, this is a film which touches on all emotions. What's more, the word film doesn't give enough credit to it; it is an experience and it certainly struck a chord with me. If ever there was a movie where 'style over substance' was applicable, it's this one. Again reminiscing 'Mulholland Drive, 'Drive' has such an incredibly beautiful, hypnotic style, which just sucks you into the movie screen. It takes from all genres, and that makes it the more special. The synthpop soundtrack conveys a certain magic and dreaminess, which result in a unique cinematic experience. 'Drive' is a film that teaches you about film, but more importantly, about life, love and suffering. For all its violence and passion, it still doesn't give you a kick in the gut but leaves you enlightened, a feat which perhaps only 'Mulholland Drive' was able to do for me in modern cinema. David Lynch's film is one strange mix of reality and fantasy, but 'Drive' seems to operate on two separate levels, with the plot on one side and the atmosphere on the other. Perhaps, when we discuss the term 'story' 'Drive' is the perfect example.",Drive

557,cedde6,Quite a ride,8,26 January 2013,"I've avoided ""Drive"" for as long as I could. Although most of the reviews I've read or what I've heard from friends were unanimously positive, they often mentioned in passing, almost as an afterthought, its rather graphic violence. For a horror movie buff, I have turned rather squeamish of realistic violence in my mature days and ""Drive""'s brutal reputation had made me quite apprehensive about it. After incessant recommendations from my friend Rory (a movie buff by my own heart), claiming loud and clear that it was possibly one of the best films of 2011 and that I was bound to love it, I eventually surrendered, took a deep breath, sat down and watched it...The Driver (Ryan Gosling), stuntman, mechanic and driver to stickups (not necessarily in that order) gets in serious trouble (read Mafia type of serious trouble) when helping the recently released from prison husband of his beautiful neighbour (Carey Mulligan) with whom he just fell in love.Considering the genre its story belongs to, ""Drive"" defies all expectations. This film has a very broody quality, dreamlike almost, with its languid slow motion sequences and elegant but never demonstrative camera work, the proceedings soaked with a beautifully contemplative soundtrack. Although unusual for that specific genre, the style of this film no longer surprised me when I realised that director Nicolas Winding Refn was also at the helm of 2003 psychological thriller ""Fear X"", equally gorgeous and ruminative in its execution.The oh-so-dreaded violence is indeed rather graphic and all the more startling as it irrupts, usually unannounced, in the otherwise narcotised tone of the film. But the violence is never superfluous as it is a necessary part of the plot nor it is glamorised in any way as it casts away our anti-hero from the only person he truly cares about. It did however make me wince a couple of time so be warned.Ryan Gosling is very good as a man who is all introverted emotions and consequently deeply out of touch with the world around, his calm demeanour belying the brutality he's capable of. By contrast Carey Mulligan brings delicate beauty and restrained suffering to her character and the scenes she and Gosling share are tender and discreetly moving, which is to say without being naive nor syrupy.All in all, ""Drive"" was indeed a hell of a ride. And this is a ride I wouldn't mind taking again.Damn! Rory was right!",Drive
558,harrisonwelshsfs,Show don't tell.,8,13 April 2020,"Following his critical hit 'Bronson', director Nicholas Winding Refn delivers a skilfully crafted crime drama with a lot of style and a killer soundtrack. Ryan Gosling plays Driver, a Hollywood stuntman, mechanic and getaway driver who falls for his neighbour Irene played by Carey Mulligan.The city of L.A has never looked so good on camera thanks to the great collaboration between director Refn and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel. The first visual reference Refn shared with Sigel was the 1964 short film 'Scorpio Rising'. Refn wanted to translate the sensual, sexual nature and the fetishized objectification of the motorcycles in the short film to the visual depiction of the cars in 'Drive'. Emulating the strong directional lighting and saturated colours from 'Scorpio Rising' Sigel noted ""he (Refn) really responded to the vibrancy of the colours. We designed a lot of the sets and costumes to make use of that kind of vibrant palette"". Shooting in real locations and mostly at night Sigel needed a camera that could capture the existing lights of the city and not lose detail in the dark downtown locations. Sigel decided to shoot with the Arri Alexa digital camera. Blown away with the results on test shoots, Sigel said ""the dynamic range was mind boggling"". Allowing him to push the sensor in darker scenes without introducing noise into the blacks. It is this clean image achieved on the Alexa that adds to the films sleek style allowing the cinematographer to capture very high contrast lighting.Drive is often criticized for valuing style over substance, and while its style is the dominant feature of the film that has made it stand out, it works in support of the substance rather than superseding it. This is not a movie about cars but a movie about a man who happens to drive cars, Refn himself said ""I have no interest in cars"", the machine is an extension of Driver, it's precision, power and cool exterior are all attributes shared with the character and the stylish film making only helps to highlight this. The first chase scene of the film is sharp and efficient, edited with a fast and smooth pace. Combine that with the subjective point of view of the scene and it becomes far more valuable as a story telling tool. The shots never leave the inside of the car and the sound design is all interior as if you're in the car with Driver. Creating the feeling of being in the same space as Driver, we understand his environment, we see who he is and why his stoic nature makes him so adept at his work. In a film so centred around its protagonist it is crucial that the filmmaking help us get into his headspace.These opening scenes with Driver are brought to life on screen with a blue themed colour palette and high contrast lighting, opposing this the shots with Irene are dominated by soft light and warm orange tones. Here we see and more importantly feel the two separate worlds that these characters come from and we understand the barrier that is between them. Early in the film even when the two characters are in a shot together the set design and framing draw lines between them. When Driver is in Irene's apartment he is almost exclusively framed with a cool blue background while she stands in front of a deep orange wall. As their relationship develops more orange tones are introduced and we see the life that driver would rather lead, a dream that he is so close to achieving. The blue and orange colour palette is nothing new to modern film making however rarely does it look this good and inform such crucial meaning to the story.Gosling does an excellent job at portraying Driver's calm and collected demeanour with a hint of dark mystery, and an underlying violent nature. When this eventually comes to the forefront there is a tonal shift that may be somewhat jarring for audiences. Although it was built up to with significant suspense the eventual eruption is still very shocking. It is this violent nature that Driver cannot escape, and it is that which keeps him from being able to embrace a new life with Irene. The following action scenes are more aggressive and now Driver is painted as a predatory force. There is a sense that although Driver longs to escape his violent world he also accepts that this is in his nature.The film tells us so much about Driver through his actions and the way his world is presented. With such a focus on visual storytelling and such little dialogue it is easy to see why the film could be seen as style over substance however the images and the style tell us all we need to know. While the film's story is quite simple the violent destiny of Driver, his unknown past, his desire to be the hero and protect both Irene and her child who represent a more innocent and caring world all culminate to give the film an almost storybook quality, like a dark fairy tale. It is a simple story, but one told with such attention to detail and so much control over craft that make it a truly impressive cinematic work.",Drive
559,myloveincruz,Digging everything about it except the soundtrack which is abominable.,7,7 October 2011,"Love how the mystery and suspense subtlety build up but the mood is shredded every time it degenerates into a music video with the worst '80's ballads that had the decency not to be written in the '80's. I can't remember really liking a film only to get continually whip lashed out of it by inserted songs. Well, speaking of the 80's, there was the overrated ""9 1/2 Weeks"" with that song ""You can leave your hat on"" by who cares, suffocate me in cheese wiz. I can only conclude that this music is the result of inbred nepotism. It's so bad I had to stop watching just to write this review. OK, going back and hoping the music director was fired at the point I paused.Can't vote yet but if it goes where it feels it is, might be a 7 or 8, if the music doesn't make me indifferent.",Drive
560,Moviemaniacgirl-1,More than I'd Ever Hoped For,9,25 February 2012,"An unequivocally masterful film that holds on its shoulders the most well rounded ensemble cast, a rising star director, and pure writing genius. ""Drive"" is by far the coolest, most disturbing, retro-iest, out- of-this-world, down-to-earth, heart-breaking, something-to-believe in film I've ever seen. From the strategic and precise composition of every shot to the ambiguity of all that is said or done, each moment drips with intensity and the burden of pointed meaning.Nicolas Winding Refn WILL BE the next tour-de-force name in cinema directing; his indie-quirks juxtaposed with exploitation conventions and oddly subtle and over-the-top choice in scoring, leaves an unsettling reality in its wake. Though it may make audiences squirm uncomfortably in their seats, we are voyeurs in this plot-- silently being wrenched back and forth, and often just watching, like their lives are our sick- documentary. Refn is in command of not only his film, but his audiences' sanity. Paired with Refn, Gosling is at the height of his big-screen brilliance. Where many thought Blue Valentine, or Ides of March fully expressed the range of his talent, ""Drive"" shows us more than simply his talent. First hand viewings of Ryan Gosling's heart and soul and beauty are bought for only $12 at a theater; and believe me, it's worth every penny. The utter magnificence of his performance leaves every viewer with a tender smile, or a soft-spot for redemption. His gritty moments and his vulnerability are equally as wrenching. But it was his sincere chemistry with Carey Mulligan that sold the film. Mulligan, always the delicate flower of her films, is firm without falsity, and truthfully gracious. Her subtle and quiet performance stole several moments of the film, and left the audience wondering what they had just witnessed. The new-found passion of Mulligan as a performer is simply breath-taking. Cranston, Brooks and Perlman-- all the underscores of evil-- sold themselves with poise and ease; their performances complemented the film's intent flawlessly. In fact, the only actress I was disappointed in was Christina Hendricks, who let her body do the acting, and left her face almost plastic at several points in the adventurous plot. As successful as the faux-80's, name-dropping, subtly-elegant screenplay was the original score by Cliff Martinez (inspired by '80s- style synth pop) was almost better. If this score doesn't find its way into your head on repeat, then nothing will. All in all, the film can attribute much of its success to the minimalist dialogue, and the packed-script. Each moment was written to fall off the screen and stomp on the audience. Colors and cars and women and blood. Not a moment was for show, and each word was delicately chosen to the full extent of its meaning. I can hardly imagine this having ever been a novel-- no words could capture what happened between the lines, and in the lead's eyes. Overall, a must-see-- A MUST-see. If you haven't seen you are not a movie-fan or even appreciator. You must-see this film.",Drive
561,Paranoyia,"Enough with all the puns, this movie is only half as good as everybody says.",5,30 September 2011,"""Drive"" is a movie with lots of potential, akin to, say, ""Stay"". Both movies have brilliant cinematography and actually a bit of thought to them as well. Yet both are very weak in terms of story, ""Stay"" more so than ""Drive"", the last one being only marginally better in this department.I am honestly baffled by the almost universal praise this movie has gotten as of late. Sure it's a piece of art, once again very close to ""Stay"". It's very moody, again like the aforementioned film. ""Stay"", however, has only a very moderate score of ~7/10 here and 41/100 on metacritic, whilst ""Drive"" enjoys a 8.5 and 79 respectably.Now, tell me, why is that? Both movies are almost identical. Alright, I shall admit: ""Drive"" has some very intense scenes, but on the other hand there are scenes upon scenes where nothing happens, nothing.Ryan Gosling plays essentially the same character he had been playing for years now. It seems like Keanu Reeves finally met his match in a nil-emotion contest. I can't say he wasn't a good cast, however. He's very creepy and intimidating at times. So I guess a theorem about a clock being right twice a day worked here after all.The storyline is very predictable and banal, apart from one small detail I couldn't see a mile away.I said earlier that it was a kind of an opportunity missed. Apart from the first ten minutes, some action scenes and some occasionally intense interplays between the characters, this movie is really not that interesting.Movie directors should realize that movies are story foremost and art second. Films are not poetry, films are not paintings. Cinema is close to literature in this regard: narrative is everything. Sadly enough Nicolas Winding Refn couldn't see that. I can recommend it, for the atmosphere, but it could've... no, scrap that: it should have been so much more.",Drive
562,eforest77,Amazing.,8,19 July 2012,"Drive is one of the best films I've ever seen in my life. A lot of times, I call movies...well, movies. I'd hate to sound pretentious, but Drive really deserves to be called a ""film"". Why, you my ask?Because it's insanely good, that's why.I think this film very much benefited from not being complicated - at its core, it's a very simple (although EXTREMELY violent, if you don't like violence in your movies, you're probably gonna be freaked out) story. Our Driver (played by the fantastic Ryan Gosling), does getaway driving for criminals and is also a stunt driver during the day. He meets Irene (played by Carey Mulligan, who did a fantastic job) and her kid, and a love story begins. However, there are...complications.This film definitely trades in quantity (in this case, story lines), for definite and total quality. The soundtrack of this movie is just fantastic. It's very retro, which gives this film a very 80s vibe. The cinematography is just absolutely gorgeous. Every single shot was perfectly framed. The views of the city were stunning, and the shots of Ryan Gosling just driving around L.A. Something this film did that was very, very well was the different set pieces. It really paid attention to the character's personalities. Driver's apartment is very sparse, and it doesn't look very lived in at all. Irene's apartment is full of life, with lots of paintings and little details. The movie has very little dialogue, but I was just so entranced by it. It felt very natural - nobody ever said anything very witty. There were no one-liners. The dialogue felt very real.The action scenes are quick and brutal, which is something I appreciated. The director didn't make any of them go on for any longer than they needed to - nothing seemed very ""this is a movie, we need to entertain our viewers with violence"" about it. It was violent because it was needed for the story.Overall, I definitely recommend Drive. It's great.",Drive
563,dayXexists,"Drive is quiet, tense, and extremely violent. In another word- fantastic.",10,22 September 2011,"Ahhh. I have to let this simmer for a little while but I simply loved this film. Refn made a movie that was high on style and beautifully shot, the way the colors and lighting complemented each other, it's not something I usually notice when watching a movie but there were some seriously nice photography in this film. I loved the score- it was musical and pretty unique and for me it helped take the film to another level- it coddles the viewer and makes you feel secure before the story turns around and b**slaps you right in the face. The way the film transitioned from quiet love story and self reflection to extremely violent crime heist movie, and back again, was seamless and pretty shocking. I was so not expecting any Tarantino-esque violence and then all of a sudden I'm asking myself ""Did I just witness Ryan Gosling 'out-curb-stomp' Ed Norton?"". Speaking of, Gosling continues to establish himself as an excellent actor and held your attention without saying much. Loved the cameo from Christina Hendricks, too. But what a great effort overall and has shot right into one of my favorite movies of the year.",Drive
564,radoii_87,Lack of control...,8,5 February 2014,"Modern film noir is about control, more specifically, the lack of control. The characters are often emerged in a world where they do not seem to have control over their fate. Most of the time, they live in a ""corrupt"" world where twisted constructs or demented minds pull the strings(e.g. east coast mob, Hollywood). Those ""villains"", instead of being completely revealed and described, are only hinted throughout the story. Yet, the focus is indirectly on them because of how they affect the characters. To emphasize this, the writers often look only at a snapshot of the characters' lives and reduce the dialogue to a minimum (e.g. Ryan Gosling's character is not given a name or a past that can potentially explain some of his actions). ""Drive"" successfully touches on most of the typical characteristics of the genre. However, a relatively new aspect is built in as well. Carey's character is not a part of the ""world"", she is an outsider, thus, pure. She drives the change at the ""end"" when the driver leaves the scene and only the stuntman remains. The fact that the narrative is not sequential hints that the end result is outside of our control. In the ""outer reality"", we are the subjects and the writer is the puppet master.The story is delivered well here. The movie engages and works because of a young talented crew that feeds of each other and trusts each other.4/5 - Worth a watch",Drive

It did remind me of the film Leon a bit at first. That feel. Images were stunning also combined with the main actor who is very good. But in the second half it looses that and becomes almost like a B film. It follows a plot not unfamiliar and leaves other stuff unanswered, that's when you loose interest. Still wouldn't have wanted to miss the first half, too bad about the second half though. That's all I can say. Nice try but didn't follow trough and in the end a sour taste left.",Drive
566,Shnorg2342,Drive- A Beautifully Dark Film,10,27 November 2019,"Drive is a 2011 slow burn action thriller by director Nicolas Winding Refn. It stars Ryan Gosling as a mysterious stuntman-by-day getaway driver-by-night. It is easily my favorite movie that I've seen from the 2010's. That being said, I'm a sucker for pretty lights, coolness, and character driven thrillers. It's worth noting that the name of Ryan Gosling's character is never mentioned, so for the remainder of this review I will refer to him as Driver. DO NOT READ FURTHER THAN THIS BEFORE SEEING THE MOVIE. The story revolves around Driver, his kind neighbor how he falls in love with, her kid, and her husband who gets released from jail part way through the movie. The husband is forced to do one last job for his old bosses in order to get out for good. If he doesn't they'll kill his wife and kid. Driver decides to offer his services to ensure the woman he loves, and her child's safety. The heist goes wrong and the husband is killed before he can get to the getaway car, but his partner survives, holding a bag containing a million dollars. They were only supposed to end up with forty thousand. After a fantastic chase scene, Driver and the partner arrive at a motel room, where he interrogates her. It is revealed that she was in on the plan to steal the million and make sure the husband ends up dead. As soon as she reveals this, hit men show up to take out her and Driver, and they succeed in killing her before Driver brutally and skillfully kills them. This makes for a cool action scene, but it's a sad moment for the character. Before now, even when he was regularly being a getaway driver, he seemed as if he regretted his decisions to break the law. He has now killed two men, and had an active (even if inadvertent) part in the deaths of two others. He was just trying to protect the woman he loves, and act fatherly for her little boy, and it's caused so much death. But the violence is far from over, and Driver knows it. These will not be the last two hit men that come after him or the neighbor. He decides to keep what he's done a secret from the neighbor until it's absolutely necessary that she knows. Driver schedules to return the money, because it's only caused him pain, and he wants the pain to stop. Regardless of this, they still send another hitman after him and the neighbor. Driver if standing in the elevator with her, when he notices the other man in the elevator is hiding a gun in his jacket. Realizing what he must do, and who he must do it in front of, he gives the neighbor one last kiss. He knows that this moment will be the last time she will ever admire him, and that he will have to give that up to protect her. After the kiss, the hitman attempts to make his move, but Driver is ready for it. He kills him, brutally smashing his head in with his foot out of anger. The neighbor is horrified, and Driver gives her a look that's a strange mix of apologetic, regretful, and thankful. He has ensured her and her child's safety, but at a great cost. The movie ends with an extremely tense scene. Driver is discussing how he wants to return the money with the money's owner at a restaurant. This seems happy, until the scene starts to become intercut with the direct aftermath. Driver hands him the money and is stabbed in the stomach. Driver then stabs him in the neck, killing him. He leaves the money on the ground next to his cold body, and drives off, injured. It ends with a somber song playing over Driver cruising into the night. Drive is a fantastic movie that perfectly balances tragedy, thrills, and coolness, three things that are very hard to simultaneously pull off well. Refn's direction and lighting are perfect in compliment to Gosling's touching performance. Drive is a perfectly dark and beautiful film. 10/10.",Drive
567,moneyboy,"Solid, entertaining flick, but not the hyped masterpiece others portray",7,5 October 2011,"Fairly solid popcorn flick, though there seems to be some hype over substance.Nice looking film that's well shot, but felt like I had seen it all before. Soundtrack seemed to be all over the place and stylistically it seemed a little mish-mash at times, i.e 80's Miami Vice/Scar Face meets 70's film-noir, which creates a kind of weird modern/retro look and feel to the film. Pacing was a little off for the first 30 minutes of the film.I kept on thinking back to Gosling's performance in Lars and the Real Girl (those awkward, long silences). Great to see Nemo's dad as a psychopath. Solid, workman-like performances by most of the cast, though Mulligan seems to be putting in the same goofy, doe-eyed performances of late(Never let me Go, Wall Street 2, etc) Enjoyable, but I think some of the hype/talk has made this film something that it isn't.You can certainly do a lot worse for 90 minutes.7 - 7.5/10",Drive
568,MaccyXpert,Gosling doesn't even need words to get the job done,9,24 November 2017,"Even though Gosling (his character is unnamed) does not have a lot of dialogue, his facial expressions and body language do the work for him. Even when his accent starts to show when he speaks louder, it's very Californian. His typically stone-cold face contrasts with his cool smiles when he visits Irene and Benicio (and looks like he feels at home). He acts very professionally and strictly during his criminal job, showing how he ultimately has control over his clients. His determination and anger in the latter half of the film is evident and scary, especially with 2 threats he gives to different people. In both of those scenes, you can tell he's clearly going all in.Irene is sort of his interest and thankfully the relationship does not get awkward. They keep it moderate for a guy who doesn't show a lot of sentimentality. Gosling's chemistry with the kid, Benicio, is almost big-brother-like, where Gosling helps him out of the hole he's unknowingly in. Walter White plays Gosling's manager, who imagines Gosling as an asset to get money from the mobsters Bernie and Nino. Ron, I think, suits the always-angry type crime boss, only giving a damn about his business and reputation.The car chase scene is also slick, with Gosling keeping his cool (while his passenger swears and acts like a wuss), dodging civilians and performing a brilliant finishing move (FATALITY). The music is just brilliant - all of the tunes they use fit the situation so well, from one describing Gosling's help in Irene's life to an Inception-like tune when he pulls out a hammer (can't tell you when) to keeping it steady while adding to the mood of so many situations. The only things I would criticise are the unnecessarily graphic violence (WAY too much blood) and the strip club scene where no attempts are made to cover anything up.",Drive

The movie plunges into a daytime hybernation where everyone's either slurring, yelling, or whispering what the scripts want them to, its really a disappointment because I thought the opening sequence would define the movie, so my advice is watch the chase scene, and just imagine what the movie could've been",Drive

The plot was entirely and painfully clichéd. I can't really say the acting was bad, because nothing was asked or expected of the actors, just clichés. I'm trying to think of one scene that someone could point to and say ""that's a truly original scene, I haven't seen that before..."" OK, done thinking, there is no such scene.

573,mart-burton,David Lynch meets Quentin Tarantino - oh yes,8,28 November 2011,"David Lynch meets Quentin Tarantino. Just saw Drive tonight at our local cinema. Big screen is the best place to see this movie. Wide aerial shots of LA interspersed with street scenes, including freeway bridges. LA at night from the air always provides possibilities, but that moment a tad cheapened with the credit insert Nicholas trying-to-save-money? However, the nouveau-to-me director Nicholas Winding Refn shows action with the style of Hitchcock. The story starts with an initial getaway car drive - brief stunt drive - mechanic day job - as Ryan Gosling shows us his daily working life. Ryan strongly plays the lead, reminiscent of Robert Redford's understated strength as Sundance. Actions speak louder than words. It is satisfying to be able to get involved in a movie without having to put up with token dialog. Hossein Amini moves the screenplay forward without unnecessary dialog which is rare these days, and this movie shines a torch into a new future. I hope. Some of the unnecessary swearing could have been lost. But then the undercurrent love story hooks us in with slow motion soundtrack a la David Lynch of Twin Peaks. Things get difficult, and uber Tarantino violent. Very violent (warning). Ryan's few extra stomps in the elevator and no subsequent reaction don't gel. And yes I have some minor niggles with the exec producers having to show those companies that backed the film, such as Dick Smith Electronics, since we saw it was a uniden device that was used to listen to police comms (really?), with a good shot of the Aon-branded LA building, fading on Wells Fargo (oh well okay then), cinematog smooth by Newton Sigel. Not for all the ladies - as strong violence. But for the thinking man – strong, silent type, tentative lady concern, and seeking fairness, it's worth watching as it introduces slow-mo and Ryan-Clint into the genre.",Drive

The dialogues are well written and almost every character gives the justice to their roles. Some violent scenes may not spoil the pace of the film and you will never feel, you are getting bored.

576,Unbilled_Role,"""Drive"" - A Riveting and Compelling Ride",7,11 September 2011,"Drive is a compelling film. The casting was spot-on. Gosling has presented us with a complex and strange character. He moves with stealth and a determined focus that is highly effective. I appreciated the fact that certain scenes contained sparse text. The chemistry between his character (""Driver"") and Irene was palpable, without resorting to the maudlin. There was a lovely contrast between Driver, Irene (sensitively performed by Carey Mulligan), and her endearing son. Newton Thomas Sigel and his team must be applauded for the cinematography. It was very finely rendered, with deep, rich shadows and subtle bits of light. In my estimation, the lighting in this film stands out as a true character, all its own.Beth Mickle, who was the Production Designer, also did a stellar job. The interiors of apartment rooms had a genuine vibe to them, and her palette choice was wonderful.So, why only 7 stars? A handful of the songs were pumped up in volume, unnecessarily. This not only defeats the purpose of the song, but it is downright pushy to the audience. Don't get me wrong, I do not mind loud music, if effective. But for these songs with their redundant lyrics, I found it distracting. Another bone of contention: some of the lines for the Albert Brooks character bordered on being cornball and unconvincing. Although he seemed to do his best on delivery, I found that several scenes were diffused in tension, because of the text. I trust that this was not the intention of either the director or the screenwriter. Lastly, there were lovely character studies by Bryan Cranston and Christina Hendricks, but they both should have been given more screen time, to flesh out their motivations and nuances.",Drive

Since its supposedly a remake of the 70's movie Driver I watched that one too and have to say that although there are similarities its a total different movie.Its not the right movie for people who expect action throughout, expect long lasting words with no meaning in the end, but its a movie for people who can empathize with the characters, feel and suffer with them surrounded by a perfect soundtrack.The only ""negative"" aspect I can think of, why the heck does it take so long to come out as DVD...I saw it 5times already and its becoming expensive! ;-) Anyhow, conclusion: PERFECT MOVIE!

This film is amazing but so many people just don't get it. They expect a Fast&Furious movie because it is called Drive. They don't understand the character and the fact that he is so quiet all the time is part of the mystery. Instead they call this bad acting and directing flaws.I recommend this movie but only to those who are prepared to keep and open mind.If you expect a normal action movie with explosion and a lot of car chases then Drive is not for you.

When this was first arriving on our screens it had an amazing action packed trailer and I thought this would be a good film too watch.The phrase that comes to mind is more style than substance, usually this is a bad term for a film but in this case the style is so powerful this film pulses through you. For instance a fight scene towards the end is filmed just looking at the shadows of the two men, this is evident of the effort of the makers to make this more than a film. Honestly every shot is brilliant with fantastic use of light and each scene drips with gorgeous cinematography and the score is the best I've heard this year. Also the tension developed in these magnificently portrayed scenes is very good and keeps you on edge and makes you feel the characters as there looking out at you.The story is not bad though and holds the film well to stop it from curving too far into an art form. The writer has put a few smart lines in it as well to keep things fresh.I must say though my mother would not like this film as it has several overly violent scenes which I originally dismissed as being pointlessly too gory but actually there quite stylish in a ""kill bill"" sort of way.Overall with a small budget and some not bad acting added to some amazing cinematography, my words cannot describe, they have made a fantastic film.",Drive
580,cookiechip_07,Go for a ride!,9,3 October 2011,"On the surface this is an action-drama, heist-gone-wrong film. Beneath the surface in the night time of down town LA, we meet a driver. The scene opens with a man (Ryan Gosling) dictating his terms over the phone with a calm assured tone and we can gather from this he's a no-nonsense, no questions asked type of guy. He, is a getaway driver. He is highly intelligent in his field and in constant control of his emotions even when under pressure. By day, we see the protagonist again driving a car but this time as a Hollywood stunt driver and this is all we really get know about our lead. No name, no family, no explanation of why, where, when and how he is what he is; he's just a driver who becomes an enigma with the more we learn about others and the less we learn about him. The film is a slow burn. By this I don't mean it takes a while to get good, i mean that the pace is not rushed, there is the constant intense heat throughout, ensuring that the finished article is cooked to its fullest. This, is Drive. By the time the end comes you will no doubt say wow. Nicolas Winding Refn has topped his game with this picture and it's the recipe of Hossein Amini adapted screen play, the cinematography and a superb lead actor which produces a beautiful meal for the audience to enjoy. When The Driver finally rests he goes home to an apartment block where he instantly catches the eye of his neighbour, the beautifully innocent Irene (Carey Mulligan). They connect, and after helping Irene with her car, it's her young son who wants to bond with our usually impassive lead only this time some emotions are displayed as he takes a shine to the boy. Unfortunately after a week, her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) is released from prison and rather than being violent towards a man who has been helping his wife, he weighs up The Driver and quickly befriends his new neighbour. Although Standard is out of prison he is not out of debt and when our protagonist spots him beaten up, his deep feelings for the family take over he agrees to help in a £1 million heist by being the man behind the wheel!To describe any more would ruin the movie, but the rest of the cast are all important. Bryan Cranston plays a surrogate father type or is the batteries of our Driver, if you will. Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks are your day time 'friends', night time gang members. Carey has a strong on screen connection with Ryan; however this is Ryan Goslings film. He embodies everything great about this movie. He is always cool, he picks roles that are challenging so he can produce his best and more importantly becomes the role rather then acts the role. If he wasn't already a wanted man, he is now. What's great is the film feels real, real time, real characters and no CGI in sight. The cinematography plays with lighting, initiating moods and emotions with panoramic shots while the mise en scene provides a 1980s atmosphere filled with 80's style music within a gloomy LA.The real kudos of this film lies with Director Nicolas Winding Refn. He has created an elegant, stylish movie with deep emotion which is subtly shown. He achieves this by utilising specific camera angles which speak volumes so the actors can say nothing and the scenes be incredibly powerful. Images and relationships that are transcendent, it's a film that gives and deserves respect. Drive may not gather huge main stream success but it will be a cult classic.(my ratings are based on 6 average, 7 good, 8 v.good, 9 superb, 10 epic)",Drive
581,felix991,This movie had some good parts but...... It Sucked,4,28 January 2020,I saw the trailer for this movie years ago when it came out and knew from the trailer it would suck so I did not bother to watch it however every time I come across a list of movies to watch (the must see ones) I see raves about how good it it is. Or at least the rating are. So tonight I gave it a chanceThis movie had some good parts and if they would have made the whole movie that way it would have been a 8-10 star but this overall is a stupid dumb ass movie. Read every negative review and that is the truth about this movie.I am 58 and have watch thousands of movies and even when I don't care for a movie I don't go out of my way to give it a bad review if it was filmed well or any review at all. because to each his own. I didn't like it you did. next...But whoever is pushing the 10.0 ratings on this movie is either being paid off or it's a studio scam giving all the free tickets and candy to write something nice.Do not waste you time watching this ridiculous waste of a movie and instead watch something like Baby Driver which actually was a good movie.,Drive
582,bobdobbs888,"Film school teaches how to make parts of films, I guess...",7,7 June 2012,"Delicious disappointment—like when I make deep-fried calamari and the breading slides off sloppily, but is still very edible in a way. And the opening of Drive is so cool, too. (Cannes gave best director). -----–It certainly isn't ""Vanishing Point"" with Barry Newman driving to Heaven, driving to salvation in the '70's.------A lot of nice pieces of a movie but no vision to ground it and bless it with spirit so it can 'live on', like the great memorables. Actually, hearing the director's interview, it seems his vision had no way of translating to a grounded video. His ideas sound coherent and euro (it's another invasion), but he has no grammar skills or crafts to make it a movie. A tone poem recited with chamber music live on stage might have been an exciting night in Paris or Stockholm, but it can't find it's way to feature non-experimental video. To translate requires cats who can really hold a vision between their teeth while creating new and newish movie techniques all the while fending off the interlopers in HollyBollywood.-------Movies like this make me want to be a script doctor like Robert Towne; it would be sooo easy. This needed more of any and less of so many. The opening theme ends in ten minutes replaced by another cool concept (having the mob finance his pro racing career), only to be replaced several more times. Only one more encore of the opening, otherwise we have about five cool movies. The opening was so good I can't let it go. It's also the ad presentation for this flick. So much could have been done developing and evolving this idea of a pro getaway driver who monitors the police radio and has an asberger-ian memory of the enormity of LA's streets and police procedure. It felt partially like a video game, 'Matrix' style— absolutely the coolest; this could have been an iconic cult favorite, like the great ones. Ryan Gosling is the new Paul Newman/Brad Pitt. Add a little gameboy-and/or- spiritual philosophy and who knows how high this could have reached. Unlike all the quality long-form on cable TV, this 2 hr could have been an LA bullet train-to- the-front-brain. But, alas, actually falls to a failed indy style high voltage mess.--—--Logically it connects, but emotionally it disconnects at every turn. It can't ground and be continuous. The continuity would build whatever you want to build and make all subsequent moments (let alone scenes) count and deepen. This is the foundation of melodrama which IS modern films, even comedies. The best thrillers compound all this, making the thing explode! ('...dancing' to the tick of a clock timer)----—So you have a fine moment that is allowed to evaporate and actually recede because it isn't allowed to touch the lingua franca, the syntax that IS a feature entertainment. No syntax is created. There is no 'time code', if you will, to monitor and act as referent to the cascading of activity. Usually this is done with a cementing 'quiet' sub-scene, or something that reiterates/adds somehow what's gone on recently. Compare to ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"" by Sydney Lumet—it's a 'network' of pre and post referring that hones this into a sword of intensity. Drive had no chance of any of this once they introduced so many premises and didn't develop any. The internal narrative Winding Refn had in his head just didn't get over to the style gestalt that is a film. Have I reiterated enough to make the point?-------—I also don't understand why these indy oriented guys don't bring in 20-30 semi-extras to fill in all the spaces of a film, you know, like in LIFE. Wouldn't have to pay 'em much.-------–This could have been a Vanishing Point of the new era leading to so many roads cyber/cyborgian. Well, Oscar Isaac in a supporting role is someone to keep an eye on. The rest of the 6 or so cast were all very good actors/presences but actually contributed to the vision migration. Drive would be great to study in film school, or for all the new have-cameras have-Final Cut Pros out there never to be in a school for film.",Drive
583,argo0403,The Most Must See Movie,10,17 July 2013,"If someone asks me ""What are the movies I have to watch?"", with no doubt and definitely I recommend this, Drive. This is a masterpiece which fights for 2nd or 1st place in the films I've ever watched.This is a crime movie. Gosling acts a man called Driver who is in daytime a stuntman and in night a driver preparing a getaway for criminals. He meets Irene,a young woman and a neighbor, and as the relationship with her becomes deeper, he gradually involves in a big trouble. With  its visually and violently beautiful directions,the atmosphere of this movie becomes unutterably brilliant. That's why I do love this movie. From beginning to end everything is cool. Music is marvelous. All songs used in this movie aren't loud but quiet and softly make a moving impression. For the first time,I bought a soundtrack involuntarily. Especially, I'm fond of ""A Real Hero"".Camera-work is skillful.  The scene of city from the night sky is a good example. Tone mainly using orange and picture using light and shade are admirably beautiful.There're many violent scenes. Some people say it's too much but for me, it's not. They're stylish and  gap between quiet atmosphere of this movie fascinates me.Most of all, actors are magnificent. Among other things Gosling's performance is perfect. I'm  wondering why didn't be nominated for Oscar. He doesn't have much lines but  his face deliberates feelings like anger or sadness. I am amazed by this. Through this movie, I became a big fan of him. I went to watch ""A Gangster Squad"" and ""The Place Beyond the Pines"", which both of them are good movies.Other actors are also excellent. Perlman and Brooks's way of acting villains are great. And Isacs's character  he's a bad guy and  I don't know why but I can't dislike him. I think perhaps it's because of his ability of acting. Cranston's atmosphere which is attractive and elegant is exquisite. For example, the scene he introduce driver to Irene is one of my favorite scenes. What should not be forgotten is Mulligan's acting as men want to protect her. I think it's the story of angry man. Usually driver is taciturn and lonely but after meeting Irene, he starts to change and decides to fight for her and Benicia's happiness.I like the scene driver drives with them while the sun is setting in. ""A Real Hero"" the song I said before is playing in this scene. Beautiful. I also like the scene in the elevator driver kisses Irene and beats a pawn.Most of all,last scene is stunning. After watching, lingering sensation came up and I felt goosebumps break out and couldn't do anything for a while. Impressed by image of driver, I almost moved to tears. This movie tells me about protecting loving person.Brutal but beautiful. Violent but quiet. Don't miss this outstanding crime movie!",Drive
584,mjharrison247,disappointed,6,23 January 2015,"I had heard a lot of great things about this movie and was looking forward to watching it but was sadly disappointed.Although a little dark and of a similar style to Oscar winning million dollar baby,this film was a little slow and lacked any real tension. Perhaps it could have contained a little more action and the action that it did contain was a little ultra violent for my liking. Maybe I'm a bigger fan of Hollywood than I like to admit. This said it makes it a perfect candidate for Hollywoods biggest accolade,the Oscar.Its hard to judge the acting when there is not enough action or dialogue. Overall,there was some good acting with some good supporting roles but perhaps even too Hollywood for Hollywood. Even the biggest gosling fans might find this one disappointing.",Drive
585,Isaaclk_,Underrated,9,8 February 2021,"I have barely heard or seen this film being talked about before, and it seems as if it went under the radar, which i find absurd. The directing, photography, cinematography, acting and soundtrack of this movie is perfect. The story is very good too but it seemed to lack any depth and i would have enjoyed a further 20 or so minutes of film to allow a better understanding of some of the characters and give them a bit more context. In a way Drive gives me impressions of a modern day True Romance - the cars, the city, the romance tied in crime, the violence, and the guy unexpectantly ending up with money he doesn't want on his hands. I love that film too. Definitely worth a watch",Drive

589,silentman01,The Rise of Refn and Gosling,9,19 January 2012,"""Drive"" is a story about a young man with no name who works as a stuntman during the day and works as a getaway driver, at times, during the night. A man with no attachments to his past, he wandered through his days unnoticed with a determination to stay so. All of this changes when he meets Irene creating a shift in his priorities leading to situations and circumstances he would never before involve himself in. We know nothing about his past and the motives of his present are as mysterious. The perfect ""Anti-Hero"", he hits a strange balance of being a combination of a Western Hero (personified by Gary Cooper, Clint Eastwood) with a darkness close to that of Henry Fonda's ""Frank"" in ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh in ""No Country For Old Men"". Nicholas Winding Refn directs this picture and it really shows how far he has come as a film-maker. His use of colours are brilliant as he shifts through darkness and light with an artistic manipulation that contributed to the great cinematography which was essential to create the varying moods. It was predominantly eerie and helped the transitions smoothly leaving a touch of suspense all the way through it's end. The screenplay, written by Hossein Amini, is sufficient in it's brevity adding to the enigma, which was the Driver, enhancing the mystery to his motives by sufficiently cloaking who he is. The star of the show, except Refn, was Ryan Gosling who continues to build a reputation as one of the actors to look out for. His evolution, which was slowly in the works, hit a new height with his portrayal as ""Driver"". To be so convincing with such few words and relying only on expressions and mannerisms to be the basis of a great performance is an art which is almost lost today. He is loving, caring, generous and loyal to only a few people but at the same time he is also ruthless, fearless and unflinching in his determination, which sometimes led to ""justified cruelty"" on those who stood in his way. He is never over-the-top, however out of hand a situation might get, thus building a character who had enviable serenity in testing situations. Ryan Gosling will in all likelihood not be nominated for an Oscar for his best performance to date for what was undoubtedly one of the best performances of 2011 (personally this was my favourite). This, I fear, would be the first of many crimes the Academy will undoubtedly pull on this film in the year. Gosling is supported more than capably by a great cast. It includes the rising star Carey Mulligan, the love interest, played her torn character with such simplicity and an under-tone of complexity that bringing out a sense of realism would have been very arduous. But, the talent she has, has helped her to find the balance and give one of the most under-rated performances (along with Gosling's) of the year. There is also the brilliant Bryan Cranston whose evolution is just extraordinary. This character actor tests another variation to provide a great supporting role of a man who with his desperation has lost all his dignity clinging on to the last straw of hope which is Gosling. Cranston played the anti-thesis of Walter White (Breaking Bad), with such guile that you forgot it was Mr. White. For a TV actor that is hard to shake off, ask James Gandolfini. Ron Perlman's screen time was small but his significance to the plot was not and he did justice to the role re-enacting his own persona of the ""bad guy"" he has done so successfully and predominantly in action films.Then, there is the rejuvenated Albert Brooks who gives the performance of his career (and seems the only likely nominee) as mob boss Bernie Ross, who is more like the anti-hero than we would like to admit. A man who is calculating in his ruthlessness and terribly frightening in it's deliverance is the perfect nemesis to the grey hero. They both fight for what they care about and none of them would hesitate to stand up against anyone who would try to destroy what was most important to them.""Drive"" is a must-see for all who want to something different in a year which has been all about recycling and few rare pieces of originality. If you can stomach the violence and the long periods without dialogue then make sure you watch it, otherwise just stay away, it won't be your cup of tea. Let's hope Nick Refn will be able to keep this form for the future",Drive
590,maddiaj,Frustrating! Weird! Boring! Silent! Don't waste your time.,2,13 October 2018,"Have I missed something? 93% on rotten tomatoes. Reviews saying it's the best movie of 2011. What have I missed!
As I was watching oh my god I was getting so frustrated there were just scenes where nobody would talk and when they did there were huge gaps in between! I needed somebody to talk it! This movie is insanely over rated! 
The movie was weird it had a strange vibe throughout it. The characters were impossible to connect with because of the lack of dialogue. The violence was over the top and did not fit the film at all. One minute the driver and Irene are kissing in an elevator and the next the driver is stamping someones head into the ground all in the same scene. I don't understand what genre 'Drive' was going for but in my opinion it ended up being a confused mess. Not good, the only part I enjoyed was the first 5 minutes before the opening credits when I thought the film was gonna be an action packed thriller - boy was I wrong! The rest was so boring the amount of times I was going to turn it off but didn't in hope that it would pick up and get better, well let me tell you it never came it did not get any better. DO NOT WATCH unless you'd like to watch Ryan Gosling not talk for 1hr 30minutes with a couple car chases thrown in with some over the top violence and a shadow knife stab at the end that's basically the movie summed up.

591,Ayay71,Not what i expected,8,26 September 2011,"Let me first tell you that after seeing review saying things like Bullit and car movie of the year, I expected a Driving movie ., But this is not a movie about that instead its a suspenseful journey of a man that just happens to be a driver , a very good driver but that is not what keeps you in your seat, That is the almost crushing atmosphere of tension that hangs over the whole movie and the very brilliant way they manage to capture the leading role, even thou he have about the same amount of lines in the movie as Arnold had in the first terminator.Also the LA around the movie reminds me of Collateral damage a vibrant and alive backdrop but at the same time cold and uncaring. But and this is a big but i can see why some people getting out of this movie is angry or disappointed because many Review makes this movie into something that its not , Sure there is the odd car chase but calling it a new Bullit is like calling a BigMac a salad ..I liked this movie for the somber tone it sets and for not letting it slip away half way through like many other movies.",Drive
592,ewanbryce,"Part Explotation, Part Art House, Part B Movie, A Complete Joy",9,31 December 2019,"I had the pleasure of watching Drive for the first time recently, and I have to say that it's one of the few films that I have seen in a while that I've connected with really deeply.Nicolas Winding Refn serves up a masterstroke in film-craft. The way that he has envisioned the screenplay & transferred that to the screen underpins his skill as a director. His choice of cast (minus Gosling as it was Ryan Gosling that chose Refn to direct Drive) cinematographer & use of the film's soundtrack has helped shape Driver as a modern classic in my humble opinion.One key element of of the film is the use of dialogue, or perhaps more so the lack of it. Ryan Gosling's Driver has very limited lines and yet communicates so much through his non verbal nuances. The tension between Gosling & Carey Mulligan's Irene is pure electric and draws you deeper into the film. Despite this lack of dialogue you find yourself emotionally invested in the relationship between the Driver & Irene.An aspect of Gosling's Driver that I enjoyed was his line about the story of the frog and the scorpion. Much is made of the scorpion motif on Gosling's jacket throughout the film and all becomes clear with that one line.Bryan Cranston's Shannon spends much of the film in pretty much one sided short monologue's with Ryan Gosling's character, all the while conveying a paternal warmth & kindness that draws you to the character.Ron Perlman's nefarious & unpredictable Nino and Albert Brooks' equally grubby yet conflicted Bernie Rose are a joy to watch. It's a shame that both characters weren't given more screen time to develop as more could have been made of them.Christina Hendricks' Blanche also delights in her cheap & sleazy character. I was surprised to read that Refn actually auditioned for the role as he was seeking to ground the part in reality.Visually Drive is nothing short of gorgeous. Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography is stunning, and combined with the film's score I found myself mesmerised & immersed throught the full hour & forty minutes.Part explotation, part art house, part B movie, Drive is a cinematic gem that rejoices in the art of fim.",Drive
593,hairlikebroc,A Neo-Noir Staple,8,8 January 2021,"Drive is a tempered, intentional, and clinical film with short but oh so glorious outburst of rage, not unlike its main character. The main allure of Drive to me is the cinematography's ability to play with light and omitting visibility while retaining key details.

595,Slim_Jack_Rabbit,Running stationary,1,25 October 2011,"Ryan Gosling plays a Hollywood stunt driver who moonlights as an escape car artist for local thugs. He gets involved in the life of his next door neighbor, her kid and the husband who owes money to the mafia boss Gosling's character happens to works for.The film plays out terribly as the murky and meager plot is all over the place and the pacing of the film so off, it just beggars belief. The many scenes just showing Gosling's blood stained clothes are so slow and stretched that you can see the changing of seasons in the background. And every time our hero starts to talk there's a standard 6 seconds delay before he actually starts to mutter his script lines. Pause in a conversation can add drama to the moment, but I shouldn't have to be tearing the hair from my cranium while watching it. Action sequences are few and far between and the story itself is done completely by the numbers; excavating only stereotypical behaviour and gratuitous violence from the flimsily drawn out characters. Think of a Tarantino movie you liked, then strip away the interesting characters, the music, the daring plot and sharp dialog. What is left is good cinematography and an incredibly cool choice of font for the end credits.I'm seriously left dumbfounded as to what prompts people to vote on this miserable excuse for entertainment with more than 6 stars. Perhaps it is the overall quality of films nowadays which seems to be in a hasty decline, rendering people clueless as to what rating to give to a film. But I can safely say that this project is as lifeless as it is artless and I would recommend the 1999 movie Ghost Dog in stead. A movie that shares many parallels with 'Drive' but which is made with far more authenticity, humor and overall class. Not to mention it having an actual silver lining and point to it.30/100",Drive
596,CubeRic9000,Silence never sounded so good,8,24 November 2011,"Drive captivated my senses from beginning to end, and left me overwhelmed by its execution. The satisfaction comes from the detail. Every aspect of the film has been carefully considered.The mood created for the story is superb. It is a dark gritty LA, where criminalisation is undertaken with the utmost professionalism (similar to Heat). Its film noir darkness, Scorcese stylised ultra-violence, and the Michael Mann driving/aerial cityscapes, all pay homage to great genre films of the past. But Drive still retains its own identity. The story is played out with real intensity. The characters all garner the audience's attention, and there is no dull moments or padded scenes, as every interaction, every piece of dialogue, works to propel the story forward, and harness one's interest.The protagonist of the film, Ryan Gosling, is the ultimate anti-hero. You have a real affinity with him, and always sense his power and underlying good nature. Gosling's character uses barely any dialogue, and only opens his mouth when absolutely necessary. His ability to listen intently whilst taking in his surrounds, never feeling the need to speak just for the sake of it, is refreshing, and can't help but be admired. He is slick without the need for style, cool without intention, and dangerous to anyone that challenges his abilities, values, or his simple desire to set things right. He is one of the most appealing film characters in some time, and Gosling's portrayal is exquisite.My favourite part of the film was the sound design. As soon as you hear that first hum of Gosling's car engine from the inside, I was hooked. Eliminating the outside street noise, and focusing solely on the sounds from inside a vehicle, had the ability to personalise the reality of a getaway driver. The hum of the engine, the ticking of the watch, the radio commentary, the nervous fiddling, along with the all important police sirens ever increasing in decibels as they close the distance, yet always slightly muffled by the closed capsule that is a car's interior. Every sound effect is presented subtlety, yet drenched in substance.One particular shotgun blast almost pierces the ears in a very quiet scene, which only helps to magnify the vicious intent of the act. But what also works so well to emphasise the potency of the blast, is the use of silence. As mentioned, this same school of thought is applied to the main protagonist, who finds strength in silence rather than speech. At pinpoint times throughout the film, silence engulfs a scene, and instantaneously adds extra depth. The sound puts you at grips with the story's flow, then the silence almost means one's breathing becomes a part of the soundtrack.The music accompanies the sound design flawlessly, with a mix of vocalised pop structured songs, and a minimal instrumental score. When injected, the vocalised tracks immediately came to the fore (specifically 'Nightcall' and 'A Real Hero'), whilst the original score unassumingly adds its magic to keep you engaged, and most of all, emotionally responsive.Drive is a coming together of all the elements that make a good film, executed thoughtfully. I think each viewer will find something within this film, which makes them reflect and appreciate. If not appreciate, then at least respect, as it truly is a modern day classic, and I believe it will be talked about for years to come.",Drive
597,erin_osullivan,It was talked up by a friend but I still enjoyed it a lot,8,28 December 2011,"When a friend told me about this film she kind of raved about it without going into too much detail about the plot, and from what she told me I thought it sounded really cool. She was saying how it was about a stunt driver who moonlights as a driver for heists, but its not a car movie and its ""really really good"". The last piece of information about it not being a car movie made me happy. So I have now watched it and I did still really like it but it definitely was not what I had expected from my friends fairly vague review of it.The basic plot line is about a stunt driver, with no real history, who gets caught up in a heist gone wrong involving a girl he is into and then he and the people around him are in trouble. Thats the gist of it.Everything I liked about it: 1. The acting performances. Fantastic. Ryan Gosling is a man of little words in this film and it makes the mystery of who he is, how he became so great at driving and his history all the more effective. There are times when we see him nearly crying which shows that he cares about the ones around him but how he can suddenly turn so violently is a shocking aspect to his character and he pulled it off amazingly. The relationship and on-screen chemistry between Gosling and Carey Mulligan is quite stunning. It is focused on staring, mood and emotion rather than dialogue. Bryan Cranston is great as always, and the other actors are all really suited to the characters.2. The music and dramatic tension. It often felt like there was music that was ill fitting but it still worked. Then there was the use of noise to build up tension. Many of the tracks sounded like they were from the 80s and I questioned whether the film was set then until one of the characters said ""I used to do ________ back in the 80s"" (I can't exactly remember what the line was but it answered my question). So it is set in present time.3. I guess what else I liked about this film is that it seemed to have a country Western style, shoot n draw, but with cars. Gosling is a cowboy as are the other gangsters. I think another really interesting and compelling factor that I mentioned previously is that Gosling's character is given no back story, he is who he is in this moment and no one can really know where he has come from and how he got there.I am now going to try to be critical, so the things I didn't like:1. maybe a little too long, or felt too long because a lot of the scenes are filmed in slow motion to intensify tension, so it felt like it dragged a bit. 2. I'm not exactly partial to as much violence as this film had, but I understand why it was included in such a gory way and suited the film. I'm just not a fan of such a lot violence. This is just a personal opinion.I have read a few bad reviews about the film but I'm still glad to see it has an IMDb rating of 8.1 because it definitely deserves it. I guess if you're expecting something like Fast and the Furious or some crappy Vin Diesel garbage you would probably be disappointed but watch the film with old school western's in mind and you may be able to see a modern interpretation of that genre.It is overall a really well executed film, has a storyline that has definitely been done before but has been done in a new and original way and stellar acting performances without being another piece of Hollywood action trash.",Drive

Drive",8,30 September 2011,"THE GOOD - Honestly, this is one of those rare movies where the story is inferior to the overall directing of the picture. I say that because, to me this felt like an ABC story which was highly predictable. But the way the director sets up the pacing and subtle yet great performances from the actors made this a rare gem. So what's the story about? In a nutshell, the Driver, our main character gets attached to a young woman and her son. The woman's baby daddy gets out from jail and has problems from his old ""business partners"". The Driver tries to help them out by going up against a pseudo-mafia whom he had dealings with beforehand. He uses his driving to exact punishment. Okay the driving part is not 100 percent true but that is the sum of the story.THE QUESTIONABLE - To some the slowness and the lack of regular movie dialogue may leave a question mark in some. But I think too many others this is where the ingenuity of the movie comes into play.THE BAD - Perhaps the only bad part I could clearly identify with is that our hero has no backstory yet he drives like no one else and can take on the mafia. Hit men with big guns come to end him yet he can defend himself like James Bond. All we know of our hero's past is that from a young age he knows how to fix cars??? Plus, he crashes cars for Hollywood.WHY – I wanted to give this movie a 7.4 IMDb style but currently partial grading is not allowed. So why do I settle a bit upwards and give this a 8/10 IMDb style or a very high 3 out of 4 stars. It was just a good movie. (Corny joke ahead) Go ahead, take a drive to go watch this movie; you will not be disappointed if you check out ""Drive"".",Drive
600,CharlesCalthrop,"Boring, long, annoying, and too stupid to live",4,19 September 2011,"First the good: Drive is cast with excellent actors. Now for the bad. Based on this picture you would not know that most of the cast could act at all. Gosling's performance makes wooden seem lifelike. This must be due to direction because Gosling has been in several recent pictures and has acted up a storm in all of them. Gosling, Mulligan, Cranston, Brooks, and Hendricks are all interesting, accomplished actors. My question is: how did they get sucked into this horrible picture? Either the script that was shot was different from the script they read, or they had guns pointed at their heads.Every plot element of Drive was so unrealistic that I found it impossible to suspend belief. The characters are equally unbelievable. Less than an hour into the picture I knew how it would end. The only question was whether Gosling's character would survive, but by that point I didn't care. All the characters were too stupid to live. Violence has its place in film, but it is not a substitute for characters, a plot, and a story even when the stupid are getting their just deserts.Nothing in this picture hasn't been well done in other movies. Drive is derivative of Layer Cake, for example. If you want to see what Drive was trying to be, rent Layer Cake.",Drive
601,austinicity,remixed 80's film noir 2.5 edition,9,1 April 2012,"I felt compelled to write a review for this movie, despite using IMDb for nearly 5 years and never registering.This is one of the most unorthodox movies I've seen in a while, especially in holloywood stock.The editing is very surprising. the establishing shot/reshot was unorthodox in reference to to the characters blocking. Instead the cinematography could be compared to a Ken Burns documentary style of slowly zooming in on a frame with a lullaby type contrast. Characters always seem to be blocked in full with each other, none of that using stand-in's to read lines with crap, altho I'm sure they used it, but the point is you don't get that feel. The characters are always in close proximity with each other leading the viewer to follow the action/drama smoothly. Couple that technique with retro-modern 80's synth-laced soundtrack, a setting in a post modern LA underground crime circle, the main characters' retro-throw back scorpion windbreaker jacket; and the time of day always seems to either be night or late afternoon; kinda like a lazy drift feel; it gives you goosebumps in some scenes. I've seen this plot before in other movies and the dialog confuses me. Not that the dialog is not logical, but the emphasis of less is more when comes to words in this movie. A lot of 5-10 sec frames of just facial expressions. To be honest, this movie dialog is prolly less than 25 pages long, yet it does not hinder the story at all and in some cases improves the ambiance of the scenes. All in all, there are a few ""c'mon"" moments when you think thats not how real shady crime deals go down, but this is a very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining movie. I love the flow of it. There will be nice laid back moments and all of a sudden graphic bloody scenes with terrific soundscapes. Quite possibly a sequel as well.",Drive
602,AmandaSage,Refn and Gosling knock it out of the park,10,15 April 2014,"I'm in the midst of a few things tonight, but wanted to stop and write a bit about Drive, because it's so exceptional that I can't not throw down a few words. So I'm aiming for something of a drive-by blog post here, but I'm finding it hard to write only a brief synopsis of why Drive is so amazing; there's a lot to say and appreciate about the movie. Film students, take note! The direction is phenomenal. Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn is the man to blame for that, and he just picked up the Best Director award at the Cannes International Film Festival for his efforts. Refn is known for a slew of films I haven't seen, but all of which seem, upon quick review, to involve at least their fair share of violence and murder. Examples include the Pusher trilogy, Bleeder and Fear X. Drive is no exception. Based on the novella of the same name by James Sallis, Refn's latest flick is about an unnamed Driver (Ryan Gosling) who spends his days as a mechanic and stunt-car driver, his nights as a get-away driver for crooks in the Los Angeles area.Here's where it starts getting hard to merely summarize the fabulous aspects of Drive. But I'm trying Refn frames his scenes and characters exquisitely; he knows exactly how to create and hold tension with the composition and length of the shot, as well as in the arrangement of characters and props (mise-en-scène). He draws brilliant performances from his actors, including Bryan Cranston as Driver's questionable boss, playing very much, and very well, against type. All of this—the amazing acting, cinematography, storytelling, mood-setting—is illustrated in the opening get-away sequence, which offers enough fodder for an entire essay of its own.Sound! The sound is extraordinary in Drive: the recordists and editors did a great job with the ambient sound; the pulsing electronic score hovers in the background like a nagging thought tugging at your memory (but in a good way); and the soundtrack is totally awesome. The disco/techno beats blast out in contrast to the dark, nuanced tone of the story and its characters. As subtle as the film is about character development and backstory, a tune like College's A Real Hero will chime in to tell us straight up that Driver is ""a real hero and a real human being."" Refn seems to have fun playing with contrast and defying expectation. Even the font of the credits clashes with the somber opening scenes; retro pink neon letters are unabashedly slapped over broody, moody shadows.So much to say Cutting ahead to the pièce de résistance. The cast is solid all around. I mentioned Cranston, who is joined by a wonderful group of actors, including Albert Brooks, Ron Perlman and the deeply talented Carey Mulligan as Driver's love interest (though I'd like to see her branch off of the whole ""sweet, ethereal and innocent"" bit sometime soon). But the standout performance comes from the fantastically gifted Gosling. (Whom I would LOVE to feature on KickassCanadians.ca.) I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that Gosling is among the greatest actors of all time, and on top of that he seems to be a profoundly interesting, unique person. His choice of films alone speaks volumes about his character.In Drive, Gosling doesn't talk much; barely at all, in fact. But he communicates plenty with his eyes and body. Refn's film demands a very technically precise performance from Gosling, and he pulls it off brilliantly. More than that, the actor is able to embody a fully realized person in spite of the fact that the script gives us very little to go on by way of who Driver is. We're told almost nothing about the character's past. It's clear from his actions, and the scrap word tossed out here and there, that he's very experienced at what he does. But it isn't until he's called upon to respond with violence that we know just what he's capable of. When he strikes, it's with chilling ease, skill and speed (so that's why there's a scorpion emblem on his jacket). It leaves you wondering: ""Where did he learn to kill like that?"" Whatever his background, it also taught him not to fear love and to follow a code of honour that includes loyalty and integrity. He has a deep well of violence churning within him, and you see him struggle at times with whether to draw from it or leave it be. But on the whole, he seems to have a pretty solid sense of right and wrong. Driver, Irene (Mulligan) and her young son seem to be among the few ""good"" people in Drive, and their scenes together seem to exist on another plane; magical wisps that somehow floated into the rest of Drive and took root. I don't mean to suggest this as a flaw; their scenes come across as stolen moments in time, and again hark back to Refn's apparent fondness for toying with contrast, and preconceptions about genre.Honestly, Gosling's performance, the use of sound, mise-en-scène, direction, genre convention So many aspects of this film could be broken down and analyzed at length. I'll stop here, but suffice it to say that I highly recommend Drive. It's an artful, intelligent, unique, entertaining, gripping movie that deserves the recognition it's getting. One of the best I've seen. Outstanding.",Drive
603,AgentLouisa,"Don't expect an action movie. I did, but I got over it.",9,16 February 2013,"Drive is the kind of film that sits around in my head, gnawing away like a toothache.Probably my favourite film of the last twelve months is Tarantino's Django Unchained. But now I've seen Drive and there the two of them are, opposite sides of the fence: Django snarling and snapping, Drive looking stoical.There's a heist gone wrong, but it's not a heist movie. There's car chases but it's not about the action. It's got a passionate love affair but no sex. The lead character commits criminal acts but he's a hero (and not an anti-hero). There's ultra-violence, but it's not about the blood. There's amazing cars, but they are just, well, good looking props. It's got Wise Guys but it isn't a gangster film.It used all these things to suck me in, tell its story, and then leave me to obsess over everything unsaid.It's pointless comparing this to an action movie like The Transporter, or even the films of Tarantino. Better to view it in the same spirit as Scorsese's Goodfellas, Lynch's Blue Velvet, Noe's Irreversible or even the early 1950s western, Shane. The opening scene is a lesson in how to play out a getaway: no emotional dialogue, no screaming, no panicking, no rants on how the heist went: simply full concentration on losing the police helicopters and squad cars. And I completely believed that Ryan Gosing, cast as the driver, was driving that car.The violence is not there to bask in the blood or to revel in the victim's downfall, it's an intense burst of emotion boiling into a pure expression of anger. It made me look away, in the same way I would if I saw a couple kissing tenderly on the street, or a close up of a person crying over their dead loved one. It told me I needed to watch this, or at least believe in the conviction behind the violence. The professional reviewers talked a lot about a 'nuanced' performance by Gosling. I had to concentrate on every look he made; every small change in expression. And I loved it.And at the heart was a story of love at first sight, the intense yearning for a family, and the lengths a man will go to protect these things - to commit crimes, kill and even give up the girl.And what of the driver - where did he come from? Was he running? Was he trying to be a different person? Did he know how his life would inevitably end? Did it end?I'm so glad Drive left me to answer these questions for myself.",Drive
604,barflyer7,Expecting more,7,24 March 2012,"Having heard and read rave reviews of this film having watched it for myself I have to say that I am a little disappointed.I wont go into the storyline as reading this you should already know it, I will just give my overall opinion taking it into context. The good points in this film first are the acting from Ryan Gosling in the lead role, a very understated performance often with little or no dialogue, he certainly handles the role of a Stunt Driver moonlighting as a Getaway Driver with aplomb. The action scenes are violent and shocking at times and inventive enough to keep them fresh. Carey Mulligan gives a decent enough performance in a fairly subdued role and Ron Perlman has real presence as a crooked bad guy. The storyline itself is solid enough and intriguing and Albert Brooks is really menacing in his role however a few things I felt let this film down badly from what I expected. Firstly despite Goslings performance I found the first hour of the film a little slow with long camera shots of driving and long moments of silence becoming a bit tiresome. After the first hour the film improves with more action but is then let down by what I thought was a really flat ending leaving you with more questions than answers. I was left frustrated as I wanted a clearer vision of what happened next. I felt that Carey Mulligans character could have been used more also.Overall a decent film that could have been better if like me you have high hopes then you may be left disappointed.",Drive

606,bikerc,If I could travel back in time I would advise me not to see it,1,1 October 2011,"Once again critics let me down. I went to this movie after checking out the rottentomatoes reviews, and at around 90+% I thought it's a must see. Well, I was wrong.Pace - kind of slow, it picks up occasionallyRyan - cool, intense (he's always playing intense characters or he's rather playing himself), doesn't speak much, but we can guess there something going on in his head and if he didn't care for Carey's character he could have easily been a psychopath in the league with the bad guys. Good driver though. And once again he loves the girl with same obstinacy that we've seen in the other of his movies.Carey - here I am lost because I am not too sure what was her role besides being cute as a pie (or button) and the object of Ryan's character's affection. Pretty much she didn't have a clue of what's going on. But her face must trigger some deep need to protect feelings in the men around her.Bad guys - One thing that struck me are Ron Perlman's teeth. They are very long! OK, it's irrelevant. Other than that, the usual, nothing new, they are unnecessarily violent (or belligerent how a character put it) , they don't listen to logic, they like to slash people with objects they care about (which they clean and keep in nice boxes).Naked girls - yes, there is a scene full of breast enhanced girls that didn't seem to care a guy was about to get his head smashed with a hammer. But hey, we would expect too much from them. Right? Music - I liked the music, I would give it a 9 or 10Image - pretty nice in some cases.To summarize - I didn't see anything new and unforgettable.

607,nate-204,The Town Meets The Straight Story,2,20 September 2011,"I'm at a loss when I see the general user community rate ""Drive"" with well over an 8 average rating. My summary says it best; this movie was like taking 'The Town' and slowing it down as much as possible making it seem like the 'Straight Story'. There are many scenes where at least 15 seconds (feels like 30) pass without much of any movement on the screen and no dialogue. Two hours of this and you feel like you're watching still photos instead of a real movie. I get the attempt at an artistic angle here, but staring at Ryan Gosling's face for what seemed like 45 minutes of this movie gets old fast. Plus, (spoiler) the random, gruesome murders don't fit the overall slow plodding feel of the movie. What's worse, is the plot seemed like a close sibling/rip-off to 'The Town' but with a worse ending. Actually, the movie ends worse off than it began without much of a point. The 'action' scenes were displayed to try and be intense; but left you thinking there was more that wasn't to be. Ryan Gosling had maybe 40 lines of dialogue and about two expressions, so trying to spin this as 'artistic' is purely euphemistic. Thus, my message to the general user community is - what were you thinking?",Drive
608,emeiserloh,Artistic ambition held back by its source material,6,18 October 2014,"While Nils-Winding Refn clearly has ""artistic ambitions,"" I don't find his films all that interesting in the long run (Bronson being the most compelling of the 4 that I've seen). I certainly wouldn't hold up ""Drive"" as a shining example of narrative cinema. The story and characters are nothing more than sketches that have been utilized countless times before, and the only thing that made the film different, and the slightest bit interesting to me, was the director's cinematic style, which tapped into techniques (including a dash of subtle sensation) that are uncommon to mainstream cinema. Refn prefers minimalist storytelling and slick styling to make superficial associations without providing anything of real substance to sink into or explore, opting instead for the typical Hollywood action pathways. People have called ""the driver"" enigmatic and mysterious, but the truth is, he only seems so because virtually no information is provided about him beyond a few hints, and his strength is only demonstrated in his superhuman ability to out-think and out perform everyone else in battle. The entire movie actually resembled a template for a video game or contemporary action comic book. Just consider what is given import in the film, as well as where, and through what it aspires to take us, moreover how it ends up: Neither story nor character development stray very far from the basic plot, and there is a long, violent conclusion (actually a series of violent incidents, one after another, that end up with nobody left). If you want to see a movie with some similarities that actually develops an authentic story and character, with a real sense of place, try Bullhead, from Belgium. In fact, I would argue that the most interesting cinema these days is not being made in English, though it is only seen and appreciated by tiny minority. ...Drive does work in several ways: 1) because Refn creates his own brand of stylish cinema crossing in elements of mainstream cinema, combining ""realism"" and the ""potboiler"" with touches of Bergman, using an artsy technique that mixes long takes and silence with quick edits, sound, and fetishist action/violence in a way that wows the mainstream movie goer who has never seen anything like it, much less in the context of a genre film. 2) as a post modern, deconstructionist take on the genre film, a la Jarmush (think Ghost Dog, or the more deconstructionist Limits Of Control, which I hated), Cronenberg (Eastern Promises and History Of Violence), even early Tarantino and the later-day Scorsese. References to films like Mann's, Thief, are spot on, but there are also numerous references to Peckinpah (and Steve McQueen) in particular (The Getaway), as well as to Sergio Leone, which not only give it support, but make its contemporary take/styling more than just derivative. I wonder what Godard would think of it? After all, Breathless was the first deconstructed ""cool, hard guy"" film to be made, more than 50 years ago. Problem is, there was not one thing about Drive that I have not already seen dozens of times in American movies, beginning with the method-actor characterizations of the 50's and 60's (Brando comes first to mind, but carries right on down through Clint Eastwood, and just about every Hollywood action anti-hero). The driver with no name, who rarely speaks: A toothpick in his mouth tough guy (with a sensitive soul) who looks like a GQ model, and whose only expression other than stone face is a glib smile that's supposed to mean everything he doesn't express... I already said that Gosling borrows a lot from McQueen, but he also uses James Dean and the young Mickey Rourke, who, of course tapped the young Brando. Problem is, with each reincarnation of this archetype the meaning gets diluted until it becomes only a posture and nothing more, effective only in how it conjures up these other actors and their movies, while contributing nothing to the archetype it is alluding to. Driver actually has no character of his own, only mannerisms, and there is nothing substantial about the film. It's only interesting in terms of all the movies and characters it references from Hollywood past, trimmed down and reliant upon familiar archetypes and stories, done up with a contemporary styling that blends art house cinema and Hollywood. At times Refn's postmodern, playful stew works wonders, but there are also times when it backfires completely, such as when the Driver boards the elevator and kisses the object of his courtly love (who's nothing more than the object of a fairytale knight's devotion) for the first time before pushing her aside and not only murdering the hit man standing next to him but stomping him repeatedly as we hear his bones crack. How romantic! Cut to the loving, face of his Madonna as she backs safely into the garage. Bottom line is that there was not enough ""new material"" to really captivate me much less enrich the bare-bones' story, and it ended up being not much different from all of the other movies built around dysfunctional males who can only find their way (and know how to survive) as warriors, by means of repeated acts of violence against whatever ""bad guys"" are threatening them, or some innocent member of society. The only thing I really wondered about in Drive is what made Driver the way he was, or why everyone in the movie had to die except for the girl? Talk about self-defeating.... Half way into the film (once I fully understood what the director was doing) I could pretty much intuit everything that was going to happen scene by scene, moreover how it would be portrayed. For me, despite a few moments of genuine brilliance, this film was ultimately not very satisfying, even somewhat pretentious.",Drive

There is quite a lot of attention to his facial expressions.The second half, however, is quite different.

If you love cars, especially with better drivers on it, very interesting drivers i might add, what's the wait for you reading this. If you tend for films that draws emotion through hypnotic score and brutally honest dialogue, go watch this now. And lastly if you can handle violence and love your suspense palpable yet still thrills you unexpected stop right here, call your local cinema and tell them you want a secured seat. For this film, Nicolas Winding Refn proves himself to be a wonder - craftsman with utter taste. Putting artistic perfection on such a commercially appealing hence relatively known plot.Speechless for Ryan Gosling as he's equally and effectively quiet in this film. He's mostly silent, but on his face is the summary of the scene.Drive didn't create much talk til' later half of this year but I'm certain it'll in the coming days after its wide release.It has reasons why I love going into theater without second thinking of paying.

615,benettfreeman,Interesting but flawed,6,5 August 2012,"There were several things I really liked about this film - the performance from Gosling was well-balanced, the plot was OK, the supporting cast performed well in the non-violent scenes, the soundtrack was well-suited, and I liked the overall 'feel' of it: a film about a very troubled person that wants to do good. The Driver reminded me a little of James Cole in 12 Monkeys, as well as obviously Travis Bickle and other anti-heroes.But there were two flaws that kept it from getting 8+ out of 10.Firstly, the film was way too gory. The scenes of murder could have been executed without closeups of knives entering flesh, and to me this decision really jarred with the rest of the whole. I not only winced every time this happened, but felt the overall integrity of the cinematic vision crumble. This lost a whole 1.5 marks on its own.The other flaw was that although the plot had interesting dynamics, the script was not really clear enough to show this. I had to read the Wiki article in order to work out exactly what was going on, on two occasions. The criminal's motives were not always clear, and I don't think this was deliberate.I still enjoyed the film but soooo wish the director had cut the gore and brushed up the script in one or two scenes.Could have been an 8.",Drive

I expected a much more mainstream action-flick out of this one. Instead I got a very provocative, but special experience. The style of the movie was very much like Tarantino's - dark and twisted, yet special in its own way. The dialog was layered and the action gory at times. I liked the editing and the close-ups, which added to the suspense of the movie. The retro-like intro was a cool stylistic nuance and the score carried that style and delivered this movie to a whole new level. The acting was superb. Ryan Gosling goes without saying. His intense and reserved way of acting added great mysticism to his character. Carey Mulligan was sweet and likable and Bryan Cranston continues to get better with each performance. I was also glad to see Ron Perlam being part of this project. He has been miscast too many times and I was happy to see him in his comfort zone.

618,tsbarry,Worst (or one of) Movie of the Year,1,18 September 2011,"This has to be one of the worst this year. After reading some of the other reviews I had to wonder just what movie did the other reviewers see OR do they just not get out that much OR have they never really seen a movie before. I went to this movie thinking that it was a remake of the 1978 The Driver with Ryan O'Neal, which was just a great movie (which I'm going to have to purchase after seeing this lame want-to-be imitation, that didn't even come close). To start:The music was horrible and for the most part just drove me and my son to want to leave within the first 20 minutes. You know how you can sometimes tell how good (or how bad) a movie will be just by listening to the music in the opening (and throughout). Well this was clearly one of those movies. I stayed because of all of the great reviews on IMDb thinking that the move would redeem itself in the near future, but it never happened. The cast was okay and their performances were, eh... But Gosling's character was for the most part a sociopath and was in NO WAY like the Steve McQueen characters of old. Very disappointed in the other reviews making this comparison as I am a huge McQueen fan. It just wasn't there.The action:There was none really. And there definitely was not any driving and what ""was"" there was very poor. I kept waiting on some cool chase scene or trick move that would happen and of the three driving scenes that I remember, but I think there were only two, they just fizzled. Nothing to watch there.

619,migueloliveira-16,Drive,9,5 May 2014,"Drive, from director Nicolas Winding Refn, is a story about a mysterious stuntman, mechanic and getaway driver. He starts falling for her neighbor, who looks alone for her daughter. Then her husband gets out of jail and owes money to some bad people, our driver wants to help and agrees to do a getaway job but something goes wrong and he gets in trouble he didn't want.""You give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window. Anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours. No matter what. Anything happens a minute either side of that and you're on your own. Do you understand?"" - The DriverThis movie is entirely a new musical experience, it's not the usual orchestra or rock music, which is good, it aims to be different from what we already expect it to be. It is a simple, yet complex movie, it doesn't attempt to create new things, it uses what already works. With short and slow understandable dialogs it paces and creates a good story. The viewer has time to think about it, to meditate about what's going through the characters mind.Our main character is a anti-hero, he intends to do the right things but he uses the wrong ways to do it, we feel for him, even if he shows a little psychosis, he does care about the girl and her daughter but when someone harms him or them, he acts under extreme violence showing the violent and troubled man he is, maybe because of his past, we don't know for sure (but we don't need to).Overall good performances, good direction, and a screenplay that is very well paced, it doesn't rush anything.

620,addiewhiz,"Satisfies, but a bit bland",8,30 December 2011,"""Drive"" is a film about a stuntman, played by Ryan Gosling, who is forced into a rather sticky situation after aiding in a heist gone wrong. In a time where extravagant special effects and expressive acting are commonplace for such action movies, ""Drive"" delivers in subtlety and preciseness, however falls short in character depth.The story begins by introducing us the a character, whom in the credits, is simply referred to as ""Driver"". The opening scene involves Gosling's character acting as the wheel man for a man or a group of people working to conduct a theft. This scene is very well done in that it gets the audience interested in the story without being over-the-top. All too often in movies, we see loud and gaudy chase scenes in places they do not need to be. This chase scene is perfect in that the makers of the film do not use unnecessary sound effects, but instead choose to show the entire scene from the perspective of the driver, who is portrayed as a man who always displays a calm and collected façade. It is kept very minimal, but still manages to convey the necessary amount of excitement by allowing the audience to listen to a police scanner that the driver is using, and by juxtaposing the escape scene with radio commentary from the fourth quarter of a Los Angeles Clippers game. This theme of minimalism continues throughout the rest of the film, which adds to the film but also leads to a consequence.This consequence is that, by the end of the film, we still know rather little about the driver's personality. The film is about the driver helping a man get some money from a pawn shop theft, so that he can protect is son and wife, who the driver is in love with. We can figure out that the driver is calm, quiet, and thats about it. We don't know if he is trying to save the wife and son out of compassion or if he is doing it for selfish reasons (so he can steal her from her husband later). By the end of the movie, the driver is still a relatively blank slate.The payoff of the minimalism is that it respects the experienced moviegoer and does not feed them images and effects that look false and unconvincing. All of the car crashes in this film look real and seem as though they were actually done and not just simulated. In that respect, this is essentially the polar opposite of any Michael Bay film.My only other gripe about this film is that there are some aspects that are left incomplete. Near the beginning, the driver is shown to be gearing up for a newly received job and anticipation is built up regarding that job. However, the movie leaves that stone unturned and renders the scene in which the audience receives an explanation of the job pointless. The other incomplete aspect of the film is that the driver misses his chance to woo the woman he is in love with because he kisses her in an elevator while a hit man sent to kill him is in the elevator with them and then proceeds to kill the hit man right in front of her. This is essentially taking away the entire premise of the film and the reason why the driver is doing what he is doing, and flushing it down the toilet, leaving the viewer feeling a little short changed.The bottom line is that this movie is good, but not amazing, as many are hailing it. It's worth seeing but, really only worth seeing once.",Drive

Its Ryan gosling best performance ever, the name of the character not mentioned once in the movie even his name in IMDb is driver, we don't know his background, all we know about him from the first couple of scenes that he can drive and he is very organized but the real acting appears when he starts to meet Irene (Carey Mulligan) and how we get to understand from a couple of scenes that a love relation starts to grow, Without they even speak you can feel the love between them.Very hard for a performer to say much without saying nothing but when he speaks you want to listen and here comes the work of art from Iranian writer Hossein Amini, even in the action sequences and how real it appears where in a little time they do a lot. One of the great scenes is the elevator scene where the director took a risk by playing with lights to shift between his love to Irene and showing his bad character side at the same moment.A movie is all about how a director let you use your most important senses (sight-hearing) to make you shift between your emotions. The director Nicolas Winding Refn from Denmark toke a Cannes award for this work of art. If you watched the movie and your asking yourself why the driver wears a scorpion jacket and what does it mean by ""Nino didn't make it across the river"" check out this story: A scorpion asks a frog to carry it across a river. The frog hesitates, afraid of being stung, but the scorpion argues that if it did so, they would both drown. Considering this, the frog agrees, but midway across the river the scorpion does indeed sting the frog, dooming them both. When the frog asks the scorpion why, the scorpion replies that it was in its nature to do so.",Drive
622,artisannes,Long and Winding Refn,2,20 March 2012,"I was eager to see this (based on some good reviews – therein lies..) and the film begins with a driving sequence in which the character, drives a couple of evil doers to safe harbour. Unlike the Mechanic, where Statham roars off at Concord speed and never brakes, driver is skilled to the point of knowing when to stop, keep to the speed limit, creep, conceal and yes, at times, do the Concord thing.The opening was pretty much the best thing in the film. There is very little driving thereafter that ever reaches this remarkable first outing, where skill really does knock the blockbusters into their jolly genre.Christina Hendricks is great in what is really a cameo role and shows that it is wrong to niche her to Mad Men.Carey Mulligan has a semi-smile on her face much of the time. I wondered if that had more to do with the fact that she was thinking – and I am getting paid for this crap – than attempting to impart enigmatic qualities to her character.In his interview (extras on the DVD) Nicolas Winding Refn showed his strength at putting down audience members who posed questions. It is a dubious talent. The interviewer laughed nervously throughout but sadly, I think this was due to his actual belief that he was in the presence of greatness. No buddy, you weren't, Nicolas Winding Refn is a prat.Rarely do I feel so utterly antagonistic towards someone I have never met but the man has so finely honed his pretentiousness to perfection, that I cannot help myself. The interview droned on with the subliminal aural message of. ""I am brilliant but having watched his film, I have to decline to agree with him.Ryan Gosling was remarkable and so wasted because of this. I just felt that he was rowing a boat that too quickly reached the edge of a world that wasn't round and so, just fell off.Now if I could just take Nicolas Winding Refn to that same edge.",Drive
623,wwillcox561,Drive Review,9,7 February 2012,"Drive hands down has to be one of the better movie's I've seen in a long time. I have to admit when I first sat down to watch it I thought I wasn't going to like it because it had Ryan Gosling in it and what seemed like the characteristics of another play off of Fast and the Furious. Oh boy was I wrong though. Ryan Gosling plays the character of a quiet mysterious guy who holds multiple jobs including a Hollywood stuntman driver, a mechanic, and a getaway driver. While working as a mechanic his boss wants to start a legitimate racing team with him as the driver and the team being funded by mob money. When he meets his cute neighbor he ends up somewhat falling for her however she is married and her husband is getting out of jail soon. When Ryan Gosling has to do a job for her husband unbeknownst to her everything goes downhill from there and that's when things get epically violent in some of the best violence I've seen in the longest time. This movie to me, screamed a classic 80's thriller and was just absolutely awesome. The film score that was put into this movie was just so great and put such an awesome flow to the movie throughout and wasn't overdone. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone that likes films in general.",Drive
624,pete-collin,Conclusive proof that less is more,10,22 February 2012,"The first thing to point out about this movie is it won't be everyone's cup of tea. Some will find it ponderous, others old-fashioned, many will abhor the more violent scenes. For my part I adore this film. Languid, understated and bristling with style, there is no doubt that some scenes are disturbing but there is nothing gratuitous about this film.The story focuses on Gosling's nameless character, an ultra cool and somewhat mysterious mechanic and stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver for the city's criminal underclass. A loner by choice he winds up in all sorts of bother having got involved with Mulligan and her young son both of whom he befriends, against his own better judgement one suspects. The gentle pace of his and Mulligan's relationship crescendos when her husband and the father of her child is released from prison and Gosling's character atypically tries to help them when the father's criminal past threatens the family's safety. There's a certain tragic and harrowing inevitability about the events that then unfold as the good Samaritan bears his darker side in a denouement of almost Taxi Driver style über-violence but as with the rest of this film it is handled with an innate style and deftness of touch that stands this film aside from your run of the mill gangster flicks.A considered soundtrack, beautiful cinematography and stand-out performances from Gosling, Mulligan, Brooks and Perlman make this movie a must-see, but be warned, it's not for the feint-hearted.",Drive

Por supuesto que es un cuento de hadas, pero la visión es del príncipe, o más bien, del hombre hipermasculinizado que utiliza la violencia para resolver sus problemas pero que aun así tiene sentimientos.

Drive resulta ser la cuasi obra culmine del danés Nicolas Winding Refn, una obra repleta de violencia, ritmo lento, diálogos concisos y sesgados, y principalmente, ésta idealización y admiración que parece tener Refn por el lobo solitario, el anti-héroe que los hombres desean ser y el que los hombres creen que las mujeres desean tener. Porque de eso trata al final, de éste fetiche que tienen los hombres con ser capaces de salvar a una mujer en apuros, de enfrentarse a un villano imponente y salir victorioso, pero aún así, seguir solo.

632,PanTonowicZ,Guilty pleasure of the best kind,9,16 October 2011,"No one make movies like that these days and even if you can only see mildly entertaining car chases created on computer screens. The times of making car-chases as they were in such classics as ""Bullit"" or ""French Connection"" wont come back, but tributes to those car-chase action movies happens from time to time. DRIVE is an example. However Nicolas Winding Refnsur's masterpiece surpasses all his predecessors (even Quentines Death Proof although he went in a little bit different direction). The title sequences written in Pink cursive is a such obvious reference (and some TV watchers dare to criticize). Cameras point of view mostly comes from inside the car like in mentioned titles. Plot is about mechanic/stunt driver who in free time takes part in heist with random fellows. We don't know much about him because the film isn't about him, its about what's important to him. He has to make some tough choices after work gone wrong. Good feeling of voyeurism was achieved by shoots from low level angled sharply upward. The tension built by slightly longer takes with slowly zooming camera ( while heist is being in progress)are great and while watching it had goosebumps. I love all car-chases but I remembered particularly one scene. I'm talking about certain Chrysler's crush seen from rear window AMAZING. Retro Soundtrack just melt me away (personally I think music built an atmosphere of alienation) . In conclusion not everyone will get this film but those who will are going to be amazed. Visual style and night shots of the city are very climatic. There's no pretty violence and that's why it should be shown as realistic as possible. In an nutshell great action film for all those who love cars and 60's-70's action film genre.

Thanks to this, mise-en-scene can be felt even in the ordinary-looking composition. The editing was also clean.I'm a bit opposite to the casting of Carey Mulligan. She's a good actor but doesn't seem to fit in with the role. Besides, I doubt its Best Director Award from the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. Maybe, there is a gap between 2011 and now.The movie leaves room for the epilogue and prologue, but I'm not curious about them.

You know it's going to be violent, but you expect that to add to the story, rather than taking away from it.Gosling plays a jaded stuntman, with an interesting but normal enough profession, but in a day he transforms into a cold blooded psychosomatic killer for a helpless woman whom he barely knows, without any emotional distress whatsoever. Stamping people's heads in, breaking hands with hammers; Gosling spends the whole movie drenched in blood and with a singular facial expression. To say that it is unbelievable would be the understatement of the century.The rest of the actors are dreadfully cast, Bryan Cranston plays a helpless mechanic whose only purpose is to die a gruesome death. Carey Mulligan is a helpless (and I mean really helpless) female character who waits idly for a mysterious and overtly goodlooking man to solve her problems. Albert Brooks begins to be interesting when the story tries to explain that even the upper-middle class can be gruesome. Just as I was starting to like him, he stabs a fork in one of his suboordinate's eyes and slits his throat, just to justify the line ""now you have to clean up after me"". Those one-liners are great in Die Hard 4 and other jam-packed action movies where you are watching it just for the explosions, but in a psychological thriller it becomes cliché and over the top. In fact the biggest problem with this movie is it didn't manage to correctly find a place for it's violence. There is enjoyable gore for the heck of it, see 'Hobo with a shotgun' for an example, and there is well placed and clever gore which you find in some of the better Tarantino movies or 'the clockwork orange' etc. This movie is somewhere in the middle, with sickening images clearly without purple, a sad attempt at reeling in an audience who want to seem both sophisticated but are really there for the explosion. Overall Drive is not a great movie, and it's sad attempts to look like one just make the production all the more embarrassing.",Drive

As for the length of the movie, I assume they did not have any more crap to write into it so they drew it out as much as they could. I think they could have conveyed the same s**t in about half an hour. Shameless!! Will they push for an Oscar nomination for this abomination?? I wonder! That would be really something. Was there a deeper meaning to all this? I am stunned! I love cinema and always appreciate good movies. So, please, no more of this. Senseless killing, a story that leads to nothing, no beginning or end to it. However, I did watch the whole thing thinking that maybe I could make head or tails of it but to no avail. People should be warned about this before they decide to go see it and waste their own time and probably money.

641,TheTVSamurai,"Drive (2011) Review: Scorpion Jacket, Leather Gloves & a lot of Retro Music",6,25 January 2012,"If you're planning to watch this film I'd recommend going into this film not judging it based on the trailer because it absolutely does not represent the film in its real light. Here's the short synopsis as listed on IMDb, ""A Hollywood stunt performer who moonlights as a wheel man discovers that a contract has been put on him after a heist gone wrong."" The film has a pretty impressive cast: Ryan Gosling (Blue Valentine, read my review here) as the ""Driver"", Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) as his boss, Shannon and Carey Mulligan (An Education) as his neighbour/love interest, Irene. Also starring in the film, is Ron Perlman (Sons of Anarchy), Albert Brooks (The Muse), the beautiful Christina Hendricks (Mad Men) and Oscar Isaac (I'm a new fan after watching him in Ten Year at TIFF last month).The acting was superb in the film. Ryan Gosling delivers yet another strong performance, playing the lead role as the quiet and calculated skilled driver. Carey Mulligan is almost perfect for these serious, melancholy, strong yet fragile roles (I'd highly recommend watching her in An Education for those who haven't seen it yet). The two of them worked very well together even though with so much screen time, there wasn't too much dialogue between the two but you still felt the on screen chemistry. The few scenes with Ron Perlman were a treat (especially since I'm a big fan of Sons of Anarchy), Oscar Isaac did a great job with the handful of moments he was on screen, loved the scene where he gave the second chance speech and it's always great to see Christina Hendricks, she made a very memorable exit. Overall, great acting from all the main stars in this film.The opening scene was very well shot, with the Driver explaining his 5 minute rule to the clients and demonstrating his very calm, calculated and cool skills. The whole sequence was very intense and very enjoyable. And we get a good sense of how serious he is about his rule when he turns into the underground parking lot and so non-nonchalantly walks out of the car, flips his jacket inside out and puts on his hat—freaking smooth. I almost feel bad for his two clients who are sitting in there asking themselves ""where the hell did he go?"" holding to two giant black bags and just waiting to get caught. BUT than the opening credits begin and we get our very first (of many) very, very retro techno-rock tracks and it was my turn to ask ""where the fu*k is the director going with this?""

642,TheMovieSmith,One of the worst movies I'v ever seen,1,18 June 2015,"I honestly do not see why this movie has received so much hype. It was quite possibly one of the worst movie experiences I've ever had and I regret spending the money I did on renting it. The movie was long, tiresome, and dull. The cast was mediocre at best and the story was truly pointless. The only small exception were the few scenes in which there was actual driving involved (forgive me for thinking a movie titled ""Drive"" would actually have some driving in it). You see most of this movie is just Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan looking at one another without saying a word. I know women like Mr. Gosling, which leads me to believe they thought it would be a good idea if he just sat there looking 'cute.' The most entertaining thing you could do if your are going to watch this movie is to watch it with a stop watch. That way you can see how much time the characters spend not talking while they are on screen. Instead they just stare (rather longingly I might add) at one another in complete silence. The movie was cheesy, cheeky, and needlessly gory complete with a scene of excessive nudity that served no purpose. The soundtrack was straight out of the 1980's, or rather a 1980's soundtrack that couldn't afford the rights to popular music and thus had to create their own non-copyrighted music. Overall, this was a poor excuse of an 'action' movie that turned out to be an unwatchable love story. To sum it all up, it's a movie with no redeeming value whatsoever and easily one of the top 20 worst movies of all time.",Drive
643,reece-beale,The uncanny Neo Western.,9,29 December 2014,"Drive is one of those films that takes a couple of viewings to really appreciate. On first watching, you appreciate the whole 80's techno look and feel, with the link writing and ambient score, but as you watch more and delve deeper, you get to appreciate the western themes that are very apparent in the film.Goslings puts on a stellar performance as the patriarchal father figure to Benicio and Irene. We see him take the family under his protection and struggle between his own individualistic nature and his longing to belong in a family. Through exchanging intense looks with Irene, we also understand his frustration as he knows he can't be with her, this frustration escalates into his very graphic shows of violence.Accompany this with his quiet nature and the fact he is only referred to as 'Driver', similar to Preacher in Pale Rider, along with many other characteristics such as his car resembling a mans horse in a western, and the scorpion jacket as a reference to the conventional western duster coat, and you have yourself to recipe for a brilliant scored and acted Neo western.",Drive

Your friend Nino didn't make it across the river.""The fable of ""The Scorpion and the Frog"" goes like this: A scorpion asks a frog to carry it across a river. The frog hesitates, afraid of being stung by the scorpion, but the scorpion argues that if it did that, they would both drown. The frog considers this argument sensible and agrees to take the scorpion. The scorpion climbs onto the frog's back and the frog begins to swim, but midway across the river, the scorpion stings the frog, dooming them both. The dying frog asks the scorpion why it stung, to which the scorpion replies, ""I couldn't help it. It's in my nature.""This is the underlying moral complex in Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 unconventional action drama, Drive. Driver, played by brilliantly by the memorable Ryan Gosling, is the frog; like how the frog is eventually drowned because of the scorpion's nature, Driver is eventually ""drowned"" because of the criminals he helps. Note how the scorpion he wears, which is emphasized repeatedly throughout the film, does not represent what he is, but rather what he carries on his back. We can then deduce that Driver's true nature is, in fact, good (for lack of a better word), but dragged down by his surroundings.Refn occasionally adds a few touches to support these themes. Irene's son, Benicio, is watching cartoons in an earlier scene and Driver asks him if he thinks a character is a bad guy. Benicio replies, ""Of course, he's a shark,"" to which Driver responds, ""So there aren't any good sharks?""While Driver is confined in a criminal world he despises and feeds on at the same time, he attempts to break free by finding something good in Irene and her son. Their conversations are often awkward with long pauses in between (a common criticism of this film), but not without purpose. Notice how Driver doesn't wear his scorpion jacket especially during these occasions, metaphorically exhibiting his shyness and uneasiness in such situations. This indicates his adaptation to a happier world is a difficult one, with obstacles along the way, Irene's husband/ex-convict, Standard, representing one of them. Capturing the relatable embarrassment of getting to know someone, Gosling and Carey Mulligan display breathtaking chemistry here, walking the fine line between adoration and apprehension. Yet, when Driver wears his jacket, he turns into a vicious, stone-cold killer.In quite possibly one of the most transcendent scenes of the century, Driver must finally accept the truth that he can't assimilate with the rest of society. His nature and situation does not enable him to do so, no matter how hard he tries. Hence, the infamous elevator sequence. A hitman has been sent to murder Driver, and Irene has just rejected Driver's offer of running away with him and the money. The three of them meet in the elevator. Driver then realizes he can't hide the other half of him, and before brutally slaughtering the hitman, moves Irene to the side, and kisses her, knowing it will probably be the last time they'll see each other. Refn's slow motion, perceptive intuitive rhythm, and atmospheric lighting transforms an ordinary romantic embrace into an absolutely breathtaking experience, and considering the context of the film, one of the greatest climactic self-realizations ever put to screen. That moment Driver saw the hitman, he knew he can't ever have Irene. He knew the next few seconds will most likely be the only time he could ever be truly happy again. He knew, that after Irene sees his other half, everything will be over.And it was, for the most part. Driver proceeds to decimate the rest of the scorpions, and as he drives off into the night, leaving the money behind, we're left to wonder if he dies or not. Such ambiguous endings are often debated if they're necessary or not, and I would dare argue a conclusive ending would have been more satisfactory. After all, if Driver dies, it completes the metaphor that the scorpion and frog fable started. But it begs the question: is Driver somehow different?Despite its ingenious thematic finesse, Drive's strongest aspects transpire more technically. As previously mentioned, Gosling's execution is just a masterclass in restrained performance; working on the paradigm of talking so little, yet saying so much. His eyes are energetic yet longing, shooting glances that make you feel scared and sorry at the same time. He absolutely rocks the outfit too, and I can't think of a single actor today who could have delivered a more convincing performance than he did.But of course, there is no Drive without its soundtrack. Johnny Jewel of ""Desire"" and the ""Chromatics"" assembled a magnificent score, both atmospheric and memorable. Nostalgic in its 80's vibe, and overwhelming in its synthesizers, boundless in its elusiveness, Jewel's creation is something so unique and extraordinary that the feeling expressed is so beautifully indescribable. ""Nightcall"" by Kavinsky is about a girl that embraces her ghost lover despite his robotic behavior, ""Under Your Spell"" by Desire is a haunting introspection of Driver's powerless control over his own mind (""I do nothing but think of you"", ""you keep me under your spell"", ""do you think this feeling will last forever?"") , and ""A Real Hero"" by College is Driver's transformation into ""a real hero"" and ""a real human being"". Brilliant.Unfortunately, masterpiece is an overused word, and thus unfitting for Drive. Jewish mobsters Bernie and Nino are typical single-minded personalities, stereotypical villains we've seen in commercial gangster/crime films in the 90s. Shannon also somewhat acts as a service to the plot, but at least he can represent the little friendship Driver has. Flimsy and not fully realized, these criminals fall flat compared to the protagonists in Goodfellas (1990) and The Godfather (1972). If these characters were given dimensionality and more time to develop, Drive could have easily become the masterpiece it never was.I think why Drive is so underappreciated among the general audience is due to marketing and preconceptions. The trailer takes practically all the violence and gore present in the one and a half hour runtime and compacted it into two and a half minutes. It is perhaps the worst false advertisement I've seen for the last ten years or so, as audiences will walk into the theaters thinking Drive is a simple Friday night crime/thriller with car chase sequences and a conventional story. Ryan Gosling too! When viewers realized they were wrong, they didn't hesitate to look for hidden context or metaphorical meaning, and instead simply dismissed it as a poorly made film. Of course, I'm not talking about all moviegoers, but I'm certain a vast majority had a thought process similar to this.Nevertheless, Drive will stand the test of time. I'm sure of it.",Drive
646,landonwolk,"Solid Suspense, Great Performances All-Around",8,1 May 2020,"This movie is a great watch. Gosling is great as always and the ensemble as a whole is quite wonderful. The shock-value is real and in a movie that starts slow, the hard-hitting, brutal action in the second half of the movie is awesome and more than makes up for the lengthy story-build. The hotel room scene reminds me of No Country For Old Men in the way that the suspense slowly becomes a realization and then a quick reality. If I could, I'd give it an 8.3.",Drive
647,dark_frances,"I'm gonna show you where it's dark, but have no fear",10,11 February 2015,"I have met this guy before. He was Dustin Hoffman's Max Dembo in ""Straight Time"", Jean Reno's ""Leon"", Alain Delon's Jef Costello in ""Le Samourai"", Martin Sheen's Kit in ""Bad Lands"", obviously Ryan O'Neal's ""Driver"", and even François Leterrier's Fontaine in ""A Man Escaped"". And he was, of course, the mysterious stranger in many noir, western or westernish movies.He is a man followed closely by a strange shadow, a dark and dangerous one, that mostly affects the people he cares about. But the strangest thing about this man is that he is in synch with his fate. He does recognize the forces that pull him in places he wouldn't want to go, or shouldn't want to go, but he does not really rebel against them, mock them, use them for revenge or desperately bash his head against the walls they raise around him. If he happens to find a breach in those walls he'll walk out, if not he'll just keep them as a part of his being.There is a bittersweet innocence about this man. It's not the innocence of the naive hero who finds himself (or herself) pulled in a vile scheme beyond their comprehension, only to get themselves either destroyed or embittered and hellbent on revenge. Nor the serenity of the savvy criminal who willingly sold their soul to rule mercifully in hell. The man I'm talking about has a kind of wild innocence: he just happens to have been born a predator (now Jude Law's Steven from ""The Wisdom of Crocodiles springs to mind"").Ryan Gosling's Driver starts off showing just the tiniest shadow of his scorpion stinger: he's the escape driver of two criminals during a heist. All professional and uninvolved, he just drives. We don't even end up knowing why he does it - he hardly needs the money. Could be simply the thrill of the chase, being able to escape police, a purpose to drive, as good as any other, as long as he doesn't have to stay too long in his empty apartment, briefly entered and quickly left again during a beat of the intro credits.In the beginning, he looks like an ocean diver. He does not really seem to belong in the colorful, dirty, strident, perverse night of the electric city, although he knows it by heart. He seems to belong on the shore, where he can breathe air, meet human people, have friends and fall in love - but still he dives over and over again, roaming the lively and dirty ocean from behind the windows of his car, that almost act like fourth walls between him and the rest of the world - starting with the heist in the beginning of the movie. He's out there, but with his breathing and protection equipment at hand.And then we see him on the shore, and he's quiet, direct, cautious, then his face opens up in midsummer sunny smiles when he falls for a girl - in spite of all his caution - and we get to see the human, vulnerable layer behind the poker face, leather gloves, screeching tires and ticking clocks. There is some great direction and acting at work, because our ultra low-key hero actually manages to transmit the tiniest thought and hesitation - we see his aloofness turn to interest through an almost imperceptible lag in stride, focus of his eyes somewhere behind the camera, we see his decision processes through a simple turn of the head or the smallest frown, and most of this before we even get to see what is causing him to break the pace. Later on, his face simply starts to beam, and we know that he saw her, and sure enough, there she is, right behind us. We can see the world reflected in him before we see the world, and that's so good that I can't get enough of it.And this is all fine and dandy, until he has to dive again. Deeper. Going for that last heist that obviously goes wrong. But then something happens: we slowly come to understand that he was never a creature of land and sun. He belonged to the frantic, neon ocean. That's where he came from when he arrived in our story, and that's where he vanished again in the end.Well, I think that it's pretty obvious that I loved this movie. And not just for the main character, but also for the vivid world around him, populated by typical noir archetypes dressed up as casual humans - the innocent blonde femme fatale, the dark vulnerable and aggressive husband who returns from jail and darkens the horison, the sweet but mildly treacherous and powerless guardian angel (Shannon), the all-powerful fiend bound to the rules of hell, yet merciful and reasonable (Bernie), the aggressive ugly wild card that triggers the catastrophe (Nino). I loved the music that infused everything with a meaning and a will, the sudden splatter of violence and gore when the Driver's inner beast was triggered into motion, the cling of the elevator doors sealing him outside her universe, under the surface of his ocean.It's not that everything worked - for instance, the story of the scorpion and the frog was useless. But most of it worked big time, and it went straight under my skin. It's the first time I have rated a movie with 10 in a long time (last two 10s were ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""In Bruges"", more than one year ago).",Drive
648,jcv2,"Different, but not great",6,17 September 2011,"If Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction had a kid, this would be the result. Except while each of those was different and great in its own way, this one is not. It's different, but not great.I walked out of this movie feeling like I'd just been punk'd by a bunch of fake reviews in this very site. But no, RT loves it, too.Ryan Gossling plays a mysterious, very quiet person who, somehow, despite not showing any outward charm, any kind of personality, or anything like that which a woman might look for in a member of the opposite sex, manages to woo his neighbor next door, Irene, who, oh, just happens to still be married to a soon-to-be ex-con with debts plus interest due upon release.Carey Mulligan plays his love interest, your typical movie damsel who enters a man's life with the intent of making it better but ends up doing the opposite. I don't discredit her acting here, though, she was one of the two people in this movie that gave a believable performance, the other being Bryan Cranston.Everyone else was basically awful. Albert Brooks didn't even try to get into character. He has the personality of a used car salesman, but we're to believe he's a crime boss? Ron Perlman was an overacting ham. Christina Hendricks was her usual eye candy self who can't act and can't cry on cue, apparently.But the on screen chemistry between Gossling and Mulligan is not believable at all. How could a woman fall for a person who has the personality of a tree?That and the what seems to be total deafness of basically every off-camera person in this movie makes me wonder how much suspension of disbelief the director expects us to have. Despite gun battles being waged in apartment buildings with the front door wide open, despite the survivor standing there for several minutes, nobody comes along and asks ""what the hey just happened here, and who are you?""The fun parts of the movie are when Gossling unleashes his inner Bourne, but those are few and far between, too few and too far to keep the movie interesting.In short this movie is pretty boring and tedious to watch except for small parts, the situations are implausible, the casting choices leave much to be desired, and the director seems to have demanded very little of those casting choices because that's exactly what they gave.It shouldn't be called ""Drive"" it should be called ""Park"" or ""Stuck"".",Drive

651,FortySecondStreetFreak,Refn does it again PLUS we get best Michael Mann film in 16 years,9,1 February 2012,"""DRIVE"" Want to see the film that Michael Mann should have made between ""Thief"" and ""Manhunter"" instead of the mess that was ""The Keep""? Well here it is. After the triumph of ""Bronson"", and the at least interesting and delightfully brutal ""Valhalla Rising"", Nicholas Winding Refn delivers this astonishing modern 80's throwback that delivers absolutely everything you could hope for. Anyone who has seen ""Thief"" will recognise the night time cityscape stylistic flourishes and cool, smooth take on the old 'honourable man on the wrong side of the law' plot and anyone who has seen ""Manhunter"" will recognise the laid back, dream-like, constantly backed by ethereal synth, dialogue exchanges. Exchanges made so compelling, even when dialogue is minimal, by the acting and that perfect synth accompaniment, that the slowish build-up becomes a dramatic triumph in of itself. So much is owed to, and hinges on, this score and its use. The modern but throwback electro songs and 'Tangerine Dream"" style original score by Cliff Martinez (and pink, neon, silk on steel, title graphic and opening credits) all scream prime era Michael Mann too. This is not only a stunning movie in it's own, 21st century, right but the best Michael Mann film not made by Michael Mann in 16 years. That's not to say that Refn's own mastery of the art is not in evidence, or to say that it is anything but (well perhaps along with Gasper Noe) Refn's own lashings of astonishingly brutal and graphic violence on display that superbly punctuate this, what he himself has called, urban fairytale. Nor is it without note that this is very much another Refn study of a singular, driven, coldly brutal at times, man living in an unforgiving world. But, and despite traces of Melville and 70's U.S. crime films, at its heart ""Drive"" is without doubt the offspring of 80's Michael Mann. Ryan Gosling gives a fascinating, multi-layed, performance of a fascinating, multi-layered character (known only as Driver) who is the chivalrous knight one moment, and the gore drenched barbarian the next. One can not exist without the other in this man's world...not if the pure princess and her innocent child are to be saved. The support cast is also superb with an almost unrecognisable (who stole his eyebrows?!) Albert Brooks as a measured but ruthless crime boss, Bryan Cranston as Driver's friend, Ron Pearlman as a thick-headed, uncompromising heavy and Carey Mulligan does a beautiful job as the barely reachable purity in Driver's life, who belongs to another. Poignant drama, multi layered characters, simple but clever plotting, excellent (and excellently utilised) synth soundtrack, gorgeous cinematography, crisp nighttime city dreamscapes, exciting and unapologetically cool car sequences, superb acting and truly brutal and gory action are the gift to the audience...and the pitch perfect 80's/Michael Mann thriller stylings are the its wrappings, all brilliantly crafted by writer Hossein Amini and director Nicholas Winding Refn. One of the best films of the decade at the very least and an essential purchase.",Drive
652,kennyggavin,Drive,5,11 June 2013,"**Spoiler Alert**Lets start with the move ""Drive"". Now I enjoy watching Ryan Gosling perform his craft in front of us. I mean hey he looks good, has a nice build (no homo) and has drawn me into his character in many of his previous roles and seems to be very specific on his choice of roles. That is what drew me to this movie in the first place, so within the first 15 I even paused the movie twice. (The first was to tell the wife that ""ooh this movie is going to be AWESOME!! and the second was to go make a fresh bag of popcorn so I can fully enjoy this exciting experience). After the first scene my excitement started to decline faster than my bank account did as the recession hit the industry I worked in 2006!! I see the reviews and its got an average 8.0/10.I loved pink font as the movie begins and I loved the music, hell I even loved the silver 80's jacket Gosling sported in the flick giving the movie a style, a personality, some culture and even the reason we watch most movies..... FUN.... However a movie named ""Drive"" and what some confused critics were saying ""best car chase scenes since Bullet"" lacked what your led to believe this move is about. This movie had such great potential and was just mis-directed!. ""Drive"" had two car chase scenes one of which had a 400 plus horsepower Mustang GT being caught by a stock 300C Chrysler, I mean if the chase would have lasted longer than 4 minutes I wouldn't be too upset. Now take the chase scenes out and the style Gosling brought and you got superb acting by Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks that cant even save the weak dialog and scenes that don't connect that ruined this movie. There were parts in the movie that had numerous scenes of characters just blankly staring into a television or an emptiness at a wall that had me asking my wife ""is it me or is nobody even speaking throughout half this movie?"" I believe this movie had ALL the ingredients to become a classic. Great cast, a possibility to have car chases, a want to connect with the star, violence, blood, a little gore, good plot, great cinematography and just a good old fashion root for the bad guy (Gosling) hell as a matter of fact everybody was a bad guy in this movie !!

Any page that you may find concerning Drive most likely will be filled to the brim with messages along the lines of, ""They talked too much! There weren't a lot of car chases and explosions! Why wasn't this movie dumb and actiony like I wanted it to be!?"" The problem seems to be that nobody knew that this was NOT Fast and Furious 6 being released simultaneously with Fast 5, and thus nobody was prepared for a beautifly filmed throwback to 80s noir films. Luckily I actually read a review of this film before going, and so I had the advantage of being informed of just what I was in for. The other two people that I went with were not, and though they didn't hate it, they were surprised.If only more people looked into the movie before hand. But then again, I would have liked this movie anyway. It was very intense and successfully channeled a bit of Quentin Tarantino's style. Everything that these people bashed the film for, like Gosling's character being predominantly silent and wearing a satin scorpion jacket and the soundtrack consisting of cheesy 80s pop, were exactly what made the movie great for me. It was slow to begin with, but knowing that it would pay off (and it DID) made it all the more tense during the first act.I highly recommend this movie, just as long as it is clear to you that it is not all about car chases, and that is not what you are expecting.

654,michael-892-52682,"A modern cult classic, that is not for the faint of heart",10,19 April 2012,"If you watch the trailer for Drive you may be expecting a Tarantino style gore fest crossed with films like The Fast and The Furious, but you would be sadly wrong my friend because Drive, Drive is something very special indeed. Drive is from Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn who also directed films such as Bronson and Valhalla Rising, so he's no stranger to gore. The story circles around a nameless Hollywood stunt driver played by Ryan Gosling (Crazy Stupid Love, Ides Of March), who also moonlights as a getaway driver for heist and the like and he meets a girl called Irene played by Carey Mulligan (An Education, Never Let Me Go) and takes a liking to her. I'm not going to go into much detail with the story because I don't want to spoil anything but believe me when I say it is a truly heartfelt film with an incredible attention to detail, it is obvious the director put his heart and soul into making this movie. The performances though are incredible, especially from Ryan Gosling who doesn't say much but is still able to get his point across. Carey Milligan is also fantastic, I truly believe that she and Ryan carried this film, but that doesn't mean the rest of the cast was bad. Ron Perlman (Hellboy, Season Of The Witch) was amazing in which I consider his best role since Hellboy however, Christina Hendricks (Mad Men, Cold Case) was in my opinion the weakest out of all the cast but she was by no means bad she just wasn't up to the standards of the rest. However there is a major part of this film which could turn a lot of people off, and that's the gore. The gore in this movie is infrequent but when it does come it is some of the most brutal and sadistic gore I have ever seen. There were two parts in this film where I winced at the gore levels, and that would take a lot to do that since I have watched Sin City without as much as a recoil. It is also not your typical film watchers film; it's a very slow burner and is not a movie that you could just put on and have a couple of beers whilst watching it, you really need to pay attention otherwise you will get lost. However if you can stick with it, you will be rewarded with some of the most interesting characters, a phenomenal story and buckets of some of the best gore in a film this generation and you have yourself a winner.

I automatically fell for his majestically mysterious character. With no name other than Driver, we embark on the leather-glove-wearing-smooth-criminal's story, which is slowly and elegantly leaked out to us over the course of the movie. A part-time stunt man who works with the manipulative and shady Shannon (Cranston) at a car garage and spends more time in his car than his small apartment (which is never seen in full light - not one for interior design maybe?), you cannot expect an easy answer to his story and past.As this profusely poetic performance from Ryan (Yes, first name basis now) develops we are opened up to his expanding character.

To a driver perspiring confidence behind the wheel of a get-away vehicle and using excessive force when defending those he cares about . Elusive and weary behaviour, limited speech and social contact built from a fantastic lead man, complimented by solid supporting characters (Cranston, Mulligan and Albert Brooks in particular) all combine to create a masterpiece of entertainment.'Drive' is a clear cut example of how 'less is more'. My favourite movie to emerge on to my screen from the movie industry over the last three years.",Drive
664,campb234,Decide for yourself. Don't Let Negativity Sway you.,8,20 July 2013,"This May contain spoilers. I haven't seen it in a while, but I know I've seen it at least 5 times. I recall watching trailers, but I unfortunately didn't get to see it until I watched in on Netflix about a year ago.First off, I would like to acknowledge everyone that responded to this film negatively whether it be the slow pace, useless action, or whatever. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I'm really surprised how people feel so offended by this film.For those people who say the plot is useless, it's kind of shocking to me how they missed the plot that is there. This is supposed to be a noir type of film. I don't think it set out to be the greatest movie ever, but as a ""period piece"" or even homage to the 80s I think it was successful. When the title sequence began and Kavinsky's ""Nightcall"" began playing I instantly fell in love, and to be honest, like a lot of negative reviews, the soundtrack made the film for me, but that could be because I love 80s music, and more so the recent emergence of ""French House/Nu Disco/Dreamwave"" Not once was a taken out of the movie and thought ""The acting could be better."" To be honest, the characters that made the least sense to me were those played by Cranston and Perlman, although, they do provide back story to the driver's mysterious past. I remember one instance where Cranston talks about how he made money off of the driver (something of that effect) so you know they are a team of sorts, both in movies and on the street.I don't see how people can view the violence as irrelevant. The guy is helping his neighbor, and he's dealing with gangsters. Hostel is useless violence, I thought all of the action sequences were entertaining and well-fitting. He's obviously not just a driver.About the pace. All I have to say is, did people criticize Kubrick's films for people slow paced and confusing? Maybe, but just look how well they have stood the test of time. 2001 and Eyes Wide Shut are still a couple of my favorite movies.Bottom line: Don't let negative reviews stop you from watching this if you have yet to do so. Watch it and decide for yourself.",Drive
665,pjm-pjm,Must see,9,5 January 2015,"Effortlessly cool with some of the best directing in the last 10 years, Drive is a film to go back to again and again. Similar to the also excellent 'Nightcrawler', in this film LA is normal during the day, yet seedy and dirty at night. Potentially the most stylised film I've watched, Drive drags you through a story of betrayal, greed and love that grabs attention throughout. The tension throughout is palpable and is constantly rising, with a main character in 'The Driver' is who expertly portrayed by Ryan Gosling in his best ever role. A massively underrated film that is too quickly berated for its minimalist action scenes. Give this film a chance. Michael Bay may not be directing, and its pace isn't at all frantic, yet its subtle and understated brilliance drive this excellent movie to an excellent conclusion. A true delight.",Drive

I can say that this movie really puts you in a passengers seat next to Ryan Gosling, and gives you the DRIVE through the night city and the day life of LA. And it won't let you go from the first second until the last one.Phenomenal Soundtrack and colors used in this movie really tell the story.Its a part of it.Dialogue in this picture is outstanding.Every line , every little interaction has meaning.And the moments of silence.. those moments make this movie a masterpiece!Not many movies can give you those feelings that Drive gives in every scene..

667,shinnstoneer,A fine way to waste an afternoon,8,7 December 2013,"Introduction: For a film to make an enjoyable impression, it doesn't have to grab your attention from the beginning but it sure helps. Drive is successful in drawing its audience into the story with slightly suspenseful chase scene.It would have been one notch better if the writers could have developed a better way to divert the traffic copter other than a fortuitous shooting at another location just when Ryan Gosling's character needed it the most. The rest of the opening sequence seems so well planned out that the one questionable getaway moment can be overlooked.Main course: About 45 minutes into the story I stopped the video and checked the description. I try to enter into viewing movies with only a brief idea of the plot to avoid spoiling too much. At the point this was looking like a race car movie with a love twist, I decided to make sure Cole Trickle wasn't going to make an appearance.Once spoiled, I was pleased to find that the writers at least had a few surprises to deliver. It seemed certain that Gosling and Mulligan would have an opportunity to get together and the death of her husband wasn't a shock. The setup with the second car, however, wasn't expected although from the moment it rolled into the parking lot something was clearly not right.It was amusing to watch the girls at what I guess was a strip joint dressing room. Gosling is beating this guy, sticking a bullet in his mouth and they're sitting around taking it in while another casually walks up and hands him a cell phone. All in a days work at a bordello in LA I reckon.Satisfying conclusion? For the most part, the conclusion to this violent downtown western is sealed up nicely but there is just enough left open for the viewer to make some decisions on their own. That will not sit well with a select group of people, I am sure, but for those who like to imagine their happy ending this is wrapped up nicely.The people who need to be shoved off the end of a long pier get what is coming to them in the end. A few who don't have it coming to them meet their demise as well but that is necessary to make the bad guys look like really bad guys. If you haven't watched this, be prepared for some graphic violence.So, if you found a body in a parking lot next to a bag with a million dollars in it, would you call the police?",Drive
668,radamanthe,"All style, no substance",5,17 January 2016,"Drive is a movie that immerses you into its world through cinematography, directing and music. The plot is pretty basic:an unnamed guy extracts revenge from a gang of criminals so the girl he is in love with and her son can escape their clutches. The relationship of the protagonist with the woman and the boy is conveyed with little dialogue,instead stares and body language is stressed but still i found the acting not great just satisfactory. Films of this type generally don't bother much with character development, so i didn't mind much the fact that the characters were two-dimensional, they represented archetypes after all such as the brooding silent type who kills the bad guys, the former criminal who wants to escape his past but fails, and the fragile woman waiting for the silent type to save her and her son. This film is generally nothing more than a stylistic exercise, investing in Gosling's star power, Mulligan's fragility, a lot of gory violence, 80s music and great cinematography. If you want a film that has a beautiful exterior but little substance i am sure you will appreciate Drive.",Drive
669,reisnersteven,"Poorly marketed, misunderstood but truly great",8,16 February 2016,"I admit when this was coming out the previews I saw got me ready for a high octane action movie, and at first I was disappointed, but still couldn't get this movie out of my head for some reason. So after going back to rewatch it I take it for what it is...at parts a homage to the 80s, but at its core a film that's only real storyline is that of its characters. Ryan Gosling isn't given much to say but that does not downplay his acting in this, he pulls off our nameless, dark and brooding hero exceptionally well. While the film may not be loaded with action scenes that's probably because the violence here wasn't meant as action, but as raw unflinching violence, and when I say raw I mean it. The very few violent scenes at the end of this film will shock viewers for the first time seeing them, and will leave quite an impression. All in all, if you want a Michael Bay style film then your in the wrong place, but if your in the mood to get sucked into the lives of characters, and root for a hero who says little, but can still be as cruel as any criminal in the film, then look no further. Ryan Goslings Drive is an incredible, character driven thriller that will leave you breathless.",Drive

I have a little advice for the producer and director; next time you decide to waste a lot of money making a movie, try making one with an actual PLOT and a script with actual dialogue. How many scenes are we expected to sit through that have no point? OK - He walks through a grocery store and the scene ends. He carries a bag of groceries to a neighbor's apartment, gets a drink of water and the scene ends. He goes for a drive at night and stops at a red light and the scene ends. He eats breakfast in a restaurant and threatens a supposed former crime partner for no apparent reason and the scene ends.

680,cipri_alex,under par remake,2,12 May 2012,"yes, i know they label it a movie made from a 2005' book.in reality, both the book and the 2011 movie borrow so much from 1978 original(starring Ryan O'Neal, Bruce Dern and Isabelle Adjani)that i wonder if some copyright rules are not broken.the getaway driver theme is very much the same(they even show the same quirk of not using fire arms), the women in trouble is also present and so are the treacherous villains, with minor modifications.leaving aside this hypocrisy of the producers, the other aspects of the 2011 film make it worst than the 1978 original. First , the casting issues:i would start with the male lead,cause this bothers me the most.i know he's supposed to be ""the strong ,silent type"" of guy,but he only manages to be pretty ridiculous.i'm no expert in what males should do to appeal ""macho"" to girls but i just find Gosling's long periods of silence as very boring and highly unattractive.About the female lead choice, i would say only this:uninspired choice.i was unfortunate enough to see her in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps(a mess of a script,another overrated flop, way below the first one)and let me say she did not improved a bit since then.of course, i may be biased and compare her a lot with Adjani,but still her acting lets a lot to be deserved.But even a better casting effort from the producers could not save the film.Why am i saying this?The script and the pace is terrible.Some directors tend to believe if u film slow,boring scenes with a lot of close-ups of the male lead is art.granted, it can be , but not when u film an emotionless Gosling for like half of the movie,pondering the situation to the world end and then making some pretty bad decisions and acting accordingly.Also, the minor details are just wrong:the scary-than-a-gun hammer,the corny scorpion jacket( which i bet it's supposed to became a trademark of the character) is just a sign of bad taste, not to mention it magically becomes clean even after a scene with heavy blood spilling.Verdict: watch the 1978 original.unless your a female(or gay) fan of Gosling and then i can't really do anything",Drive
681,projitmookerjee,mesmerizing,8,5 March 2012,"Finally watched it and I must say it was quite different in many ways from what you expect from an action entertainer. It is a classic noir, a throwback to the 70's with its synthesizer-pop music soundtrack that will knock your socks off. It stars Ryan Gosling (can't believe the year he has had) as Hollywood stuntman by day and wheelman by night. He begins to have a soft spot for his neighbor. Things go sideways, when he decides to help out his neighbor's husband for a job. Now what makes this unique is the way the movie has been treated. Without a name or a back story on why he behaves the way he behaves, it is left to the viewers' to imagine how he could be so calm, composed, poised at one instance and do a 360 degrees turn when the occasion demands. While Gosling has really underplayed the protagonist with his broody eyes and his constant smirk, he still delivers a solid act and is ably assisted by an excellent supporting crew. Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks & Ron Perlman just add more star power to this venture. Add to this, the drive sequences & the car chases which are exquisitely shot over the LA landscape. IMDb has already picked that one scene as its top 10 for 2011, when Gosling enters the night club with a hammer in his hand, ready to obliterate his target. It becomes apparent then and there that this guy is no stranger to extreme violence when the situation calls for it. That sets the tone for things to come and its only wise if you step out of his way. Critics & audience have been divided over it with extreme reactions. While many found the tone of the movie to be slow, languid with minimalistic dialogues, there have been comparisons of its extreme (in your face) violence to Eastern Promises.

683,hollybellekeating,"Poignant, with an abundance of gore",9,12 June 2012,"This story is told with excellence; the lighting is dark and mysterious, the acting is understated and hidden, and the character an unspoken mystery. Our driver is nameless and uses long awkward silences as comebacks. The jacket, the plot twists, the smattering of blood, they add to the beautiful slow, but quick paced movie. I admit, the gore can be a bit nauseating and unnecessary in getting the point across. But I was happy to see only a few slow mo shots, as Hollywood movies seem to be teeming with 15 minute scenes of someone blinking. Whereas in drive, your heart will not be pounding with adrenaline, or your eyes close in fear. But with the retro, fitting soundtrack, the hard packed car chases that make you feel a small sweat bead on the back of your neck, and the desire for everything to work out, Drive still has your attention, and the uncomfortable feeling of being near the edge of your seat. The perspective was wonderful, the lines short an crisp. This is a refreshing view on action movies with a hint of art and silence. Utterly wonderful.",Drive
684,alan-just-7-145627,A Quiet Killer,9,22 December 2011,"I am a little speechless after seeing Drive. Perhaps the character know only as ""Driver"" played by Ryan Gosling, wore off on me a little over the course of the film. He is a man of very few words, to say the least. It is a part that I can imagine Gosling jumped at the opportunity to play because he gets to play a B.A., stoic tough guy, drive fast cars in an excellent movie, and hardly had to learn any lines! The movie opens with Driver driving for a midnight robbery. He is precise with his directions to the criminals that they have 5 minutes to perform the heist or he is gone, but even more precise with his maneuvering of the Los Angeles City streets to escape from the pursuing police. That is his part time job.By day he works as an auto mechanic for the shop run by Shannon (Bryan Cranston). Shannon is a master mechanic who often provides the cars that Driver uses in his 2nd life but is also a fairly innocent low man in the gangster operations of Nino (Ron Perlman) and Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks). These men are gangsters and we learn are very willing to kill to keep themselves afloat. Bernie Rose is a producer of sorts making low budget films in which Driver will often stunt drive for.The story is a slow moving piece. As I mentioned there are few words spoke by the central character, but there is a ton of emotion and a lot at stake. The movie moves along fairly ambiguously for the first half and I was not sure in which direction the movie was going.The plot thickens when Driver starts to fall for his neighbor Irene played by Carey Muligan. The Driver, Irene and her son Benicio become close, but the rest of the movie is far from a love story. It becomes a tangled mess of crimes that Driver gets himself into brought upon by Irene's husband who was recently released from prison. Driver is launched into trouble with the mob that he will do anything to get himself out of, but most importantly keep Irene and her child safe.The rest of the movie is brilliant. It keeps you on the edge of your seat with very calculated suspense and action. It's a classic movie that shows, not tells you what is happening and I takes you along on a great ride.Despite the simplified title, this movie isn't for the summer blockbuster action movie freaks. I remember the opening night at the AMC I often go to, had lines out the door for Drive. I was not going to see it that night but I recall looking at the crowd and seeing a ton of high school gear head types, with a lot of Fox racing and Nascar gear on. It looked like the same crowd that lined up for the Fast and the Furious series. I would guess that crowd didn't exactly get what they thought they were in for. It is a sleek and sexy film using the backdrop of an almost 80′s like nighttime watercolor painting. It is much more of the patient, particular genre than those that slap you in the face with car chases, flips, explosions and sex. It is much more of the patient, particular genre than those that slap you in the face with car chases, flips, explosions and sex.

685,Danish_Psycho,Most boring film in 5 years,1,9 October 2011,"I've never fallen asleep to a movie before, but man I got close with this snore fest. Drive is best described as a mix between The Transporter, Payback and Days of Thunder...without any of the good stuff. It has none of the roaring action scenes or epic settings of Days of Thunder. It has none of Mel Gibsons bitter revenge persona from Payback, or any of the cool one-liners. It has none of Jason Stathams cool bad-ass attitude, or fight scenes from The Transporter, but other than that it is pretty close. The story of Drive is pretty solid. It is about a stunt driver who falls in love with his neighbor, but after a heist goes wrong, a hit is put out on him. Ryan Gosling plays the main character, and some would say his acting was very good, but to me, he spends half the movie starring blindly into thin air, for 30 seconds at a time (I was so bored, I actually started timing it), while contemplating answers for complicating questions like: ""would you like a glass of water?"". This movie is artistic in the worst possible way. It is full of weird angles, strange pauses, and confusing plot devices. Most of which could be really cool if the movie was actually any good, but it is not. It is unbelievably boring, from start to finish. Okay I'm usually an action junkie, but I don't NEED action in movies. My favorite movie is Shawshank Redemption, and other movies like The Devil Wears Prada and Sleepers, I really enjoy. They have no action, but at least something happens throughout the entire movie. With Drive, if you cut out all scenes where Gosling stares blindly into thin air, or when they show him driving down a dark road (for no purpose), you'd have less than 1 hour of film.",Drive
686,cliffromain,The Perfect Heist,6,15 October 2011,"This movie should be called ""The Perfect Heist"" NOT Driver. Ryan Gosling played the perfect get away driver. Unfortunately this movie came short. Like in most heist movies, you can figure out the plot, well this is it. Small time thugs committing robberies and ended up in a jam, everything snowball afterward. Ryan's personal life has caused chaos to everyone around him. What I was hopping from him is to get out before it's too late. Most career criminals don't know when to bail out. These situations leave you with only three options jail, dead, or retirement.This movie seems to drag a little, him falling in love with one of his partner in crime wife and others chasing after him. At one moment where the driver seems to be out smarting everyone and other times he seems to be too violent. Most of these movies seems to leave a message. The only thing I got from this is how one person's life seems to ruin a lots of lives. The plot was obvious and action kept me on the edge of my seat.

It is a quiet and thoughtful film, almost meditative. Ryan Gosling plays the Driver (his name is never mentioned in the film), a young man that works part time as a stunt driver and part time as a getaway driver. He decides to help out a neighbor and gets himself involved in more trouble than he expected. There are only a few action scenes, but they are incredibly well down. They are tense, exciting, and meticulously assembled sequences. The rest of the film is much slower paced but it works perfectly. It builds the characters and adds depth and an emotional element that other movies of the same genre lack. Gosling is superb as the Driver, his character is quiet and withheld but you can really sense the emotions he has bottled up inside. The film is directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, whose previous film, ""Valhalla Rising"", played like an existential Viking saga. ""Valhalla"" was visually stunning to the point that it was mesmerizing to watch, but its incredibly slow pace and lack of emotion made it fall short of being really good. With ""Drive"" Refn has found the right blend of pacing, cinematic spectacle, and character study to create a smart, moody, beautiful, and intense film. If this is the kind of film that Refn has in store for us in the future, then the future looks very bright.",Drive

No contest, honestly. I didn't have the highest expectations going into the theater, but I figured it would at least be a decent film. My expectations were exceeded, in the greatest fashion. I absolutely loved the movie, and instead of decent, I got PHENOMENAL.It moves at a slow pace, yes, but it is so damn mesmerizing and alluring, you can't help but continue to watch. As the film goes on though, the pace seems to pick up a bit. The action bits are amazing. They come out of nowhere, with brutal gore. It really enhances the experience, in my opinion.The acting is top-notch. Gosling gives a great performance as the Driver, even though he utters very few lines during this film. The emotion in his face and eyes are what really shows the character. Everyone else is great as well, with some great performances from Albert Brooks and Carey Mulligan.Perhaps my favorite part of the film, is the musical score. It has a retro 80's feel to it, and one particular song I just couldn't get out of my head. It's great stuff. The cinematography is great as well, it is really well shot.

You could really see that he feels terrible after he stomped the Hell out of that guy's head in front of Carey Mulligan. The chase scene in the beginning was done well. It's not like a Transporter chase scene where he just drives off. It was really about timing and really blending in the crowd. The chemistry between Gosling and Mulligan was unique. It proves that you don't need to talk so much to be in love. Ron Perlman was also amazing. When he's angry you know he's angry. Everyone in the cast was amazing!

692,bg11215-366-263177,I have mixed feelings about this film.,5,7 April 2013,"On the one hand, there is some directorial brilliance in it, and the cinematography is brilliant. It's beautifully stylized, the work of an auteur. However, it also contains some EXTREME violence, to the point that it was very disturbing to me and I wished I hadn't seen it (the motel scene, elevator scene to name but two of the five or six scenes containing extreme violence). Some people might be able to stomach it, but it was so gruesome & graphic that I really truly wish that I hadn't seen it. I am of the opinion that excessive violence is not needed to tell a story.Moving on to the actual story, I found that it dragged in places, particularly around the 30-40 minute mark, where I began to wonder ""is this going to go anywhere""? Then the story lines slowly developed, but remained however a bit under-developed. But for the kind of movie that it is, I don't think this is particularly a handicap; this type of violent action thriller doesn't need a deep story; some high speed car chases and shootouts apparently will do just fine. Ryan Gossling's understated portrayal of his character was both a bit confusing and brilliant. He says so little during most of his scenes that it had me wondering, ""is there any emotional depth to this character?"" That question was soon answered in the way that Gossling proceeds to pick off his adversaries one by one, which was kind of bad-ass. Part of the main story line was a bit muddled (for me anyway), and again, I just wish that I had known about the violence ahead of time so that I could have looked away during certain scenes. Extreme violence is apparently this director's trademark. To summarize: again there was some brilliance in this film, but I wish that they had focused more on developing the story and in finding alternate ways of portraying the story than resorting to the shock value of such extremely disturbing violence. That's why I only gave it 5 stars.",Drive
693,rajiv_master,Nothing Extraordinary....!!!,5,25 January 2014,"An average movie,nothing you haven't seen before,can be avoided.Action sequences are few and far between and the story itself is done completely by the numbers; excavating only stereotypical behaviour and gratuitous violence from the flimsily drawn out characters. Think of a Tarantino movie you liked, then strip away the interesting characters, the music, the daring plot and sharp dialog. What is left is good cinematography and an incredibly cool choice of font for the end credits.There's no shortage of great performers in this movie, and they're mostly wasted. Ron Perlman is so awesomely menacing! And so completely under-written! And what's there is clichéd! God, what were these people thinking? Bryan Cranston has a supporting role as Gosling's partner/boss. A huge opportunity is wasted when his character's interest in the stolen money is just casually discarded. That might have actually GONE somewhere. As a ""Breaking Bad"" fan, I know just how good he can be, but the writing here is nowhere near as good, and his character, as well, is left adrift.First the good: Drive is cast with excellent actors. Now for the bad. Based on this picture you would not know that most of the cast could act at all. Gosling's performance makes wooden seem lifelike. This must be due to direction because Gosling has been in several recent pictures and has acted up a storm in all of them. Gosling, Mulligan, Cranston, Brooks, and Hendricks are all interesting, accomplished actors. My question is: how did they get sucked into this horrible picture? Either the script that was shot was different from the script they read, or they had guns pointed at their heads.",Drive
694,seanconnery_62,Best film of 2011,10,25 October 2011,"Nicholas Winding Refn is best known to me as the director behind the hard hitting ""Pusher"" trilogy. He recently came out with ""Bronson"" and ""Valhalla Rising"". With the latter one not being very impressive, though I really was looking forward to see his American take on cinema. And Refn has a thing for brutal violence and stylish directing and for that reason, it does suit his latest film ""Drive"" perfectly. Hands down... Drive is a stunning film. It's like a homage to all the cool flicks we've seen in the 70s and the 80s. It has a gripping story, well written characters, great direction and a cool soundtrack. Here we have a film that respects all these elements. The pace of the film may seem a bit slow for some moviegoers, but frankly, It really suits the films nature, unlike George Clooney's ""The American"" which was painfully slow. However, when the Action scenes kicks in, they're pretty intense. The car-chase in particular between the Ford Mustang and the Chrysler C300 was a well executed scene, making it one of the best car chases I've ever seen on film. Also I was impressed with the ""Elevator scene"", beautifully shot, gripping music, and when the fight breaks loose, It's very brutal. Ryan Gosling is fantastic as the silent Driver, he really reminds me om Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood. Albert Brooks was terrific too. Carey Mulligan was great as well, as so was all the other actors. Ron Pearlman in particular was not to bad either. ""Drive"" is not for everyone. If you're expecting a ""Fast and the Furious"" or ""The Transporter"", Look elsewhere. Because here we have an Action-drama that may well be the most realistic flick I've seen in a very long time. Stylish, Gripping, Cool, Ultra-violent, intense... ""Drive"" is Oscar worthy material.",Drive

How he successfully portrayed this complex lone quite kept to himself character but delivers tons of emotions and thoughts through body language and looks and in some points, witty eyes. Simply, BRAVO !!Supporting acts are not to be disregarded as well specially from Carey Mulligan. They delivered this inner connection, fights, caring and acceptance of separation with a very less amount of words.If you need a trailer, just get a glance at the elevator scene,it tell it all.Cinematography was good, shortened dialogue in content but rich in impact, Music was FANTASTIC and moving.To sum up, a great work of art, a Gosling piece of art.",Drive

Unfortunately the movie failed to deliver on any front. It took over 40 minutes for any semblance of a story to form, and even then the emotional depth of the characters was tenuous to say the least. The main character is almost impossible to identify with considering for the entire film he says perhaps 100 words, and we get no back-story to determine why acts the way he does.

Ryan Gosling is one of my favourite young actors (this is why I watched the movie) but his performance in this movie was sub-par. He portrayed a taciturn, overpowered and ""mysterious"" stuntman with a poker face (in most situations) punctuated by long and ""meaningful"" silences. Ridiculous, unreal and parody like. What really saddened me is the score of 8 given by IMDb readers. For me this was the last time when I am using IMDb score as a an indicator of quality. This is not a matter of taste.

707,EamesTheForger,"A violent, stylish film with a real heart; Refn is a director to keep an eye out for.",10,8 October 2011,"'Drive', a film by Nicholas Winding Refn (Bronson), has the makings of a cult classic. Ryan Gosling plays a man who simply 'drives'. He performs stunts in vehicles for Hollywood films, but he makes his real money as a getaway driver. 'Drive' is a film of two acts; the first, in which the driver becomes involved with a married woman, Irene, and her son, sets up the second, in which he must protect her from chillingly ruthless mobsters. 'Drive' is one of those cinematic experiences that you pray will never end. So great is the atmosphere created in the film that it invades your thoughts for days after having watched it. Something about the slow pace, sleek visuals and electronic soundtrack transport you into this glossy yet dangerous LA underworld. The film is clearly influenced by classic such as 'Bullitt', 'Goodfellas', and 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly'. Despite this, 'Drive' is an absolutely unique piece of cinema which is certainly no less than the sum of its parts. Unlike many recent Hollywood offerings, 'Drive' is a film that is directorially bold. Nicolas Winding Refn seeks both clarity and originality in the film's key moments. The opening scene is a getaway chase, but instead of fast cuts and meaningless explosions, Refn treats his audience with more respect, creating a slow, tense escape scene which is vastly more satisfying than a simple display of technology. The reason this works is because the film carries genuine emotional suspense, and we care about what happens to the characters, something that is actually rather rare. Gosling's character, known only as 'Driver', is a superhero of sorts. Much like Spiderman or Batman, he has two personas: the quiet, caring stunt driver by day, and, when he dons his scorpion jacket, the cold, calculated getaway driver by night. As a character he is easy to admire. He is often silent, always thinking, and handles danger with calmness and skill. Despite the fact that he is on the wrong side of the law, towards the end of the film we see the driver as a victim of his own nature and sympathise. Irene's husband gets into serious trouble on release from prison, and the driver offers his assistance only to become tangled up in a seemingly never-ending web of organised crime. Be warned; the story darkens, yet of course continues to enthral.",Drive
708,marijumanji,There is half of a good movie here...,6,11 June 2012,"To be sure, Drive has it's moments. The actors don't let the material down at all, this is a clear case of an editor not knowing when and where to trim. The movie contains a half dozen exceptional set-pieces, but mixed with this is some dialogue ""so corny it would make the pope weep"" and long boring stretches that make the viewer want to yell ""step on it!"".The mortar holding the project together is a unique score by Cliff Martinez that adds an eerie 80's vibe to the entire thing. Bryan Cranston is decent but isn't given much to work with. By the time Albert Brooks waddles into frame for the 2nd or 3rd time I was thoroughly bored. Despite the hype and aspirations to be something greater than it is, Drive suffers from childish dialogue and bad pacing. The opening scene is truly awesome, it's too bad they can't follow it up at all.There are plenty of interesting bits in ""drive"" but the whole is weaker than the sum of it's parts.",Drive
709,steph_jt,Soo slow and boring!,1,7 October 2011,"I have no idea how this movie has received such glowing reviews. Gosling appears to be heavily sedated throughout the movie, and the virtual lack of dialogue through the majority of the film just adds to the overall boring experience. Overall it's a movie about nothing with no message at all, and it ends by leaving you with no sense of closure or understanding of why you have been subjected to such a depressing experience. If there was any message at all, I would say it was that life sucks and then you die, or crime doesn't pay perhaps, but overall that's a little bit too Disney for my tastes, but perhaps this will appeal to the masses? Do yourself a favour, and spend your time watching something else, or at the very least take some Valium to get yourself in the correct frame of mind for this slow-paced, self-indulgent offering. No Stars.",Drive
710,ajlara79,"Good plot, excessively bloody",5,4 February 2012,"The plot of this movie is excellent. A quiet, lonely guy who is a skilled driver although a delinquent and violence-able man is at the same time a nice fellow who voluntarily helps the husband of a woman he is very fond of in driving him in and out of a heist. Unfortunately for him, things go very wrong. Mere chance puts him in the way of the mafia people that are sponsoring him for a car racing team.The movie however is extremely graphic, during the first forty minutes nothing too violent occurs but suddenly the driver (Gosling) turns berserk and in personal defense becomes a killer himself. What started as a movie of a stunt driver / car mechanic who at night works as a driver for thieves turns out being a story involving the worst kind of mobsters you could think of. The shift of the movie takes you unexpected although the slow pace of the beginning surely makes you suspect something has to go wrong at some point. Now, overall a good movie but I think that the violence and explicitness is just too much, it it is really unnecessary and I can only guess it was done this way to make it more impacting to viewers.",Drive
711,ford_guy20042000,What is it about this movie that the critics love? Honestly?,2,13 June 2012,"From the moment Drive starts and the lovely pink cursive credits come upon the screen there is a dragging feeling. Will the credits ever end? My wife and I watched this together and almost in unison we questioned..""What's up with the pink writing?"" The point being that the credits are that intrusive to illicit a response from two people. And we found out...it sets the tone for the whole movie to go on too long.I am all for acting...and I will watch a 4 hour movie...or a miniseries in one sitting...IF it's good. In my opinion this was not good...it had the potential to be good. Ryan Gosling is a great actor. But Drive was not a vehicle for him to be that actor. There was a point when I turned to my wife and said ""Is he ever going to say something?"" And then of course he opened his mouth to make me look like an ass.This continued throughout the course of the movie. His silence did not further the story it made it painful and dragged it down. There was such long pauses between him and Carey Mulligan that it physically hurt to just watch them stare at each other. They would stare, then smile, then stare, then smile, and then stare some more.Carey Mulligan is a beautiful young actress who was COMPLETELY underused in this film. She could have been a much stronger dynamic in the film...however the director just simply chose not to. Which leads me to really wonder if she was miscast. I thought she was beautiful in the film and her demeanor, personality and beauty did not translate into a Denny's waitress married to a Mexican petty criminal. I didn't feel it.Bryan Cranston is another one that is a GREAT actor, but he played his character too twitchy. His focus on money seemed odd when knowing the cars he has and the garage with tools and equipment, plus building and land are probably worth A million plus. And to run your business for that long and then be THAT stupid. Well...you'll see if you watch. At least out of his stupidity it did make a situation for Ryan Gosling to actually talk.Ron Perlman is one of my favorite actors, but fell short in this role. He plays the Mob partner of Albert Brooks. Who did the most he could with the material given, but then again you are left thinking how are these people this stupid? Not to give away the ending but it is one of those that leaves you saying to yourself ""This is it?"" I understand that they tried an artsy approach, and were trying to be brilliant with it. That's fine as long as you have story, dialog, and acting to back it up. It just goes to show that the ""paid"" critics wouldn't know a good movie if it swam up their urethra.",Drive
712,b_evans,Drive on,3,8 December 2012,"How is it that terrible movies like this consistently get fairly high rating on this site? Anyways on to the review.Overall - Bad movie, this movie is slow paced, meaningless, lacking in characters and plot, and attempts to cover this up with a ton of music.1. Gosling takes ages and ages to respond to anything, and for no reason. None of the dialogue in this film is particularly meaningful or dramatic, yet it takes Gosling up to half a minute to answer simple questions, and he does this for the ENTIRE movie. It drags basic everyday conversations into drawn out moments of awkward silence and makes Ryan come across as some sort of serial killer.2. Slow motion overload. For a film called drive there isn't a lot of speed to this movie. Every other scene is shot in slow mo, and for seemingly no reason. Every time Ryan turns his damn head it becomes slow mo time.3. Flimsy plot doesn't hold up. This storyline is crap, it is pretty basic, but because the underlying plot is so basic and it is so drawn out it is like watching an epic c rate movie. Epic as in slow and pretentious. Even the parts meant to be meaningful are not. Such as the last violent part, the one before that, the central conflict. Basically a criminal guy puts some money down on a race car so that Gosling can make some money driving it and split profits. His apparently retarded brother/partner or something decides he will steal from the East Coast mafia by knocking over a pawn shop. Correct, criminal masterminds best idea is robbing a pawn shop? No, he will actually set up a pawn shop robbery and then double cross them. But not until they get the money into their car, morons.4. Violence in this film is gratuitous when it happens, which is rarely. I get the feeling they put it in just to keep people awake from all the slow mo shots of absolutely nothing going on while shitty music blasts.5. I should have put this one first, don't see this movie because it take FOREVER for literally NOTHING to happen, as well as dragging out a fairly simple storyline that could have been done in half the time. Also, no real character development, at all.",Drive
713,jakelanda1994,Driver a dud,6,23 January 2012,"Despite all the great reviews that have been put out about this film, I'm not buying it. In fact, the only reason i kept watching was that Ryan Gosling and Carey mulligan are probably my favourite actor and actress of this generation of film. I think the cast carried the film, which itself was dull and unbelievable.Credit where credit is due, I think the actors, sound guys and camera crew all did stellar jobs. Where Drive falls down is the script, and the direction. The film is riddled with long awkward shots lacking in dialogue that give it an extremely European feel. The whole silent montage thing is fine. However, when you're trying to make an audience believe that Gosling's character (We never learn his name) and Irene (Carey Mulligan) are developing some sort of meaningful relationship, you need more than a few lines of dialogue. I think the best part of the film is they way they develop the driver's relationship with Irene's son. That at least I can say was fantastic. I just can't shake the feeling that the cast was wasted on such a lame attempt to make a great film. The plot is really quite interesting, and it presents some profound moral dilemmas, yet something is just missing. Whether that falls to the editors, the director, the screenplay writer, or any combination of the three, I can't say. All i know is that I really wanted to love this film, and I found myself struggling to even finish watching it. Some people may have been put off by the extremely graphic violence. I think it was masterfully placed in the context of the film. However, if you can't believe that the driver really cares for Irene, then everything that follows Standard's (Irene's husband) release from prison may as well be in another film.So overall a disappointing experience in my opinion.",Drive

What ever the director wanted to achieve with this wanna be artistic expression, he failed doing it. The same goes for the writer, who by the way didn't write much. The same goes for the actors, they managed to get lost somewhere in the art they couldn't deliver. When I look back on the previous year, I see bunch of second grade attempts to sell mediocrity as exquisite film work. On the top of the pile is this, I don't even have a word of it, parody? I deeply suggest not to watch it. It is bad, it is boring, it has failed to communicate with the audience, it has failed on every level a movie can fail. I wasted 100 minutes of my life. 100 minutes that I cannot get back anymore, they are irrevocably gone.I can't explain to myself the high rating this travesty has.

716,robearbarrett,The Return of the Action Hero,9,29 January 2012,"Previous to watching this movie the name Nicolas Winding Refn may mean very little to you, but after establishing himself as a master of atmosphere in his direction of Drive we may see the name much more often. It's easy to link elements of this film to some of his previous work like Bronson, especially in the way the characters are established, But this film being on a larger 'Hollywood' scale it packs a bigger punch.I think the main aspect of this film's originality is the unique 'dream like' atmosphere that's created. The films score in particular helps this with the use of mainly electronic and synth music which gives an 80's vibe to the film and creates real depth to the scenes. A big surprise was the quality of acting provided by Ryan Gosling who gave an powerful but low key performance in which his character was enigmatic and secretive. In-fact the lead role known to the viewer as ""the driver"" acted as the main reason for why i compare this film in many ways to the 1976 title Taxi Driver. Both these films contain a similar narrative structure and lead character personalities with both being played as inconspicuous but deadly under the circumstances of the plot.Drive certainly gives us a return to action films of the past with the focus on atmosphere, plot and emotion rather than on the exaggerated special effects that we have become used to over the past 10 years. It also gives the Director an increased reputation and also spells the end of a good year for Ryan Gosling with both Drive and the Ides of March set to give him a new direction in film.In conclusion Drive is an atmospheric and interesting thriller that provides decent acting quality and a return to the heyday of the old action hero a must watch film of 2011.",Drive

My poor husband (bang, bang, shoot 'em up, foreseeable twists kinda guy) only stayed in the room with the movie because he was tired and nearly asleep. It didn't help that the soundtrack was slightly off sync, so he left eventually left for a prior appointment, but JUST AS ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE. I text-ed him that what he'd been waiting for did eventually happen, and you certainly have to watch the quiet ones..... I LOVED this movie. Not the violence, but I get why it had to be so. I loved the intensity. It was clear that something big was around the corner, you just never knew which corner. About 50 minutes into it, I checked how much further the movie had to go because I was starting to get anxious about what they were going to pack in to the last half hour or so. Great cult-ish sort of classic that I imagine could go easily overlooked in the new cinematic world of speed, echo-blasting music and predictability.",Drive
718,jeffallenhammer,"Drive proves that the best films tell a story through pictures, not words.",8,29 September 2011,"Drive navigates a slippery road with skill and precision. Drift too far right and it falls into a pit of predictability and clichés. Veer too far left, it crashes while attempting to pierce the impenetrable wall created by audience expectation of the Hollywood formula which they've grown so comfortable with.Director Nicolas Winding Refn asks for a great deal of faith from Ryan Gosling in Drive's slow-burn approach. There's little surprise that he gets it, as Gosling was able to hand-pick his director when he signed to play the part of Drive's unnamed wheelman. Refn and Gosling are able to do more with looks, gestures and body language than any film in recent memory. Drive proves that the best films tell a story through pictures, not words. Even completely still scenes with no movement whatsoever pack a punch.Gosling's character is a getaway driver by night, and has two jobs by day; every minute of his life is spent behind a wheel or under a hood. As fate would have it, he meets Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son, Benicio, who need his help. He seemingly tries to resist becoming involved. Ultimately he is too kind to ignore them. Don't mistake the driver's kindness for weakness, he has a very Jekyll and Hyde personality -don't worry, he reserves his bad side for only the most despicable characters. To some, the relationship may seem awkward, as calling Gosling's character the strong silent type would be a vast understatement, but it works fantastically well. Another man (Oscar Isaac) enters the picture and what transpires between the two defies all movie logic, but perhaps is not entirely unbelievable in the real world. The action, drama and comedy switch gears like a well-oiled machine. Refn keeps the action sleek and stealth rather than loud and roaring through the streets. Drive features Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks in terrific mob performances. Expect Drive to have an instant cult following and get Ryan Gosling some major roles.

I was expecting a stellar movie, and I wasn't disappointed; just not floored.If you would like to see a tense crime thriller with emotionally complex characters, go see ""Collateral"" or the masterful ""Heat"". ""Heat"" is a great movie, ""Drive"" is a good movie, and no sane person would disagree with that distinction, star power not withstanding. I liked it and recommended ""Drive"", but it isn't amazing as some people have said. Go see a few more movies, and then we'll talk. Sorry.Last thing I have to comment on is the song selection. Not music, that's fine; but the songs. They are absolutely terrible, end of story. You can make it '80's noir without the stupid pop from the same decade. The songs felt out of place, and too warm n fuzzy. How about something more somber and introspective? Something that reinforces the mood, not distracts. I was distracted by the songs, and they made the movie just feel ""okay"" rather than a truly polished gem.",Drive
722,hammy012,A top-notch crime thriller,8,20 August 2012,"I've had really high expectations for a movie like this. Well... mainly because of the awesome soundtrack, not to mention the positive response from the film-buffs and all that... Pretty much geared-up to watch it anyway. I expected an action movie, with a decent storyline. Yet, it blew me away.Drive is about a mysterious man only known as ""Driver"", who works as a getaway driver for crooks, bank robbers and the sort. He gives them only five minutes to do their job; should they fail, they'll be on their own. He works anonymously, with no regrets about the past jobs he has done, and this makes him more mysterious. When he meets single mother Irene, and her young son Benicio, Driver eventually softens. Here is the portrait of a once mysterious man, then you suddenly get the feeling that he's not as badass as he seems. He helps Irene's recently-out-of-jail husband Standard complete a job to pay off his debts, although this means breaking his moral codes. The heist goes horribly wrong, all hell breaks loose from there, and... well you get the point.The point is, I really understand the people who don't like the film, and were expecting senseless carnage and a fast-paced thriller (I admit that sometimes I do enjoy a Michael Bay film)... Drive is not a movie made for everyone. It's all about the man who does not have a name... it is intended to arouse your curiosity about him, he doesn't say much, you wonder where he's from, why is he here, why is he doing all of this while he can get a full-time legal job. When he falls for the girl, you feel like that's all, but the film catches you off balance as he suddenly begins his transition from a gentle, caring man into a savage murderer when someone threatens the people he loves. There's more than that to him.Director Nicolas Winding Refn deserves praise for his modern-day 1980s classic. The cinematography is excellent; a dark, decaying Los Angeles serves as the backdrop to all the mayhem, while the carefully executed scenes just pile up to an outburst of ultra-violence evoking the B-movie feel, yet, it is never overdone; the makers know how to restrict the violence before it overwhelms the viewer, and instead, it just makes it more fun to watch. This is a stylish, class-A art-house flick; a fresh counter-film to all the movies of today which just features little to no moral complexity in their characters and stunts which attempt to make an audience go ""Ooh!"" and ""Aah!"" while failing to thrill them at the same time.",Drive

724,stfa-1,Style over substance,3,18 July 2012,"Drive is not near half as good as the reviews lets you think it is. The main character is empty, and we don't give a damn about him because we no nothing who he is, and what he feels, which will gain our sympathy. For all we know, the main character could be a mass-murder from New York hiding as a mechanic in Los Angeles. We don't know. But it's totally unexplained how he handles deadly weapons with extreme accuracy. Oh, and the dear widow and poor kid does not make up for us to feel or root for him. This relation is shallow and fabricated. Visually, however, the movie is nicely choreographed, and the music fits the slow progression. Overall, Drive has no tires - in other words: The Emperor has no clothes. The bottom line: Drive does not deliver!",Drive
725,hansflicksmartin,"An incredibly stylish flick that is very successful in its use of pacing. Gosling is superb, showing his darkest side yet and further proving his already considerable worth.",8,13 June 2013,"Nicolas Winding Refn is fast building a proved track record in working with the best young(ish) actors in cinema. Having previously brought a snarling, bestial Charles Bronson to the screen by way of Tom Hardy, Drive now sees Ryan Gosling's moody, enigmatic cool used to full effect.There are a number of factors that make the film stand out from the crowd, though that's not to say that it feels completely original in all respects. The 80s flavour that infused Refn's earlier film, Bronson, is very much present and accounted for. As with that picture, the soundtrack is used to augment the atmosphere, but also to surreptitiously signal changes in mood and action in the plot. This is not in the sense that it's an indication of what the reaction should be, more that it sometimes complements, but at others provides a severe contrast with, the more affectionate moments that take place. Stylistically, too, the production harks back a few decades, title fonts presented in hot pink and the anti-hero's costume just as much of an anachronism as the mobsters that he finds himself entangled with.The movie also has a definite rhythm to it. The first half is packed full with a seemingly ordinary love story, though the mood soon darkens, revealing a much shadier side to both the nameless driver and the film itself. It's this transformation that is the most striking quality of the plot. Gosling morphs from shy young lover to vengeful and ultra- violent in a heartbeat. It's a testament to his skill as a performer that this never feels unnatural, his screen presence providing the impression that he is capable of this kind of brutality, even when sharing tender exchanges with a prospective lover.The pace is fairly sluggish as flicks that find this kind of popularity go, particularly between the opening sequence and the point at which the atmosphere changes. Prolonged shots and lingering focus on some events of the story are conspicuous in the emphasis placed on them. This not only rounds out the character of the driver, but also sharpens the contradiction between the two distinct halves of the film. The latter half pulls no punches in the depiction of ferocious and often sadistic bloodshed that ensues. It's a constant battle for the driver to keep his emotions and boundless fury in check. Once again, Gosling comes into his own here, and it's a joy to watch as he uncontrollably trembles with rage confronting each of his antagonists. These instances punctuate the more deliberately paced scenes perfectly and this amplifies the slightly guilty, heart pounding thrill as revenge is exacted.It's easy to see why this became the sleeper hit it turned out to be and I look forward to the upcoming second collaboration between Refn and Gosling, Only God Forgives, with great anticipation.For more reviews, visit http://hansflicks.com",Drive
726,sujeet100,Don't even bother to watch this if you are in 2020,5,27 April 2020,"I decided to watch the movie looking at the high imdb ratings and boy I regret my decision.
It's just after watching the movie I realized that all the reviews praising the movie were written in 2010 or 2011 when the movie was fresh and audience felt it is something different.
Watch it now and you would realize how boring the movie is.The movie starts with a robbery scene and is the only worthy scene to watch in the whole movie. The plot moves very slowly. The hero feels that speaking less or taking pause of 10 seconds means phenomenal acting.
It's frustrating to see the lead actor behaving so robot like, not a small smirk on his face. He keeps poker face through out the movie which is really frustrating to watch.The only good thing about this movie is some of the aerial shots of the city nights cape and the synth music. Somewhat reminded me of GTA V.Don't waste your time on this just by looking at the ratings.",Drive

728,rpgrosso-1,Might have been an OK film with a competent director,4,20 December 2019,"At one point this movie had a chance of being a decent film. But the director is so prodigiously incompetent that it never had a chance. The director is Nicolas Winding Refn, the same director that gave us Only God Forgives, one of the most tedious, self-important, unwatchable movies I have ever seen. And, unfortunately, his indelible stamp is on this one as well. So, instead of getting decent storytelling, we get overproduced music blaring in our ears at inopportune moments. We get dialogue so laconic that we are forced to scratch our heads and ask ourselves ""who would ever talk like this?"" We get mood and style bludgeoned repeatedly into our senses with the dexterity of a bull moose arranging a china cabinet, the result of which is our craving to leave the theater and go outside to take a walk just to re-experience what the normal world is like. It's as if the director planted a bomb in a style, mood, art, and directing class factory so that it exploded and splattered bits of the indulgences haphazardly all over the screen. It was a directorial mess.If you want to see style in a director watch Stanley Kubrick. If you want to see mood, watch Coppola. If you want to see competence watch Scorsese, Lean, Ford, or the Coens. But avoid watching another movie by this pufferfish of a director. His movies are exercises in missed opportunities. And any movie he makes is an opportunity you should gladly miss.",Drive
729,larsviebrock,7.8? I really don't see why...,6,18 November 2015,"Okay, where to start with this one. The movie is not bad, not at all. What the movie really was on the other hand, at least to me, was disappointing. I always found IMDb-ratings relatively meaningful, of cause with its exceptions. And this is one. One of my favorite movies, Lucky number Slevin, has about the same rating, so expected something.Actual review: The first scene was really cool, some brief information about who we're dealing with and what will await us. We see the super awesome, flawless, untouchable, unemotional hero who never seems to catch a sweat, no matter how tough the situation is. Not a bad start at all, but what you (at least I did so) expect is to learn more about his motive, his origins, weaknesses... What you get though, is almost none of that. Yes, there is some emotionality when he fears that Irene is in danger (especially well done in last scene) At least I don't know why the driver is such a brutal, well trained killer, with absolutely zero mercy and apparently experience in stomping skulls to meshed potatoes, slitting throats and more gore... There was no satisfactory explanation for his skills, emotional coldness and attitude and its origins. Talking of gore... I didn't really see a point in that. Why did the movie have to be that brutal? I didn't see how this fits or supports the plot, it made it rather ludicrous. The bad guys were, IMO, not deep enough, not really interesting and just plain ""bad"".Verdict: It is to say that movie was a bit disappointing, the acting was really good which makes it even more disappointing, that we didn't get much insight on neither the driver nor the bad guys. The death of Irene's husband felt kinda forced to get rid of him, and make the romance happen. The soundtrack and the ending were both good, but didn't make up for the many flaws over the course of the movie.",Drive

Does every movie have to be swirling vortex of continual action? No. Sure, there where a couple of times when I wished Gosling would just say something, anything. But it didn't ruin the whole movie for me.I found this movie entertaining with the occasional slip. Some of the violence was a bit gratuitous, but it was also cartoonishly fake in its own way so it didn't bother me. Also, most of the people who got killed richly deserved to die.The ending was a bit strange in that why would Gosling bother to meet with the bad guy at all knowing he'd be attacked? Why did he leave the money there as he should have known that virtually anyone could abscond with it and he would be blamed anyway?

734,abezerrav,Awesomeness with Style and Heart. Beautiful film.,10,16 September 2011,"Everyone must see this! This is one of the coolest movies (coolest being the operative word here) I've ever seen, and probably one of the best this year. As everyone has said, the film looks beautiful. Some of the cinematography and style reminded me in a way of Wong Kar Wai's ""In The Mood For Love"". The subject matter, however, is obviously different. I should also mention the performances. All perfect. Carey Mulligan as Irene and Ryan Gosling as the lead, the Driver, are amazing with their subtleties and quiet exchanges. Both very good. On the other hand, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, and Albert Brooks were all very loud and/or outspoken, which makes the film perfectly balanced. The music!!! My God, the music! Odd and bold choices, but add so much to the images shown. What I like most about this film, though, is the silent tension throughout many of the scenes. There is one particular scene I love which inter-cuts between a dinner conversation and events that happen earlier that day. Also, that amazing kiss scene in the elevator, followed by a Gaspar Noe-inspired gore fest beating, which will, without a doubt, prove to be one for the books. I'm sure it will be talked about for ages, shown in film schools and inspire many aspiring film makers to start making movies. Probably my favorite of the year, along with ""The Tree of Life"".Unfortunately, some critics might say (some have already said) it is style over substance; that while the film looks beautiful, it has no emotional support to sustain it or make it transcendent. I completely disagree. Mulligan's character provides all the heart the film needs. Her vulnerability and deep love for her son changes the Driver. She is what ""Drives"" him to do what he does. She turns the average joe into a hero, or maybe anti-hero. Even though he is very stoic and not really effusive, he unveils himself to her near the end, and this is the true heart of the film. See, the title might not only refer to steering wheels, shifting gears, and speeding, but perhaps most importantly to the DRIVE that Irene introduces into The Driver.This film is truly a spectacular achievement.",Drive

I still don't understand the reviews. It was like taking a walk through clear jello. More unnecessary pauses and slow motion for nothing but effect....and a boring, needless, effect at that.Replace Carey Mulligan with Michelle Williams and you just have an instant replay of Blue Valentine - another huge disappointment!Critics have been bashing ""War Horse"" by calling it ""The Best Movie of 195_"" It begs the question as to whether a good, solid, narrative, beautifully photographed and told has to take a beating because it is not ""cutting edge"" - whatever that is.

The marketing puts it as an awesome movie full of car chases. IT IS NOT THIS. And in my opinion that it great what Refn has done with this movie is nothing short of incredible. The chemistry between Driver and Irene only makes you want Driver to win more and more. This movie shouldn't and doesn't appeal to the classic dude bro who loves awesome car chases and action scenes Ryan Gosling is playing a genuinely flawed character who is lonely and still fights for the girl he knows he wont get.

I loved his nervousness when confronted with imminent threats and danger. The movie had a simple, clean pure expression. Far above most other movies in the genre. The music was decent, Carey had an innocence well suited for her incorruptible protagonist, the cars had personality, just like the Volvo in ""The World according to Garp.""

Can't believe that after an incredible, methodical, beautifully written and acted tension buildup, the camera literally shies away from showing the climax (filming the shadows of the two fighters instead) and then, all we get is a hero blinking once to show us that he is still alive, yet unfortunately unchanged emotionally. Maybe I'm not French enough to appreciate the minimalism, but I just expected more of an inner breakup not just a hero driving into the sunset with a vague idea of how that spells justice. Isn't running away what he's done all along?

And - whilst the film is very watchable (apart from the extreme violence at the end)it is no ""Taxi Driver"". I think the current rating of 8.2 is not justified by its merits - I would rate it 6 maybe 7. On a more positive note, I think both actors and direction have a lot of potential for more. That is probably the reason why I was disappointed this time. I would definitely look out for future film in this combination.

It was mostly subtle, oftentimes graphic, but when a film like ""Drive"" is shown alongside the dime-a-dozen products the Hollywood Machine is grinding out, it should be respected.I'm not going to persuade you to like it. There are some viewers who can read images the way the director has written with his camera, others cannot. No review can change the aforementioned. Some notice the Goodwill Billboard above Gosling's character when he puts on his mask and connects the two images as more than coincidence. Some may not. Some may notice a small hole in the wall, where a family picture might have been, in between Gosling's character and Mulligan's. Some may not have picked up on the significance of this hole.My point is, this movie isn't for everyone. I don't mean to read as pretentious, but again, this movie isn't meant to be enjoyed as much as it's meant to be observed. Simple as that.

I just though it would be too much like Transporter (Jason Statham)and that film bored me to tears; but, boy, was I wrong! Drive is not a movie, it's a piece of art. My friend convinced me to watch it and I've been thanking him ever since. The film is so stylish and has such a 'noir' feel to it. Definitely the coolest film of 2011. One thing I can guarantee is you'll be after the soundtrack once you see this film. Absolutely perfect. It is so strange, yet it works for the movie so well. Nicolas Winding Refn ceases to hypnotise me with his fantastic direction and dedication to detail. Ryan Gosling truly shows his stuff in this movie. I was so shocked by some of his actions and equally shocked by his mental threshold. His character is stone face and so mysterious, it's great; and he is, of course, supported by some fantastic actors, one definitely being Bryan Cranston... that man is a God!

747,jmclaughlin90,The Best Film of 2011,10,19 September 2011,"Drive is one of those rare gems that is pretty much indescribable. It's hard to identify what type of film this is. It isn't really an action film or a drama. What I can determine is that it's a character driven film that is unlike anything else that has been released this year.The film stars Ryan Gosling as a man only known as the Driver. He has a job as a Hollywood stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver. He gives each person on a deal five minutes and if they are a second too late, he's gone and they are on their own. The opening of the film is quite impressive as it draws you in and shows how much of a professional the Driver can be. He's very much a loner, but he seems to have a pretty good relationship with Shannon (played by Bryan Cranston), the owner of the mechanic shop he works at. The Driver soon meets Irene (Carey Mulligan), his neighbor who lives down the hall in his apartment building. She lives with her son and her husband is in prison, who is going to be released soon. When he gets out, it turns out that he owes some money to some criminals and he asks the Driver to assist him with the deal. Things go wrong and from there, Drive has you in its grip for the rest of the film. It's a slow burn film that can be calm and then, bam, it can turn on you in a second.The performances are stellar. Gosling is fantastic as the Driver. He plays it calm and cool, with sudden bursts of violence when protecting the people he cares about. He doesn't have a lot of dialogue, but he pulls it off so well. I'm not really a fan of Gosling, but he was really impressive in this. Mulligan does well with the small screen time she's given. Cranston is just as great as he is on Breaking Bad. But the one performance that really stands out from the supporting cast is Albert Brooks. He plays Bernie Rose, a crime boss who you really don't want to be on the bad side of. He's quite calm for most of the film, but when he gets violent, it's absolutely brutal. I'm sure he will be getting plenty of attention come award season. He's phenomenal.Nicholas Winding Refn does wonders directing this film. He does it with such elegance in each shot. I definitely need to see some of his earlier films. The cinematography is beautiful. The score is great, sounding like something you would hear in an 80s film. It's the first soundtrack I have wanted to go out and buy since Inception. It sounds great.I have not seen any other film this year that has even come close to this level of satisfaction and excitement. This is a rare film that is just so great and it really sticks with you. As soon as the credits rolled, I knew this was something special that I had just seen. Thank goodness the usual schlock of summer movies has come to an end. Drive kicks off the fall movie season and it brings us the best film of the year thus far.",Drive

I'm a fan of Clint Eastwood who doesn't say much as a part of his usual portraition of characters but this is redeemed by character interaction which I think is lacking in ""Drive"". I don't care about the characters or their interaction and the plot never seemed really interesting.I'm sorry that I cannot share the enthusiasm concerning the fact that Refn, my countryman, has directed this visually gorgeous picture.

I never used to be the guy who gets off on special effects or blockbusters, but there is little to none actually likable features in Drive. I'm not the one to decide if it's worth watching or not, but if you like movies with actual plot and dynamic action, Drive might not be your film.",Drive

He doesn't speak too much and when he speaks he doesn't make threats, he makes promises that the bad guys gonna get it! Just like in Dirty Harry... The movie has this 70's feeling but in a way that will make true cinema fans to look back with nostalgia. You almost expect Starsky and Hutch to start chasing the guy. And Ryan Gostling - he got the idea and played it perfectly. Really, the atmosphere is amazing and the soundtrack is adding to the amazingness of this masterpiece. The main theme, ""A real hero"" from College ft. Electric Youth - awesome piece. I rarely write about movies on IMDb.com, but this one - you should really see it. What are you waiting for?

752,Andrew-J,Excellent film with few annoyances,8,11 February 2012,"Ladies and gentlemen, my review is nearly a year after the fact. I know this, but bear with me, for I must declare this movie to be one of the best I've seen yet. Dubious as I was of Gosling's presence on this project, his characteristic deadpan expression actually worked to his benefit as a strength.The director created a masterpiece of cinematography here, using a great deal of artistic transitions and pans to tell as much of the story as the acting itself. In addition to the technical aspects which created the fantastic environment for this piece, the supporting talent was phenomenal. Christina Hendricks, Oscar Isaacs, Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks took to their respective roles as though portraying their own history. And what can be said about the great Ron Perlman that has not been said already? His character was flawlessly delivered! For a brief moment, I do want to mention the superb job that Carey Mulligan did with her role. All over television, and throughout Hollywood, we see unfaithful wives portrayed. However, rarely have I ever seen such a character portrayed with all of the subtle nuances Ms. Mulligan brought forth. It was truly a privilege to see ""Irene"" as a woman struggling with the incalculable emotional wrenching between her husband and the Driver. Bravo and well done!There is language in this film, as well as violence, blood and gore. My rating is based, though, on the chosen method of ending for the movie as well as one scene of unwarranted nudity. It is a person preference, so take it or leave it, but if there is any form of nudity within a movie, I prefer it to be relevant to the story. In this case, a man sitting in a ""dressing room"" surrounded by ten topless women was unnecessary. For the job that Refn did with the movie as a whole, he did not have to stoop so to so low and obvious a rating grabber as this scene.Now, a word of warning. If you are a fairy tale ending seeker, this is not the movie for you. You will be absolutely disappointed. However, if you are seeking a movie that is at once a flight of fancy, retro recollection and reality-based consequence, see this movie!",Drive
753,maxtricks,A look says more than a thousand words.,8,1 May 2012,"""Drive"" is a movie that was pretty different from what I expected. I was prepared for a good action movie with a little bit of romance. But that was not the case, it was a deep and dark movie about a mysterious protagonist fighting for what he wants. It was very brutal, which at some points felt too much. This is why I ""only"" give this movie 8 stars, because the movie would have been just as good (maybe even a little bit better) without the horrible murders portrayed. But the film makes up for it with it's dialogues, which use a lot of body language and atmosphere. Like I said in the title, the looks sometimes speak more than the words in several scenes, which had a very beautiful artistic effect.I recommend this movie to anyone prepared for a ""heavier"" movie.

The previews would have you believe there's going to be some fantastic car chase scenes but there's really only one and it's not particularly memorable. More annoying however is the complete lack of attention to detail. When Albert Brooks slices Bryan Cranston's arm, ""The Kid"" should find him in a huge pool of his own blood. But it's not even close. Cranston is just laying there propped up against the car, dry as can be. And when The Kid goes to Pearlman's restaurant, why does he need to wear a mask? He doesn't even go in. Just silly attempts at making The Kid seem bad-ass somehow. The character development is laughable. If Albert Brooks is allegedly running LA what is the purpose of Ron Pearlman's character? Is he the Stringer Bell to Brooks' Avon? He's an idiot with no real purpose. In a post Wire world, brooding music and long silences just are going to get it done. This movie was a total bore.",Drive
756,santasvelnyte,Drive,10,3 December 2011,"I was so interested in this movie since that moment when I noticed that Ryan Gosling's in an action movie. I thought it's going to be something not very good. I was so wrong. As I started to watch it, I literally couldn't take my eyes off the screen, I loved everything in there, since the first conversation, which was so uncertain at first, until the last drive in the dark. I tried to compare this movie to others. I can say that some scenes may not be seen by kids or sensible people, like me, I turned away at some parts. But it only added some more charm to it. Somehow all those head blowing moments reminded me of Sin City. I should also say that the whole story was a little bit like Next Day Air, I mean all that confusing money thing. And that jacket.. That jacket is going to be a legend, maybe not as huge as red Rebel's jacket, but still. Cast was brilliant, I think it was literally the best Ryan Gosling's role ever. Even though he didn't talked much, he did an amazing job. And finally he's not only a drama and comedy actor. And Carey Mulligan is just precious, she's amazing at everything that she does. Ron Perlman, Christina Hendricks, Oscar Isaac, everyone was brilliant. I loved the soundtrack, too, but I only noticed music at the end of the movie. It's just because I was so into it and music was blending into scene so perfectly. This is probably one of my favorite movies now and I highly recommend it to those people who love action movies and to those who don't as well. It's not a typical action movie, watch it and you'll see why.",Drive
757,thedavidrowley,Travis Bickle in L.A.,9,26 September 2011,"Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is utterly impressive. It's not often that our antihero can pull off a satin scorpion jacket while still maintaining his pure awesomeness. Anyone who was thinking about possibly seeing this film should stop ""thinking"" and get out and see it.In the opening sequence it's clear that the main character - only given the title of ""Driver"" and no name - portrayed by Ryan Gosling, is not someone to be messed with. We hear his tag line from the trailers about what he does (""I drive."") The car chase scenes are fantastic but what really makes this movie is the characters that aren't built up to much in the trailers. I went in expecting a good action film and what I got was a modern day Taxi Driver. Gosling's character is a man of few words but that doesn't mean he's ignorant. He knows the slime in his city and how they operate.After a pawn shot robbery goes wrong, Driver is left with a bag full of cash and the top dogs of L.A. after him. All he wants is out, not the cash, not a reward, just out. Unfortunately the powers that be don't trust him and what ensues is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat til the end.Filmed in L.A. the movie is a stunner that has everything. The beautiful scenery, impressive action, beautiful woman (Carey Mulligan and Christina Hendricks) as well as a great cast. Gosling does a great job in this film (I'm still unsure if he was the best pick, I like how he played the role I just think he may be too good looking for this character) but it's Albert Brooks that really brings a whole lot of energy to the party. Perhaps he's why I'm reminded of Taxi Driver, except this time he's the one who's making the treats.See this movie. Go go go.",Drive

The Driver: It's only part time. Refn turns his career into a profession, when directing one gut wrenching cinematic experience. Drive is a great way to save 2011's reputation from awful films, filled up with awesome car chases and gory action that will make you jump out of your seat, starting with the very beginning.A placid man works at two things, stunt driving for movies, and escorting robbers in heists. One day his friend Shannon introduces him to Bernie Rose, who wants him for his stock car design. Meanwhile he meets his next-door neighbor Irene, and can't help but fall in love with her. But after helping out Irene and her son, the Driver soon finds out that her husband, Standard, was returning from prison. Soon after arriving, He witnesses Standard being beat up by thugs from his prison, and says that he owes them 10,000 dollars shortly or they'll get to his son and wife. The Driver assuring that he won't let that happen, helps him get that money by doing a heist with him. But then everything goes wrong, leaving it up to the driver to look for the boss of these thugs and make sure Irene and her son are safe.The score gives the movie a ""new age"" kind of look to it, but it was so creative, and perfectly matched up with the film, especially ""Nightcall"" by kavinsky, and ""A Real Hero"" by College. It also makes me look back at Hobo with a Shotgun, being gory and having that eighties resemblance, even though they're nothing alike. Nicolas Winding Refn is new to me (not seeing his earlier work), but when seeing this, there's no doubt in my mind that this guy can make it to the top.Ryan Gosling is at his best so far, giving his lead role as the Driver. Albert does an amazing performance also, playing Bernie Rose, and creates the gruesome and grisly turns throughout the movie. All the other actors were also magnificent, such as Ron Perlman (Nino), Carey Mulligan (Irene), Bryan Cranston (Shannon), and Oscar Isaac (Standard). The Part that surprised me the most was probably in his apartment with Blanche, which sets off an amazing and unsettling switch to it.

After meeting the girl next door - literally - he decides to look after her and her son, Benicio. When the girl's boyfriend - and Benicio's father - gets out of prison, Driver decides to help him out of a jam, by being his driver. Unfortunately, the heist goes wrong, and that is where the real drama begins ...Interesting, that they used huge pieces of The Social Network soundtrack, while the other songs seemed to be reminiscent of the quintessential 1980s action flick, which is appropriate because Drive reminded me of an early 80s action/drama, the James Caan film ""Thief,"" though I liked Thief better. It even had a similar scripted title font, and the endings were comparable, though you won't necessarily guess this one.Drive does have it's ""lapses"" which don't ruin the movie at all. The action and suspense makes up for the lapses. In fact, it also reminded me a little of Luc Besson's ""Leon The Professional.""

And when i got into the mood of the movie i really enjoyed it.Ryan Gosling is great in his lead role - what is also the only really good character in the film, although we do not even know his name. When it comes to non-speaking, mysterious, anti-hero lead characters, there have been many more who used such an possibility to show their acting skills. And Isaach De Bankolé for example was in Limits of Control at least as good as Gosling is here. But he carries the film - no doubt - very well.The movie is highly stylized and focuses, centers, and depends on Goslings Character. The Plot however keeps underdeveloped, some points are not made clear and most of the characters are ""just there to get shot"" at some point. Not even the Drivers love-interest gets really fleshed out, but her son shares a nice immediate friendship with our male lead.All in all it is a film about atmosphere, style and a super-hero.

765,AndyWakes,Ryan Gosling drives...and silently broods (a lot!),7,6 January 2015,"While ""Drive"" is a decent and occasionally brilliant film, it fails to live up to its rave reviews. The first act of the film (especially the opening scene) is excellent. However, the mood created by the first act quickly turns into an occasionally exciting but clichéd (and unnecessarily gory) bloodbath. I have no problem with graphic violence (it can be used for brilliant dramatic punctuation, like in ""The Departed"") but here it seems unnecessary and distracting, possibly to make up for the film's plot holes and all too familiar storyline. The tremendously talented cast is mostly wasted here, with Ryan Gosling (who probably has no more than 20 lines of dialogue in the entire film) spending most of the movie with the same dead-pan look on his face, staring pensively into space. Albert Brooks does breathe some life into the film as an unpredictably violent gangster, but it isn't enough to elevate the film's inert and meandering script. The film also fails to build on some intriguing premises introduced in the first act, like the driver's unexplained policy of only allowing his customers (usually criminals) five minutes during getaways. While I was initially blown away by the film's visual flair, in retrospect this film seems like a standard issue revenge movie pretending to be an art movie. It's atmospheric and brilliantly shot, but lacking in the deep philosophical explorations and dramatic tension that it seems to promise.",Drive
766,togutas,Bang!...................Bang!..................,8,2 March 2012,"...is about as good an explanation of the structure of the film as I could come up with.Firstly, if you want a conventional story, coupled interesting dialogue this and over the top performances this is not for you. This is a film of scenes and atmosphere above all else. The thing I was reminded of most when watching this was listening to your favourite album of which you love every single song, on a CD, where there are 3-4 second pauses between each song. Most individual scenes are absolutely top notch stuff being expertly composed, with camera work, lighting and all other aspects of mise en scene working in perfect unison to create a visual feast with some of the most effective use of sound since There Will be Blood. Yet the way the songs or scenes are linked is basically non-existent with long pauses that will either annoy or provide a moment of calm before continuing to the next scene. This may be a deal breaker for a lot of you and looking over previous reviews this is the most common complaint along with the awkward dialogue. It would be stupid of me to defend the dialogue or lack-there-of with an argument like 'Oh but it's supposed to be like that,' because substance is always more important than style and entertainment should not be sacrificed for anything, but this again serves a greater purpose. This pause works extremely well at creating a jarring effect against the scenes of passion, action and extreme violence giving these scenes overall impact far greater as a result. This is a film of individual moments and the overall experience (if that makes any sort of sense) and not how they are linked together. But to be honest, what do you remember of a film after you watch it? The individual moments and the overall experience. And these are astonishingly effective and will leave a lasting impression for years to come.

The dialogue between Driver who in which is Ryan Gosling and Irene (Carey Mulligan) who in which is the Driver's neighbor very quiet and they are not full of words, but you can really see the chemistry between these two characters which I like. Driver is pretty much willing to help Irene out while she's a single mother.

771,Hausmannsgate,More than it appears to be,8,29 January 2012,"When I was a bit younger I would valiantly work my way through almost every recommended film that came my way, regardless of genre or plot. But as I have gotten older, and time available has gotten smaller, I find myself lacking the patience for the more unconventional genres, or stories that don't interest me. When I read about this film it did not interest me one bit, and it held the promise of being unconventional, so I let it slide for quite a while. Despite awesome reviews and friends telling me it was the best thing they had seen in ages. It's about a stuntman who also moonlights as a getaway driver. He falls in love with a girl, but she has an ex-husband who is in trouble with some gangster. As this becomes a threat to the girl and her son, our stuntman offers to help, but everything goes wrong. The idea that it was about a stuntman made me think about the tedious encounter I had with Tarantino's Death Proof. And the entire gangster genre has in my mind just spawned too many films. One grows tired of it. Yet, after many months of hesitation, I finally decided to sit down with this film, thinking that it might yet prove to be worth my time, and I am glad to say it did. One thing I liked about this movie, was the fact that we never learn the name of our hero, and we never learn anything about his past. A bit like in the film Taken, with Liam Neeson, we first perceive him as quite a vulnerable type, but as the plot unfolds we learn, in part through some quite violent scenes, that we underestimated him, and possibly what kind of movie this is. It catches you quite off guard and serves to make the character even more mystifying and interesting. As for his relationship to the girl, this is one of those few films were two characters say very little to each other, but still manage to convey romance.Apart from Taken, one could also compare Drive to films like Heat and Taxi Driver. Like these films, Drive has a wonderful cinematography, set mostly in the dark lit streets of LA. It has an astonishing soundtrack, which renders the film a melancholic backdrop that it needs in order for us to take it seriously. Without the artistic framework this film would have been a mediocre thriller. So, if you are like me, and have your doubts about whether or not to see this film, for one reason or another, my tip is to give it a chance, especially if you enjoyed films such as Heat or Taxi Driver. I also compared it to Taken, but despite having a somewhat similar story, Drive is a much darker and deeper film, and having love for Taken does not automatically make this a film for you.",Drive
772,heavymetalmouth91,'Drive' Review by Heavy Metal Mouth,9,28 September 2012,"Drive combines several unique stylistic elements and excellent character performances in a rare art-house thriller which stands among the very best films of 2011.Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson, Pusher Trilogy) and based the book of the same name by James Sallis, the story follows an anonymous central character played by Ryan Gosling, known only as 'The Driver'. Working as a Hollywood stuntman by day and getaway driver by night, Gosling begins a close friendship with his sweet neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benicio, while her husband is away in prison. However their blossoming relationship is brought under threat by a job gone wrong involving small time mobsters Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Pearlman).Gosling plays the unnamed protagonist to perfection in a reserved performance which slowly reveals the true nature and identity of his character over the duration of the film, exposing a composed, sensitive yet highly explosive figure capable of extreme action when forced by circumstance. Mulligan is also exceptional as the gentle Irene, conflicted by her devotion to her marriage and her growing feelings toward her protective new love interest, while Bryan Cranston puts in a strong performance as the Drivers manager, mentor and friend.However the real highlight of Drive is the wonderfully stylish direction by Refn, creating a 1980's like vintage setting which is perfectly complimented by the atmospheric, synth driven soundtrack, composed by Cliff Martinez. The late night L.A street shots combined with spontaneous, extreme scenes of violence throughout the film suggest a likeness to a hyper-stylised version of Taxi Driver, a bold comparison perhaps yet a justified one; Gosling seems obsessively consumed within his character, much like Robert De Niro's disturbing portrayal of Travis Bickle in the 1976 classic.Ultimately, the blend of fine character acting, Refn's slick direction and Martinez' outstanding soundtrack makes Drive a unique work of art and an instant cult classic. A must see film for this year. Find this review and more at www.hvymetalmouth.blogspot.ie",Drive
773,TyTanner,Not enough substance,6,16 July 2013,"Drive is considered an art-house action drama feature, a tribute to car film's of a bygone era and is inspired by many other retrospective films.Writing and directing these types of movies like Drive (which pay respect to older features) is always high risk but handsomely pay off if they are produced well and have their potential fully realised (for example: Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof).Somewhat regrettably, Drive did not work to great effect as a stylish, neo-noir film inspired by Grindhouse influences, because it lacked true substance.I wanted to like the movie because one; it was recommended to me and two; because I rate director Nicolas Winding Refn very highly for his host of good films. For me, this wasn't his best, but I don't blame him entirely, in fact I blame in most part, the writer.Drive has some terrific moments no doubt, which include some fantastic graphic scenes rich of violence and gore and a soundtrack that has a retro-stylish and 80s theme to it.But I believe the film was too scarce and deficient in substance. When I say substance, I am referring to the interest in the story/plot, the characters and their development and the overall engagement with the film's audience.I failed to connect with the characters, had little if no interest in what happened to them and was unmoved and uninspired by the story, which is a shame.So this is where I blame the writer for not developing the characters enough. And I also blame the actors for not selling their part. It might be harsh but I believe it to be true. Unfortunately, I did not even feel much sympathy for the wife/mum Irene (Carey Mulligan) or her young son Benicio (Kaden Leos).I didn't think too highly of The Diver's (Gosling's) performance either and that may have been due to the fact he was given very little dialogue. Gosling's limited dialogue worked in some scenes, but not in the most part because he failed to build any kind of relationship with me (the audience).If you desire to see a superb Gosling performance, may I suggest Refn's 'Only God Forgives' which he both wrote and directed. Hint, hint. Now that film is a true visual masterpiece and draws you in brilliantly. Compelling viewing, to say the least. I also recommend watching 'The Place Beyond the Pines,' directed by Derek Cianfrance. Gosling is still a stunt driver but far more convincing in his role, and the movie itself is brilliant.But I digress.The styles and influences that Drive employs (including film noir and comic gore) have been quoted as ""a bizarre concoction... reminiscent of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive... and Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, (reviews from the Cannes International Film Festival).Really? Mulholland Drive (a surrealist neo-noir film) and Pulp Fiction (a non linear, stylized black comedy/crime) are two masterpiece films that deserve to be recognised, as I'm sure they are, in their own right. Drive may attempt to draw on some of the styles and cinematic techniques from those two features, and does well in some aspects, but is not exactly reminiscent of them.I have given Drive a rating of 6, one; because it does deliver some well orchestrated scenes, builds tension and is backed by a good soundtrack (credit to Cliff Martinez) and two; because you can't give half-ratings on IMDb. Ideally, I would have given it 5.5 but I am feeling generous today. Tomorrow I might have given it a 5.",Drive
774,JBrockerDUDE,disappointing.,3,14 April 2013,"This film really had me expecting something action packed, dramatic, and intense. Instead it left me feeling dazed, tired ,and bored. This film had No plot, Very anti climactic action and violence scenes, and the dialogue was awkward and uncomfortable. The music was terrible, and it had almost no driving scenes at all. Really over rated, and misleading. I'm not one to judge another opinion, but i can't see how one can find this movie a masterpiece. It was very slow, and the story and characters developed very poorly. All in all, very boring film, and very disappointing. Only good thing about this movie was the very little violence. I wasted an hour and 37 minutes on this boring piece of crap, when i could have watched a good movie.",Drive
775,kulpank,Decent Effort,7,16 July 2013,"Drive is a dark crime drama. It is story about an unnamed driver (Ryan Gosling) known as The Driver. The plot no provides no background of any of the characters and builds a premise from the present. The driver is a silent no non-sense guy. He works in a mechanic for a crippled body shop owner. He works as a stunt driver by the day and as a getaway driver for criminals by the night. He has strict rules about his getaway heist. He does not take part in the crime and provides only a set time window for the act. His life changes when he bumps into his neighbor (Carrey Mulligan) and her son. He falls deeper than his depth when he helps her recently prison released husband. The movie has many violent action scenes. The cinematography is like that of 80s-90s gangster movies. It tries to emote more with less words. The characters are built with no background information and the emotions are subtle and unstated. Ryan Gosling as the Driver is good. He tries hard to appear dark mysterious and dangerous, and succeeds to a limit. With handful of dialogues he manages to ante up the tension or with a small smile makes himself appealingly. All of his transitions into various modes are smooth and almost seem to flow. The supporting cast works well. The film has a retro appeal about it. It is effective without the use of smart dialogues or loud music blaring in the background. Its not a genius plot or film but the movie is still worth a watch.",Drive
776,kooser,Taxi Driver meets Citizen Kane.,10,26 October 2011,"Incredible - astounding - genius! Martin Scorsese (pumped up on Scorsese Juice) on his best day, maybe... maybe, could have made this film. The casting, acting, lighting, score, set design, wardrobe, continuity are all superb. Beyond that, in a realm of it's own (where only Angels dwell) the cinematography, lighting and (most of all) editing are beyond words - inspired, even genius. The film is beautiful in every way. There is not a second of dead space. The acting and directing are subdued to the point of cracking. The script is intelligent, crisp, taut, naked and censored of bullshit. The violence is visceral – most disturbing not in its graphic display but in its contextual presentation. Never gratuitous; never senseless - the violence hurts most because it is exactly what it is and nothing more. Albert Brooks says ""It's OK, it's OK, no more pain, it's over"" an we want to crawl under our seats until mommy wakes us in the morning and tells us it was just a nightmare. Who resurrected Gregg Toland, Robert Wise and Bernard Hermann to photograph, edit and score this film? Who brought the young Orson Welles, Frank Capra, Sam Fuller and Francis Ford Coppola together to direct this masterpiece? Drive should be mandatory viewing for every film student for the next 100 years. Battleship Potemkin, Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Drive: This is our world in miniature.",Drive
777,james-965,Highly overrated,6,2 March 2013,"So disappointed.Before heading into this movie I checked the reviews on RT and here. Assumed it would be an underrated movie for the mass market and right up my street.This was definitely not to be the case.The characters were poor and under developed, the interaction between cast dull and without chemistry. Story-wise it was terrible. Logic holes you could drive a tank through, tenuous reasoning, cheap macguffins with no believability about the circumstances of any character.I thought the whole ""less is more"" approach for the dialogue fell flat, and actually worked against itself. I was left wanting so much more from the characters back history and personality. It was as if the script writers thought they were smarter than they actually were.On the positive side; the cinematography was excellent, throwback synth-pop juxtaposed nicely and the car chases impressive. However, these facts alone were not enough to class it in the 8/10 category of films. 6/10 purely for the aesthetics - I'd only recommend watching this if you have nothing else to see. You'll feel conned expecting something special.",Drive

Not many people have watched this movie, so the ratings do not reflect a proper sample size.The cinematography in this movie is well done. I really enjoyed the use of mirrors to show secondary characters, and slow camera panning. The acting is pretty decent. But everything else sucks. . .badly.First, this movie moves so slowly you can literally go to the bathroom between when someone says something to the main character, and when he replies. The other bad aspects; the random and bloody violence, the incredibly weak plot, the lack of character development, the lack of detail (the entire movie could be completely covered by a trailer. . .completely), the coldness to the entire movie, the realism, and more.Speaking of the realism, there are manual transmission, V8 sounds in a FWD Chevy impala that the driver never takes his hands off of the wheel to shift.When he gets into an impact in his personal car there is zero damage to his car even though there was major damage on the other vehicle.Skip this one, unless you value your time and money. Fortunately my DVD player still plays sound at 1.5x speed, so I just kept it there most the time and finished the movie a lot faster.",Drive
779,markusendresen,This movie stuck with me,10,13 November 2018,"I saw this film once, on a very small screen on a- Not Netflix, about 1,5-2 years ago. Didn't really get it, but thought it was fine. The g o r e was what drew me msot at that time.
But the main themsong of the film, A Real Hero, has stuck with me. The Driver snapping completely in a elevator stuck with me. The girl quiet stares entices me. It was this summer I saw an analysis of it by Chris Stuckmann, and I began appreciate all details that show you how the Drivers world slowly begins to crumble. This is a character study, and a damn good one, at that.
I finally saw it again a week ago. It is now etched into my mind, and in my opinion, one of the great films of the 21st century. Gosling's terrifyingly quiet performance is mesmerizing, as long with all of the others in the cast. Refn unhinching visual storytelling and direction is breathtaking, not only one of the best films, but one of the best made, as well.

780,putosamofficial,Drive is simply gorgeous to watch,8,16 March 2017,"This movie it's an exponential function. It starts slow by getting all the characters ready and showing their nature and ambitions to later explode, it keeps growing faster and faster. This film is very dialogue-less, it only says what it thinks is needed to say but it pays off on the visuals with consistent cinematography and great use of color. The action scenes feel damn good to watch in my opinion because they are very simplistic, it's not the ultra-budget common Hollywood action movie. Yes, there are car chases and fight scenes but they aren't very explosive, too unrealistic or extremely complex, they feel minimalist and brutal which fits perfectly on the purpose of the film.I find a lot of people either loving or hating this movie with mostly the reason being that the main character is very mysterious. The main character is the driver and we don't get to know his name neither his past and he's also not very talkative, but by doing this we can focus on exploring the main subject of the movie which is the human nature. We see different characters with different intentions and the consequences of living in a world of crime. Some people call it terrible acting, some call it amazing acting, i think it's the right acting for the right characters.",Drive

782,istrategic2000,Painful to watch except for Cranston and Brooks,2,19 October 2012,"Not really any spoilers here. Just minor ones that don't give anything away.The first five minutes of the movie and you think you are in for one heck of a great film. It was smart, interesting and paced wonderfully. Oh how foolish of me.You then get slow meandering movie that goes nowhere. The soundtrack was something out a cheesy 1980's movie. The script is dull and boring and creates main characters that are not interesting and don't do anything. Gosling's character dresses like he's in a Member's Only commercial. He chews on a toothpick and broods throughout the film. No real back story is even given to him, the main character, which is needed. I think he has 100 words of dialog through the whole film. Mulligan is sweet and nice and does what she can as the mom who has made bad choices, but is really given nothing to do.You are then hopeful for the sporadic driving sequences that will populate a movie called Drive, that will make up for the lack of any interesting plot or character development. But guess what, they never come. There are not any scenes involving car chases or anything regarding fancy driving that the character is supposed to be able to do. The one saving grace, albeit a cumulative of 15 minutes total screen time are Albert Brooks and Bryan Cranston. Cranston, with maybe total 8 minutes screen time, 1/2 of which he shares with Brooks brings a performance that is nuanced and epitomizes the ever trying loser. Brooks also with very little screen time gives a great performance, not because he plays against type, but because he goes with the role and makes it his own. The film wants to be a character piece, I guess, but you don't really care about or relate to any of the characters. The good thing for Gosling and Mulligan is that they have made better films with better performances so we can maybe overlook this piece of crap.In the end it degenerates into a revenge movie. You are hopeful for a great fight or cool smart twisty ending, but you get an out of character sloppily directed sequence that confirms the movie you have been watching is garbage. I've seen better endings to a TJ Hooker episode. I wanted to see the movie based on the actors and some of the misguided positive reviews I read. I feel shafted. I love great movies, good movies and even halfway bad ones. This one was painful, avoid at all costs. Drive sucks the tailpipe.",Drive

784,joewilliams-01809,Drive: Short Review,8,17 February 2018,"A very memorable crime drama with a very slow paced film but an amazingly entertaining, it is really due to how well directed and well handled this film is. The visuals and cinematography are beautiful.  The story is well written and the streets in LA was given a life for an overused setting. The characters are interesting, they were given a lot of attention and background that let you sink in and fear for them. The main protagonist is silent and not your wise cracking quipy guy like most of today's, he is confident, comfortable and brave but once he was in danger, I feel the sense of fear in him as he is out of his comfort zone and Ryan Gosling did fantastically even if he has one emotion on the entire film which is impressive. The only gripe I noticed is some scenes dragged a bit and it can be bothersome for some people.The film is well-directed, taking a same old formula from a crime drama and take it into a creative way.It is not action packed nor fast paced, it is slow yet entertaining that let you sink in to the characters and gave you a sense of uncomfortableness if that's even a word.",Drive

787,NoNonSenseGuy,Only for the THINKERS !,8,6 March 2019,"WARNING; if you don't like movies that build on momentum (if you're an impatient person with ADD), THEN skip this flick. If you're not a thinker, and NEED constant action to squelch your nervous tick, skip this movie. This movie moves at its own contemplative pace. FOR THOSE of who enjoy avant-garde imagery and dark work cinema-topography, this movie show-cases Goslings dark brooding and deep acting skill. He's able to go from one extreme mood to another and does it quite convincingly. In One scene he plays a Sappy love-stricken young man who acts like he's just out of high school; in another, his mood and temperament shift to that of a disturbed man with a dark past...a past that he's run from but, only temporirly. Goshling's charater is the type that rarely stays out of trouble for too long, as trouble seems to follow some people. He's only escaped his reality for so long as Mafia types seem to litter his walk as his self proclaimed Vigiante ways lead him on a colission with a destiny that he can't escape. IN another scene, his love interests are smashed by harsh reality of Standard's return to home from Prison. Gosling plays a dark thrill seeker who's not afraid of conflict but is keenly aware of the dangers of poor association with the wrong types of people. Co-Stars like 'Muligan....and 'Cranston (already a hugh star).... played passive characters, ALL did great work in this movie. Drive has a simple HERO type plot 'save Irene from the bad guys.' Gosling does this by implementing his driving talent and no-nonsense personality against Mobster Characters he runs into (not on purpose). Drive is a thriller with a hint of romance and heroism. Its a movie that reminds us that sometimes when you do the Right thing, you end up paying for it (and not in a good way).",Drive

I think humankind has lost its perception about what's good and what's bad in movie industry. With all the Transporters, Transformers, all the Fast and Furious series and the look alike, they give bad reviews about Drive because it lacks all the clichés from the previous mentioned. I feel bad for them because they're blind in front of a masterpiece and cheerful and encouraging to blockbusters made only to appear in cinema just for the money and fame. I admit, I wanted to see this movie because of Ryan Gosling. And once again, he did not disappoint me. I've seen most of his movies and I think this is his best role, yet. I rarely see a performance like his in Drive and when I see it, I know it will be stuck in my mind for a long time. If I wasn't already a fan, I would've become after Drive. The way he plays The Driver was worthy of an Oscar and it's a pity he was not put in the race for the award. I loved everything about it. The director did an amazing job, making this movie. All of the actors were wonderful in their roles and there were some moments absolutely breathtaking. I give it 10/10.",Drive

Let's figure out!Why some movies like that leave the impression of layered and voluminous despite simple story. It's because it has any triggers of success mainstream movie.1. The presence of a lot steps of story developing. Despite quite a little timing, it seems like a long story movie. It leave an unbelievable impression that you lived another live during the watching as well.
2. All character's are appropriate and have a specific relationship with main character. It makes the movie truthfully.
3. Logical construction of story and understandable dramatic end.
4. Incredible cast.
5. Car's theme.
6. Cult soundtrack that was created extremely appropriateBut when we add there a portion of art-house we eventually have a cult masterpiece.
Details that took it:1. Brand-new type of main character (mix of Taxi Driver, Rambo, Terminator and Forest Gump)
2. Unique and unrepeatable style of filming, editing and graphic design.
3. Probably the best neo-noir film in 21 fox.I think the last paragraph is the main secret of success. It's the first neo-noir since «Se7en» that all details come together and we took a real cult movie.",Drive

Desperately trying to make a classic and no where even near a watchable movie! I think ppl here are not honest and are just hypocrites who pretend that this stupid movie is a classic, and in believing so they are of higher intelligence or something, lol!

All in all I was left with a sense of emptiness and a lot of questions for the director. Being the first movie by this Nicolas Winding Refn, but from browsing his other titles this brand of gritty uberviolent flocks doesn't seem to be that far off.First off the good. The cinematography as well as musical score is great. It does a fantastic job of making you feel like you're watching a 1980's movie and I absolutely loved that. From the wardrobe down to set decor this is one of the best examples of taking the viewer back in time and making it convincing. The intro scene as well as first third of the movie also carries with it a great sense of building tension. Problem is this continues on until the bitter end of the movie, with scene after scene of mounting tension capped off with gratuitous violence. Many of these scenes attempt to make Ryan Gosseling the coolest most dangerous man on the planet but I had a hard time believing this. I truly think he is a talented actor but I feel like he was just trying a little to hard and the character never really came through for me and was equally difficult to get attached to.

801,jaycp1979,something very very special.....,10,25 September 2011,"Where to start..? Having dragged my poor younger brother along to the local cinema to see 'Drive', we entred the theatre and it was practically empty, i counted 22 people with us included, and i began to worry that this might, just might, turn out to be a turkey of a movie despite the positive critics reviews i'd read... but then the film started and from the moment it began i was hooked. I literally can't wait until this films comes out on blu-ray so i can add it to my collection. Heck.. i might even just go again to the multiplex so i can convince myself that the mastery i'd just witnessed wasn't in my head and was, indeed, a movie that, in my opinion and my hope, will set the tone for other directors/story tellers for years to come.Like i said, there were 22 of us in the theatre at the start and with the passing of the 45th minute i noticed a few leave... and not return. More fool them. They missed, quite possibly, one of the finest films of recent years.The film is a slow burner, as stated in other reviewers remarks on this amazing film. But, with this 'slowness', the film draws you in.... the quiet glances, the long silences, drawn out and lingering looks leave you on the edge of your set waiting, with breath held, to see just what is going to happen next.No, this isn't an all action, driving, gun blasting flick.. its something much much more... and all the better for it. If that's what you are after, then im sorry but this isn't it... its smarter and, in occasional places, graphically and extremely violent, but in keeping with the whole movie. No gratuitous 'Saw' type violence here.Please go and see this film, especially if you live in the UK where this film should be getting far more attention than i fear it is...

802,gveltman1,A Pure Spectacle,8,17 September 2011,"""Drive"" is visually astounding, emotionally powerful, and revealed with expert style. The dual plots converge in a mindful and deliberate form. Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan prove to be a admirable acting duo. The cast is so uniquely strong. Seriously, how is it that Bryan Cranston is now finally emerging as an actor in films? The same could be said for Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman. Perlman and Cranston, two of the top actors on two of TV's most critically acclaimed shows (Breaking Bad, and Sons of Anarchy), should be forces to be reckoned with in the coming years. Nicolas Refn is on to something here. His use of silence is downright brilliant. Sandwiching silent slow-motion shots in the middle of some of the most intense sections of the film gave ""Drive"" a cinematic beauty that is rarely exhibited. The music may seem out of place initially, but combined with Gosling's attire, and the Los Angeles night lights, the blissfully ripe female voices that penetrate each song will gradually grow on you. Some of the use of Los Angeles as a backdrop seemed to be reminiscent of ""Collateral."" A hot topic of the film is the painfully brutal violence, mostly at the hands of Brooks' character, Bernie. I'll admit, after a while I saw it as a little distasteful. For a moment, the violence started to take on a Tarantino type of feel that didn't match up with the rest of the film. The film is a spectacle nonetheless. The pawn shop scene is BEAUTIFUL. Gosling's and Mulligan's relationship is slow to blossom, with Refn putting purposeful dialogue and action into each shot. The mark of a great director. Watch out. Gosling and Cranston will be considered for Oscars. ""Drive"" will be nominated for Best Picture.

803,meisterjaan,The years most successful failure,7,1 November 2011,"There were some good scenes but overall I think this movie could be entitled the years most successful failure.I can actually see Nicolas Winding Refn (who has also directed ""Bronson"", which was great) sitting in the editing room with the editor and thinking: ""God damn, how was I so blind, how could I not see the flaws in the script, how could I make such simple mistakes. Naah, okay gotta make something out of it. Lets put a lot of cool music!""What disturbed me the most: *The Drivers character was dull and lifeless. Even stoic people are real people, but in the movie, I just saw a sketch. *In some places, the music was a bit off or too dominative *I didn't see any real feelings between the Driver and Irene. Romance was made only with romantic music and the implication that usually people in that sort of situation develop a romance. But it wasn't in the actors eyes. *The movie didn't have a culmination. Don't get me wrong, I hate the Hollywood Aristotle 3-act model, but a story's got to have a peak. ""The Driver"" just started rolling, and rolled smoothly till the end. If the culmination was meant to be an inner one, it wasn't played out properly.It seemed Refn was repeating himself and relied too much on the old tricks - stylishness, brutality and cool music.For me, a mediocre movie - 6.5/10",Drive

The little bit of car action that was included was actually quite silly, with over the top engine noise and Ryan Gosling driving an indestructible car at the end. Secondly, the violence was way too detailed for my taste. If you enjoy watching someone's brains being mashed, then grab your popcorn and beer and enjoy! Did the producer have shares in the fake blood supplier and 'gruesome noise' maker?Thirdly, the plot was OK, but the story dribbled out in erratic fashion and just when you think something is going to happen ....it doesn't.",Drive
806,matthewcraigingle,This movie will get your heart racing from start to finish,9,31 January 2012,"Drive i do admit has to be one of the most heart pounding films I have ever seen in my life. It grips you from the start of the film to end of it. Ryan Gosling coming from The Notebook and Remember the Titans stands out in this film directed by Nicholas Refn. I saw one of Refn's earlier films, Bronson which stared Tom Hardy and I was amazed at the work that Refn put into both films. The feel of the film mesmerized me into thinking this movie is Oscar worthy and might put some big numbers out there. The biggest standout of them all is Albert Brooks. He plays the villain to perfection. I have seen a few good Albert Brooks films which have mostly been comedic films but never seen him in a more serious role than what he did in Drive. If anyone wants to see a good heart pumping, old fashioned car chase movie, this is one movie you would love to watch.",Drive
807,YourFilmWhore,Hyped to death movie that fails to fully deliver.,4,3 February 2012,"Oh Drive, how I was expecting so much more from you. I will never try and pretend that not once did I think this movie was going to be something that could have swept the Oscars (though it has been nominated for one) but I expected something better than what I received. Don't get me wrong, Drive is not horrible, but it is not this supposedly wonderful and defining film that everyone says it is. It is OK at it's best of times, and downright annoying and tedious at it's worst. I think that this is all thanks to the fact that the movie never once gets above it's tepid pace, no the least thanks to Ryan Gosling's just bored sounding delivery. Look, I never thought the man was wonderful, but I know he is above sounding like he is giving a Time Share lecture. Riveting. Oh well, it is nice to know that everyone else has the same bored quality (except Ron Perlman, he is awesome, but not in the movie enough) and then the story is really about as simple as one could expect from a movie that is hyped to crap. It just never once builds up to any tempo nor does it truly get fun enough to warrant a second viewing (unless being bored for a good three quarters of the movie is your thing.) Now, as much as I tear it down, why not rate it lower? Firstly, it really is not incredibly bad with some good gore scenes and disturbing imagery (a bullet being shoved down someone's mouth comes to mind.) But this movie was ultimately killed thanks to it's incredible hype, and failure to really follow through with it. Watch this movie if you only if you are a huge Gosling fan, or think that really crummy acting is your thing.",Drive
808,coltonschropp,Actions speak louder than words,8,21 August 2012,"This is one of those films that targets a niche audience. If your one for the mainstream flicks that Hollywood endlessly feeds us, than there is a high chance that this movie will not satisfy your taste. But if your one for enjoying a grind/art house and or foreign picture, or simply something a bit outlandish, you may find Drive to be a very enjoyable and rememberable film. Its concoction of 80's throwback and modern ambient score meshed with ultra violence, the substitution of body language for words and a traditional crime noir genre picture wrapped in the structure of a fairy tale/super hero story, is what makes this tale unique. If you are a well rounded cinema goer then you most likely will recognize the pastiche of work borrowed (e.g. the man with no name Clint Eastwood character, korean style action pacing, Miami Vice/Bullet/Driver Esq crime plot) This interesting mix is what makes Drive so refreshing. Contrary to the cult following's love for this movie, numerous people have stated that Drive was god awful. But it's not that the movie is poorly crafted, but rather the greater audience simply cant be entertained or understand a film I would classify as introverted. What Gosling and Mulligan share on screen is a strong connection that is shown through action not words. This may not equate to the type of entertainment most Americans are accustomed to and that is one common reason why Drive falls short in the eye of the masses. Other's say the premise is cliché, I will admit I thought the same... but it's the near flawless execution of such common material that makes it so refreshing. Many critics and film enthusiasts love this picture because they don't watch films strictly for entertainment but rather for the craft of filmmaking and the deeper meaning behind the stories and character interactions; Drive is very much a film for the deep thinker. Im not saying it's an intellectual piece of cinema, but rather a movie where you must understand and enjoy the nature of passionate introverts and visual symbolism to really LOVE IT. Drive is easily in my top 5 films of 2011, top 50 of the past 10 years, and top 100 of what I've seen. If you're wondering why I only gave the movie an 8 out of 10 then, its because no movie in my eyes deserves a 10 or a 100% because no movie is perfect and it wont receive a 9 because although I love this film, due to its withdrawn/introverted minimalist nature, it lacks the ability to convey a wide range of emotions that the majority of truly outstanding films deliver.",Drive
809,philip-wrangberg,Intense action with human emotional depth,8,23 December 2011,"At first look, ""Drive"" seems like a typical action movie with car chases and and bad guys, fortunately that is not the only aspect of this movie that contributes to its success. Firstly, it is considered and action movie because of its film nature, as it basically evolves around a man that get involved in mob business. The car chases are well done, and especially not over done. Special effects are not used excessively which contributes to the both realistic and admiring atmosphere of Los Angeles. The story is overall well structured and every character finds their specific role in the movie, without extensive narration. Secondly, this movie, surprisingly, reaches an emotional depth that acted as a major factor to improve both the story and intensity of the film. The protagonist is a silent but passionate character, which can be very hard to succeed with, but Ryan Gosling manages to portray a believable yet admirable performance. Alone, his emotional state provides the building block for his relationships with the secondary characters. Mixed with the cinematography, specifically the music and script, this film goes beyond the common 'car chase' and bonds with human sentiment.",Drive

The whole trailer you see - all scenes where they actually speak are in it, and all that are worthy.

Otherwise, don't waste your money.Look down your snooty noses if you must, but the only people who admire this film are art house elitists who find value in anything that resembles avant garde. Face it, you are sheep just like the rest of us. This movie was overtly packaged and marketed to lovers of action and car chase genre. It does not deliver.First, what is good. The cinematography is lovely. The opening five minutes are a tense, superbly crafted anti-chase chase scene. The settings are stark, but curiously beautiful.From there, the story falls completely apart. Gosling spends most of his screen time staring at people or off into space. His character strains mightily to appear tough and sympathetic, a Bronson-esque righteous vengeance type, but ultimately transforms into a cold and psychotic machine. He is surrounded by equally misguided, wooden characters who are so utterly forgettable, the audience cannot care about them enough to hate them.The plot is ridiculously improbable, full of holes, and descends quickly into a seminar on creative and grisly murder techniques. A complete waste of time and popcorn.Ryan Gosling is, without a doubt, one of the new generation of brilliant young actors. He will delight us in ever greater roles. This isn't one of them.",Drive
813,rockyfanatic9292,Great directing and opening scene,9,21 February 2012,"Going into Drive, I had very high hopes because I have heard such great things. This film is definitely an art house film, and if you like those types of movies you will love this. However for me I did have a few problems with it. For one it went a bit slow, and it seemed like they used slow motion way too much. However the biggest thing I didn't like was the stupid violence they added about halfway into the movie. There are some movies out there like the newest Rambo where I just love all the stupid awesome violence and blood, but this wasn't one of them. The first half of the movie was awesome, filled with story and you could really see the characters develop. Then it seemed like they just decided to throw in some dumb violence and it just didn't fit in with the tone of the movie. Aside from those things, there were some things that I did enjoy. The directing in this movie was absolutely amazing! The director definitely stole the show. I also enjoyed the looks of the movie, it was very colorful and it gave you a sort of 80's feel. It had a lot of old school aspects to it. It had 80's music playing, the settings looked like they were in the 80's even though they weren't. There is one scene in a motel where it made me feel like I was watching an old movie from the 80's. The acting was also very good. Gosling played the stoic character very well, even though he wouldn't seem like it. His character is a man of very few words who just wants to get the job done. I didn't think Gosling could pull that character off, but I was wrong. Albert Brooks also did excellent with his role as Bernie. The only actor that wasn't believable was Ron Perlman as a Jewish/Italian mobster. I think there could have been much better actors that could have played him. The biggest problem with the movie was the stupid unnecessary violence. For the first half of the movie I was really into the story and the relationships between the characters, but the violence brought me away from that. Overall, there are people who are going to LOVE this film and there are people who will think it's the biggest POS in the world. Both have very good arguments and I wouldn't disagree with either side. For me, I'm somewhere in the middle, so that's why I gave it 6/10.",Drive

It forsakes the immature Hollywood conventions of spoon fed expose. A knowledge of the genre and film history helps to truly appreciate this film's value - The Driver (1978)- is an exceedingly good a cue point for the sub culture inhabited by these 'players.' The innocents serve to heighten the chasm between normal life and one where the participants in the 'chess game' play for keeps and death is awfully real. The waitress and her small child bring our reality right into theirs. We feel hot breath of killers up close to accentuate and contrast against a mum with her son unknowingly targeted at the centre of a malevolent maelstrom. Driver successfully coupled the European sensibility of realism and seemingly modest budget, allowing story and the director / camera to be the auteur. The cast hit all the right notes, a top class ensemble performance. Well something like that. As with La Haine (1995)- not a Hollywood cop out - 'Driver' is for grown ups, who are nuanced and well versed in both the history, connections, references and language of film, including TV productions, historically European and rest of the world outside the US, however, notably vastly improved American TV productions are emerging.",Drive

I lost count of the arty silent stares. No music, no script. Count how many lines the 'driver' has in the first 20 minutes. Even I could have learned them in a day. I was completely bored by it. Cheesy and pretentious, maybe some people find the 'art house' style attractive but its a big budget movie. A movie has to have some redeeming features, some ways of entertaining or standing out from the crowd. This movie will be more a 6 star in 2013, and not the 8.7 its got now.

Why wasn't this nominated for the Oscar for best picture, direction, screenplay, actor? It has a higher user rating on IMDb than everything except Hugo and The Artist and a higher rating on Rotten Tomatoes than everything but the Artist, Hugo, and the Descendants, so why no love, Academy? I saw the Pusher trilogy back when they each came out and knew that Nic Refn was on his way to something bigger and I think Drive is finally it.

818,felliott-133-6341,An absolute masterpiece,10,15 May 2012,"I had extremely high expectations when going into this movie, knowing the director from Bronson, and Ryan Gosling from excellent performances such as Lars and the Real Girl and Blue Valentine. But boy oh boy, were my expectations blown out of the water. From beginning to end, this film is completely captivating and memorizing. As soon as that first song begins to play over those pink lacy credits, I was lulled into a paradise world of cinema. The soundtrack and sound mix as well as the pace of the piece lulls you into a eerie and beautiful trance. This along with the extraordinary cinematography took me into a kind of dream world, where the lights are played like a piano, and seem to reflect how the characters are feeling at that particular moment. The casting was perfect beyond perfect, Ryan Gosling disappears so that all we can see is the Driver, a deeply interesting character. There are some brilliant character moments in this film, which reveal so much by saying so little – its almost like poetry. A great moment for me was when the Driver is talking to Irene's son, Driver: is he a bad guy? How can you tell? Benicio: Because he is a shark. Driver: There's no good sharks? This plays along so well with the scorpion and the toad theme, of a scorpion's nature, a shark's nature, and the nature of the driver. Every character in this film is so deep and complex, something that I love more than anything in films, and I think something that is left out and forgotten in most films these days. The levels within Albert Brooks' character make him a 'bad guy' that is realistic, human and not altogether hated. Bryan Cranston's performance was one of my favourites, a very likable guy with a little wink of selfishness that makes him meet his end. That scene between the two is heartbreaking on so many different levels, as well as scary on many other levels. Standard and Blache are also very interesting characters, both beautifully casted as well. The portrayal of violence in Drive is something I have never seen before. The film stays at the same pace and tone as the rest of the film, although such extreme things are happening. We are not influenced by a heighten of dramatic music or faster paced editing, everything stays on the same wavelength. This is a very good way of showing us that the driver has a very different mind state than most people, he is like a shark or a scorpion, in that these things are on the same level to him as any other spot of drama. This is what makes his relationship with Irene so special, as I feel, it is the only thing in his life that has ever moved him. It's the only game changer for him. Before this, he will crash cars and risk his life, and drive getaway cars, because, why not? What does he have to lose? He also has this feeling of invincibility, until Irene comes into the picture – and then he has a weakness and something to lose. I must say I have become religious about this film after seeing it. I have seen it more times than I can count already, and would love nothing more than to shake Nicolas Winding Refn's hand and tell him he has made a masterpiece, an absolute classic that is up there with the best movies of all time.",Drive
819,Ashman1977,Outstanding Movie,8,6 January 2012,"I put off watching this movie because I thought it might have been just a rehash of other car flicks like gone in 60 seconds and the transporter. Drive is nothing like that. It is a brilliant film and surpassed my expectations. The music is amazing, the acting is brilliant and the direction is superb. It is a thriller more on the lines of History of Violence, slow, brooding and allows for character buildup. The plot is predictable but done so differently that it keeps you engrossed. Ryan Gosling delivers a sensational performance, truly Oscar worthy if this was any other film. All in all, a great film,but not recommended for family viewing as there is some violence.",Drive
820,render_this,Underwhelming,5,26 September 2011,"Had very high hopes for this from the trailer and reviews but my expectations were not met. I was expecting an intelligent thriller with a decent story, strong performances and some great driving scenes.What I got was an odd thriller with some stylish moments that doesn't work as a whole. The story treads very little new ground in the 'tough guy develops feelings for a woman / child' school and isn't that well told (the motivations of the gangsters are never that well explained). Ryan Gosling's character is a man of few words and long pauses, which isn't necessarily a problem but he's also not far off being The Terminator it transpires which is a bit of a stretch when there's no background to support his one man army capability. The gangsters aren't on screen that much - they have a couple of decent villainous scenes but they'll never touch Joe Pesci for menace and violence.Driving? Opening scene's pretty good, the rest aren't much better than you'd see in any high end, modern US cop show, these ones just have Ryan Gosling in them rather than a TV star.Some of my disappointment comes from the fact that if you're going to make an L.A. at night movie it's going to draw comparisons with Heat and Collateral. Drive can't hold a candle to these in terms of transporting you into the L.A. underworld.If you go to see movies for cinematography (the movie seldom looks anything other than great) and performance you'll love it, if you go to see movies for stories and character development, avoid.I think a lot of people giving this 10 / 10 reviews are the kind of people that just big up anything that isn't mainstream Hollywood - they may use the words 'subtle' and 'nuanced' frequently - beware of these peoples' reviews!!",Drive
821,stephenlfrance,From Silence to Violence,8,19 October 2011,"Drive opens with two burglars committing a stealthy robbery and subsequently, a slick escape from the authorities with the aid of a hired wheelman. Ryan Gosling plays the silent, serious and stoic Driver for the thieves; a man occupied as a stunt-performer by day and moonlighting as a get- away driver by night. The introduction can simply be described as silent. There is melodic, melancholic and a methodical tone to the music accompanying the quiet scenes and brief sections of dialogue; nonetheless, it is eerily tranquil. Almost fifteen minutes pass before our main protagonist speaks and to contribute to the building mystery, we are not provided with a name for our lead. Ideas about Ryan's character begin to bleed out from the silence of the filmic script; he is patient, quiet, controlled, strong-willed and streetwise; however, he appears to be suppressing an extreme emotion or perception. Audiences will recognise that there is depth to his personality. It emerges from his eyes, body language, lack of expression and the deafening serenity of the movie. The silent moments in this film seem to express more than the scenes of dialogue. Ryan's character is a man who appears to harbour a dark side; a man that stares into the abyss and does not blink; categorically, a lead character that viewers will have great difficulty disliking. The beginning also reveals his attraction to his neighbour and her child. He stares at them as if they are his release from his self- imposed solitude. He forms a relationship with them and learns that the child's father is in prison. In my experience, introductions that translate as predominantly calm mean an aggressive situation is lurking in the shadows. When Standard (Oscar Isaac) emerges on the screen as the father who has been released from jail, I immediately wondered if this would be the start of the violence; this particular actor has played some dubious characters in the past, namely his recent performance as Blue Jones in Sucker Punch, the sinister pimp. After a few scenes with Standard, I was right to wonder...Drive is a true character driven plot. The Driver remains nameless for the entirety of the script, adding allure to the story. He has conflicting behavioural traits; the plot unveils his deep sense of morality in his protection of Standard's family from a relentless mob, yet he murders anyone who targets them with robotic simplicity. He unveils his knowledge of criminal psychology when he stares at the crooks he is dealing with, clearly able to analyse them, which makes viewers wonder: where has he been? What has he done? Fundamentally, who is this man? Using this enigmatic, fearless and very capable central protagonist, the creators keep the audience in constant suspense. The transition from a humble film to one of raw aggression is amplified by brutal sound effects for the vicious fight scenes. There are many characters that have been created in the past, similar to the Driver. They are universally fascinating. To name a few examples: Jack Reacher from Lee Child's Reacher series of books, Jubei Kibagaymi from Ninja Scroll 1993, Bone from Blood and Bone 2009, and Ryu in the video game and anime series of Street Fighter. They are loners, drifters with mysterious pasts, amazingly strong combat skills and mental acuteness surpassing average intelligence. These characters tend to be scarred by some tragedy in their past and it has imparted humility. This film was fantastic and very profound, because of this character choice. The 'Outro' soundtrack used in the final scene of the film, completed the story.",Drive

Almost every movie out there, even the good ones, are so predictable. You can judge a movie based on how many explosions there are, or if there's a love affair, how it'll turn out in the end. The fact is, however, the movie ""Drive"" follows more of an unconventional, yet more realistic plot. I won't say what happens, but just know that it's not what you think. In my viewing of the movie, I knew right off the bat that I couldn't expect a single thing to happen. I was sucked into the movie because I had to know what was going to happen. To my surprise, what actually happened was neither what I expected nor what I didn't expect.

It seemed like a good enough plot, a driver for movies moonlights as a getaway driver.. Pretty cool, I thought . Right after the beginning, things went downhill... Quickly. First of all Ryan Gosling is such a good actor, but the script made him an awkward mess. He had a strange obsession with his neighbor but he never talked to her! And when they did end up talking, it was so incredibly painful it was comical. Everyone in the movie theater I was in burst out laughing in these awkward scenes. Another completely strange plot twist was that all of the sudden Ryan Goslings character could fight and became increasingly over-violent. Like when he stomps on the guys head in the elevator, over and over and over and over. The people in my theater were laughing in a- enough-already kind of way and someone actually yelled ""I think he's dead!"" which caused more laughing.

I gave it a 3. I could go and on about every little thing that made this film suck, but what made it horrible was the amount of grossly inaccurate portrayals of the characters and cheesy action scenes. It starts off from the start - nobody gets away in a car chase in Los Angeles! What were they thinking? The characters - OK, so there's a guy who is a stunt driver by day, but also works as a mechanic, and has a third job that consists of driving people to robberies. Very realistic, ha! Not to mention that he makes all this money but lives in a crappy apartment in Echo Park?!? The worst part about the film is the main character's outer and inner motivations. He is going to risk his own life all so he can save the family of the woman he's just met! How about that scene at the end where he strategically runs into the villain's car, flips it over the cliff, and then drowns the man in the ocean! lol!!!

But it's not over the top good. Comparing to maybe the best two movies, of this genre, in the last 50 years is hard for me to swallow. I've seen hundreds of movies, Gone in 60 seconds maybe one of the best since Bullitt, even with CGA, but story wise, not what I would call fantastic. It is a good movie and Ryan Gosling did a good job. But the others, Ron Pearlman, Albert Brooks, Bryan Cranston and poor Christina Hendricks boy was there performances lack luster. I don't get it. Christina Hendricks is a beautiful woman, and they depict her as a hooker??? I have some real problems with understanding who was cast director for this movie.

And there would be driving scenes where no one would talk at all.. I mean come on!

832,Gsean20,"An excellent film, extremely well made, and filled with great performances . It is a unique and great movie experience. A must see",10,9 September 2012,"Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is a movie the likes of which I have never seen before. It has a unique style that I had never seen before. One of the great things about drive is that it manages to work its magic in 100 minutes, which is by no means a long running time. The characters in drive are vivid and feel extremely real. Carey Mulligan is excellent as Irene, a young single mother who falls for Ryan Gosling's mysterious stunt/get away driver. Ron Perlman is entertaining as Nino, a loud-mouth and arrogant mob boss. Brooks is especially fantastic as the soft spoken but vicious Bernie Rose, who is pretty handy with a razor. Yet the most amazing thing about Drive is the performance of its leading man. Gosling is magnetic as ""the Driver"" a stunt driver who moonlights as a get away driver for criminals. The driver is a quiet character who doesn't talk much but this allows Gosling to display his exception ability as an actor. With so little talk, Gosling conveys the feelings of his mysterious character through facial expression and simple looks in his eyes. He is able to convey both a kindness and caring in some scenes yet in others he is a figure of intimidation and brutality.The overall non-verbal nature of the mysterious main character adds to the overall tension of the film. The film is excellently paced and extremely entertaining. The film's marketing suggests primarily action scenes but that is not the case as the film is a character study of sorts, but don't shy away from this film because it isn't strictly speaking an action movie. Refn's film is extremely tense and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is definitely worth watching. The sound track is also extremely good and fits the film nicely. In addition, the the satin jacket Gosling wears throughout is perhaps one of the coolest things i've ever seen.Drive is one of my favorite films and it has a unique style that makes it a fantastic film to watch. Tense and entertaining, Refn and Gosling mesmerize you from beginning to end.",Drive
833,iflafilm,This and True Romance are the two greatest movies ever made,10,18 September 2011,"I'm gonna make a really bold statement and I'm deadly serious; for me, I don't think I, or anyone, could ever make a better movie than this. Every single frame of this movie was perfect. The titles, the music, the pacing, the dialog, the acting, the script. Every second of this was flawless victory. I won't say anymore. If you loved True Romance or Things to do in Denver When You're Dead - welcome to part three of the perfect trilogy.That said, if you're the 'typical mouth breather' I have to sit in front of every time I go to the movies, this probably ain't for you. I heard the 80 IQ and under crowd grumbling afterward. If you're looking for mindless drivel to talk, text and chew loudly through, maybe 'Green Lantern' or 'Tyler Perry presents I wanna Get My F*ck on at Madea's Family Reunion' is still showing somewhere.This is one of those once in a decade movies.

834,alexandkonst,Action with an artistic touch,9,17 February 2013,"This movie definitely isn't your standard action flick with shooting and shallow characters. Ryan Gosling plays a man of little words and his performance is ashtonishing, you can really feel his character through his facial expression and his depressed smile. This film has very little dialogue but will keep you really interested from start to end. From the first scene I realised this film is different. There are some very violent scenes with raw gore but they look very beautiful especially one in an elevator( I won't say more so I don't ruin it.

Everything about this film is perfection in my opinion, the soundtrack is one of the best out there and the performances from all the cast members are career highlights or sure. I do not actually believe it is possible for somebody not be completely involved in the story after the opening, quite simply it is sublime. After that the film does slow down but this is all necessary for character and story development, when it picks up again in the second half the original change of pace feels completely justified. Ryan Gosling's performance is to be commended, he doesn't say much but his calmness in one scene and then brutality in another is very entertaining and difficult to watch such as the scene in the elevator where he literally jumps on a man's head until it is completely crushed. Albert Brooks also deserves recognition for a similar reason, playing the role of the primary antagonist, Bernie Rose, he is unsettling on screen yet you cannot take your eyes off him. The way in which he brutally murders Shannon and 'Cook' are the two most graphic scenes in the film. I think this is a film that everybody should watch and it is undoubtedly my favourite film.",Drive

For those of you who have even the slightest appreciation for film as an art medium, you will most likely thoroughly enjoy this film. Overall, every piece is there. From the directing (Refn is truly a stylistic genius), cinematography, cast, right down to the soundtrack, this film is one you could see several times over and still take away something new every time. Nothing here is done by accident. Some may complain about the slack pace in the first half, but I personally was too enthralled by the Driver character and Ryan Gosling's portrayal of him to mind. Plus, the plot is a reference to the motif of the scorpion that is used. Slow and steady, but willing to violently strike given the right provocation. My advice would be to keep that in mind before sitting down to watch this film, and don't expect your average Fast & Furious type action flick, there's too much substance here to ignore.",Drive

The script-writer must have been laughing all the way to the bank. Call it style, call it tension-building but frankly there must be less than two hundred words of dialogue in the whole film and those that are said are hackneyed, insubstantial and ridiculous.

839,A-Train9830,"Drive is an exceptional, different, and refreshing action movie that changes the game completely",9,26 March 2014,"I first saw Drive sometime around last November. Coming off of the Breaking Bad series finale, I was eager to see anything with some Breaking Bad actors in it. I was looking around on Netflix when I discovered this movie called Drive, which had Bryan Cranston from Breaking Bad in it. Now, my knowledge in the world of cinema isn't too extensive right now, as I'm just in high school. Without knowing anything about expected Drive to be your average action movie with fast car chases and stuff like that, and I hadn't ever seen Ryan Gosling in anything (except Remember the Titans but I never realized he was in that until recently) and assumed he was just this teen-girl idol from romance comedies. But everything I had assumed changed when I sat back and watched Drive.Drive is about a Hollywood stuntman/getaway driver that forms a bond with a married woman and her family. That's at least some of what is happening. Drive was in no way your typical action flick like I had assumed. Drive is an intelligent, beautiful look into the character of this quiet, troubled driver and how he forms a close bond with this woman. It is very quiet and slow at times, but then violent and thrilling at other times. I would describe it as like a generic action flick and an art-house film combined into sort of a mix. This movie mixes the two into an almost perfect hybrid for fans of both. And this movie is very smart, impacting deep meanings that take a good amount of focus and keen attention to pick up on and decipher. It certainly doesn't spoon-feed you all of the information. It makes you thin about the characters and the plot in a very exciting and interesting way.The acting is great, I really can't find a weak link anywhere. Ryan Gosling really opened my eyes with this movie. All assumptions I previously had about him faded almost immediately. He is a serious actor who possesses a very good talent, he actually distinguished himself as one of my current favorites. His supporting cast all give good performances themselves. The action scenes in the movie were all filmed very well in my opinion. And this movie is shot beautifully, the cinematographers and the director really put great detail and effort into making this a wonderful film to view. Another thing that I really liked about Drive was the music. They put the perfect songs and pieces in the perfect spots, and they used songs that don't sound anything like what I listen to but made me love them. The soundtrack to Drive is exactly what it should be and really complimented the atmosphere of what was on screen. I really can't complain about anything in Drive except maybe its slowness and quietness. I personally like it and thought they used it nicely, but people who are used to constant action and fighting will probably find a lot of the scenes to be boring, but I don't think it's a major flaw at all.Drive is a very special movie to me. I wasn't in love with generic films before seeing Drive, as I enjoyed movies like Gran Torino and 3:10 to Yuma, but I definitely had never seen an art-house film. Drive opened my eyes to the possibilities of a movie. I think Drive is probably the first movie to really make me think deeper, and it was the first movie to introduce me to the artsy style of filmmaking. I think Drive is a great transition film from mainstream action movies into the world of art-house. Drive was the movie that introduced me to a greater way of thinking about and seeing movies, and it could do the same for other people.",Drive

843,marcchoover-56977,"Not a great plot, but the acting make this a great movie.",8,17 March 2016,"This movie is not quite an action movie, but you get your shootout and car chase scenes. Not quite a romance, but you get Ryan Gosling falling in love with Carey Mulligan. And it's not quite a drama, but Ryan Gosling's character is in love with a woman who already has a boyfriend (played by Oscar Isaac) that is in debt with gangsters for protecting him while he was in prison, and while Gosling was driving Isaacs for a pawn shop robbery to pay back the gangsters, Isaacs gets killed.The plot isn't too deep, but at the same time, it isn't too shallow either, and Ryan Gosling gives a GREAT performance, always pausing before answering a question or speaking, which I'm not sure if that makes him look like a deep thinker or a slow one.Warning, spoiler past this point. The ending of the movie will have you hanging at the end of your seat. After killing off all the gangsters that were involved in the killing of Carey Mulligan's boyfriend, he brings the money that was stolen in heist to the main gangster, played by Albert Brooks, and Brook's character stabs him in the parking lot after Ryan Gosling hands him the money - Ryan Gosling, in turn, stabs him back - and what appears to be a near-instant fatal stabbing.The camera then shows Ryan Gosling sitting in his car, clutching his bloody stomach, not moving and apparently dead.

845,breadginger,Gave Me the Tingle,10,23 March 2020,"Listening to electro pop genre based music has been something I've listened to for a very long time. That specific genre based music has ALWAYS given me a feeling I can never explain. That feeling I call the 'Tingle'.
I saw short clips of the movie before even watching and Ladies and Gentlemen let me just say that that already gave me the 'Tingle' (along with the song of course playing, of course). Doubt that it was going to happen along the whole movie due to Ryan Gosling. I've never been a huge fan of his works neither was I interested in his work. In fact this was a 'Ryan Gosling' movie. Then I had the audacity and went to lay down and watch the movie, never would've knew what was going to happen.
If I could best abstractly describe this movie it would've been 'city lights'. This whole movie felt like looking down over city lights with that electro pop music playing (Sorry in advance of soundtrack references, it's too good). The tension and connection you feel in scenes with Irene and the Driver was just well done. Very glad they've urged to not say a lot of lines, it was worth it. I wasn't warned about the gore I would be seeing and too be fair, I love gore.
This isn't your typical car chasing impala movie, this is the real crap it's a  emotional rollercoaster movie. Not to even mention the excellent cinematography and especially the lighting.

849,WiseOne-4,Much like fashion is cyclical apparently so are movie clichés,9,20 September 2011,"Ryan Gosling and his girl friend are in their apartment elevator with a mysterious man in a suit. Ryan notices a gun in the man's jacket. He grabs his girl and starts to make out with her in the elevator. Queue the high contrast lighting and long ""intense"" multi-angle shots followed by Gosling throwingthe mystery mans head into the elevator and stomping his face into the ground till it squishes. His girlfriend mortified exits the elevator and stares in disbelief. Ryan stands there coated in blood with the typical blank expression on his face and the audience laughed. The whole thing just so ridiculous. The police, such an intricate part of the opening scene are nowhere to be found the whole rest of the movie as Gosling leaves behind dead bodies in hotel rooms, on the beach, in diner parking lots and even in his own apartment complex elevator. This movie takes itself way too seriously. From the out of place eighties-esque synth pop soundtrack to the equally out of place large pink title cards this movie is a mash up of 80's clichés and pretentious cinematography. I went into this with high expectations based on all the user and critic reviews. Although I was impressed by the acting of all the supporting cast and the intensity of a few scenes here and there overall I left the film thinking what a waste of time.Ryan Goslings character was so unbelievable. It's like they were trying to make him a quiet Steven Mcqueen tough guy but it just didn't work. Don't get me wrong he has tons of screen presence but his character was so uneven. He could barely communicate or express any emotion with any character in the film including his girlfriend but he somehow was great with the girlfriends son. He turned into father knows best. Please! Guys like this have mental and emotional problems and they would feel just as uncomfortable around a child as they would around adults. But the filmmakers try and manipulate us by showing the equivalent of scenes of him doing magic tricks like pulling coins out from behind the boys ear.At least 30 minutes of the film were long scenes of Gosling driving down the road staring off into space. I couldn't help but reminded Taxi Driver. But that movie had voice over's and a far more interesting lead character. Gosling is just pure 80's superhero tough guy with no characterization aside from his undying loyalty to the girl down the hall and her son he's known we presume for at most a few weeks. They tried using violence purely for shock factor. The best thing about the film was the opening scene where Gosling uses his wit and exceptional driving skills to avoid the police from catching him as a getaway driver for a robbery. But that scene was bittersweet because it seemed to make a promise that there would be more scenes like that to come but the movie is just all downhill from there. All the support cast were great though, although for the most part given little to do or say. In particular Albert Brooks and the forever awesome Bryan Cranston. Oh and the girlfriend was pretty hawt too.This movie was entertaining to watch when I didn't know where it was going but once I saw where it ended up it all just felt contrived and empty. The opening scene promises a total different movie than is ultimately delivered. What was so interesting about it is it put you in moment of what it would really feel like to try and escape police pursuit in the real world. But after the opening the rest of movie turns into fantasy that's hard to derive any real tension from.",Drive

853,luigisib,Nicolas Winding Refn has mastered his craft and 'Drive' is the evidence.,10,28 December 2011,"Nicolas Winding Refn, son of Lars von Trier's editor, Anders Refn, is the star of Drive. Not Ryan Gosling's captivating, muted portrayal of our borderline sociopathic hero, comparable to Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, nor is it the twinkling, Hollywood city scape, such as with Heat's L.A., nor is it the automotive fetishism one may assume from the title as with Vanishing Point. No, Drive is the film where the 1990's most promising new director truly flourishes.From the opening sequence one may be forgiven for thinking the film to be a more polished, stylised and current version of 1978's The Driver as the character's profession and rules are very similar. However, Drive is far more comparable to films of definitive moral ambitions such as Shane, which, though a clear Western, grew out of the Film Noir sensibilities of the 40's. And it is these Film Noir sensibilities that encase Refn's neon streaked colour pallet. Despite the film's modern setting and clear 80's vibe the film comes across as timeless and, while you are swept up in the tale, quite unidentifiable. This means the audience focus on the beautiful and brutal plot.The film consists of explosions of violence, reminiscent of Gaspar Noe's Irreversible, but it is at some of these points one can see just how in control of his own film Refn is. It is the choice of what he allows the audience to see which is so relevant. This is encapsulated in one of the film's final scenes in which, instead of being confronted with an all-out knife struggle, the audience are presented with a stunning shot of two silhouettes cast by the low hanging sun, licking the concrete in a serene and bewildering brawl. Drive is an amalgamation of skills and lessons learnt from Refn's past films, of atmosphere, depth, patience, impact and effect. Nicolas Winding Refn was awarded the best director award at Cannes. Rightly so, as he has made the best film of the year and despite a uniformly superb supporting cast, brilliant editing and a soundtrack to die for, that praise fall firmly on him.",Drive

856,clarek1975,Not 'Drive Angry 3D' - Pheeewww!!!,9,5 February 2012,"As soon as we commence with 'Drives' quite brilliant opening, a cool but not so frantic getaway; it is clear that you don't mess with 'The Driver'. Ryan Gosling simply oozes class, cool and intimidation with a soon to be seen ruthlessness that, although not coming as a surprise (there is a clear, deep simmering, primal instinct beneath the calm exterior) is no less stunning.The prologue opening is simply awesome, calm yet tense, a cat and mouse hide and chase that gives us a stylish glimpse of the night blue metal cool of a Los Angeles to come; the same reflective, cold, hard LA seen in Michael Mann's 'Heat'. Held; up close shots, slow aerial pans and zooms add extra tension to Gosling's already smouldering, unflappable driver. Twinkling, grand cityscapes act as a backdrop to Goslings night crawling, flowing seamlessly into the superb 80's electro, thudding, iconic, pink neon title sequence.Stunt driver by day, wheelman by night, the driver is 'a man with no name' and of few words. He lets others do the talking, but he is forced into action when he starts up a tentative and restrained relationship with his neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan). He agrees to help out her paroled husband to pay back a debt to an LA gangster by doing a small time heist, which goes badly wrong. In order to protect his neighbour and her son he has grown fond off, he embarks on a spree of ultra-cool violence which provides an insight into the true capability of our 'Driver'.Mulligan's and Gosling's on screen show radiates tension and is charged, owed to the subtle unknowing smiles and long silent gazes, both of them uncertain and equally tarnished.The definite quiet and the slow developing relationship of the opening play of 'Drive' is a purposeful device used to build tension for the inevitable second acts fallout of events, glimpsed at with 'Driver's' first tell of what lies beneath in a chance encounter with a previous associate, showing that he is as equally as brutal and intimidating with a few very measured words as he is when he is about to put a nail in someone's head. When he chillingly asks, often throughout ""Do you understand"" – you understand!The true tension that 'Drive' crafts from the off is all down to the fact that we are just watching and waiting for it all to escalate, and escalate it does. Responding only to aggravation, more passing triggers come as events unfold, 'Driver' will strike and decisively, symbolised no more so, than by the scorpion insignia on the back of his stunt jacket.Violence IS ultra, and often the mashed melon reveals someway detract from the style and methodical cool, what you don't see and the build from the pre-emptive slow-mos is often more foreboding and gripping than the imminent outburst of violence. Providing the calm before the proverbial storm of when gosling explodes into shocking action, gives more impact to 'Drive's' violent episodes. His interrogation of gangster's moll Blanche serves as a terrifying warning and an example of pure intimidation without violence, but we soon see what he is prepared to do, if the answers needed are not so forthcoming.Support is given by Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman. Perlman is slightly disappointing as the token middle man goon Nino, but bigger boss Brooks is superbly malevolent as Bernie, who too shows a will equal to the 'Driver 'and will act with unflinching brutality.Christina Hendricks (Blanche) is underused and her appearance is borderline cameo. At only 100 minutes 'Drive' may have spent a little more time to flesh out these ancillary players some more, adding a greater character study that could have made it epic, especially when no back story is given to Goslings 'Driver'. Making Gosling's driver a 'man with no name' works and is the premier performance, adding greater mystery and allure, making 'The Driver' an Icon for any era. Gosling has already provided some memorable and brilliant performances in 'Blue Valentine' and 'Half Nelson' but 'Drive' is his iconic role so far.Nicolas Winding Refn's dynamic direction and a supreme soundtrack make 'Drive' a brilliant instant classic; an early entry as a great movie for this still new decade, comparable with 90's classic 'Heat', not as epic but on less lacking in style and cool.Drive is brilliant!

858,juliodosanjos,"The coolest movie in many, many years",9,14 December 2011,"I've been expecting this movie for some time, since I've known the previous work of Nicolas Refn, specially the bizarre BRONSON. I had some high hopes for this title and was afraid of getting disappointed. Luckily, DRIVE was everything I expected and much more. The plot is simple, but great movies often are. What matters here is the way the story is told, and DRIVE has a firm, creative and talented storyteller in Refn. To help him in his endeavor, the cast is simply brilliant. The ""coolness"" of the movie is distributed among its soundtrack, colors and shots that directly take you to the 80's and the number of elements that could easily become collectibles - from the cars to the scorpio jacket. Thinking about the movie (what I haven't stopped doing since I watched it three days ago), I got to the conclusion that if David Cronenberg made a movie with Steve McQueen, it would be DRIVE. To me, it can't get cooler than that.",Drive
859,sam_duerksen4,i don't understand.,7,18 September 2011,"I did not like this movie. It had it's moments, I will give it that, like some of the car chase scenes were very well done and they were different and daring. And I loved the first five minutes, I was really hoping it would keep going down that path. The music was captivating, I thought Gosling did a great job at portraying his characters emptiness, and some of the cinematography was beautiful. And I even liked the opening credits. But as the story got rolling I found it very difficult to stay engaged. I wasn't learning anything new that I didn't learn in the first five minutes and I didn't really give a crap what happened to any of the characters. I guess maybe because I didn't find the two main characters relationship all that believable or moving. Great films have some sort of message in them, or a great narrative. There's something about the characters that you can relate to. In this film, Gosling's character is not even given any background. We don't know where he came from, what his past is. It's very difficult to relate to him or get why he's doing what he's doing or why he's such an offbeat. They made it very clear that his life was empty but that's about as far as it went. I'm not saying Gosling did a bad job, I think the director did.Not too mention the editing was just ridiculously slow. It's like here's a shot of his head he's staring... staring.... staring.... now camera pans to girl she's staring... staring... staring... Ryan laughs awkwardly.... they stare some more... cut scene. Cool. Also one thing I noticed is Mulligan's character doesn't seem to give much of a crap about her husband when he comes home from jail. Yet when he dies all the sudden she can barely speak and she's so grief stricken. This reaction didn't fit with the way she reacted before. I thought it was kind of a laugh there was nothing about the story that moved me or even excited me I just found it so boring. i'd also like to add the director came up with some main ideas for this movie while he was stoned on some sort of medication after the dentist... I could tell...",Drive

Drive is like the total opposite to one of those cookie- cutter Hollywood movies that see the light of day way too often.The filming, acting, story and instruction are just top notch. Every single scene is just excellently lit (it's a joy to watch). Drive doesn't rush through the scenes to get to some big explosions or otherwise purposeless action gimmicks. The movie doesn't insult your intelligence (like so many Hollywood movies do).This movie definitely deserve 10/10 stars, and I would highly recommend watching this movie in the cinema (it just fits the big screen so well), and not wait until it hits the DVD or Bluray marked.",Drive
862,djuleez,"""Pusher"" for children",4,18 December 2011,"Oh how the mighty have fallen and lost their edge. After the Bleeder and Pusher movies that were so gritty and real, it is hard to believe that this is the same director. Everything about this stinks of a lazy stroll through CSI and the US culture of gloss versus grit and bravado versus reality. The story itself is multilayered with acres of scope to flesh out a gripping, dirty, yet cool masterpiece - especially with the movie ""The Driver"" from the 70s to build on. And with one of my favourite actors in the lead role - this should have been a cult classic. Instead it is instantly forgettable with a series of events in the last third that must have come out of a comic book as the logic and credibility of all the characters suddenly fall into a category of childhood playfighting, not the adult battlefield of ganglords. And where were the car chases - I can only assume that the budget didn't stretch to wrecking too many cars, with way too much time (in comparison) played to a predictable love triangle storyline.I think my main criticism has to fall on Refn himself. His vision seemed to have fallen woefully short. The cool distant reprise of Ryan O'Neil from ""The Driver"" is a good start - but it is played so clumsily and painfully in your face as to lose its cold pathos beneath a blundering series of panning moody shots and distasteful musical warmth. The music score, the lingering shots - a total afront to creating anything gritty or remotely powerful. The dialogue was pretty decent though, with some incisive prose, and the casting of Albert Brooks as a bad guy was genius. Yet even the set pieces lacked any zest or street cred - way way too much polish Refn - and another lesson unlearned from your early movies.Everything about this screams 15 rating for armchair mid-evening viewing - atrocious music singing the praises of our hero only making it that more irritating and comical. Dear Refn, please regain your credibility at the cost of selling your soul for you will never again regain the longevity of those earlier movies with this thin waster that has already dissolved from my eager brain wanting something to challenge it rather than kill another two hours of life.",Drive
863,djuri1985,Successful originality,9,4 January 2012,"***This review is not suitable for people who understand movies and other kinds of things***I didn't intend to write a review on Drive, and I know that it's inappropriate to write a review on other people's reviews, but after reading them I couldn't help myself and had to make my statement. Besides, I think I will still offer a (maybe) helpful insight to the movie.I'm not a professional movie critique, but when I get to judge a movie, and I do because judging is something we humans like and need doing, I have 2 simple rules: 1.) is it smart? And if it gets passed that then 2.) what does it try to achieve? I really don't see an exception to this rule. Now, anyone who thinks this movie deserves 2/10 I will have to disappoint. As fortune has it, if you are among them, you shouldn't be reviewing movies.Drive clearly stands apart from your typical ""production"" movie where a bunch of people involved with movie-making decide it is worth investing into an idea, make a movie out of it and make money because there is a good chance people will watch it (especially if you hire Adam Sandler) - 'Drive' is not a 'business' movie. It does try to sell itself (don't we all?), but not for money. For something much more pleasing.'Drive' is expression. A statement. A view. It tries to communicate. It tries to be unique in a universal sense. It tries to stay true to itself - and solely for that it deserves some credit.The idea that the world can be so unbearably corrupt that words become needless is familiar to all of us. The state when the only noble thing seems to be to fight it, not for a gain, but purely out of ethics. When you loose all understanding and fate in others, when bad people no longer have excuses. At times like that one finds the motivation and strength to pursue greatness and sacrifice himself for the world, even if it's just for an utterly unimportant woman with a 'cheap' place in society - because there is no lesser or greater sacrifice. That's what Jesus did as well, and his book got some good reviews, didn't it? (I'm an atheist BTW).That's where the brutal murders come from. They are saying 'No! I did not hesitate, they deserve it'. The idea of Ryan G.'s character is that he has freed himself from the 'ME'. He has no stakes in any of it. He did not fall in love with Irene, he just views her as something pure and good. The only time he kisses her is in the elevator and he does it to save her, not out of 'love'.The slow pace and silence are not there just out of aesthetic reasons. They are very descriptive and say a lot about the main character. They try to emphasize his emotional state, especially his determination. They also draw our concentration onto specific things and put us more easily into the protagonists shoes.I expected 'Drive' to be a witty racing movie with good action sequences. I was pleasantly surprised to see it does better. It only uses the whole 'driver' thing as a cover for a more meaningful story.A good movie's job is to remind us of noble values, to strengthen them. Also, to contribute to the collective vision of the world and to set the directions for it's development. To offer up-to-date ideas to the viewer so we can use them for ourselves - to build on each other, or to provide the comforting fact that there is someone else out there who shares our confrontations. If a movie succeeds in not damaging our culture, in my eyes it is a good movie, and I will always feel sympathetic about it.'Drive' succeeds!",Drive

Since watching ""No Country For Old Men"" I don't think I've ever had the displeasure of wasting nearly two hours of my life viewing beautiful shots (if you can count under shots looking up Gosling's nostrils as beautiful) coupled with atmospheric soundtrack whilst virtually sod all was happening on screen (and that includes dialogue).Or, possibly there could be something wrong with me in that when I pay my money to see a highly rated film I, odd as it may sound, like to be engaged in something that offers more than the 20 minutes of worthwhile film (by the time all the worthless pregnant pauses are taken out) that this film has to offer!",Drive

Everything about it from the score, to the performances, to the soundtrack, direction, cinematography was stellar.Ryan Gosling gives a career best performance, as a man of few words, whose actions speak volumes. The rest of the cast is also stellar, from Christina Hendricks, to Bryan Cranston. It is a fairly simple story of a stunt car driver who agrees to help out an ex-con, but in the process ends up offending some very bad people. Of course in helping out the ex-con as is often the case in seedy crime films, things go anything but according to plan. From there it changes into a story of vengeance, with scenes of intense violence, that never felt false. It is hard to stomach in parts, but I never found it gratuitous.If you are a fan of movies, you can't help but enjoy this film.",Drive

Just watch the lift scene between Ryan, Carey & one villain and you will realize what I am talking about.Ryan has given once in a lifetime performance and kudos to his acting skills. Now all his movies are in my watch list and I have already completed half of them. Carey is lovely and enact her part perfectly.But the real start here is Nicholas and the screenplay.

The film sucks you in right from the very beginning, and creates a dream-like atmosphere for you to walk out with at the end. I wasn't exactly sure what I was about to watch, all I knew was it was the new Ryan Gosling film and an action thriller. This is the year for Ryan Gosling. Ever since Blue Valentine, he has been an actor to watch. He has definitely earned a new name for himself apart from The Notebook. His acting was on point, allowing you to feel his presence by just catching the glimpses in his eyes. The cinematography and soundtrack where what completed the film.

You can't define a specific genre for this type of movie. But in all I loved Ryan Gosling's acting.

People going to a movie because there was action in the trailers only to be disappointed by a movie that was actually really good... does that remind you of anything? well for me it reminded me of fight club, stupid people coming back from the cinemas saying the movie was bad because Brad Pitt wasn't beating on someone for every waking minute of the movie.

870,felixshreds,A suspenseful romantic thriller a la film Noir,10,10 June 2013,"The movie ""Drive"", starring Ryan Gosling in the leading role and written and directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, tells the story of a stunt show-driver, who earns himself some extra money by helping criminals to escape from their robberies. The main character is visibly loathed to keep on his criminal activity, but also requires the financial advantages of it. One day, he gets to know his female neighbor and decides to do his last job. But not before he the neighbor's fiancé returns home after a long imprisonment... Nicolas Winding Refn did a terrific job directing ""Drive"". Asthetically, cinematically and effectively, he chose the best possible visual style and directed his actors. He did a truly amazing direction without exceptions. He manages to create a great harmony between the atmosphere of the visual aspects and the story's characteristics. The acting is conspicuously great. Ryan Gosling's minimalistic performance of the tough but deep stuntman, who is fed up with criminality and in a kind of experimental love with the girl next door, blew my mind, so did Carrey Mulligan's sensitive interpretation of the young lovely mother.The car chases are the best ones in movie history. The movie's problem is that it failingly tries to convey a general criticism of materialism, which is transported, but not at all convincing and also absolutely displaced in the story. Being indeed stylistically well and authentically made, it does not meet its requirements of successfully criticizing materialistic values.",Drive

And I do enjoy a good dialogue movie when it is about personalities and conflicts being opinionated an mentally stimulating. But that isn't here either. What about scenery?

Although the movie sort of drags on and gives you these weird calm scene with a foreboding sense of dread of what's to come I couldn't help but fall in love with the music of the film. It deserved the academy award for sound editing and possibly more. Also the plot felt like it was forced and meant to be like a lone cowboy film and I feel like the love interest just wasn't there, I mean the lady barely even talked to him and he almost died over her?!Overall if you are a fan of drawn out and dramatic scenes that are meant to give you a deeper view of the character, and gory, intense murder scenes that jump out of nowhere then I'm sure you will love this film.

This film is slow to start and quite frankly boring. The most entertaining character in the whole film is Nino and he has about 5 minutes of total screen time. I have now lost 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back. The soundtrack is far too loud and irritating. The composers tried to hard to be retro-80's and completely blew it. I have also read that we are comparing Ryan Gosling's character to Dirty Harry, that is absurd. The character development was non-existent, and Ryan Gosling's performance was poor at best.

The opening scene is perfectly timed and so well directed and it sets the tone for the rest of the film that has constant taut tension but still lets you breath and enjoy it. Ryan Gosling looks fantastic in the film and like I said he can drive me around anytime. He becomes truly the ultimate hero in the film and delivers an understated performance with so much mystery and fire percolating underneath. The streets of downtown LA look perfectly edgy for this film and the car scenes driving through it have this timeless very dreamy movie quality which is so rare in todays films. Albert Brooks and Carey Mulligan also deliver amazing performances even when not speaking as we see many times in this films many music video like montages.

Drive is a movie that is both beautiful and gritty beyond word. The way that this movie is directed and executed reminds me of the great days of cinema and story telling. The cast is brilliantly directed and the acting on all levels is spot on. The only issue I had with this movie is the very brutal and (in my opinion) unnecessary violence.

882,Ljayd1903,"If you're truly a film fan, you'll like this movie",9,24 June 2012,"I have read a few other reviews on here and honestly don't understand how this movie has got so many negative comments. It seems that the name of the movie has misguided some people into thinking that they were going to see a lot of fast car chases, explosions and fist fights. I can imagine that this is the only reason why some viewers were left disappointed. It seems that the majority of viewers who gave bad reviews are of the same mindset as the guy on here who said 'the only reason I gave this film 1 star is for the boobs'. Yes, the dialogue is minimal, and no, the main character doesn't have a back story but so what? This is more like a cult movie with a blockbuster feel, not expecting the audience to be lazy and spelling everything out for you. What happened to the appeal of mystery and intrigue? Ryan Gosling plays his part quietly, intensely and he really makes you wonder who he really is. The cinematography is undeniable brilliant and the soundtrack is just cool, there's no other word for it. The supporting characters are great and not overplayed. I also saw in one review someone claim that they saw way more chemistry between Irene and her husband rather than Driver, I think most people just seem to need every thought or feeling that a character has to be verbalised so that they can understand it. The driving scenes were realistic and perfectly executed and the violence is brilliant in showing the audience exactly what they weren't expecting from the hero, not gratuitous at all. And as for the 'plot holes', if you actually pay attention then you will understand what is going on. If the worst people can complain about is headlights working after a collision, then you're really not getting the movie and you should just go and watch something else. If you're looking for an action movie with class, then this is it, beautiful cast, beautifully played. Slow and oozing cool, this movie shows that there doesn't need to be a swear word or explosion every five seconds for a movie to be dark, compelling and entertaining. Ryan Gosling is a refreshing hero with a dark side. If you are a fan of great directing and won't feel the need to complain because the main character doesn't have a catchphrase, then you should be able to appreciate Drive.",Drive
883,evolume,Overrated and Mis-Marketed,4,18 October 2011,"The current rating for ""Drive"" is 8.3. Prepare for it to drop further. Once this film hits Redbox and Netflix and people can actually see what all the fuss was about, there are going to be a lot of unhappy people wanting ""their 2 hours back"". Granted this is not a film for the masses, but I contend it isn't a film for film buffs either.I'm one of them. With it's success at Festival Di Cannes and torrent of critical acclaim; and because of it's trailer, I was understandably expecting an artfully crafted action thriller. I was hoping for something along the lines of ""Leon"", ""The Limey"", ""Get Carter (original)"" or ""The Italian Job (original)"". Or at the very least a driving movie on par with ""Vanishing Point"", ""Death Proof"" or ""Ronin"". ""Drive"" scarcely shares a genre with any of these films though it's marketing and title would suggest it does. It's closer to ""Lost In Translation"" except with less character development, virtually no memorable dialog and no humor. Actually, casting Bill Murray as The Driver might have made this film 10 times better.Check the Memorable Quotes section. There are currently about 6 quotes and only 1 of them is actually memorable. I remember it because Gosling's ""5-minute window"" line foreshadows a thrilling heist film. In reality, it forecasts the only 5 minutes of driving you're going to get - 10 minutes if you include the picnic scene.Why was ""Drive"" marketed the way it was? My guess is the most obvious - they wanted to sell this film to gear-heads. They wanted to encourage fans of 70's muscle car films and fans of crime noir to see it. They also wanted to cross genres and attract a broad audience - fans of Bruckheimer and Michael Bay action films. These are likely the most irate of audiences as it was nowhere near this class of popcorn movie. Mostly, I suspect the marketing people behind the campaign had no idea how to sell a film called ""Drive"" that has almost no driving in it. The result is a film that will ultimately anger many who will no-doubt feel that they have been deceived. This is evidenced by the frivolous law suit brought against the producers of the film for false advertising. Ridiculous, yes but baseless? Absolutely not.I also wonder how ""Drive"" won Best Director at Cannes. The darling of the festival, Quentin Tarantino won the Palm d'Or for ""Pulp Fiction"" but not director. In fact none of his films have won Best Director but lets examine his most recent, ""Inglorious Basterds"". Whether you like it or not, it definitely showcases vastly superior direction to ""Drive"". It has pages and pages of dialog and character developing banter, written and performed in 4 languages, no less! It has an ensemble cast and hundreds of extras in period appropriate costumes. It was filmed in dozens of exotic locations in multiple countries with brilliant photography of interiors, exteriors, day and night. It has a great soundtrack of music from different periods and countries. And it has multiple action sequences featuring antique weapons, blood, smoke, fire and explosions. And yet ""Drive"" - a film with little dialog, absent character development, limited cast, sparse photography and a one dimensional soundtrack - gets best director. Must have been a pretty sorry pool of contenders this year.Don't get me wrong, I liked ""Drive"", parts of it anyway. I can see Refn is well-versed in film and his influences show through in his direction. But this is not his best film, not even close. You want slow, brooding and atmospheric? See ""Valhalla Rising"". Looking for a stylized character study? Try ""Bronson"". These are both Palm d'Or caliber if ""Drive"" is a litmus test for Best Director of Cannes.",Drive

I was looking for chopsticks to poke my eyes out as this would have been more pleasant. The dialogue was a total of 2 paragraphs, and Ryan Gosling spends at least 60 minutes of the movie staring at the world far beyond and when he does decide to speak, he usually utters between 1-3 words. I haven't felt so tense in a long time. I was begging for something to happen. Everything feels so slow moving that it makes you anxious. It's like the director took tranquilizers and decided that the pace should be slower than death. I will devote my life from now on to discover why this movie has an 8/10 in IMDb and mostly how and why it got nominated for an Oscar and 50something other nominations. I'm proceeding now to cry in fetal position until I fall asleep. The other 2 people watching the movie with me feel exactly the same.",Drive

I began to realise that this beautifully made film had such a simple story to it that I'd actually become bored, although well cast, well directed, and just stunning like I said, this film became a little tedious, I was sadly disappointed, I hoped this would be taxi driver for a modern age, thinking about it, the story did have a somewhat taxi driver-esque feel to it, with the main characters loneliness, people in need and hurting people to make sure they're safe, however I just didn't connect with this film in the way I'd hoped I would. It's well worth a watch in the right conditions, but I don't see what all the fuss was about, having watched it",Drive
887,Eric_Ruan,"Cool? Yes, but that does not save it",2,31 August 2012,"2 out of 5 stars Do we need another overrated Hollywood production that provides nothing but a sensation of coolness? Our beloved audiences, after all, have been much in love with Inception and Black Swan the very year before. Of course, Drive does not sink to the same embarrassing level of pretension, obscurity and manipulation as those two; but on the other hand, there is not much to derive from this so-called ""powerful love story"".Mind that there is a fine line to be drawn between a powerful love story and a foolish one. For the record, Ryan Gosling's Driver is that all-perfect guy who is, ironically, too timid, too shy (or too manly?) to take his innocent neighbor away her screwed-up husband (and why she married that loser is an unsolvable mystery to me – maybe it is simply there to make us feel desperate than ever for Gosling and Mulligan's characters to be together).While any in-heat female (and zealous male) audience will no doubt fall prey to Gosling's stunning performance as The Driver, those who are able to see with the organ above their eyes will certainly not be satisfied. Every plot point is pretty much predictable; and if you don't really understand what is going on, do not worry. As long as the kissing and the head-blowing sequences are back to back, you will forget everything else. This flawlessly corny love story does not push the audiences to the edge but can still extract loads of sympathy from them. Christie Lemire even declared that Drive's ""more about the questionable choices that drive people -- and, ultimately, the ones that drive them away"" – as if the double take on the film's title is anything but ridiculously obvious.The question is: Would Drive be so warmly embraced within the art-house circle had it not won the Best Director Prize at Cannes in 2011? I was fooled too, and I even included it in my list of Best 2011 Films initially. However, the difficulty with which I tried to find nice words to praise it for anything beyond its crazy 80s' stylistic flourishes speak to its emptiness. On a first encounter, it is easy to accept it as some kind of high-standard crime action film. Refn found incredible ways to make use of sunshine and night lights to lighten up his picture, creating a permanent dreamy state that, when combined with the minimalist style of performance and dialog, can easily distract the audience; not to mention the effective use of electronic music. However, all of these can hardly mask Drive's flaws – the film lacks a personality, it is not intriguing in any way, and much less deep. And while one can forgive the unbearably easy manners that Ryan Gosling's Driver holds his toothpick, it is much harder when Drive's values add up to not more than the very toothpick that he holds.",Drive

Its stylish and seems to have a heavy hanging 80's setting although it is not, Gory, sophisticated and one of the best film's in recent years.

Throughout the film he starts to develop feelings for her and regularly visits her and her son. Her soon learns that she is married to a current prison convict, who is soon to be released.

889,tomodude6542,Not your stereotypical action film!,9,4 July 2012,"'Drive' is, in short, a film that includes violence, fear and car chases. Yet it is nowhere near as cavalier as other action films of the genre (i.e. the fast and the furious). More than having violence and fighting in it, it has a distinctive and poignant story line, which is the main reason for it being labelled an action film for people who have never liked action before. Its great story line is almost enough for the watcher to forget that it is essentially an action film. The way Nicolas Refn has fused romance and action into a genre of its own is truly incredible.And of course, the acting is superb. Ryan Gosling's mysteriousness makes the film what it is. Also Carey Mulligan deserves a mention.Overall, I think this a truly fantastic film. There is enough action for action-lovers to enjoy it and a big enough story line for anyone to enjoy it!

It is so refreshing to see an independent film that doesn't really on clichés, big explosions and crap acting. Anyone who has rated this film 7 stars or less clearly has come to rely on dumbed down blockbuster films, which are made to make money and appeal to as big an audience as possible.

891,tubamonkey09,A cowboy movie where the mustangs are cars,8,10 July 2012,"This film was a surprising refreshment to the movies that seem to spew from rich production companies like a BP oil spill. The story is simple and resembles old cowboy classics like ""Shane"". Basically lone stranger meets homestead, husband has issues with the bad guys, and the stranger takes care of the issues. Take this template, add some sports cars, great acting, beautiful cinematography, and an effective soundtrack and you have ""Drive"". The first thing that grabs you is the cinematography. The audience sees the city cloaked in shadows and a lone driver preparing for a heist. Then suddenly the soundtrack. The songs are mechanical and cold which compliments the driver and the hum of the car's engine. The movie is an experience and even though script-wise it is nothing new, it is still a great film that adds more value to the ""car chase"" genre that has otherwise been monopolized and bogged down by movie such as ""The Fast and the Furious"". I would recommend this film to any film lover, and even purchased the DVD for my personal collection. I rate this as a deserving 8 out of 10.",Drive
892,joshuacybulski,Are You Ready to Drive?,9,12 July 2012,"Are you ready to Drive? (SPOILERS!)Drive is a documentary about a stunt car driver named Ryan Gosling, you might know Gosling from his other documentaries The Notebook and Half Nelson. Ryan has been through his ups and downs from losing his parents to Alzheimers in The Notebook to becoming addicted to crack in Half Nelson.I was really looking forward to seeing Ryan succeed in his new career as a race car driver. It was good to see that the Dad from Malcolm in the Middle has settled into a nice career as a mechanic, I was however troubled to know that he had turned to a life a crime, I guess the checks stopped coming from Malcolm. The Scout from The Scout stopped scouting baseball and has turned to scouting race car drivers now and running a racing team, I guess Steinbrenner had finally given him that promotion he had been looking for. The real star of Drive is the Mexican family that lives next door to Ryan, Standard his daughter Irene and her little half brother Benecio. A part of me was hoping to find out what had happened to Irene and Benecio's mothers but before I could ask the question Standard was holding up a pawn shop with some Firecrotch. Ryan is a really quiet dude who loves to blast Electronica music,tour around LA and eat at Denny's. But once Standard takes a dirt nap its up to Ryan to protect his kids, enter Ryan Bourne! Ryan then goes on a rampage like no other, between eating Denny's and stunt driving Ryan has learned 11 types of martial arts,, which he uses to his advantage. Ryan and his buddies also like to joke around, at one point one of his oldest friends comes up to him at Denny's and Ryan says he better shut his mouth or he will shut it for him, classic!Nicolas Winding Refn has directed some fantastic documentaries before including Bronson and the Pusher trilogy. He also went back in time somehow to the year 1000AD and directed a documentary about a mute warrior. Fantastic stuff!All in all I would say Drive is worth your time, even though they forgot to record sound for the first half of the documentary. I would give it 9.5 crushed skulls out of 10 crushed skulls, the 0.5 point missing being for a lack of money shots.",Drive
893,wademasquerade,Breathtaking,10,21 November 2012,"I honestly haven't a clue of where to even start with this film. It has the dark, yet heartwarming story of classic noir films with the modern bite and 80's synth soundtrack of tried-and-true action flicks. This is one of those movies that will literally give you goosebumps, and that allows you to connect with the characters on a tremendous level. The characters in this film do not have the two dimensional, dull delivery that is usually expected from a film of this genre. Every emotion, every word of dialogue, every gesture is delivered with a genuine authenticity that is nothing short of impressive, which is all credited to the exceptional acting displayed in Drive. Ryan Gosling's role as the ""Driver"" is one that will be remembered for years to come. His often somber and often mute presence is very chilling albeit showing his courage and emotional strength. He delivers more emotion in his few lines than some actors can do in an entire movie. The taboo romance that brews between him and the ""damsel in distress"" character Irene (portrayed by Carey Mulligan) is both heartwarming as well as heartbreaking. The traditional ""bad guy"" roles, played by Ron Perlman (Nino) and Albert Brooks (Bernie Rose) are those that you would expect in a mobster film such as The Godfather or Goodfellas. Their strong, but not too campy, portrayals of mobsters are a nod to the aforementioned films. The score for this film, composed by Cliff Martinez (whose other works include Wicker Park and Gray's Anatomy), is a stirring, ambient work of art. With nods to 80's eurosynth pop and electronica, it fits well to the overall tone of the film, which is also accompanied by similar styled songs such as ""Real Hero"" by College and ""Nightcall"" by Kavinsky, the former of which being the ""theme song"" of the film in a way. Drive, being an adaptation of James Sallis' novel of the same title, is a powerful, riveting, exceptional piece of art. It may seem far fetched to some to call a movie art, but believe you me, this is art. From the moment the end credits were rolling, it has been my absolute favorite movie. Truly impressive.",Drive
894,AdamGH86,A complete experience,9,12 January 2019,"If the title sequence in 'Drive' does not immediately grip you then nothing I say will make any difference. It perfectly sets the tone for the entire movie. This entire movie absolutely oozes quality. The director knows exactly what he's doing here from the composition of the shots to the way the visuals and sound complement one another throughout.'Drive' is an exceptional combination of top quality direction, excellent casting, shocking violence and beautiful sound. One thing 'Drive' does that I personally love is that it has music that is essential to the experience. It's not background noise or just a series of cool tracks, it's totally woven into the fabric of the movie. It informs the mood and atmosphere perfectly.This movie is a throwback to the 70s and a modern classic. Doing a movie like this could so easily go sideways, alienate a lot of the audience and be one for purists. But I think 'Drive' rides that line between art and accessible movie really well. It's minimalist in terms of the dialogue, the action is to the point and hyper-violent but serves a purpose. This is a serious movie for serious-minded movie-goers. If a lot of high-speed action is what you want then it may disappoint, but I'd encourage anybody to just sit-back and enjoy the experience of watching such a quality film.'Drive' has really stuck with me. Not really any particular scene but the feel of it, and that's hard to explain. I just suggest you watch it and make up your own mind.",Drive
895,Superarcadia,A Masterful Dream,9,17 September 2011,"Nicolas Winding Refn has given us an odyssey with a dreamlike Los Angeles and a getaway driver who exists as an existential representation of getaway drivers and hidden demons. What's inside someone who risks their life for work and pleasure? From the driver's point of view it's probably a way to feel actually Alive, as if too much downtime were the opposite of being alive, causing pain he believes nobody would understand, and he doesn't show himself and is unable to express his internal world unless it's deeply troubling him. He's the guardian angel of revenge when a mother and child have been stricken with bad-guy gangster flu. That's the mystery Winding Refn has mastered here. What grueling violence must we face when the Rose's and Nino's come uninvited into our lives? What's underneath our surfaces? The Driver describes at the end, one day of joyriding with Irene and Benicio was the best day of his life. I think he was deeply serious about that!

This movie is my favorite example of what I call style over substance. The music, clothes, dialogue (or lack there of), and the cars are all so beautiful and stylish. I feel like I could watch this movie everyday for the rest of my life and be perfectly happy with that. People complain that with Ryan Gosling's quiet roles that he's not really a good actor, but I think that he and Carey Mulligan decided to use little dialogue together was such a good idea. You can really, truly see Gosling's emotions flow through this character. The Driver (Gosling) truly loves Irene (Mulligan), but her husband recently got out of prison, so it is kind of an awkward situation. Through a series of events of crime and corruption, the Driver ends up in a dangerous situation where he must continue to protect Irene from danger. But, in doing that, the Driver has to be quiet violent himself. He ends up stomping a man's head until he crushes his skull and brains, which some people think was unnecessary for the movie, but I thought that it fit perfectly. Refn is a filmmaking genius and I have no complaints about this movie. I would recommend it to anyone and hope that everyone enjoys it as much as I have. 10 out of 10 would recommend",Drive
898,Pwj579,Great alternative to the typical Hollywood action-fest,9,25 September 2011,"First off, I want to say I was totally impressed by this movie by the way I was totally removed from the theater I was in.The director started off with a Michael Mann-esque muscial/visual showcase of Los Angeles after dark. The 1980s revival-style pop music set the mood for the rest of the movie. Great choice for the soundtrack throughout the movie to convey emotion and feeling. Had a little feel of of Brian DePalma 80s movies (Scarface and Body Double).The opening chase sequence introduced us to this mysterious driver. Gosling's character spoke almost nothing for the first 30-45 minutes. I was very impressed by his ability to convey emotion and actions through only his expressions and body language. Cudos to him, he was channeling a little bit of Steve McQueen in this movie. (While I am a huge fan of BULLITT-1968, I'll try to keep the comparisons brief, in respect for both films and directors)It's only in his interactions with Irene and Benicio that we see his humanity.Carey Mulligan displayed her versatility as an actress as the single mother/Denny's waitress Irene that befriends the Driver. What a difference between this character and her roles in ""An Education"" and ""Wall Street: Money never Sleeps"".The turning point of the movie, stood out to me was the immediate change in the Driver's mood and attitude when he was in the Diner and a former criminal from a previous Drive confronts him. This where he answers other than a one word answer. He shows intense disdain and threatens the criminal with a mouthful.Absolutely loved the 5.0 Mustang/300 chase sequence (perhaps another homage to BULLITT, a Charger would have been to obvious?)On to the other characters in the movie. Christina Hendricks was underutilized in this film. Would have liked to seen more dimension to her character, other than her guts being splattered in the bathroom.Bryan Cranston was spot on as ""down on his luck"" action sequence director/garage owner/NASCAR crew chief wannabe Shannon. He's the Driver's boss and only ally.Albert Brooks was the cold and ruthless withdrawn West Coast mobster. This was totally outside of his typical light-fare. His cruelness was totally unexpected. The scene after his interaction with Shannon in the garage, when he replaces the razor in the case is haunting.Ron Pearlman was Ron Pearlman. Hated his character but that's what your supposed to. He got what was coming to him.If I had one negative it was the intensity and gruesomeness of the violence. However, I acknowledge that this is what the director wanted to convey. The disgusting and bloody violence that really happens as a result of survival and mob pressure.Overall a superb film. It most likely won't garner any Oscar or Golden Globe attention, except for perhaps Sound Editing, go figure.However, I believe this is one of the best films I've seen in the past 5 years. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was definitely worth the price of admission and time spent in the seat. (Only enhanced by D-Box theatre experience by Cobb Theaters that just opened near us in Northern VA.)I look forward to more films in this similar vein.Bravo!If you liked this movie, I recommend the following similar films: BULLITT (1968) Miami Vice -TV Pilot (1984) Heat (1995) Collateral (2004) Miami Vice (2006) Street Kings (2008)",Drive

I have never actually seen a Nicolas Winding Refn movie, and I wanted to like the guy. I really do. I know he shoots his films chronological order, and first I thought it would be unique, and I would get something different. I was also a Ryan Gosling fan, but when I actually saw this whole movie from start to end, boy, I realize I was wrong. Very wrong.As much for an interesting plot, the film is unique at some times, and has a bit of Tarantino-esque feel thanks to the film's violence (which is not a compliment since that type of violence for this kind of film is unnecessary)and a great performance by Gosling. However, that's the problem too. The film is sometimes too silent, not too much dialogue. And for some people, despite the interesting plot, it may not be for everybody (such as myself but still impressed) and in just many parts of the movie will leave you unanswered questions, watch and you will see.I don't say that Nicolas Winding Refn is a bad director, I'm just saying he could've done better for an audience instead of trying to impress professionals and critics.

The film is visually stunning and Ryan Gosling portrays the quiet and deadly driver with perfection.

Drive is a character study on a man who wants to be the good guy, but his surroundings and situations drag him further into a life of crime. I think we really need to talk about the cinematography in this film, it's outstanding, every shot feels thought out and composed. Refn loves his visual metaphors and this film is another exemplary example of how art house cinema can be enthralling.

The music was fitting and the diegetic sound was edited in an unusual way, sounding distant at some points and being loud and in your face when it needed to be.The second act, without getting into spoilers, was much more intense than I anticipated. The exposition in the first act, while being maybe a little bit too simple, hinted towards the second act and sets it up well.Great performances by the actors, especially Ryan Gosling, Ron Perlman, Oscar Isaac and Albert Brooks. Gosling absolutely nailed the lead role.There were a few scenes that felt off to me. One that comes to mind is when Gosling and Carey Mulligan (Irene) are at a small creek with Irene's son.

It was as if the screenwriter ran out of ideas halfway through writing and wrote the rest really quickly and lazily. It has good potential but just didn't live up to my expectations. Also, maybe I'm just really dumb, but I really don't understand what Nino and Bernie had to do with any of it. Maybe I'm missing something but they never explained how either of them were tied into it. I can see how Nino might be involved but Bernie really felt like he was just thrown in. Plus, he kills Shannon for what reason? Shannon is the last person I'd expect to be involved and yet somehow he ends up dying. The movie did a horrible job of explaining the plot and I just felt confused for most of it. Why did Bernie even need to kill all those people? I guess the acting was OK, it wasn't anything special.

So here we have it and need I say more? This film is a film lovers film, truly using the medium of image over the stage's preferred medium of sound. To top it off it has a great sound track, which adds tone and mood. The film is told by the eyes, the scenes and what is not said. It deals with age old human issues like loss, love and the want to be included and to be useful. Also it deals with true human emotion, in that Ryan's character truly gives himself to a cause for a reason that is not vane nor self centred. I will stop there because I don't want to include any spoilers!",Drive
915,Bigwillyz21,Holy crap did I watch the same thing as everyone else????!!!,1,25 November 2011,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have seen in years. The previews on TV were more exciting then the actual film. This movie is not what you think it is or what they led you to believe it was about. It was an hour and 40 minutes of boring(I can't stress this word enough), monotone, drabble that barely had a plot and made Ryan Gosling look like an idiot. I seriously thought he was ""special"" throughout the entire movie. It really is sad if we are headed down the road where this is considered a big crime thriller. $15,000,000 Budget..Is that a joke?This is my 1st review because I had to write something about this mess.Save your time and money.

916,marthastewartsmelons,One of the best movies I have ever seen!,10,26 February 2013,'Drive' was such a powerhouse of a film from the undeniable amazing acting from Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan to the artistic and out of this world soundtrack this IS what movies should aspire to be. Never in a million years did I think Albert Brooks (the lovable store owner from My first Mister an underrated gem) could be so vicious and actually make for a great ultimate bad guy. The cinematography and pace of this film is top notch it leaves you at the edge of your seat wanting more. It captures you from the beginning and keeps you hooked to the very last second almost holding your breath. Ryan Gosling is one of my favorite actors of all time his dedication to his roles and the incredible talent is one of a kind and genuine. You really feel for this character and rooting for him all the way. Everyone really delivered a stunning performance.This movie is one of a kind and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who appreciates REAL cinema.,Drive

922,Elliot_Ghost,"Mostly good, but with a flaw that destroys most of the movie",7,26 December 2011,"To start things off, i really like movies. Lots of movies. In different genres. I like hyper violence and i like sad, artsy movies that no sane person would sit through and i like big blockbusters and everything in between as long as its good in my world and the world thats within that movie. I understand this movie and i understand what people like in it. I like some of its elements too. I love the soundtrack and the contrasts between control and insanity and between calmness and panic. I like the graphic style and the surrounding feeling of it. I loved the scenes where he fell in love with the girl. I loved the tension and strong emotions portrayed with minimalism. But the things i don't like is so severe that it just irritates the hell out of me and i cant get it out of my head. The fact that so many didn't react or write about the things i reacted to just makes me doubt my own sanity. After i was done watching it, i went through some trouble and long hours reading up on other peoples opinions just trying to find clues of why i didn't like it and so many did. OK, so what didn't i like? I think the major issue i had with the movie is a major and growing problem, and that this movie just was the last drop for me personally so to speak, and it ruined it for me. I have just had it with some things in story telling in movies. One of the most annoying thing is how they portray gangsters and mafia in action/drama/gangster movies. It just seems so tiny and unorganised and weak and sloppy and braindead and totally insane that what seems like big crime syndicates can fall so easy. You only see a couple of guys and thats it. Of course there are more people behind them that the movie doesn't show (cant have the movie go on for 17 hours just to show all the bad guys) but the way its presented its totally unbelievable and unrealistic (within the realms of the particular movie's universe ofc). I understand that those big organisations don't count on a guy like this and that it could happen the way it did and that its random and bla bla bla. But its been done so many times, and in such bad ways that it makes me sick. It destroys the whole movie. OK, these guys weren't the biggest organisation in the west, but big enough. I love crazy ass movies that have a sic and twisted universe that is unreal and different from our own. But the movie always have to be believable within the universe it creates for itself. Always. Thats one of the most important things for me in a movie, and if it falls short, everything starts to fall. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind made perfect sense to me. So did brazil and twelve monkeys. So did scarface and taxidriver and Rocky and even day after tomorrow (yes, i said it!)(just to mention a few examples). Warrior fell short a little bit, but not as much as drive. Am i nitpicking when i hate this movie based on the way it portraits the gangsters he goes toe to toe with? I am trying really hard to forget it. To just let it slide. To let all the good things about the move win me over and relax. But where should i draw the line then? When is it enough?",Drive

924,acksurfer101,The Evolution of Cinema,10,25 September 2011,"My experience seeing Drive was like that of people seeing something like Star Wars when it first premiered in theaters. From the moment it started I knew I was witnessing something unique and new, an evolved film just a bit ahead of everything else. A friend of mine remarked that it's an ""indie"" mainstream movie, which could not be more on point. Drive has the depth of the most iconic independent features yet has been directed to the masses. It's exciting for me to witness a film like this, defying the rules and bringing everyone something so big with such beautiful restraint. Film is changing. It's mutating into something we've never seen before. But I think we're finally ready for it.Drive tells the story of an unnamed Hollywood stunt driver working for the movies by day and robbing banks by night. He's a getaway driver and he provides his clients, as we are told in the opening lines, with five minutes. After those five minutes he can and will get them from point a to point b. But he doesn't get his hands dirty; that's not his job. He drives. And thus begins this dark fairytale of a simple man with extraordinary talents and how his world is shaken when he falls for a neighbor and ultimately is set up when obliged to help her ex-con husband.The driver, played by Ryan Gosling, is a tremendous character, given such little dialogue, yet played with so many layers. Gosling probably has about five pages of lines and not much else. Most actors would complain that they were given nothing to work with, yet Gosling seizes the opportunity for creation. His iconic character is a quiet, introverted man who is genuinely seized with a storm of emotions he is unfamiliar to during the course of the film. There is one shot, after some particularly gruesome business, when he turns around to look at his neighbor Irene, played with touching sympathy by Carey Mulligan. He is bloodstained, trembling, and frighteningly silent, but he has a fire inside of him that pours out of his eyes, displaying a chilling mix of a savage monster and an innocent child. That is what's so incredible about this performance. He perfectly blends a reserved and even bashful innocence with primal viciousness. Ryan Gosling is truly at the leading front of a new level of acting. His driver is an ode to characters like Deniro's Travis Bickle and Pacino's Michael Corleone but with a heightened humanism those other roles at times lacked. This work is complex and scary and absolutely wonderful.Gosling is supported by an excellent cast, each bringing something refreshing and incredibly truthful to their parts. Albert Brooks' mob boss is a force of its own. Like Paul Newman's character in Road to Perdition, Brooks is a likable villain who will help his friends and take them down without hesitation. He is scary, but not just because he's the bad guy. He's scary because he seems like a real bad guy. Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, and Oscar Isaacs round the rest of the cast out, bringing true dimension to what they are given. So rarely are we treated to a movie filled with such talented people, working so hard to give us something so special.But the acting is only one part of this powerhouse. Director Nicholas Winding Refn has come to form with Drive. His earlier work, Bronson and the Pusher trilogy had flare and incredible skill, but Drive is his real breakout. It's a great example of a director's growth. Everything just comes together in a way that he hadn't done before. The soundtrack, cinematography, even the credits fit so, so nicely. This is film.He opens the movie up with such a tense chase seen that rivals the drama of the opening of Inglorious Basterds, but he does it with so much style. In Drive, he gives us a western, a superhero movie, and a fantasy in just over an hour and a half. And it flows so well. This analogy doesn't quite do the film justice, but he almost shows us a combination of a music video and a feature length movie. It just has that much grace. I was always on board with his work but now I'm fully on the team. He is someone to watch and I am gushing with excitement about his re-teaming with Gosling for a Logan's Run remake.Drive is just special. It's not something a review can sum up. It is beautiful; it is a piece of art. Go see it.",Drive

This is a treat for those who love to watch movies and enjoy the flow of it.The first scene itself made me glued to the screen.Carey Mulligan was the cutest thing that i saw for a long time in screen.

927,dpena27,What movie have you people watched?,4,16 September 2011,"This one was almost a walkout for me. The first half is so slow and boring that I considered leaving. Most of the story happens in the second half of the movie and only a few scenes can be considered good. For a movie titled drive and for the main character to be a stunt driver the two or three ""chases"" are your super basic weave in and out of traffic or run a guy off the road sort, nothing new or even entertaining. Ryan's character is written as the ""im so cool I can only say two words at a time!"" kind of guy.I swear the a lot of these ""user"" reviews are people that have been paid to praise it.Just because a movie is filmed in an older style, in this case 80's style, doesn't make it a good movie. Even in the 80's this movie would have been trashed by movie-goers.Im being generous with my 4/10.",Drive

If you're looking for a film that's a bit different from your average action flick then you've come to the right place. Please ignore the negative reviews as i'm writing my first ever review just to express how well made and stylish this film is.The title may distract you from what this film is really about. There's loyalty, passion, violence and romance all neatly woven into the film, i was expecting any of that! I thought it would be about a get-a-way driver who falls for a girl on the job. It's rare to have a film that fills silence with so much emotion that you can feel it.Watch this with surround sound on as the bass and cool 80's style electric tunes really add to the script.

929,chemamon251,Seriously?!,1,7 February 2012,"i don't know if people saw the same movie i did, but seriously i felt offended by this pretentious piece of BS, because in my opinion, to enjoy a movie you have to feel it or at least connect with the main character, and i'm not saying that i need all the Hollywood sfx or the Michael bay action movie, but come on! gosling can do better than this, i understand that his character is supposed to be ""the 80s style few words bad ass"" but instead he looks retarded. and the ""love story"" is ridiculous, there's not even a good reason for the driver to sacrifice for the girl, because she loves her ex-convict loser husband and so the kid and they don't even care about him, then a couple minutes later he's about become a racer, then everything goes wrong and for no reason, so the ""plot"" is nothing but laughable and confusing,even when the art-house movies are complex but because they have a deep history and characters but that kind of stuff doesn't fit in Drive, because there's nothing to think about, is just a psychopath/stunt man/getaway driver who falls in love with a random girl and helps her husband but everything goes wrong so now he is in trouble, that's it .i enjoy the ""art-house"" style movies, and despite the cool cinematography of this film, this is just a pretentious movie and tries very hard to be considered cool or artsy, although fails to deliver action or even the artsy look the director pretends to give, so in my opinion it's just a ""wanna be movie"".in my opinion is a generic pretentious film, easily forgettable, without a plot, quotes or an icon to be remembered. and i hate it even more because of the hype and unrealistic rates at IMDb.like i said the camera shots, photography and music are good though, but it doesn't fill the empty space for a good story.in just one word: OVERRATED",Drive
930,guniko,Real hero,7,26 August 2013,"Driver(Ryan Gosling) is a mysterious protagonist. The movie takes place in present time and we don't know anything about his past or his future. He doesn't have a name. We know that he is a professional getaway driver and he seems to be living a low profile life before he meets his next-door neighbors. A mother and her son...We don't know why he was driving around before but from that moment on, his actions are driven only by love. He embraces them as his own family and protects them instinctively. He becomes their 'hero' but can't protect them from getting hurt. The controlling idea of the movie is ""A real human being' can be 'a real hero' only to the limit that his/her environment (destiny) allows.""

Although while watching it I did have some expectations of its type but found something far more different. and different in a good way... Without indicating too much of the film, I do highly recommend it. I did find it rather STUPID some woman actually tried to sue a theater regarding misleading trailer.. Yes I do admit the trailer does give off the wrong impression but lets all face it, that isn't the first nor the last trailers will mislead us...

No such luck.Basically I'm out of the time it took to see this, and learned absolutely nothing.

933,cynthia8885,Drives your heart .. completely!!!,8,5 October 2011,"Nicolas Winding has created his own little classic in this movie. A typical genre of car movies. Though not a very fast paced movie, it keeps you hooked on till the end. Extremely violent but done very very ostentatiously!!! The bloodshed, the cars and the story line somewhere strikes a chord in your mind and heart!! its 100 minutes of movie pleasure!! Ryan Gosling is tremendous throughout the movie, has literally portrayed the essence of the story well, there is something about the silence in his mouth and the words in his eyes. It causes an effervescence inside you. And here's the best part.. his character has no name in the entire movie!!!! the plot begins where Ryan is a garage worker(Bryan Cranston) and also is an occasional stunt driver. He gets romantically involved with his neighbor, Irene( Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio, when Carey's husband(Standard) steps out from prison. Standard own ""protection money"" to Cook from his time in prison and Cook threatens to go after his wife if the money is not returned. Considering Irene in mind, Ryan steps forward to help Standard by robbing a pawn shop. The robbery goes fatally bad when standard is shot dead. Later Ryan learns that Nino (Ron pearlman) is behind this heist. How Ryan encounters Ron and vice versa, and what happens to the money, and Irene is the rest of the plot that keeps to glued to the seats.Personally my favorites of the movie was Ron Pealrman and the music and of course the action.Ron Pearl is just too very good!! Dialogue delivery, intonation, expressions this man has it all within him.Music: watch out for this track ""Real Hero"". The tune just cruises through your heart in a way you'd never imagine.The killing scenes are shot in a very dramatic and extremely violent way, but it does not make you wanna see away!! Its simply grotesque but cool!!!!Final Verdict:: Watch it to feel it!!Simply Perpetual!!! Loved the movie!!",Drive
934,SANGER_A2,Could have been much better - and shorter!,1,29 January 2012,"Okay. The storyline in this film is pretty good. The bad guys are good, the cars are nice, the ending is good...um that's about it. The main star kinda reminds me of some of the reviews of the later Matrix films comparing Keanu Reeves to a block of wood. Pretty similar is many ways. He's actually a bad-a$$ fighter and driver, but he is incapable of showing any expression. Okay, maybe there is a good reason for this, but a bit of background work showing this may have helped me put up with it a bit more.If they had added in 15 minutes at the beginning of the film explaining some of the back-stories and cut out all of the pauses and unnecessary it would be a good film.I swear, if they had cut out all the bits where there was massively long, unnecessary slow-motion scenes and the bits where the characters pause for a minute or so not doing anything the film would have just been an hour long instead of an hour and a half!!! That is the bit that ruined it for me. I went in with high expectations and just got fed up about a third of the way in. I'm sure lots of the reviews here say that it helps build tension etc - but for me it was just incredibly annoying!The ingredients were there - good cast, good story, lots of good acting, but it was just tedious overall. Someone needs to release a seriously cut-down version - maybe with some of the deleted/extra scenes thrown in to make it an actual feature-length film. Then I may watch it again. Otherwise not. I feel I have totally wasted half an hour of my life spread out throughout this film.I had such high expectation based on so many reviews and such a high rating from them! Makes me wonder if the studio employed a few people full-time to rate it and bring it up! Finished watching just annoyed at IMDb and this is the first review I've written in years and it usually gets it pretty right.",Drive
935,evansweet1214,A Tense and Often Beautiful Masterpiece.,10,19 June 2011,"You might hear one comparing this to a Tarantino film, but leave all worries at the door, this is an absorbing and tremendously unique piece of cinema from Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn. The reason it works so exquisitely well is because the film grabs hold of you and takes you inside this often dark and dream-like LA setting. So, when the end of the film hits, you feel apart of this film, and it's there to stay.This film also offers a Ryan Gosling like you've never seen him, speaking only when necessary, with tension and fury in his eyes. He's silent, caring, and ridiculously tough. Every line is delivered perfectly and every gesture is natural.I saw this at the LA Film Festival on a mammoth screen with booming speakers. The music only makes this film more unique. It is catchy and synchronized perfectly with the TRULY beautiful cinematography.This film is the BEST of its genre. I honestly cannot compare it to any other film, for it is truly that different. ""Drive"" is already the best of the year, because I'm POSITIVE no other film will haunt and invade me quite like this film has. This is not just a classic for its genre, but a beautiful and bold classic in general.",Drive

Everything is great, from the soundtrack, story, acting, writing, hell even the font of the credits is cool. The opening scene with the perfect music in the background still resonates in my head. When I first watched it I immediately felt that this one was going to be something special. And I was right. Ryan Gosling is quickly becoming one of Hollywood's most talented actors. I just recently saw The Ides of March where he was amazing as well and this movie just confirms it. Gosling plays a violent introverted driver that also understands the important things in life. Its just amazing to see this guy's subtlety when playing the part. You can understand everything he thinks about, his fear, his happiness, etc. even if he just stands there and looks or just gives a quick answer. The plot itself is good but not amazing. The movie just has a lot of very interesting characters, great acting and a unique, fresh and brilliant style.",Drive
937,ani_anks_ani,Truly different experience,10,1 October 2011,"Just finished watching ""Drive"". Truly different experience.The movie has such a tricky feel to it. Sweet and charming from one side and very dark and ominous from the other. It drags you in and doesn't let go, even after the black screen comes on. And the cinematography is just one of a kind! Some, especially the driving scenes reminded me of Gus Van Sants works and ""Brown Bunny"" by Vincent Gallo. But no, this is way different - dark story line captured in warm, flaming and shadowy tones. Wonderful lighting throughout the whole movie.Unexpected, retro-pop soundtracks played a huge role. Adding that cherry on top of the cream. Looking back I can't imagine anything better for backing up directors idea through the music.For myself, I have discovered Goslings acting in ""Half Nelson"". He was just great there, and in ""Drive"" he just continues to prove he's talent. The ending had reminded me of some french new wave movies... In conclusion, it seems to me that ""Drive"" is and undercover art film, with deep meaning. Hiding behind glossy pink head titles, pop music and a golden tarantula on the back of the drivers jacket.",Drive

939,funnybuisness94,My review,10,24 September 2011,"The first time I became aware of Nicolas Refn as a director was when I saw about the first quarter of Bronson and was extremely intrigued by how different and out there it was; but I never managed to actually finish the movie and he kind of slipped my mind. Flash forward three years when the first clip of Drive was released. I was introduced to it on an internet message board and was ecstatic right from the start. Then a while later the first official trailer was released and I found myself even more pumped than before. I made it a personal goal to get a copy of Bronson to finish it before I went to see Drive; Bronson was as strange and out there as I remembered but I generally enjoyed Refn's style and was excited to see what he was going to bring to the table for Drive. Finally after much anticipation I got to see the movie and I was amazed! With a great cast portraying almost instantly relate able and likable characters that feel very realistic and deep. The main character ""The Driver"" has an almost super hero like feel to him and his scorpion backed jacket is like his crime fighting costume. Pretty much all of the casting was perfect and I especially liked Ron Perelman, I think it is his best role in a long time and really shows you what he is capable of as an actor. The film has a very heavy graphic novel feel with both the sleek visuals and the over stylized violence as well as the mentioned before vigilante watchmen like vibe; and yet none of this makes the film seem like it isn't still grounded in reality. With one of the greatest car chases I have ever seen in a movie and an amazing 80's like soundtrack this film comes together in a way that can only be described as John Hughes meets Quentin Tarantino, making a cross over between Taxi Driver and the 1978 film The Driver. It has pretty much all the qualities of an 80's romance movie and all the qualities of your usual violent Tarantino movie in one. I think Refn did a really great job at asking the question ""how far are you willing to go for someone you love?"" And the film also experiments with love at first site; without giving away too much, he hasn't known the women very long and yet is willing to do so much for her and her family including risk his own life. I think the film is also a great look at cause and effect, as certain things lead to other things and it escalates more and more. However the movie does have a slow start it is all very vital to the plot and adds an anticipating build up because you know at any minute the sh*t could hit the fan and the feeling that something bad is going to happen is very evident in the visual story telling. All and all I think the movie comes together very nicely and is a great break from the usual pop corn flicks that are forced on us now a days. Though there is some backlash due to the advertising misleading people (supposedly. I knew what I was in for from the start) but I am very glad for Refn's success on this and I think this film will have a huge following in the future. I think any back lash on this film is just like the meat heads that hated on Fight Club because it didn't focus on fighting.",Drive
940,tigerlily1221,"There's Something About You, It's Hard to Explain",10,23 September 2011,"Had I been asked prior to viewing ""Drive"" who my favourite directors were, I'd have said, Michael Hanneke and Gaspar Noe. I'm considering adding Nicolas Winding Refn, but confess I've yet to view his other works. This film, Drive, was a delicious and engaging surprise for me, as I went to the movie at the suggestion of my husband and was not prepared for anything more than a car-chase laden hour and a half plus of predictable storyline replete with chest-thumping bravado and *yawn* you get the point. Drive manages much more, as you've inferred, if you've sifted through all 150+ reviews as I now have. Please go see it. The naysayers are viewing this through the wrong lens. So two camps it is, then. I come from the Loved-It Tribe.We left the theatre and I immediately saw the parallel to Gaspar Noe ""Irreversible,"" which shall (and should) always be controversial for film-goers. Drive has that ultra-violence and will meet with the same response as any other film that posits the question for the viewer as to the nature of man: is s/he inherently violent and, as a second correlating query, the Machiavellian, ""do the ends justify the means?"" Is Irene and her child (and their innocence) worth preserving, via any means? If we say that Driver is a 'real hero,' as the lyric's suggest as a backdrop at film's conclusion, then the movie has stated its position. A good film sometimes (or piece of music, or art) has a life in that it asks you to provide an answer to a question it asks. For a piece of art to come to life that way - and its actors to create that life - speaks to its success and the strength of the director.Aesthetically the film is a modern take on the electric 80s and transported me back in a palpable sense. The L.A. night once again is a living beast, like a tiger in the dark: Something in the night with the power to pounce, a Something exciting and demonstrably erotic. I appreciated the long glances inwards we were given at times (hallway of Standard's welcome home, the elevator, Gosling walking into the strip club, the interior of Irene's apartment) to notice details that built the theme. The walls of the strip club entryway, a champagne-coloured light, mirrored Driver's satiny-jacket. Irene's wallpaper in the apartment, patterned and ordered, feminine and muted, agreed with her character to a degree. It's the little details like this that make me want to watch this again, as I want to know more about them (him in particular) so I can answer for myself that question, ""what was his true nature?"" The scorpion. Of course the film provides us the familiar fable and several people have groaned about hearing it again. But I want to look back and note the shadow on the pavement (can I see a stinger on the end of its tail, pictured there?) or when he raises the hammer in the strip club, is that the tail about to strike? In still shots Refn has rendered Gosling (especially) into a piece of art.It's not over-thinking the film, I don't think. It is just that there's so much to capture your thoughts. Anyone claiming the film is boring/static/etc had no thoughts to capture. It's just this good!",Drive
941,deepseabc,Save 100 Minutes and Watch the Preview,1,10 February 2012,"This movie is the epitome of showing the entire movie in a 2:30 trailer. I don't mind when a movie is not exactly as portrayed in the trailer but this is ridiculous. The movie had no script, no character development and it portrayed Ryan Gosling as a bad ass driver that took jobs driving criminals while they were in the process of committing a crime. I'm not even sure a stunt driver was required for any part of the movie. There were very few, if any, overhead shots of the stunt driving there was nothing special about any of it. At best this was a B budget movie with some big names and ""interesting"" camera views and soundtrack. The interesting camera views can be summarized by something a high school film producer would use. I didn't find anything interesting about this movie and only kept watching because it got such great reviews. Gratuitous violence does not make great a movie, that was poorly written. The best analogy that I can make is to equate Drive's high ratings to ""The Hurt Locker"" winning the academy award against Avatar. Don't get me wring I think Avatar is Fern Gully for adults, but how did the highest grossing movie of all time lose against a movie that wasn't even in ""theaters everywhere?""

There are a big number of terrific reviews, and from the other side a lot of people saying that this is the best picture ever made. Please, not everything is black or white, while in my personal opinion I'm more on the darker side...Nice photography, nice soundtrack, and... that's all. This is my first written review in IMDb since I was outraged of this rating.IMDb ratings are more and untrustworthy, and mostly due to the guys that have the need to show they are admirers of the TRUE cinema, and that blockbusters are evil.

Move over Nicholas Cage, smouldering nothingness has a new face!Don't be mis-led into thinking this is a driving movie, it isn't.

I went into this movie after watching the trailer I expected one thing as I'm sure you all will. What i got was something completely different, the trailer is very misleading and gives you the feel of a down right action thriller that kicks ass from the word go, unfortunately for you die hard action fans its not. Going back to the trailer, not sure what the trend is of late to advertise a film in such a way to make the perspective audience believe that its one thing when actually its a whole different animal, either way I think most that have an open mind would be amazed at the finished product, both the cinematography and soundtrack are fantastic, the acting is toned down but with good reason and the scenes of violence are nothing if not extremely realistic! I give the film a solid 8 out of 10 but sadly i don't see this film doing very well at the box office because of how the film is shot and paced, i do however see this film becoming an instant cult classic to be placed up there next to the likes of Donnie Darko, Boondock saints and the Crow.

The name drive is totally misleading but in a good way. This movie was made in such a special, almost perfect way. There was minimal dialogue which didn't need to be added in, the music was crazy good, and the overall feel of the movie was, well, chill. Drive had every aspect of a great movie:Love Action Gore Artistic Screenplay Great Music Amazing ActingBasically everything. It was a magnificent piece of art that everyone should have the pleasure of seeing. I know that I personally will see it again, I loved it THAT much.",Drive
946,briebo1,This film is not for everyone,10,14 December 2011,"In looking at the reviews it appears you are going to love or hate Drive. If you don't like art-house style independent films, you will probably not like this movie. Yes, it has action. Yes, it has violence. Yes, it does have star-power. But this is not a blockbuster film and the vision for Drive was obviously not compromised in order to give it a broad appeal.I would describe this as a cross somewhere between Schrader's American Gigolo and Malick's Days of Heaven, both films came to mind when watching it. You have a main character you are not told much about, thank god! Too much back-story would ruin this film. I think one of its strengths is its ability to keep you in the moment, communicating all you need to know for the scene. The characters and story are communicated with minimal dialogue, the performances very understated and restrained. How it spoke to me was in a perfect blend of the score and the cinematography (one of the major criticisms of Days of Heaven) with the excellent performances that give it all a perfect pitch, even those who hate the movie cannot deny the shots are visually stunning. It is one of those films that stay with you, haunt you, because it delves in to grab you emotionally and invest you in such a profound way that the film lives on in you, I still can't shake this film. Driver now forever exists in the reality of my psyche cruising the LA streets.I have to marvel at any film that can affect me the way Drive did. The film accomplishes so much with so little, it is truly a masterpiece in my opinion.I will add that I think the division over the quality of this film lies in viewers who seek visceral experiences from film and those who don't and prefer ""entertainment"" and films that are plot driven and offer more exposition. Rarely do you find films that seek to give the visceral experience, that seek to leave an impression on the viewer. If you prefer, and like myself even hunger for, impression over the normal exposition, you are going to LOVE this film.",Drive

Yes, there are intense action scenes that push the R rating toward an NC-17, but the overall vibe of Drive is one of silent menace. And although the film centers around a mechanic/stunt driver/getaway driver, high speed car chases aren't what Drive's all about. There's so much going on under the surface of Drive's unnamed main character (played with simmering intensity by Ryan Gosling) and so much left unspoken - when other directors would have chosen to fill the air with dialog - that Drive does something films rarely do: it makes audiences think. Who is this strange man who parcels out his words as though he's being made to pay in blood for their usage?

First half shows a calm, quiet, and peaceful side of that driver; the second half, however, shows a different side of him entirely. A good twist. The movie pairs action scenes with slow, new-wave-like songs. A different vibe kind of movie. It's also very tense; there are lots and lots of dialogue-free-but-awkward moments between the driver and that girl he likes. They take their time when conversing. Staring at each other for at least 5 seconds before replying to the each other's sentences. Weird, but rightly placed ""pause"".Halfway through the movie, I make fun of whatever on the screen, but the more we get deeper into the movie, the more I enjoy it.

This is my first ever review and I created my account just to write it. Drive is full of clichés, no dialogue at all, stupid and undeveloped characters and almost no enjoyable action scenes.

I noticed the rating of 8.3/10 on the IMDb website and it definitely boosted my intention of sitting down with a cold beer and enjoying an hour and half of action packed movie!!! Well, what a let-down... it started well with the robbery and the chasing through LA, but then the whole thing crumbled. The action totally faded, I was left with one or two scenes of driving for the rest of the movie while the main actor just did not perform so for the driving it drove me bunkers! Anyone, I believe, with a couple words of English could have had the role. His style was cheap with his old, used and bloodied jacket without forgetting that his toothpick in the mouth was like so 20 years ago, god it makes me feel old! The other actors, I'm sorry but they were just shocking, like the soaps characters on local TV. The girl next door, her fella, the gangsters plus the ones I forget were just terrible actors. And just to add a bit more, the music was aged. Have a look on the page about all the goofs in the movie like when he drives the Mustang backwards and gears go up, come on! And what amazed me is when he rammed into the gangster's limo with the front of his car and the front lights were still perfectly working... Quite unbelievable... And let's be honest, if you were in his boots right? You killed one of the two gangsters that are after you, would you show up unarmed in a restaurant to meet the other gangster who wants you dead? And turn your back to him when you are walking through the car park? Exactly! In the real world you wouldn't, well he did... Not many thoughts went on for the making of this movie which is slow, cheap, boring, useless and will leave you angry from the time wasting and the money you just spent watching this piece of rubbish.

The boy responds, ""yeah"". ""How can you tell,"" asks the man. ""All sharks are bad guys,"" responds the boy as though it is obvious.With a movie that is directed as deliberately as Drive I believe that this scene is in there with a very specific reason, and is crucial to understanding what this film is placing in front of us. The major theme of this film is a tried but true idea which is, what is bad and what is good. What is light and what is dark. Can you tell who the bad guys are?We have Shannon and the Driver, both run an honest garage shop, both also aid criminals. Both are trying to get into honest, work but are drawn back to the dark, by their actions and by ""bad"" luck. We have Bernie and Nino. One is hot tempered and quick to kill the other doesn't relish what he has to do. One laughs after killing, one sits alone in his house drinking. One wants to murder, one wants to help.The much talked about elevator seen is the culmination of this problem for the driver. He knows that he must unleash the ""dark"" in him to save the one he loves, but he also knows that she will see this ""darkness"" in him. Which is why he wants steals a kiss, one last moment to show her the ""light"" in him before he must unleash the ""dark"". This film is a purely sad movie about how even the best of us, when pushed to the edge of death will unleashes the monsters inside us in order to survive, and to protect the ones we love. So who are the good guys? Who are the bad? Can Bernie really be considered a Shark just because he is trying to save himself? Remember the driver is just as much a criminal as he is. Can the Driver really be a good guy if he is willing to help criminals and go to the edge of brutality that he does? Who are the sharks?",Drive

966,SylvainSivori,A perfect modernization of an ancient concept.,10,10 October 2011,"Drive(2011)I watched 'Walhalla Rising', Nicolas Winding Refns previous film, a few years ago at the Rotterdam Film Festival and left with a great feeling. This piece about a mute viking(one-eye) made a big impact. Yet, I never expected the director to make the leap over the ocean himself and make a more mainstream film. Well he did, and I'm thrilled.The film starts off with a blast. We see 'driver' (Ryan Gosling) driving an escape car and outwitting cop cars in a way which reminds of a computer-game. The tension and pace of the scene is very strong, straight away the main character is portrayed as calm, cool and collective. Nobody can hurt him, as we will see in the rest of the film.The main character possesses a few characteristics 'one-eye' in 'Walhalla Rising' also possessed. Whereas one-eye never spoke, driver speaks the bare minimum. One-eye was relentlessly violent, as is driver. Ryan Goslings character is a present day viking/hero. Rules don't apply to him, he and his car are untouchable.The film is divided in two parts. The first part obviously introduces the characters, but in a very calm way. A 'standard' type love-interest is also introduced. We take a look at drivers life. The story eases by and can very well be an homage to eigthies B-movies, also thanks to the fantastic original score which has an eigthies synthpop feel to it.The second part of the film takes the viewer to a completely different direction. The story evolves into a crime/thriller where everybody is inter-involved in some way. When things start to go wrong they really do. The film becomes a personal quest by our ""hero/viking/driver"". He has to protect his love-interest and her son. Suspense is also fed with great ease by the director, the build-up to the 'gore-like' scenes is very elegant. Driver goes about with amazing coolness and confidence. He's got everything to become an instant cult-hero. The hero is dead, long live driver.The cinematography is amazingly well adapted to the story, the scenes where he flies around the city in his car for one are mind-bobbling. The direction is very smooth, time flies by when viewing this. The 'gore' is great and unexpected and reminds of David Cronenberg; realistic, hard, but not too much of it which gives a great impact.The casting is spot-on. The stubborn loner driver is perfect for Gosling. Carey Mulligan gives the single waitress-mom a new dimension and is as sweet as she is hardened. Bryan Cranston as the likable opportunist friend Shannon who has known hardship is easy to relate to. The 'gangsters' play roles they're familiar with. Ron Perlman as Nino stands out as a very convincing hatable character.The score is wonderful. The 80s synthpop goes perfectly with the lonely dark nights of LA, it also adds to the softness of the subtle love story. The stylist scenes combined with the suspense rising sounds give a great effect and keep the viewer on the edge all the way through. There aren't any major twists and turns in this crime-thriller, it's not needed though. Drivers quest for justice is a familiar story set in modern day Los Angeles about a man with morally high standards and the skills to go along with it to make the bad guys pay. A perfect modernization of an ancient concept. 9/10",Drive
967,amudsen14,Awful and completely overrated,1,8 June 2012,"Just to put this review into context: I love character driven movies with beautiful cinematography. I am a big fan of compelling unconventional love stories, mysterious deep dark characters, symbolic plots, and beautiful shocking violent scenes. This movie has none of the above, at all. It tries so hard to have it, that it just sinks in its own pretentiousness. It's all about the director trying to show how cool this movie is. Guess what? It's not. Don't get me wrong, I care for anything that tries to separate itself from the awful movies Hollywood is making nowadays. I hate Transformers, or any other CGI crap. I love B movies from the 80s. I don't care if a movie is slow. What really bothers me about this film it's that is has no soul. It is self centered and pompous. The plot makes no sense. The characters are stereotypes. The level of violence is disgusting and completely unnecessary. Seriously, I think Bryan Cranston is the new God of acting, I used to believe that Ryan Gosling was one of the best actor of his generation (I've seen practically all his movies), and I have nothing but admiration for the rest of the cast. Then, why does this movie does not make me even care for what happens to any of the characters? Because everything here it's just so fake! As a viewer, you never stop remembering that you are watching a film. You never get driven by the story. All this fuss about how great ""Drive"" is just reminds us of how decaying the movie industry is nowadays. Is this supposed to be ""the best movie of 2011?"" Come on! Any five minutes of Breaking Bad, picked at random – even Walter Junior having breakfast! – can be a million times better than this 100m overrated piece of crap. And please Just because the main character doesn't do anything, it doesn't mean that the movie is ""existential"". Go read a book before you used that word! I'm so angry I was not going to write anything, but I need to get this out of my system And to warn other people: this movie is not art, it is a complete waste of time.",Drive

What director Refn does exceptionally, is tell a real film, developing characters with little, to no dialogue. The Driver (Ryan Gosling) may know a stick shift like the back of his hand, but it's his presence outside of his sleek 1973 Chevy Malibu that tells the true story. A quiet, reserved man who is capable of inexplicable violence, we know almost nothing of his background. Stunt driver for films similar to ""The Fast and The Furious"" (which this film has almost nothing in common with), The Driver moonlights as a getaway driver for petty, small time criminals. We see Gosling as an antisocial, mysterious man, but that doesn't stop him from forming a protective relationship with his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son, while her husband is in jail. The two have little to say to each other, but from very subtle stares and gestures the audience easily comes to their own conclusion that they understand each other. The pacing of the first half of the film is incredible. We are slowly introduced to this seemingly calm world, which clashes with electronic, 80's synths revving up the soundtrack. The bond between Gosling and Mulligan blossoms, even after her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac), returns home from prison. Owing protection money from prison, Standard must rob a pawn shop in the valley with the help from The Driver and the full figured, femme-fetale Blanche (Christina Hendricks). With the heist going from routine to disastrous, the film's tranquil pace explodes into shocking, gruesome violence. Bloody or not, the movie has sucked you into this noirish- world and no matter what happens next you cannot look away. Still, it's the performances and cinematography that continue to blow my mind long after the film is over. Albert Brooks, who seems like a decent ally at first slowly transforms into a monster, which is an exciting transition, although is clear from the start. Ryan Gosling's presence is so dominating throughout the entire film that requires the audience to be submissive, and is entirely done through his demeanor. With the few car scenes in the movie, you're completely sucked in because the choreography of it all is mind-blowingly awesome. Sigel creates such a unique atmosphere in which you become hypnotized and eventually surrender to. I only have one complaint and that was not utilizing Christina Hendricks! I'm a huge Mad Men fan and I really was disappointed with her amount of screen time. Not discrediting the film, just a personal wish. I'm predicting this is a film that will go the way of a fine wine, better with age.A must see for all film buffs....""My hands are a little dirty.."" ""So are mine.""",Drive
970,theomer1,A worn out storyline but a captivating movie,6,27 January 2012,"This is a typical ""good guy wipes out bad guys"" movie. It was way too dramatic. The tough guy was too tough to respond to other people's simple questions like ""How are you doing?"" or ""What time is it?"" He would just stare at the person talking to him. The dialogs were typical of mob movies. Pauses in dialogs were annoyingly long. During those pauses, I often found myself thinking, ""Spit it out already!""As for the good parts, the movie is beautifully shot and successfully keeps you at the edge of your seat from start to end. It doesn't rely on too much background music to induce the mood. A well-made film overall.",Drive
971,jamesschwartzvedanta,Eighties Camp At Its Best,9,2 November 2011,"This movie is great campy fun -- but elevated to art by the quality of the acting and the directing. It's almost Warholian in it's approach: gloss, camp, ultra-violence. Clearly the film is a parody/dissection/love-letter to those action films from the eighties where the heroes were cool and the plot twists were utterly obvious and the world was glossy and cheesy and strikingly soul-less, but also terribly attractive. The plot? Ryan Gosling drives a getaway car, falls for the lovely but under-used Carey Mulligan, and ends up in trouble after helping her troubled husband do one last heist. Oh yeah, it's predictable alright. But the direction is so assured and the acting is so fine that it's an absolute pleasure to watch things unfold. I wish there had been one or two more good twists, and the ending was disappointing. But how can anyone complain after a cinematic treat like this. Extra points for the spot-on soundtrack!",Drive
972,thewolfscarecrow,Worst Movie of 2011,1,4 November 2011,"OK, let me just start by saying that I am an intelligent person, and I hate the usual car movies like Fast & Furious. So that wasn't what I was expecting when I saw this. I went this hoping for a sleek, smart thriller with Ryan Gosling. That's not what I got.I honestly do not understand the hype this is getting and wish people would stop trying to read themes into this movie that aren't there. I'll admit, the cinematography was beautiful.The acting by Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan was awful. I have never seen an on-screen couple with less chemistry and I never understood the attraction. If someone looked at my kid the way ""Driver"" is always staring, there's no way I'd let him in the house! All they ever did was stare at each other and then BAM, husband is back. And he doesn't like ""Driver"" but then they're best friends. All just suddenly and with no emotion behind it! The story never had enough development. They'd give you hints of a plot but never actually give you anything. No back stories on the characters, nothing. I understand that it is imitating real life, but good films can develop characters even without shoving it down our throats. Gosling seemed just like a shy, normal guy and then suddenly he's killing everyone? Violently and brutally? It just wasn't believable. And then everyone tells me he's supposed to bad-ass. Why, because he chews a toothpick? Movies are about telling a story and ""Drive"" did not do this at all. Save your money, see ""Midnight in Paris"" instead.",Drive
973,dmzavatar,Still Waters Run Deep!!,9,7 November 2011,"This film just kept on surprising me. At first I thought it was trying to be cooler than it was, and I was annoyed. Then I thought it was trying to be cleverer than it was, and I was annoyed....Then BaMMM it turned out that it was a truly well executed intelligent and cool movie. I underestimated it just like many do with ""no name"" and you'll see how that works out for them...Fantastic.Poor reviews may be down to people missing the core reason for the turning point(s). The film does explain this to you clearly, but in contextual dialogue. There's no lengthy exposition from a character only there to join the dots. Those familiar with noir/double cross/and ""the patsy"" can easily understand what's going on.These guys are in a need to know situation and when it hits the fan your asking the same question they are - you're involved not just a passive observer. It's been a while since I've gone from thinking ""who the **** does this guy think he is?"" to genuinely giving a **** about their outcome - all in an economical hour and forty minutes.Again fantastic.",Drive

How anyone can say this is a bad movie is totally beyond me. So what makes a good movie? fine acting - I give the leads here 9/10 Great cinematography - i give this 9/10 Good dialogue and plot line - a solid 8/10 Great soundtrack - one of the best I've heard in ages - 9/10 Character depth - again a solid 9/10Drive scores highly in every department. Ryan Gosling takes his personal performances to a different level leaving the viewer sympathetic, engrossed, engaged and repulsed in his character at different times through the film. The support are all outstanding and occasionally deliberately clichéd.And its a long time since I heard such a beautifully haunting soundtrack.

Carey mulligan gives the same expression she gave in her previous movies, but its Ryan's ride as he is really the driver of the film; and Nicolas winding is hid co-pilot as he keeps you guessing as to what he wants you people to feel about this film.the only little crack in the mirror are the Tarantinos style of violence which could have been easily avoided without disturbing the impact of the scene . overall this is a gem of a movie. go for it to experience a very different kind of genre.p.s. i am not a regular writer.",Drive

But then again it could have been so much better with a few tweaks.I think it's the producers first serious movie so I let it slip. For a debut it would be awesome, or for someone willing to learn.I loved the retro look, the music was seriously the best I heard in a while in a movie.But then again a speechless protagonist and some artsy camera shots don't make a good movie. The end was rubbish. Cut to black fair enough but not like that. Also too much time spent on establishing characters when some of them are just not very deep. On the other hand you have whole story lines leading nowhere.As a conclusion, watch this movie. But hope that the mistakes won't get repeated.",Drive

978,mthuff,Performances - superb,10,4 April 2021,"What I enjoyed enormously in this film, was the amount of non-verbal acting, and especially Carey Mulligan's, whose very natural and quietly expressive acting provided such a striking contrast to the violence which then follows. I missed this film at the time, but was very pleased to have caught it, it being material I would not ordinarily have chosen to watch. Both Ryan Gosling and she should be greatly commended for minimising their dialogue to such effect, and deploying considerable talents to improve the overall effect of the film.",Drive

However I found the movie to be overly violent (unbelievable)and, by the end, ridiculous...unless someone can explain why this guy, after being super-human through the whole film, allows Albert Brooks to stab him? This story was told more effectively in a better film years ago, Michael Mann's Thief. And as far as action goes, I would take the car driving in Bullitt over this one. Goosling may be a better actor but McQueen driving a muscle car was more exciting. And as a contrast...the restrained violence of Bullitt had a more devastating impact than the cartoon violence of Drive.",Drive

981,sinnatra,"""Stare"" is what they should have called this...",1,9 February 2012,"This movie was tedious and pretentious. At times you get a vague feeling of David Lynch's masterpiece Mulholland Drive but that feeling quickly evaporates. This movie lacks any real character development. Some of the violence is simply over the top because it is unexpected and you have no feel for why it is happening to such a degree. 60% of the movie is nothing but characters looking introspective. This, in my opinion, isn't ground breaking or even particularly interesting at all. I could've spent two hours looking at various photographs of people and had a better time. There seems to be a large crowd that loves this movie and I can see what they see in the movie but it doesn't appeal to me. So in short, I get it, and I am not impressed.",Drive
982,Hit-Girl101,best film ever,10,10 February 2012,Drive is the best and I'm gonna leave it at that. Trolls probably don't agree but that's just because they are so jealous that they couldn't have seen it first. People like Quentin Tarantino he was just mad because he didn't make it first. And another thing is in all of his movies the characters talk too much i know he likes dialog but he has taken it to far. And he hates inception and drive and we all know i cant be having that. Drive was the best how much do you a ll wanna bet he was high as a kite that day? If I had a dime for every time i said i loved it i would have over a million dollars. Its true i love that movie hecka bad. I think its time Quinn came out of his shell and said the same. If he knows it why does he never admit it? Good question right?

Shame.However, whilst the story isn't mainstream, it's hardly unique and the plot was as flimsy and obvious as they come. Too much time messing with groovy camera work etc is all well and good, but the story and characters where poorly crafted/delivered.I genuinely tried to enjoy it, but I think the edge that it tried to maintain/achieve simply wasn't attainable.All in all, great cast, excellent cinematography, but a fairly poorly implemented movie.Damn shame as I was expecting something ""special"".Good, but far from excellent and therefore 5 out of 10.Soz",Drive

The lights, the sounds, the camera shots. I was intrigued, so I asked the name of the movie. DRIVE.I remained hesitant until one day while passing a theater I decided to finally give the movie a try. What a great decision that was. The film isn't afraid to venture out and try something different. It attempts and delivers in spectacular fashion.Films like 'The Descendants' and 'The Artist' received all the attention this year, and they are without a doubt great films.

985,jakej0693,Pretentious movie that tries to act like an art film.,5,21 June 2013,"Let me start off by saying that I totally disagree with the rating of this movie. I mean, come on! 7.9?!? This movie tries way too hard to be artsy by having long scenes, that in the end, have almost nothing to do with the rest of the movie. One of the reasons people say this movie is great, is the acting and characters. But, I totally disagree with that. Ryan Gosling tries to act cool and mysterious but, comes off as being creepy and weird. HALF of the movie is just ""Driver"" (Gosling) and ""Irene"" (Mulligan) staring at each other and barely talking, while some irritatingly boring music plays loudly in the background, acting as filler for what should be taken up by actual acting and emotion.Okay, so if all the boring artsy stuff had been the whole movie, then it would have been fine. 6.5/10 easy for trying to be interesting and artsy.But, then the movie tries to make up for the boringness by throwing extremely gory ""action"" scenes into the mix. Mind you, when I say ""throw"" I mean they LITERALLY go from boring slow motion bulls**t to blowing a girls head off with a shotgun and stabbing a guy in the eye with a metal pipe. Another example of this is when Driver and Irene are making out in an elevator then, all of the sudden, he starts bashing a guys head in with his foot! It makes no sense and comes out of no where!!!The most annoying thing about this movie is the driving parts.This movie is titled ""DRIVE"" (I do understand that it has two meanings) and has multiple driving scenes in the trailer but, there are maybe 2 or 3 driving scenes worth anything, and the whole part about Shannon telling Bernie that he's ""Special"" and he's ""never seen anything like it"" but, we see maybe three full minutes of him actually doing impressive driving. Most of the car scenes are of him just driving around in his car, or driving Irene around in his car, or him tinkering with his car... you get the picture here. Plus the whole ""stunt driver"" thing is basically just a slap in the face, as there is only ONE F***ING SCENE of him being a stunt driver.The thing that pisses me off the most is the fact that this has such high reviews and a high rating. When this movie first came out it had a 8.7 and now it has a 7.9, which I think is still too high. When you think about other movies that have much better acting, directing, action scenes, characters, and plot, but have much lower ratings and then you see this piece of cinematic dogs**t get a 7.9, it just shows how terrible the movie industry has become and how stupid the majority of people in the world have are.",Drive
986,craig-oxley,Not the film you were expecting,2,3 November 2015,"After watching the trailer you may be expecting car chasing, bare- knuckle fighting, explosions and a fast paced action film. But it's none of these things.It's a slow paced drama that centres around the longing looks of two people that want to be together. Don't expect any of the things I mentioned in the first paragraph. Do expect long scenes with barely any dialogue and lots of moody mumbling. You may get excited that it's ""going to kick off"" at one point in the hotel. But that's as much action as you're going to get.As I was expecting an action film and not a moody art house student type of film. I hated it. Many love and adore this film and are rash to call others that don't like it as idiots. But everyone has their own opinions and what they do and do not like. Don't be quick to judge someone by their likes and dislikes.So in summary, not an action film. Look up any Drive parody on YouTube. They all have it spot on.",Drive

But I had to for this one, it was such an epic disaster that I had to justify the money I spent watching this turd.This movie tries to be ""artsy"", and people seem to buy it, in the same way people think abstract art is artsy. Basically 90% of the movie is nothing happening. We see characters staring not saying anything, or just driving around. There are trace elements of a plot, enough to make you think it will all come together later... it does not... The plot is about as flimsy as a low budget porno. The mind numbing nothingness and pointless scenes are occasionally interrupted by EXTREME and over-the-top graphic violence.Let me address a few quotes from professional critics, and tell you the truth about the film. I could go on but frankly its high time to purge the experience of this film from my life and move on. Please ignore the positive reviews, they are apparently all high on something really strong.

Ryan Gostling's 'mute' performance prevented you engaging with his character. There was no chemistry between him and the female lead.In terms of action there wasn't enough. In terms of violent action it was very poorly done with no sense of suspense leading to the gratuitous violence and recognisable CGI effects.Oh and the ending was highly unsatisfactory too with no sense of closure and no feeling that you had learnt anything from the experience of the film.

The plot although being very simple is very effective and it is a brilliant spin on the Romeo and Juliet situation. After watching many Nicholas Winding Refn films I was expecting a full out violent romp but I was completely wrong as this film exhibits what I believe is the true essence of cinema, yes it did have them extreme violent moments but they were equaled out by the pure beauty that as the romance between Goslings and Mulligans characters.

Overly-stylized violence distilled to its basest essence -- neither visceral nor intellectual -- that, it doesn't so much shock as desensitize.The director,Nicolas Winding Refn, hasn't a creative -- or an original -- bone in his body; mimics Brian De Palma, Martin Scorcese, Quentin Tarantino et al.Ryan Gosling does his impersonation of the remote, existentialist anti-hero. But instead of appearing preoccupied and intense, he just looks 'blank'; not too unlike a damaged adult Opie.

992,museman-jude,Drive: A thinker's thriller,10,29 June 2012,"Drive is a fabulous film. However, it seems it is drawing some negative reviews from the fact it is not 'fast and furious' type car movie. That is completely absurd. For starters, Drive has a substantial plot and excellent acting, the polar opposite for Fast and Furious movies. Comparing them is like comparing two different films from different genres. Drive is much more of slow paced, tension builder. From the blood- pumping beginning to the exhilarating finale, Drive will leave you breathless. Ryan Gosling plays Driver fantastically well, considering he is rather unaccustomed to this type of role. Carey Mulligan is impressive but Albert Brooks almost steals the show from Gosling. Most famous for voicing Nemo's dad in Finding Nemo, Brooks is transformed as brutal and savage gangster Bernie Rose. The Violence is a little excessive, but provides an emotional link between Gosling and Mulligan. Drive is an amazingly hypnotic movie that will take a while to sink it, but when it does, it will stay there for a very long time",Drive
993,juanxto,An unexpected pleasant surprise,8,22 April 2012,"This is my first review for IMDb and I have to say that I've decided to do so because this movie has made me feel something I haven't felt with any other movie in the last few years.As an overall, the words which would better describe this feeling are ""strangely beautiful"". Lots of people have criticized the long pauses and silents from the actors, and even though they have transmitted me more than dozens of spoken dialogs in other movies. Looks are self-explanatory, vibrant and full of emotions and unspoken things. The main character is completely awesome, one of those who will stay in your memory, full of details and with a meaning for everything he does, says or doesn't say. And the music is really good, with an 80's flavor but not being completely old-fashioned. I can still remember the songs in my mind.Anyway, and I think this is the source for all the bad feedback this movie has got, you must be aware that this is not one of the latest kind action movie. You won't see spectacular chases, nor long shooting scenes, nor even explosions. This doesn't mean it is not violent; I can assure you it has some of the more violent scenes you could watch in the last few years.As a summary, I recommend this movie as a whole product. It may not be a great action movie, nor a romantic one, nor a noir movie and at the same time, it is all together at once. I would dare to say that if you liked Leon, you will like this one as well as both movies are more about the persons and their relationship than the action itself. An enjoyable experience.",Drive

He just stares into space and blinks his eyes, I though more than once that he would fall asleep, sincerely, be advised, don't specs too munch of this movie, for me was a waste of time and money, I actually want to do some justice with the rate, I think is too high for some crazy fanatics of unjustified violence and empty dialog.",Drive
995,ana-persinaru,Hauntingly intriguing,8,12 May 2012,"I am a big fan of Ryan Gosling's unconventional roles so Drive was a must see. The storyline is not very obvious, which makes the action so much more gripping. The 'Driver' (he has no name) is very mysterious and gives so little away from what he's feeling that it leaves you guessing, which is in my opinion the charm of this movie. Don't expect the movie to be action scenes from one end to the other; when they're not smashing each other's heads, the camera focuses on the driver's steel gaze and gloved hand clutching the wheel... you don't know where danger is coming from or if there is any. All in all, I think this movie is very individual. There's nothing that I'd compare it to, which is a big thing for movies nowadays. I do recommend you take care if you don't particularly enjoy the violence. I for one am fine with the concept it's just some of the graphics were very very vivid (e.g poking a guy's eye out with a fork), but I think that's a reason why it was so compelling.

While he was driving, everything is under his control. As i said before there are two part of this film. For me, night is more sensational than the day. After passed long time Ryan Gosling met the new neighbor, she is Irene. Film is starting after this period. Irene's husband was in the jail. After he leaved the jail, he got in to trouble with mafia. The leader of mafia offered the work to the Irene's husband. Also mafia leader threatened to Irene's husband for accept their work. Otherwise they will kill the Irene and her little boy.

His kind of love interest is played by (i swear I've seen her in something before) Carey Mulligan, her on screen chemistry with Gosling is awkwardly good. The movie directed by Nicholas Winding Refn is not what one would initially expected, it finds a perfect balance between being fast paced and calm. It is a unique film, surreal, edgy and violent, it is excellently weird with an eerie 80′s feel to it. All adding up to be a pretty decent film overall.",Drive

Harvey Weinstein was next to me.The energy of this movie have had me blown away. I had all but lost my love of movies (I've been working as a sales agent for years selling terrible indie movies). I scored a ticket to DRIVE and figured I'd give it 20 mins and walk out if it sucked.This movie was so perfect. It's ability to nail the era, to capture a feel I've seen in so few movies, it was a mix of grindhouse and vintage 80s LA that I didn't know could be captured. Straight forward, simple, and absolutely spell binding.The crowd at the premiere was so into this movie, it was like we were all witnessing something. When Ryan Gossling stomped that guys skull in the elevator, the movie got a standing ovation full of whoots and cheers. Mind you, just the day before, I saw the press screening to Terrance Malick's TREE OF LIFE from which I counted at least 100 walk-outs. DRIVE really grabbed a hold of me (and the entire theatre) and took us to a place movies haven't taken me to in years.GREAT F-ING MOVIE!!!! And if you show DRIVE to someone and they DO NOT like it??? Then you pretty much have understood both of you are on two completely different appreciation levels (don't knock the other person, just don't waste your time showing them beauty when they'll never appreciate it).",Drive
999,briandwagner,Great film with a few issues,7,21 February 2014,"Pretty solid film, although I think this film is pretty overrated. Two things really pulled me out of this film. The first was the sound. For what ever reason, in parts of the film, they put all the dialog and sound effects on the right channel and the music on the left. It creates a very strange effect. When there is a character on the right side of the screen, and you hear their voice on the left, it pulls you out. This is a huge issue if you watch the movie with head phones (Like I did). I actually switched the film to mono part way through so I wouldn't be distracted by it. It might seem like a minor thing, but truthfully, this ticked me off. The second thing that really pulled me out of the film was the gore. It seemed so out of place. I mean, I guess the amount of gore that comes out a persons head when they get shot by a shotgun would be a lot, and maybe it was a realistic amount, I don't know. But it seemed over the top. Not like a Kill Bill over the top where it's to the point where it's funny, but instead it was out of no where and pulled me away. But it should be noted that this isn't the case every time something violent happens. At the end of the film, a characters arm gets cut open and the amount of blood wasn't as over the top as other moments and as a result, didn't distance me from the film. Those are my biggest complaints. All in all, it was a real good movie. But if those two things would have been corrected, it would have been much better in my opinion.",Drive
1000,ginazoneny,So disappointing & horrid sound mixing,1,11 January 2020,"The 1st thing i noticed was the sound mixing between music & vocal speech. I had to turn volume 20 levels higher than usual to hear anything, but the music was outrageously louder (by a factor of 10+ increase) than the vocals of actors. To hear dialogue I couldn't turn tv down to reasonable level.Then I noticed. Ryan wasn't given ANY dialogue through whole.movie; I kept waiting for him to speak but he couldn't because apparently they didn't write any dialogue for him, which made the movie painful & frustrating to watch.Between those & some minor but fatally flawed story telling/writing, I could not watch the last 10 minutes or so & rated this a one of ten as a result. Too bad as the concept was sound & the production quality great. Whoever wrote the dialogue & the sound mixer turned a great movie into a total dud.I have 4k UHD plan for best pic & sound, with a full home theater system that is balanced perfectly. Not my system so it's the original film or netflix streaming that screwed up this movie for viewers.",Drive

Drive shows the viewer it's mastery in strides as it thoroughly gets its messages about love and sacrifice across along with it's many underlying themes of loyalty and betrayal. This is a film told not in words but pictures as every single frame of film has a story of its own. The direction taken in this film is one unlike any other before it, and it has undoubtedly inspired many passionate filmmakers. Ryan Gosling is brilliant as the Driver, undoubtedly the best role of his career so far. I cannot sing enough praises for this film, just please go watch it right now if you haven't already.",Drive

But the movie was a success because of the presentation and Ryan Gosling's awesome acting.Also the soundtrack was very influential. In fact i found the soundtrack holding me up to the screen. Action scene was also quite bloody and comes out of nowhere making the viewers surprised.I personally have seen the movie a number of times. I found it quite good.Besides Ryan,Albert Brooke did a nice job. Carey Mulligan was also nice. But Christina Hendricks,though she was in a small role,looked quite funny. And the dress she wore was hilarious.Not the usual nicely dressed Joan we use to see in the TV show called mad men.Still this movie is quite good and hope you will enjoy.

1005,CaligulaJones,"A New ""Bullitt""? Only if Kim Kardashian is the new Marilyn Monroe",1,17 September 2011,"Worse tripe since ""Black Dahlia"". At least Josh Hartnett TRIED to act in that. The direction on ""Drive"" appears to be ""action""...and somebody forgot to say ""cut"". Not to mention actually film any action.I'm also rather bemused by all the ""you don't really know anything about film"", if you don't happen to worship at this piece of post-modernist crap. I can guaranFRAKINGtee you that my ""best of"" list has movies most can barely pronounce, let alone have ever seen. I studied film at college and I've seen more art/cult/indy movies in ONE DAY than most of you have in your lifetimes.So, I know pretentious crap when I see it, and this pretentious crap.I usually love pretentious crap. I can usually get SOMETHING out of, though. Some acting, some plot, some music, some action. But instead, we get dull actors, a heist gone wrong cliché, REALLY bad 80s music, and precisely 5 minutes of really good driving at the very beginning.This film has nothing to offer me but Albert Brooks (which is the only reason it gets one star, although I can't really give it zero).And, no, I've never seen ""Fast and Furious"". I don't intentionally watch a Bruckheimer movie. And I would have got the irony if there was actually not a single bit of driving in this movie.If you want the same effect this movie gave me, put on a car commercial, push pause, drink a shot of cough syrup, hit play for three seconds, repeat. It would help if your three year old was playing with a Casio keyboard as well, or put on the ""Miami Vice"" soundtrack (TV show, not movie).Do yourself a favour: rent ""Into the Night"" and ""The Limey"" if you want a vision of gritty LA. Or, hell, watch ""The Shield"", which had more integrity in one scene than in the six hours this pretentious crap seemed to be.Oh, and Christina Hendricks gets a credit? The car's tachometer gets more screen time.Between her prominent, er, billing, and the trailer, this was pure Hollywood shuck and jive, bait and switch.

All the ingredients where there, but the chef... was not. I tried really hard to stay awake. Such a shame. Slow and boring. Tried twice to watch it, and i had to give it a third try. Totally unbalanced with R. Gosling's talent absent throughout the movie. Dark, with loud music, no dialog and numerous pointless scenes, this film is certainly overrated by some reviewers. The director tried hard to push it as an artistic effort but failed in the process. The film had a fair opening (since when can somebody outsmart... a helicopter and half of the police force...chewing a toothpaste and driving around), a plot plot and a bad ending. I had to give it a 5 out of ten because i like Gosling.What a Yawn!!!",Drive

The story is about a driver who is perfect in his Driving,skilled in killing,quiet in talking,and a quiet lover who would not say a thing to the girl but have taken the whole mess for her by helping her hubby and getting into some deep trouble from which he gets out by killing all the bad guys(though the ending is not so good). The plot is that the Driver has fallen for her neighbor who is married to a guy who is in prison but when he gets out he is in deep debt so the Driver decides to make it for him.The movie doesn't have much Car stunts like the Fast n Furious but what it does have is Ryan Gosling who's got a style of his own.

Very Deep Meaning,10,11 December 2016,"Average movie-goers left this movie hating it, for they wanted an action movie filled with car chases, ceaseless action, and a romance to appease the notebook lovers. What they received instead was a masterpiece, chock full with imagery and symbolism. Everything to the clothing contains a message related to the story. This shows the level of detail and thought that went into creating this film. This movie can be taken for face value as an average action movie. However; once you decide to delve deeper, and really get into the story, that's when you'll begin to notice things that seemed unimportant before.What it received as a reward was praise from movie critics, and a multitude of negative reviews, from uneducated audience members.",Drive

The way he moves across the screen, glares at the characters through emotional eyes. Each scene is a rare blooming flower transitioning from one scene to the next with a haunting smoothness that will make you want to watch the movie over and over. I would say the reason I gave the movie a nine out of ten instead of the ten out of ten is because of the unneeded graphic scenes placed within the movie that make this movie in a different genre. This movie could've easily have been one of the most romantic movie performances done in a long time if not for the awkward kind of graphics that happen throughout the movie.

1011,simonwalker-963-271795,"A piece of art, one of the best movies ever made!",10,3 April 2014,"I genuinely feel sorry for people who got so caught up about the fact that Ryan Gosling plays a near mute character, because they are missing something marvelous. This movie is beautifully crafted, it isn't like normal action movies, its realistic as can be, even from the getaway seen at the very start the camera never leaves the car, so you watch from his point of view and not Hollywood's. The sound editing is also amazing and just as realistic as the film, and the soundtrack is AMAZING! the songs aren't over done and bring a feeling in like no other film has. The cinematography is even better, the beautiful city pans, the facial shots, excellent shots and a lovely filter is used for the whole movie. Nicolas Winding Refn has done nothing half-hearted and has made sure every shot was better then last and has mastered this easily. Drive has also a number of hidden messages, which is great because too many many movies spoon feed the audience. The most common message is the scorpion on his bad ass jacket, The scorpion on the jacket refers to the famous story of the ""scorpion and the frog"", and this angers me when people say ""Ohh i think the elevator scene was unnecessary violence"", well actually no it wasn't, he kisses Irene (Carey Mulligan) because this is drivers way of saying goodbye because he realizes he has to kill this guy or he will them both so he stomps the man and Irene gets out of the elevator, then you are left with a beautiful shot of the scorpion on his jumper because its referring to the story of the scorpion and the frog because he did what the scorpion did, he brought them both down because its what he does, but in this case it was to save Irene. To wrap it up i would give Drive an A+ and there are only 2 other movies i would ever give that to and that is: The Place Beyond the Pines and Inception. If you haven't watched this movie please please please go and watch it, turn it up and by the end you will sit back and think ""Wow"", its been crafted as a piece of art, the Leonardo Davinci of films.

1012,nataly-calvo,You Make Me A Real Human Being,10,30 August 2014,"Reading the reviews on this film, specifically those centered on analysis of symbols, a lot of attention has been given to the scorpion jacket he wears throughout the film and its connection to the story of the scorpion and the frog, which ultimately proves to be the plot of the story. However, not much analysis has been given to the mask he wears at the beginning-when he's performing the car stunt- and the end of the movie -when he murders Nino-. And the best way to understand the mask is to listen to the music given when he meets Irene-A Real Human Being by Nightcall. This song is played all through the creek scene and most of the time he spends with Irene before Gabriel comes back. The mask is obviously a synthetic object and his wearing of it in the beginning and end of the movie show his lack of real life. He's in this own world of his without a family or any past (that were told of) or relations, he simply Drives. And in the end when he puts the mask back on to save Irene and her son, he makes that decision to not have a life again, and possibly give everything up for the rest of his life. When he drives off clean from the deal after leaving the money next to the corpse of Bernie, A Real Human Being and A Real Human plays again, hinting that he will be able to make a life for himself and he isn't stuck in his synthetic mask.",Drive
1013,carlahorner,Mostly painful,4,27 August 2017,"I watched this movie because it was rated a 7.8 and I like Ryan Gosling as an actor. I went into it knowing it was a drama, so I was prepared for it to feel a little slow. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that it was actual torture watching the entirety of this movie. I was so bored about 30 minutes in and it really didn't pick up for more than 5 minutes at a time for the remainder of the movie. Almost zero dialogue, seriously, I was squirming the whole time. I was into the gratuitous violence, as it was the only interesting part of this movie. Considering that I am overly critical at times, I rated it a 4. I personally disliked this movie, however, it is artsy and deep and for that I give it a few points. If you like pretentious dramas/might-as- well-be-romances, you'll probably enjoy this movie. But it was painfully slow for me and easily over rated by a few points. Not as good as many other movies rated in the high 7's.",Drive

1015,jackdorf75,A Modern Masterpiece,9,24 November 2014,"This is a near-perfect film. Some people criticize it for being slow-moving, however this is one of the film's best qualities. The reason Drive is so great is because it is so subtle. During some of the confrontation scenes, the tension builds up so slowly and perfectly that you might not even realize it until you are on the edge of your seat. As for the acting, Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan steal the show. Again, sometimes the nuances they give their characters are so subtle that some people may consider it bland, but if you look closely, the performances are magnificent. Also, it is brilliant that all the other characters are fast-talking, but Gosling and Mulligan are minimalists with dialogue, emphasizing their relationship with each other.This movie is also so great because it is so unpredictable. I won't spoil anything, but at the beginning I had a pretty clear idea of how everything would turn out. Even at the halfway point, I had a different idea, but I still thought I could predict it. However, there are so many turns and twists, the whole movie will leave you guessing.Finally, I just want to point out the lighting in this movie. Although a minor element, it is some of the best lighting I've seen recently, giving each shot a unique look. The soundtrack also adds a great vibe to the film, and all in all, a near-masterpiece.",Drive
1016,SpikeDurden,An Action/Heist Movie with the Heart of an Indie Drama,8,17 September 2011,"Drive is an action movie with the soul of an indie, art house production. Its beautiful cinematography combined with a minimalist, neo-noir approach to both action and dialog make Drive a winner in my book. We cared about Driver, who speaks so little but says so much. He reminds me of Jef Costello from ""Le Samourai"" and other nameless, silent heroes. The film shows you much more than it tells you. The pace is slow, reminiscent of films like ""A History of Violence,"" but more polished. The soundtrack's dark, ethereal electronic and often 80s-inspired tone sets the mood and matches the pace. With great performances all around, shockingly realistic violence and mesmorizing driving scenes, Drive succeeds in giving us a film that isn't dumbed down for the typical Hollywood action audience. The trailer may be somewhat misleading, so don't expect non-stop explosions, lame one liners and thousands of bullets. This isn't the Fast and the Furious. It's ""Drive"" and it's refreshing.",Drive

That they string together a chord of relevancy or perhaps hold a bigger meaning than what unfolds on a screen. Drive is just that and much more. Staring from its powerful script to the overhead camera shots which capture the very essence of dark LA lanes, Drive is brought to life by its able cast. The presence of their characters says much more than the dialogue interplay between them. With each scene woven flawlessly by the screenplay penned by Hossein Amini (the real hero over here!), Drive revels in the craft of movie making at its peak through its director (Nicholas Winding Refn). Anything more in written wouldn't justify the how effective the movie is. Perhaps, me writing a review after seeing it for the first time back in 2011 shows it has stood the test of time rather effortlessly. Though each one has its own take on the craft of movie-making, I do believe that Drive is worth your time.",Drive

If you have seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. The rest of the scenes are just (nice) fillers.But I just want to talk about the driving scenes, because they really destroyed the movie for me. How can you create an ambitious (love) story about a driver and then use such mediocre, de-energized and unrealistic driving scenes ?OPENING SCENE: I just liked the idea of using the stadium to disappear in the crowd. But apart from this there was nothing special and not much tension. Nothing you would remind, nothing which made you think ""wow"". Just compare this with the gripping opening scenes of ""Mad Max"", ""Heat"" or ""Point Break"". You still can remember them, right? Director Refn just failed to give ""Drive"" such an remarkable, powerful opener.PAWN SHOP SCENE: 1) How would you park your getaway car ? Towards the shop (so you have to do an u-turn) or towards the road you want to use to get away as quick as you can? 2) Our awesome driver can't outrun a Chrysler 300 with a Mustang GT on a winding road ? Hard to believe, even if the Chrysler is a SRT-8... 3 )You plan to rob a guy but you know he is an outstanding driver - would you try to catch him by car ?BEACH SCENE: 1) You can ram a car off the road, but avoid to also jump off the road with your own car? Come on... 2) You ram a car off the road and your headlights will still work? Detroit steel must be really tough... DUBBED ENGINE SOUND: The engine sounds are obviously dubbed and it's done in a really bad razzle-dazzle way: In the opening scene, you just hear the Impala revving up and shifting up very quickly - 2nd gear, 3rd gear, 4th gear, 5th gear. There is no way you will reach 5th or 6th gear in a urban car chase with packed streets. I guess it has just been dubbed to compensate a lack of tension and thrilling driving.While the inboard scenes, there is also no down-shifting noise, no release of the throttle to take a corner. Compare this with Steve McQueens inboard scenes in ""Bullitt"" and you'll understand how ridiculous the driving scenes in ""Drive"" are...I REALLY MISS... realistic, but thrilling car chases like in Bullitt, Vanishing Point, The French Connection,The Driver, Blues Brothers, What's up doc?, Christine and Death Proof.

1021,duskraider31,Wow...A misleading title and uninspiring storyline,4,28 December 2011,"Really disappointed in this movie. I enjoy Gosling's acting and loved the director, Refn's first movie, ""Bronson."" I figured this would be a smart mans Fast and the Furious. Well, at least Fast and the Furious had some type of character development and action to push the scenes along that made sense. None of the characters do much except stare at each other without talking or growl or complain. They do not progress in the story as well. Gosling's character goes from silent brooder to mass murderer. I thought he was just a driver!!! While I did embrace the style of the movie, modern day directors that are not established need to understand the importance of when and when not to use dialog. Just showing a characters face is not enough. Realism is communication. I don't know many people who can express all their emotions by the raise of an eyebrow. Oh, and the title says Drive but there are literally 2 scenes, yes only 2 scenes, of vehicles being shown driving. The first happens less that a minute into the film. I don't even think the car went over 30 mph. Lastly, the violence in this movie was borderline campy. Especially Gosling pulling his best rendition of Irreversible and American History X. If you are going to make a serious film, make death mean something to us and to the characters, rather than try to shock. I had high hopes for this film, yet a 4 out 10 it receives.",Drive

I suppose people who are imaginative will love Drive with all its missing bits and pieces that they have to fill in themselves. Others might enjoy a simpler movie though. That's understandable.By the way, I also loved the soundtrack. I was born in the 70s and grew on electronic music during the 80s and 90s.

Somehow during the movie he manages to get cosy with the neighbors even though they don't talk and barely know each other. Then he decides to take huge risks for this family that he's known for like a week or two.So many stereotypes too.

Anyway, the most attractive aspect are the visuals, the shots are very well done and they feel very unique, maybe that will make you really like this movie, sometimes the movie can be brutal, and other it goes for a more poetic style, making contrast, especially in one scene in the elevator.

The blood and gore is done in a perfect fashion. It is extremely superfluous, but also adds to the dark, visceral feel of the movie, giving it an artistic feel. The movie starts off slowly, with amazing acting and curiosity for how it will play out to entice you to stay interested. Despite the slow start, it builds up into a fantastic action film, but retains the acting and curiosity of the first act. The film ends in a perfect fashion, leaving you with many emotions about the main character, The Driver, and a fable, representing the movie.

1028,ethanwright,Man with autism tries to deal with social scenarios,10,18 December 2016,"An incredible film about a man with autism trying to get through difficult social situations. He also drives cars. Ryan Gosling says about seven words throughout the entire movie, but it's okay really because he is defined more by his crazy, constantly fluctuating emotional responses to everything. Time and time again the driver fails to handle critical scenarios that could change the entire plot, and then somehow make them look deliberate and totally planned. Missing social cues left and right, this is a comedy about a man with an unchecked mental condition trying to pick up a woman. A must watch for all car lovers and quite easily accessible for deaf people as the film itself does not have many lines in it. Why does he drive? Who is he? What is his past? Who knows, all that matters is that he's driving now and he can go really really really fast. This movie contains: - Epic car stunts - Ryan Gosling pretending to be autistic - Film dissolves between almost every shot - Very long stares where nobody says anything during the conversation but it isn't awkward because they always play ""A Real Hero"" over itOverall I rate this movie a 9/10",Drive

Even at the end, it was a black screen for seconds before the text appeared, all the movie was like waiting for things to happen, it had these moments when you would thing it was paused. It looked like the movie was just 60 minutes then they stretched it to be 90 minutes.

1031,ajr-91106,Didn't meet expectations,6,4 October 2020,"Drive's beautiful cinematography and terrific sound design allow the film to create a cinematic atmosphere which pays tribute to classic 80s culture. However, this is let down by the fact that this tone doesn't stay consistent. The scenes where Ryan Gosling is driving around or talking are fine, but when he gets into a fight, the tone becomes over the top and almost ironic. The film tries to be dark, serious, stylish and deep, but the level was of violence is ridiculous. Most of the kills Gosling makes are graphic, bloody, drawn out and like something you would see in Kill Bill. The way the story progresses is also bad as the characters relationships don't ever really develop and there is no message or contemporary issue addressed for the audience to make sense of. Some films can get away with having a weak plot and no real meaning because their so action packed that no one notices (such as Mad Max Fury Road). However this film has barely any action and focuses on being moody and dramatic, so the lack of plot is very noticeable. Overall, in my opinion the screenplay for this film is garbage, but the way it is shot, the sound and atmosphere save the film from being garbage too.",Drive

Gosling is man of few words and I don't know why...The character Albert Brooks played was one he has never played before. Its bloody-more than I thought it would be. It really isn't that interesting. We have a man with no past-nothing..Goslings just there. Not like Clint Eastwood in his earlier movies being all dark and silent but with a mission..eventually Eastwoods characters open there mouths!! People actually left the theater during the movie.I never liked any of the characters in this one...yes, it was that bad!!! When I left the people behind me said they didn't understand it either!

1033,austinarchibald,"Magically Retro: ""You've seen this movie before, but you've never seen it like this""",9,17 September 2011,"This movie is layered with very thick and powerful themes: the retro 80's style, the hero as a real human being, Hollywood fantasy land, what love ""drives"" a man to do, etc.The movie is a spectacle: it combines the perfect duality of fantasy and realism; the scenes, emotions, and characters seem so real, yet they are placed in a Hollywood fantasy land of invincible heroes and despicable villains. This duality is tough to explain but really grasped me by the end. The characters are seemingly frozen in an 80's world that takes place in the modern era.The acting is superb, of course, but the masterpiece lies in its moving and timingly ""retro"" soundtrack, the beautiful cinematography, and the unspoken scenes of silence which speak volumes.You are drawn to love the hero, a real human being that is driven to unreal inhumanity to be heroic. This movie is not what I expected. Some may not find meaning in the silent scenes, the 80's style, or the crescendoing action-packed intensity. You are led along carefully by the director to grasp the characters, the nuances, the emotions before he takes you up the crescendo of action and intensity that climaxes with a long focus on our hero... wondering if he is dead or alive.A movie for the ages, destined for a cultish following. Definitely a movie I will see over and over. An action movie that is layered with real emotion and meaning. 9/10",Drive

Running from dedicated aspie to full-on nonverbal murdertard, this performance was one of the most wild rides I've ever been on.Christina Hendricks was an odd but fitting choice for a throwaway actress, because usually her rack gets her a recurring role but in this case I think Refn just wanted to remind us all that there are times in your life when a huge pair of jugs bounces your way but you have more important things to focus on even though you always have them in the corner of your eye.",Drive

The lack of his character's dialogue posed a huge challenge to portray the character well. However, his ability to show off Driver's progression into madness was incredibly executed, proving that Gosling has range in his acting. The symbolism and music throughout further played into Driver's insanity. What didn't make sense is the disconnect in the middle of the film with the string of progressively graphic acts of violence that Driver commits with the rest of the film. Overall, it was great to watch but it would have been more enjoyable if the violence in the middle was toned down.",Drive

However, what the trailer to THIS film did, is make everyone think that this film is going to be as exciting as Die Hard...well, this artsy/fartsy film is NOT. I repeat, it is not. I have no problem with art-house films. But the trailer would never guide you to believe that this is an art-house film! I don't know what these 10/10 star folks are on, but this was by far, the worst film since Battlefield Earth. The production company better be happy that they made a film for $13,000,000, as I'm sure, many people will have seen it in the theater after seeing the trailer, and the producers will make their money back over and over again.

1044,qasimuk,Most Overrated Film of The Year,5,29 September 2011,I was expecting the film to be brilliant as I had read so many good reviews on IMDb and seen a high rating. What a let down the film was. The 1st half of the film was so slow it was unbelievable. I was tempted to walk out of the cinema for the 1st time ever. It was like watching paint dry. 2nd half of the film picked up but even still it was not a great film by any imagination. I should have went to watch Crazy Stupid Love instead. That would have been much better than this. Ryan Gosling doesn't have many lines and half the time you just see him driving or looking at his female costar or the little boy he gets attached to. The film is predictable although it should have had a lot more action in it and a better storyline.,Drive
1045,ralphtuminez,Analysis for Mr. Rice,7,20 May 2019,"This film covers the 4 values of film well, most notably in the artistic department.Drive uses a variety of camera angles to establish not only setting, but the relationships between the different characters. Drive primarily uses visuals and auditory cues to engage the audience, I personally felt that dialogue was not as prominent in this movie compared to some; and instead the story was told through interaction.This film is entertaining in the same way that Baby Driver is entertaining (Drive came first though), from the premise of the main character who is solely a getaway driver and doesn't use violence to resolve problems to the sudden 180 the story takes after a few mishaps in a heist. Drive has many powerful scenes, especially when Gosling goes on his rampage to gain a pseudo form of redemption.Educationally, there really isn't much to be found in this film. I suppose there's always the undertone of ""crime is a dirty business, so don't get involved in it,"" but otherwise Drive's purpose is primarily to tell an entertaining story.Within the literary value of Drive, I think that the value here can be attributed to the internal and external conflicts that Gosling's character faces. While he is knowledgeable about crime and doesn't seem to be a prideful person, the challenges he faces in the film raise the bar for where his knowledge and pride should be. Of course those challenges are addressed by Gosling by either talking it out or straight up just killing someone. Depending on how Gosling's character reacts, it acts as an indicator of whether he is controlling his pride and ignorance or not.",Drive
1046,matthewb,Noirish adaptation is unnervingly good,10,13 February 2017,"The tech writer John Gruber is fond of a Kubrick quote about the truth of a thing being in the feel of it rather than the think of it, a phrase that for me perfectly explains the appeal of Nicolas Winding Refn's noirish adaptation of the James Sallis novel. Right from the first hotel room scene, through a near wordless 15-minute opening stanza, the foreboding atmosphere of an after-hours, back-streets Los Angeles takes hold. The ambient, minimal score by Cliff Martinez blends with deftly selected French electro-pop to deliver a moody, European sensibility that extends through the production design, colour palette and camera work.Flashes of sharp violence punctuate the film but are short-lived, like those in the fairy tales from which the director has drawn inspiration. Comparisons have been made with David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive', but the film is tonally closer to 'Lost Highway', with its mildly existential leanings, transformative subtext and generous use of electronic music in tandem with overpowered vehicles. But 'Drive', to its service, is less weird and more literal than Lynch's entire back catalogue (with the exception of his Disney masterpiece, 'The Straight Story').Ryan Gosling is typically understated, and his scenes with Carey Mulligan provide an effortless chemistry. Albert Brooks, playing steadfastly against type as an embattled mobster, brings both pathos and menace to the character of Bernie Rose. 'Drive' is a lush, cinematic indulgence that by most rational scales would not achieve a perfect score. And yet it seems petty to award it anything less. It looks — and feels — unnervingly good, and sounds even better. It's the film hot-pink Mistral was made for. Pass my driving gloves.",Drive

Drive is worth a watch for is cinematography and lighting design alone, but also this quiet patience amongst the violence. I've never seen a film with so much action have this pensive, deep quality. It is contemplative and emotional.I would recommend this film more for the film lover than the action lover; if you were going into this as an action/adventure fanatic (which is how iTunes classifies it), you may be surprised by its depth and art-house vibe.Overall, the film left a lasting emotional effect on me, and I found myself contemplating its meaning, visual style, and ending long after I watched it.

1051,crystal-rose-bale,A rebuttal of some inane reviews.,10,22 September 2011,"One of my favorite things about really liking a new movie is reading the bad reviews to see why people disagree with me and whether they can make me see flaws in a film by giving me a different insight and allowing me to think it over a little more deeply. I was pretty excited to read the ""Hated It"" reviews on IMDb for ""Drive."" My friend works at a movie theater so he got us in for free two nights in a row. I loved it both times, and that's not typical for me. I guessed that the bad reviews would mostly be about it being too slow for an action movie – a legitimate response from any stupid person. I was right for the most part, but I found something slightly more disturbing in the negative reviews. There is an ASTOUNDING number of people who expected this to be a remake of ""The Driver"" from 1978, and complaints that it wasn't more similar. Okay, so, what the f?These people are actually going to go on to IMDb and write negative reviews saying that the film wasn't similar enough to a movie that wasn't even being remade? I also don't really understand the mentality of people who seem to really love a movie, in this case ""The Driver,"" but want it to be remade. If it's so good, why do we need to fix it? These are the people who are encouraging studios to do nothing but churn out the same god damn movie every three years because they have such a set comfort zone and don't want to see anything outside of it. These people are killing the creativity of the world's greatest film industry.""Drive"" stands on it's own as a great movie. It pays homage to films of the 1980s while still feeling ultra-modern. That being said, it's fairly slow-moving, especially in the beginning. You need to have an attention span. Some people said this movie had no plot, to which I say: You clearly were texting during the movie. Cut that s--- out. There isn't a lot of dialog. I actually read one negative review that said that Ryan Gosling's character probably wouldn't get along very well with people if he were like that in real life. My response to that is, why, exactly, do you think his character gets along well with people? He barely interacts with anyone in the film, he doesn't have friends so to speak, and he doesn't talk very much. Something tells me that being sociable isn't high on his list of priorities. Another big complaint is that Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan spend a lot of time staring at each other not saying anything. This is true, but I don't think it's a flaw. I think it has to do with the fact that neither of their characters seem to do a lot of socializing. They both are shy. They're awkward. They connect with each other in a different way than your typical action hero slickly picking up some bombshell so they can go home and bone. If you're looking for something that cookie- cutter, this movie probably isn't for you, but the good news is that pretty much every other action movie that comes out is. Go waste your money on those. Throughout their scenes of silence I always felt a palpable tension, and that's what I want from dialog (or lack thereof.) Another thing I read a lot of comments about was that Gosling's silence made him seem stupid. I don't know if ""stupid"" is the right word, but I don't think he's supposed to be a genius. He's a stunt man, a mechanic, and a driver. None of those things require you to be great with words. He has a different kind of intelligence, and I would agree that it's not book smarts, but that that doesn't make his character less relatable or realistic. I think we all have our strengths and weaknesses, and the idea of God-like action heroes who are good at everything is really quite boring. Again, if you disagree with that, fortunately for you, most movies that come out are tailored perfectly to your tastes, go watch those so I don't have to.",Drive

From the opening scene, music, cinematography, directing, acting, all blended to create a deeply interesting work of art. The characters are so skillfully developed, some have a minimum of dialog, others have much more, but each has a unique ability to express themselves. It is easy to be quietly drawn into them. Upon a second viewing, the scene of momentary, wishful hope he expresses to Irene, his voice softly humble as he stares at the floor is exceptionally poignant - and overlooked - considering the very next one which destroys everything. The look on his unveiled, stricken face after wards is powerful.First viewing is great, second is even better since many scenes are so meaningful after understanding each character's nature.

This one of a few films that has left me speechless after watching and that isn't easy. It has such character, from the amazingly unique 80s synth style soundtrack to Ryan Gosling and Carey mulligan's chemistry this film in my eyes really is almost perfect. all the performances are brilliant but no one person steals the show and every relationship flows perfectly character with barely any backstory and screen time together feel like they have genuine history. I know this was a passion project for the director, Nicolas Winding Refn, and it really shows, such care and thought has been taken for every detail and the little things like having the basketball game that would later become a pivotal part in the drivers getaway on the TV in the background of the very first scene make this movie a joy to revisit. after the recent years of the Hollywood machine pumping out pandering big budget little thought films seeing this was like a waft of fresh air, truly a film where every detail is important. I think the end of this film perfectly encapsulates why i love it so much, by not exactly having a fairy tail ending the film has the emotional effect films so often lack nowadays: it leaves you wanting more, it left me with such a devastating feeling of emptiness, of yearning and that's brilliant. this is what a film should feel like, this is real cinema. overall incredible: the performances, the cinematography, the music, the way dialog is only used when really need, i love everything about this film. this is who we need ti be supporting directors like this who really care for the movies they make, please tell your friends about this film because in my eyes there's not enough people outside film enthusiast talking about this.sorry if the reads a bit chaotic i just have such passion for this film i find it hard to organise my thoughts and feelings about it",Drive

Drive delivers acting beyond words, and cheesy lines, the intensity of the silent moments are breathtaking, the acting is mostly done by body language and eye""contact"". If you follow the non-said lines you will actually understand the unnamed hero, and get an idea of his background. The words spoken between Gosling and Mulligan almost destroys the romance that could have been.Let me say it like this, if you liked wall-e, where you have two robots who only acts with their body and eyes, you are gonna love the acting in this flick.The plot is submerged, and you have to think to understand this movie. The setting is beautiful and with a feel of reality. The acting is superb. The action is short and intense, with rough violence, which I personally like.

I was falling asleep about half an hour into the film that I expected to be packed with thrilling stunt car scenes, but I got the complete opposite. The movie opens with one of only two car chase scenes which are hardly exciting at all.Ryan Gosling's character is pitifully dull and boring with such little dialogue. He alone, apart from the horribly vague story would have been enough for me to want to just walk out. For some I've seen, he comes off as just ogling, heart thumping material for the young girls, which I will say - if you want to burn your money just for an actor's looks over his actual character's depth (which there is none), go right ahead. The conclusion was done poorly, I'm sitting in my seat expecting a good wrap up scene, but the screen just abruptly cuts to black and on come the credits.There should be no justification in why the producers could pass this off as a finished, well scripted film, because it more than evidently lacked a compelling story, interesting characters, and overall: just plain effort.

1064,kai_lor_edu,One of the Most Stylish & Cool Films Ever,10,15 December 2011,"If you are looking for a ""Fast and Furious"" then look somewhere else. Perhaps go watch Herbie Fully Loaded. Drive is way too smartly written and too well acted and simply way too stylish and cool to be compared and Fast/Furious. Let's just get it out in the open. Ryan Gosling is clearly one of the best actors if the best actor of his generation. His performance here as The Driver is so top notch. He's subtle and yet exudes such an energetic persona into The Driver that you cannot take your eyes off him. Carey Mulligan shines radiantly and is the emotional heart of the film. Though an understand and subtle role, Mulligan welcomes you in and you feel her pain and longing when it is all done. Albert Brooks is fiery and a force as the villain. Rounding out the cast Bryan Cranston and Christina Hendricks (fan of Breaking bad/Mad Men)are both solid in glorified cameo performances. In the lesser hands of a lesser director, Drive could have lost its way but in the hands of a true auteur like Refn, Drive soars brightly. Although Drive is not everyone's cup of tea considering the mass violence and the vintage art-house genre appeal, I strongly recommend it for all.

I was blown away by the cinematography with its gorgeous colours and the usage of great camera angles.Drive is a original that shines with its slow pace (not boring) and a great story. I am a big fan of the relation between the driver and Irene, wich contains nearly no talking.The second half of the film gets extremely violent without being ridiculous or pure splatter.",Drive
1081,inkbot,Drive Delivers: 4 Wheels; 10 Stars,10,13 October 2011,"A seeming homage to '80s suspense movies like Manhunter, Drive is as deliberate and compelling as Ryan Gosling himself, who, ahem, wants to prove to us that he's not a baby anything anymore. He's all grown up, and he wants us to know he's put his ""Notebook"" in his back pocket, climbed behind the wheel, and is all about driving us crazy.What makes a great movie? Simple plot; complicated characters. And Drive delivers. At the end of it all, it's a whole hell of a lot of ado about nothing, really. None of it needed to happen, which is the point. Deciding to become involved, that choice by Driver, is what sets everything in motion. There is not a word out of place in this script, not a moment, not a choice, not a quiet glance, not a stomp or slice or curve or blink that wasn't intentional and rife with symbolism. It's, quite simply, the tightest film I've seen in years. And it stays with you like a dream you can't figure out. It leaves you tied in a knot, but don't expect a ribbon or a bow; Drive leaves you with just enough questions to keep you turning down those mental side streets.Ryan Gosling captures the quiet rage of this character doing a lot of bad things to bad people in the pursuit of doing one good thing for two innocents. Although Driver is a bit, well, lost and messed up, there is something so beautiful and vulnerable about how powerfully he acts out while trying to become ""a real human being and a real hero."" As screwed up as he is, this movie leaves you wanting to be as cool as Driver, even if it means you have to drive all night, alone, both craving and avoiding another honest moment because you know it will send you off the rails again.And then there's that kiss.Boys, let me let you in on a little secret. There's something about leaning and angled shoulders that really gets us. If you can perfect that, you're in. There's this moment in the elevator (which is one of the most perfect scenes ever to grace the screen). That one scene delivers what every movie should: an emotional roller-coaster. It goes from this precise anticipation to a perfect moment of abandon (still filled with the promise of violence and, therefore, a supremely palpable tension) to a startling and gruesome anger. (Well done, sfx crew!) That one scene is a perfectly encapsulated character study of Driver: a troubled, tortured scene for a troubled, tortured soul. The love story goes from maybe to yes to closing doors, shrinking beneath symbolic subtext. An entire movie in a minute: perfection.From every aspect: precision writing, flawless acting (I never thought saying Albert Brooks wasn't funny would be a compliment!), artful direction and cinematography, extremely believable sfx, even down to the costumes and that damn jacket (don't try this at home) that gets better as it gets bloodier, and the seedy LA locations, this movie just Gets. It. Right.The music is as hypnotic as the film, another homage, it would seem, to soundtracks from another era, such as Blade Runner. It has that '80s Casio feel but with an updated groove.You know that a movie's hit you where it hurts when you find yourself wondering if a fictional character is okay. Is he eating? Is he sleeping? Does he need a damn hug? A new jacket? Is he out of gas? Is there fresh blood on his gloves? Is he on the streets–right now–cool and cautious, somehow profoundly capable but equally crippled, a compact explosive driving an Impala?And can I get five minutes?I saw it again, and it's even more perfect the second time around the track. So stop reading reviews, get in your car, and drive to the theater right now. This movie deserves your time, your money, and your respect.The storm inside him escaping like invisible dark matter, trying to extract black and white from those gray eyes, betraying the need to just keep the wheels turningDrive: 4 Wheels; 10 Stars.",Drive
1082,Great_Ape,What a pretentious borefest,4,25 September 2011,"This film was as entertaining as watching paint dry. Instead of being called ""Drive,""it should have been called, ""Let's sit around looking at one another."" Very poorly directed and written, with a horrific 80's soundtrack in the background. One reviewer stated that you just have to sit back and hold on for the ride. What? What ride? Maybe hold on to a cane to stop from falling over. I kept waiting for action...nothing. I kept waiting for the thrills...nothing. I waited for some sort of real emotion and tension...not much there.

I thought I was watching a trashy mindless grade D movie, with almost no redeeming qualities. I still do!Incredibly slow, pointlessly violent, with slow speaking, boring and completely unappealing and clichéd characters, and a story that is all over the place. Ryan Gosling somehow becomes a super hero about half way through the story, which seemed quite silly to me.

1086,burwellc-1,A review by a girl.,6,16 September 2011,"I normally don't write reviews, but after seeing this disaster of a film I felt inclined to advise other people not to spend their money. First of all, this movie is not at all what it is portrayed to be in the previews. In the beginning few minutes they make you think its going to be action packed and awesome by showing a cool heist, and then they move on to 45 minutes of silent awkwardness and long gazes while the characters establish some sort of messed up love connection. Also, as I saw other people commenting on, the music is terrible, unnecessary, and LOUD... it's kind of ridiculous. Once you finally get to the violence it gets REALLY violent, which Im a fan of, but I laughed out loud when they showed the dudes face smashed in and how the girl reacted. I felt kind of terrible, but it was just over the top. If the movie started where it got violent and went from there I think I would have actually liked it.I was kind of confused with the ""80's"" theme... there were newer cars in there like the impala, mustang and 300. If you want it to be 80's go all out 80's not some weird mixture that just doesn't make any sense. Man, I was just really disappointed... I wanted to see some fast paced heist movie and I got this weird, awkward, quiet, blah movie. The only reason I give this a 6 is because I was happy to look at Ryan Gosling's sexy face for an hour and a half... even if he isn't saying anything.",Drive
1087,chelsearule1456,A Breathtaking Masterpiece,10,1 July 2012,"This is a rare piece of cinema. Often hypnotic, occasionally brutal and always beautiful, Drive is a huge accomplishment and a master class at achieving thrills on the cheap as apposed to cheap thrills. Drive's estimated budget was $15,000,000 which suggested that Nicolas Winding Refn was always going to have to rely on solid storytelling and fine acting. The film follows a Hollywood stunt driver (Ryan Gosling) who at night, occasionally works as a getaway driver for the mob. As the film progresses, we are shown exactly what our protagonist is capable of doing when the ones he cares about are threatened. The results are harrowing, with some of the most horrific violence ever shown in a film. Ryan Gosling is superb as a modern day 'man with no name' who is surrounded in mystery. His past is never mentioned, his motives are never mentioned and we as an audience can only guess what his character has witnessed/been through too arrive at this point. He's cool, calm and collective and he only speaks when necessary but despite this rough exterior we are shown a softer side too Gosling when he falls for the 'girl next door' who is expertly played by Carey Mulligan. The car chases are explosive and put The French Connection too shame. The soundtrack is pumping (Kavinsky's Nightcall being a real stand out). If you are looking for a film with huge explosions, gun fights and over the top protagonists then look away. This is the thinking mans action film, with an absorbing story, told through the eyes of the perfect anti-hero. Refn truly has created a masterpiece and whilst it may not have grossed as much as the 'summer blockbusters' of 2011 it sure as hell deserved too!",Drive

Whoever rates this movie highly doesn't have much experience of 70/80's movies that have long 'meaningful' glances and little dialog. Wife and I went expecting something with a bit of action, we nearly walked out. If you take out the long pauses and only include scenes of relevance then it'd be a 1/2 hour TV movie. Ryan Goslings character just comes across as an expressionless dummy who can't think of a thing to say. Yes, it's filmed well, but that doesn't make it a great movie. The violence was gratuitous - if the director wanted to keep with the 'hidden meanings' of the non-vocal scenes then he should have only hinted at the violence. Go see 1971's Vanishing Point.",Drive
1090,esratokatli,An Action Movie Without The Dynamism,6,8 February 2012,"I was looking forward to watch this movie, as I read really good reviews about it. Today finally, I found the chance to watch it, and I might say I am a little disappointed about it. The movie starts with a robbery scene. We see Gosling (we'll never catch the name of the character he's playing) in the driver seat waiting for the robbers to finish their job, while listening to the police radio and a game on the radio. When the robbers get to the car, Gosling tries to drive them to a safe place by using the information he hears from the police radio.Finally, he drops the car and the robbers in the stadium where the game that he was listening to has just been over and flees the scene immediately. So thanks to Gosling's intelligence and punctuality, they succeed to run away from the police. There is a beautiful music playing in the back throughout the scene. So, the movie starts with a really promising scene, where did it lose me? As I implied in the title, the movie lacks the dynamism. By dynamism, I do not mean chase scenes accompanied with loud music, of course. I understand the director 'slowed down' the movie for the audience to connect with the characters but most of the time, at least for me, it made the opposite effect; I got farther away. So I found it hard to connect with Irene or Gosling's character as they seem 'silent' even when they speak to each other. And also, I found it hard to track the connections between Gosling and his criminal entourage. Overall, one might perfectly say that this is a Ryan Gosling movie where he is the dangerous, brave and at the same time romantic, righteous, good hearted criminal. But this is a movie focusing on a character while it fails to make the connection between the audience and the character.",Drive
1091,joshosullivan1992,Drive takes a different direction,10,7 February 2014,"I've never written a review before but after watching Drive for the 5th time i felt I had to. First off Ryan Gosling was an amazing choice to play the 'Driver' you can't quite put your finger on what type of person he is, he seems to have a lot of troubles but stays calm up until the point he sees red as he does a few times in the film. His chemistry with Casey Mulligan also makes this film different, romantic relationships in film are usually the same, Guy finds girl, they date, they laugh and they fall in love, Not the case in drive the awkwardness between Casey Mulligan and Ryan Gosling gave a different viewpoint, she was broken with her husband in jail and the driver was looking for something but had no idea what it was, all he's known is driving so romance gives him something different. Nicolas Winding Refn done a great job also with the casting, Bryan Cranston as everyone knows can play any role and be magnificent, also Ron Perlman done a great job as the villain. The soundtrack was amazing, it has gained a lot of critical praise and i can't help but agree, some of the songs are captivating and i actually purchased the soundtrack after viewing the film. Someone on the boards said the soundtrack was 'terrible' in my opinion this is far from the truth, Nicolas Winding Refn stayed away from the generic sounds and even the music in between silent shots couldn't of suited the scene any better. Credit has to be given to Cliff Martinez also for great choice of songs used.

I am extremely impressed with Ryan Gosling's method acting ability. Sociopathic, heroic violence at its most primal level.Totally agree with you blackmambamark, I thought of ""Taxi Driver"" too.

1100,MartyndeJong,Frick'n Awesome!,8,11 June 2013,"DRIVE (2011) Ryan Gosling, better known as a friendly pretty-boy, shows a different side of himself in this time. The story starts with a very interesting scene, where de viewer meets the superior driving skills of ""the driver"" (Ryan Gosling). This takes place when the driver has to get away from the police with two burglars in the backseat. This scene is the perfect opening of the movie, because it gives a good impression of who the driver is, what he does and especially, how he does it. The strange thing however, is that during the entire scene, which lasts for approximately ten minutes, not a single word is spoken between the three characters. During the entire movie, Ryan is not much of a talker. He probably thought he was starring in an urban western. His long (awkward) silences, stare offs and his toothpick which he constantly balances on his lip, remind me of a typical western; of course including a huge amount of tension, where westerns are known for. This movie also has plenty of beautiful scenes, where the music is in perfect harmony with the cinematography. Combining the actors, the music and the perfect shots, the director has managed to create an excellent suspense, which gives you the feeling that something might happen any second; keeping you waiting for awesome action. Because when this suspense turns into action, the waiting is rewarded in the best way imaginable. The first half of the movie is quite quiet. In this part you get to meet the driver's neighbors and some other bad guys. But in the second half, the storyline switches 180 degrees en the genre goes from a slow-paced drama, to a hardcore action thriller. You could say that some scenes are pretty violent and shocking. No, this movie isn't suitable for people with a weakness for blood or violence. Due to the fact that the driver seems such a friendly, quiet kid, the surprise is even bigger when he turns into a violent killer. Yet, this makes his perfectly performed personage even more impressive. In short, when you can't decide between drama, action and thriller, this movie is the perfect choice. Once again, thanks to the beautiful cinematography, the quality acting and one of the coolest soundtracks out there; this movie is a real diamond in the dust that will definitely be noticed by movie enthusiasts. But don't expect a movie about cars; it's definitely not Gone in 60 Seconds. But when you have a taste for quality movies, and you find enough patience to get through the awkward silences, you will definitely not be disappointed.",Drive

But I put aside that feeling because that shouldn't be a reason not the like a good movie. I didn't had high expectations and I'm glad I didn't had them because this movie was terrible. The main character was terrible. I don't know if we can blame Ryan Gosling for that or it was just bad writing. Everybody was praising the soundtrack it suited the movie but nothing more.The other characters didn't save the movie. I'm a great fan of Bryan Cranston but his character was just empty.

Everyone of these characters felt boring and rough, with nothing to make them stand out; Even the love interest who spends a lot of time on screen.The plot was poor. One heist leading to some brutal killings; that was all! The film spent so much of it building up only to tie up the movie in around 20 minutes! This was such as shame seeing as the striking and stylish ending scenes were actually pretty good, they just had no real plot behind them, making them seem like cheap thrill rather than anything deeperKeeping it short, this film had potential.

What did this guy want to achieve in life. Why did he start talking to this woman. All these questions lead me confused and just angry.Finally when the movie picked up it's pace, it was just overdone with violence. I love action and violence when it is done with reason but this was completely over the top. How can Ryan Gosling's character, who was just a stunt driver be the worlds best hit man as well?

Perhaps i don't get the slow moving film, the silent scenes, the sudden gore that smacks you in the face without warning. It's amazing how they made a car-chase look like its as exciting as pouring milk.I guess the acting is 'ok' but to be honest, it doesn't look really hard to stand still, or move slow and just shut you mouth and look like you have autism. Offcourse actors will disagree and maybe even say its the simple things that are hard to act, but that doesn't make it thrilling to look. There are even some scenes where i though it was slow motion, but when rewinding and looking it back i could see it wasn't, he was just moving really slow.In fact i care so little about this movie, I'm typing this on my ipad while the ending of the movie is playing on my screen. I m not going to check for grammar or typos,because i think in this case it's about getting a point across.This movie is not for the fast paced action packed movie or strong dialogs. If you have 1h and 40 mins to spare and this movie is the only choice, go wash your car instead.

It was a master piece of love and romance at many moments and a classic portray of violence. Hats off for director Nicolas Winding Refn, to be able to put these scenes with so little words. Like character and their silence were shouting out loud with their eyes and actions. The audio was exemplary, I am pretty sure that audience who watched it loud enjoyed it equally who watched it on low volume.I don't see any one else other then Ryan as Driver. This is certainly going to be one of the best movie for next few years until Refn and Ryan comes with something even better. If you have not watched this movie and have sometime, go guys and watch it right away. If you have already watched this movie, i know you want to watch it once more.. :-)",Drive
1107,DavidBel,"It is simply too simple, too generic and too boring to make any type of effect on me",6,19 December 2011,"Just finished watching Drive, and I basked it in all of its exceptional competence and amazing adequacy. It is simply too simple, too generic and too boring to make any type of effect on me.Ryan Gosling plays a getaway driver who is nearly as robotic as the soundtrack is. His impressive range of acting talent is confined to staring deeply at his neighbour, Irene, or staring deeply at his boss, or staring deeply at the camera, or... well you get the picture. He is a man of few words, and the ones he do say sound like they're written from a ""Write Your Own Movie"" kit- scant and merely functional enough to keep the ""plot"" moving. His character has little to no motivation for anything done in the film, except that he ""loves"" Irene. This point is conveyed through quick shots of them driving together, them having small talk, or, if they're going to be really romantic, staring deeply at each other. When the action begins (and believe me, it takes a long damn time to begin), she is shoved out of the way like the nameless plot device her character is.The plot is about as flimsy as you get, and runs around the film like a 5-year-old with amnesia. Plot lines that seem like the movie's main point get picked up and dropped just as fast (Is his career in stunt driving progressing? No... Is he going to do more odd driver jobs? No... Is he going to be a race car driver?) and when it finally decides to settle on a theme, it kicks characters out just as quickly. Christina Hendricks? Bah- toast her. The boy? He was in this movie? And when it finally ends- well, you let me know. Because the ending that it left us with felt like the writer went for a bathroom break and the director rushed in and grabbed it. Pathetic.With an over 1 1/2 hour run time, Drive ends up being a generic mobster action movie that takes an extraordinarily long time to get anywhere. It overindulges in its night-time visuals and stylistic ""hero"" that it forgets it should be actually telling a story. I can see many people being deluded that it is an artsy deep movie because the main character is nameless and near silent, but it only uses these conventions to cover up the lack of originality the movie has. It simply tries to be a Pulp Fiction without the grit- without the heart.Things I did enjoy was the music, I think Kavinsky was used excellently in the opening, and the visuals. I appreciated the neon lights of the night, and the shots of Gosling driving around at night with the soundtrack bumping in the background definitely set an electric mood.",Drive
1108,XrisIsGod,Incredible movie.,10,12 October 2011,"Not only is this movie easily the best film of this year it may be one of the top best movies in the last ten years. It's stylish and not afraid to stun the audiences with filming art that many Hollywood movies are afraid to do these days. I would say the Elevator scene rivals the Rape and Fire-Extinguisher scenes in ""Irreversible"" but at a more emotional level rather than a brutal level. I was loving this movie and was disappointed once it ended not because I was disappointed with the movie but because it ended, I wanted more. Though not entirely a gangster/mob film I would say it ranks up there with the rest of them including GoodFellas, Pulp Fiction and others.

1110,thesteelbadger,Drive Slow,9,10 May 2014,"What struck me most in Drive is the almost slow-motion way in which the plot unfolds. Many times in the film the camera slowly pans as we see the world from the perspective of the unnamed Driver's car window. Events take on an almost surreal, inevitable feel as the Driver's carefully constructed life is brought tumbling down. The plot is well-worn and nothing new, the way the Driver conducts his business is very similar to The Transporter. However there the similarities end, Drive has very little in the way of dialogue, which I liked, and no narration. This does mean that the plot is not really fully explained but I don't think it matters, as I said before the actions and reactions throughout the film seem inevitable, we have seen it all before. This is not a movie with a great convoluted storyline which we are meant to endlessly analyze, I don't particularly care that the course of events doesn't make much sense; I care more about how every character seems trapped in their own lives. Most of all the Driver who for some unknown reason wants no dealings with other people. Drive is a movie where the characters don't feel the need to explain themselves or have weary arguments. They take their cues from each other and we take them from the music, which is perfect throughout.",Drive
1111,darkoil,Heavy hitter in a sea of remakes and failures.,10,27 September 2011,"Praise the rarity of a modern film that once started we are compelled to see through to the end. Drive is one such film.I'l be honest, this film knocked me for 6 as after watching the trailer I was expecting to see a transporter 'esque action film but in reality the film is so much more.At the start, scenes with hardly any dialogue are inter-spliced with silent, richly detailed scenes which in some ways tell us more about the characters than a 1000 spoken words ever could. As the film progresses more characters are introduced and with them a lot more dialogue, it's by no means a bad thing just there is a stark contrast between the first and second half of the movie.The film develops from the calm into a full hell bent storm, fast paced ultra violence happens after scenes shown in slow motion, the violence may be few and far between but it really stands out, maybe because we don't expect it, maybe because it goes too far.The acting is fantastic and everyone plays their part outstanding, especially Ryan gosling who portrays the hero as a dark,calculated, man of few words who's ambitions and motivations elude us.There's not a lot more i can say without giving away specific plot details. The directing,soundtrack and acting all come together perfectly to create one of the finest movies in a long time.

At first I didn't know what to think of it. The plot is simplistic yet told in a way which is quite powerful. Through relentless violence and clever camera-work, the film perpetuates into new territory. The story was told in a way that seemed more like a fable than a realistic occurrence. It reminded me of a cocktail mix between Peter Yates' Bullit and Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver. This cocktail may be hard for some to swallow. I, however, found it to be one of the best action flicks to come out in a long time. An art-house picture that packs a bloody punch.",Drive

Loved the 80s style titles, the cars, and the whole retro look and feel of the movie. The slow pace and easy camera movement, calmness of the scenes and characters, especially the Driver, results in complete immersion of the viewer and makes the violent scenes even more violent and eerie. Superb acting on Ryan Gosling's part, he did a great job. Nicolas Winding Refn has a bright future ahead of him.

1114,cemaia,incredibly freaking terrible,1,6 November 2011,"First of all, I'd like to say that I'm giving this film a '1' because there's no zero. Then again, the sound is sync, so I guess there's your point right there. Secondly I'd like to say that I've never written a review before, simply because I think that enough people write it, and there's always someone who writes what I wanted to. However I found this movie to be so incredibly overrated that I felt compelled to writing my own review, even if there's not that much to say. When I saw this movie's score I got really excited about seeing it, the scores being mostly spot on. But this movie is just the worst piece of crap ever. I mean, it is TOO SLOW, nothing really happens, the dialogues (omg the dialogues!) are totally awkward and unbelievably unlikely to happen. The movie has no story what so ever and it's basically nothing plus nothing with some parts of unnecessary very graphical violence in between. Don't even get me started on the music. Talk about music which is out of the place, really!Terrible, simply terrible. Not worth your time, nor your money, not even worth those lines I'm writing, except I'm writing them with the good goal of trying to make people not waste their time like I did.",Drive
1115,kamranhuseinov,Definitely worth watching once,9,9 January 2017,"My first review. Because this not-a-mainstream movie deserved this.First and foremost it was acting. These actors now will be left in mind as the characters in this movie :) Joke aside, Drive was the only movie that had my heart beat with thrill long after the Inglorious Bastard's famous bar scene. Not only the scene where ""they"" were waiting for ""him"" in the car (I honestly do not consider this a spoiler), the other parts of the movie as well. Frankly, I was initially feeling that instead of stretching first half only about the hero and the new neighbors and their time together, it would be better it some background information was given for most of the characters. But then, I realized that this is not a gangster movie or plot-twist play to focus on those aspects. Instead, leaving the mystery behind the hero's personality suits better here. Overall, as a spectator I really enjoyed ""Drive"" the most among more than ten movies I have watched in the last two days (because of sickness = rare opportunity :). Funny enough, this one had the lowest score among them, but got highest score from me :)",Drive
1116,mvolchok,drive as far away from this movie as you can,1,5 October 2011,What a f##king piece of garbage. Dismally slow and boring for the first half of the movie and dark & gory for the second half. I walked out of the movie feeling like someone had raped my mind and stolen a bit of my life. I read another users review that this was a great mix of art house and Hollywood action and is something to be celebrated. Knowing that a movie this boring and tasteless is being celebrated is truly a sad thing.The driving scenes were a let down. There were really only two and well...there was nothing new there. Yawn.How am I supposed to think that this guy is a hero because he wants to protect some silly waitress that got herself involved with a low life thug early in her life and stays with that thug? How many times am I supposed to be able to watch Ryan Gosling stare before feeling like someone has dropped a sedative in my drink? The gory killing scenes were a little too late ... at this point I just didn't care....Waste of time. Shame on you fellow Americans for celebrating such a worthless piece of sh*T!,Drive

But after seeing this i have to say this movie has so much more.It's a art-house movie at his best! This whole film is just mesmerizing. Some scenes in the movie are just (as Neill Patrick Harris would say) legendary! After a first weak half of the year i finally saw a movie that is Oscar worthy. I think you can already say that Ryan Gosling will surely be nominated for an Oscar this year. If it's not for this film it will be for 'Ides of March' or 'Crazy Stupid Love'. This really is his year.Every detail in the film just fits and makes it more and more memorable. From the watch on his steering wheel to the gloves he wears while driving to the impressive scene in the elevator.If you didn't see this movie yet, just go see it! It's a movie for every person who likes film.I give it a well-deserved 9 out of 10.*I'm sorry for my bad English. I just hope you understand my point of view. If not, read another review! :D",Drive

It's narrow minded people like you who shouldn't be allowed to rate films. For those complaining that it was boring and has no noteworthy action, I didn't know a movie had to have jaw dropping action to be good. Once again.The film itself is a masterpiece. The acting, action, and soundtrack were amazing. The plot could have been better but all of the good outweighs the the bad by far. I love how the movie doesn't have a lot of dialog but yet it feels so emotional. The actors do such a great job at getting these emotions across and making such believable characters. The thing I like about Goslins character the most is that he is an absolute bad ass, but you would never know that unless you've made him angry. It's a reminder not to mess with the quiet types that hold in anger at times. Some people would say he's a psycho in this film, I say he's a hero and an idol.

The lack of substantive dialogue, zero character development, a screenplay / story that doesn't offer any twist, surprises, authenticity, complexity... anything that would give it the kind of rating that it's IMDb score gives it. As of this writing, it is at a low 7... should be a low 4.Bottom line: fake as hell... the Blare Witch Project was more believable... OJs not guilty plea was more believable. What McDonald's is to food, this movie is to cinema.

People may expect, at first, something in the same range as the Fast & Furious franchise. Unfortunately for them, they would be completely wrong.The movie begins with one of the most awesome car pursuit ever filmed; the camera never leaves the car and the ""Tick Tock of the Clock"" gets your heart pumping. Refn's directing is smooth and precise. After that, there's the credit scene and then the movie goes crescendo. That's where most people expecting a ""Furious"" movie might get bored. The Driver (who's name's unknown) is an anti-hero who thinks before he speaks. The love story is quite simple, but it works great! The score is brilliant and adds up to the tension of the movie. There are not many action sequences, but they appear out of nowhere and they hit you like a hammer! The Ultra-Violence will also leave you speechless. Overall, ""Drive"" is an adrenaline - not that much action - packed ride with a mind blowing cinematography and an awesome retro feel that will stay with you forever.

I din't find anything interesting in the movie. I also didn't like the cast of the movie. The hero looks like he is scared in majority of scenes, even though his character is portrayed as tough and stubborn.The movie in overall is dragging and do not deserve an IMDb rating of 8. Don't just watch it because it has a good rating on IMDb. I did the same and i wasted my 1.5 hours. The violence in the movie is bit too much as per my opinion.

Ryan Gosling is simply awesome , different & refreshing in his role.Performing mostly with silence this guy just emotes with his eyes and his face. Looking, reacting, nibbling on his toothpick Gosling just perfects the art of silence. Initially, in the first half hour of the movie he is just like milk-and-water but slowly slowly as the plot develops his character grows on you and you will be simply taken aback by his style and presence. Same praises for the background score.It will make you sink into the movie. This movie has speed bumps in between which slow down the movie, the finish line leaves an impact. With little to no dialogs, the movie is full of retro like background music which fits the feel of the movie. Some slow motion shots of the car chases are just awesome. Highlights of this movie are the quiet moments of plot and character building that almost emits a zen like meditative quality punctuated by sudden bursts of violence and action that thrill and shock you in equal measure. Although this is a action on flick but at the end of the movie you are left with a smile on your face.. My take:- A must watch movie.",Drive

Case in point: In the beginning, the driver is given a Chevrolet Impala. No manual transmission Impalas have been built for decades. Yet, we are asked to suspend disbelief and, listening to the sound track while the Impala is being driven hard, presume the trans is a manual. While it is true that an Impala can be jury-rigged with a manual transmission, we aren't given any indication that this is the case.Similarly, when the car is a Mustang GT 5.0, at the 53 minute mark, a quick glimpse is given of the trans shifter on the console. Again, an automatic. Yet, the sound track, again, is filled with the noise of a manual trans car being driven hard.Ryan Gosling is great as the ""Very Little to Say"" good guy. Carey Mulligan plays her role well, though the relationship between her character and her husband, just returned from a stretch in prison, is ill-defined and left for conjecture.A good movie, not an ""8"" by any means, but, all in all, if the problems with the sound issue are ignored, a good watch.",Drive

Casting was perfect and I couldn't think of any other actors/actresses that could fit the roles that this cast did. Outstanding work on their part. The soundtrack was superb, it really fits the tone and give the film the noir feel. One of the best soundtracks in a film out there. At first when I heard about the story I thought it would be another transporter movie, all action and chase scenes. I was pleasantly surprised that it was nothing like that at all, the story was well put together, and written great. To keep this short, this was a fantastic film and is in my top 10 favourite films of all time. It was just clever and was a nice change to all the superhero and over-the-top action movies that we are all use to seeing. Its just too bad that its not getting on top of the box office and its not doing that great in the revenue category. All the movies in the top 5 box offices this week are garbage.",Drive
1136,zinnernet,Overrated trash Cinema,3,27 March 2012,"This is my 2nd Attempt to write a review.. My first effort was canned by the powers that be. I finally got around to watching Drive a few weeks ago... I saw it for free, on DVD. I will not bore you with a long winded review as per some of the zealots who have professed their undying love for this movie / director.My thoughts.... over hyped excrement (read Sh*t), not worthy of my $15 + to see this at a Cinema, or $2.50 to hire on DVD (I paid nothing and watched it at a friends house, I would have been disappointed if I had been duped into outlaying ANY money to watch this movie).The Ultra Violence depicted throughout this move was particularly offensive, unnecessary and shows just how banal and immature REFN is. (Spoiler Alert) The scene where Ryan kisses the leading lady for a good 20 seconds in the elevator whilst the hit-man looks on, then Ryan proceeds to stomp on said hit-man's head until it collapses... pathetic. BTW I am not adverse to depictions of Horror / Violence in cinema and I have seen more than my share of violence in real life, I work with many victims of crime, and I have seen things that would make some of you curl up into the foetal position and cry.Some of the reviews I have read on here are laughable, the Authors trying to give any level of credence or kudos to REFN where he clearly does not deserve any. I recently watched a video online of REFN being interviewed on UK Television. Host ""the violence... its like a car crash"" REFN ""Violence is easy to work with... its like F*cking"" Absolutely Moronic... I wonder if he ever listens to himself when he speaks.... I see that maybe he will be directing a remake of Logans Run... please, whoever owns the rights... don't let him anywhere near it",Drive
1137,ireallyamsomething,Drive,9,30 May 2012,"I am not a big fan of action movies. So it perhaps comes as a bit of a surprise to me that my favorite movie of 2011,Drive, is an action film. Or maybe not. Because Drive is much more than just an action movie. Categorizing Drive as just an action movie would be like saying The Dark Knight was just a superhero movie. One complain I often have with films of this genre is that manufactured 'thrills' are provided at the expense of character development. Mostly, it's all car chases and gunshots and explosions- but if one doesn't feel for the characters, would one really care what happened to them?Drive, directed by Nicholas Winding Refn (whose previous credits include the Pusher trilogy and Bronson), manages to achieve a rare feat-it mixes style and substance into one bloody brilliant cocktail.""I drive"" says Driver (yes, Ryan Gosling plays a character with no name) and that's pretty much what he does. He drives for the movies (as a stunt double) by day and works as a getaway driver by night. He is a man of very few words and we get no knowledge of his past. Ryan Gosling is absolutely fantastic in the role and the sheer intensity he brings to the screen is wonderful. He doesn't do a whole lot of talking, but his eyes speak volumes. It isn't often that there is a character as intriguing and exciting as Driver in an action film or rather a film of any genre. The character is also given a couple of nice touches and details – the toothpick and the scorpion jacket he wears (which is just the coolest things around), for example.The first scene sets the tone for the film- signals that this is not going to be your standard action flick. Anyway the scene is quite unusual and effective – a car chase scene which relies on skilled and strategic driving rather than speeding and colliding. There is near to no dialog and lets us know that there's nothing Driver can't do when he's behind the wheels.The plot involves Driver getting close to his neighbor Irene (played nicely by Carey Mulligan) and her son and soon with the turn of events landing into a whole lot of trouble after that. They are the only 'human contacts' for Driver other than the owner of the garage he works in, played by Bryan Cranston. Irene's husband who was earlier in prison gets out of prison, but he has to pull one last job – for which Driver agrees to help him out. And the heist goes all wrong leading to quite a few people going after Driver's life.But the film, for me at least, is not about plot. It's about characters, and the film has the feel of something like a dreamy mood piece (in a large part due to its beautiful cinematography and pulsating music-'Nightcall' and 'A real hero' are the high points of the soundtrack).One of the things I absolutely loved about Drive was the way it treats its action sequences, which often enter into violent territory. Each scene has a special something to it, making it distinct and edgy, rather than repetitive. In almost all action movies, after a point of time the action sequences get predictable- more cars and stuff to blow up and endless car chases.Drive has some breathtaking action packed sequences. There are two scenes that are particularly memorable and noteworthy. The first one involves Driver in a strip club armed with a hammer and a bullet – Gosling is dynamite in the scene, burning up the screen with his intensity (I think I have used the word 'intensity' more than once- the movie sure is intense). The second one is a mesmerizing scene taking place in an elevator. It is a brilliantly directed scene, and has a dreamlike quality to it. The scene features both the most romantic and the most violent moments I've seen in recent times. The elevator ride turns from heaven to hell in a matter of seconds.I also thought the romantic angle between Driver and Irene was handled superbly .The subtle and understated romance has more chemistry than many standard romantic films.Albert Brooks as the bad guy does a fine job and is a menacing presence, especially in couple of scenes with involving a fork(!) and a razor blade(!) .The film ends on the right note, and the ending is just as good as the rest of the film. Drive ends just the way it should. Melancholic and bittersweet would perhaps be the right words for the ending. Drive is a hell of an exciting ride and it is just what movies should be – exhilarating and intoxicating.",Drive
1138,robzrhino,Chick flick in disguise?,2,3 October 2011,"I was looking forward to seeing this, as the previews showed great car chases & looked like it had allot of action. It did have a couple of good chases, but they were few & far between. The action was mediocre, the ""plot"" was weak. Definitely disappointing on how much time was spent trying to achieve character development and clashes with the ending and the flow of the story-line is too slow at times. Too much time with showing Ryan Gosling's & Carey Mulligan's characters unique ""friendship"". This isn't an art film it was billed as an action flick!

Basically Ryan Gosling plays an stunt driver who moonlights as a get-away driver for the criminal element. The film tries to wrap him in a quiet, ""still waters run deep"" mystique, but to me this fell flat. Throughout the dialog light film Ryan Gosling acts out his role by staring at the camera and in general saying nothing, mostly smiling lightly, to communicate with the rest of the cast. Unfortunately this just comes off as weird when every question or conversation he is thrust into becomes an awkward-pause-and-smile-response session. Seriously there are third string characters that have more to say than Gosling does in this film.",Drive

Speaking of which, if you thought Kill Bill was an over-rated movie, you obviously still haven't seen Drive. This movie was obviously directed with one purpose and one purpose only - winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes. And, surprisingly, it even failed at that. Could it be that this wannabe-art movie was too fake even for Cannes standards? It's hard to tell. Could it be that the 21st century has already gotten its worst blockbuster? Only time will tell.

1142,discobiscuit-949-419406,"Self absorbed, cringingly clichéd tat.",2,17 December 2011,"I'll be brief because I've wasted enough of my time with this film already. This review contains no spoilers only criticism. I have never written a film review in my life, I have been roused from apathy by the entirely undeserved high score this film seems to have here on IMDb.What a load of self absorbed art student-esque rubbish. The only saving grace was occasional excellent cinematography but even this becomes laboured and self-conscious as the director attempts to introduce yet more blue and yellow light to all and any given situation.My two main criticisms are how utterly cliché ridden the spoon fed narrative was and the tedious pauses and smirks which I'm afraid cannot replace acting when done this badly. Themes in a narrative should be subtle and left for the viewer to interpret not rammed down your throat with a eighties gloved fist. This is why I don't attempt creative writing because themes would appear clunky, forced and amateur, the result would be dreadful, I stick to what I'm good at. The clichés: quiet, strong, brooding hero. Okay so these are the classic themes of the American spaghetti western but I'm afraid this needs to be paired with credible acting and here Ryan Gosling fails entirely. Instead of the steadfast stoic cowboy his unconvincing acting (consisting almost entirely of uncomfortable smirks) produced a sort of creepy autistic dimwit whom I'm fairly sure I wouldn't let anywhere near my vulnerable child. Carey Mulligan seems to be a nice enough lady, her character here though does and says not a thing in the entire film. She doesn't seem to make any sort of decision or express any sort of opinion about the situation she finds herself in. Again just another cliché ridden character (vulnerable, victim single mum) not really able to affectively carry the attempted mood of the film because like Gosling she just doesn't have the sort of acting skill this sort of thing would require. Okay so perhaps I have another problem with the film, it's plot, or lack of plot. Wow this limp story could have occupied literally half of the time and not appeared rushed in anyway. The result of stretching this obvious idiot tale over an hour and forty minutes with tedious non- acting is painful and occasionally had me looking away from the screen for something interesting happening in the living room.Just for the record I love some art house/film noir. I think what's happened here is the director Nicolas Winding Refn has tried to actualise a series of concepts and failed to do it in a convincing way. I have some sympathy for him and the main actors as they've attempted something very very difficult and if it had worked it may have been an absolute classic. It's a high risk strategy as the result was either going to be great or absolutely diabolical and I'm afraid it's the latter here.As I'm normally a relatively positive person I'll like to finish with something cheery:Albert Brooks who plays gangster Bernie Rose does an incredible job and the result was utterly convincing. He brought to life a truly chilling, terrifying and charming psychopath. Super job.",Drive

Marc Platt may be getting too old for production of movies that deserve an over 5 rating. I don't think there was one character that was remotely understood in this film. Maybe this is because not one character said more than 10 sentences? Now as if we were lost for the first third of this film, how about the ending.

Drive did. why is that? because it is such a refreshing breath of fresh air from most everything else around. this is my first review on this site, and the reason i've been compelled to time in on it is because there are a lot of people out there that missed the point on this film, as you'll see in the boards. they complain about the lack of action and sometimes dialogue. this is not an action movie, by any means. that's not to say there aren't very well done action scenes sprinkled tastefully throughout , or that it is a straight out drama. this a slow-burning crime thriller and is obviously VERY reminiscent of the 80s, mostly through it's synth-pop ""theme song"". this is a film that takes its time, builds up the suspense of a scene or sometimes throughout multiple scenes and then finally explodes in a magnificent, often very graphic, act of violence. there were many beautiful scenes and all the actors gave great, memorable performances.

Having watched the directors last film which didn't exactly have much dialogue in the lack of it here did not surprise me but sometimes you don't need a Tarantino type script to say so much. The acting from Ryan was superb and he was well supported by some quality actors. I could go on but I will just say that if you want a Fast and Furious 23 then don't watch. My favourite film of all time is Once upon a time in the west and this is like a modern day Sergio Leonne western, the car being the horse, Ryan being the man with no name.",Drive
1147,stefan-hilmarsson9,"Awesome film, and is actually more influenced by Japanese films then Hollywood action",9,20 March 2012,"This is one of the better films that I've seen in a while. It took me a while to figure this out, but in my opinion it's actually quite influenced by Japanese culture. (THIS MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS)You might wonder how I can believe that. A Danish director (Nicholas Winding Refn) makes a low budget indie film about a Hollywood stunt driver (Ryan Gosling)in LA. Well first of all, the music: The entire soundtrack is mainly electronic based music and steams of the 80's music scene. This isn't all that different from most of the animé films I've seen, e.g. The Ghost in The Shell and Akira. Secondly the main character. Goslings character is a nameless driver that rarely speaks and is the best at almost anything he does. He's a great driver, smarter than all the other characters and also overpowers them physically. In addition to these nietzschean features he's also a moral compass in comparison to the other characters, and doesn't necessarily put his own objectives primarily. A nameless stranger, smarter, stronger and basically good. This is the typical main character in many of Akira Kurosawas films (Compare him with ""The Samuraj"" in Yojimbo) *SPOILER* Goslings change in facial expression in the ultra violent elevator scene reeks classic animé.And thirdly, the style and the noire look: The low pace, it's angels, lighting and the dark city feel with a lot of focus on the skyscrapers (especially in the first 15 minutes of the film and the title sequence) is also very similar to many dystopian animé films.So when I've read a lot of reviews on Drive, which are all basically positive, it bothered me a bit when critics said that it's was an homage to the 80's and classical get away films. In my opinion this is just as much an homage to Japanese films and animé.These are just a few examples. I could also discuss the other characters and stereotypes, the acting, the (lack of) dialog, the violence etc, but I hope that you get the idea. In either way, this is a great film that I hope will go down in history.",Drive

I realize some people are fanatic about this movie and are even going as far to say it is the best movie of 2011, but be warned, you'll either love it or hate it... I personally fell into the category of the latter. The violence is too much and out of place at parts, the dialogue between characters is slow and choppy, and the music (pop 80s fans will swoon) was just way too much for me. I can't even justify the rash actions taken by the main character due to the lack of character development. I have watched a great deal of movies and consider my taste to be very eclectic and this is definitely one movie I wish I had skipped. And just for the record, I never review movies on here, I just felt so disappointed after I watched this one due to the hype and high ratings (I feel IMDb rarely gets it SO wrong) that I felt responsible to share my opinion with others before they went to see this film.",Drive

I don't remember the last time a movie gave me chills, made me jump or had me on the edge of my seat like this one did. Ryan Gosling truly shows his acting skills in this movie. His diversity in different movie roles is extremely apparent during this one. He plays a sort-of strong, silent type, but when he has something to say, he holds attention phenomenally. Some of it was a bit more gory than I had expected as well, which is not a bad thing in my opinion. Such scenes were done so well and were anything but disappointing! The relationship aspect of the movie was a tad off to me in the beginning but nearer to the end, I fell into it a bit more and grew to enjoy it. A lot of this movie had some ""shockers"" too and some unexpected scenes that caught me off guard.

1150,annette_69,Hot mess,9,1 January 2012,"I had high expectations for ""Drive"" after all the critical glory it was showered with, but this movie is a hot mess. While set in modern-day LA and showing reminiscences of films like ""A history of violence"", ""Drive"" also pays homage to those dirty pleasures of the 80s (Miami Vice, Wild Orchid) with its use of pink credits and its soundtrack. On the other hand, Ryan Gosling's character was clearly meant to evoke memories of Steve McQueen (Bullitt, anyone?), so some 60s vibe was thrown in as well. I suppose everyone can pick the period he/she likes best, but sometimes less is more.As to the acting: I love Ryan Gosling, but to call this the best performance of his career doesn't do him justice in my opinion. He nailed the stoicism and toughness of the ""Kid"" to perfection, sure, but at the same time, this left very little room for him artistically. The vulnerability depicted during his interaction with Irene were his strongest moments. Speaking of Irene: Carey Mulligan is a wonderful actress, but I didn't buy her in the role of a (too) young mother and wife of a convict. She was way too sweet and one-dimensional (not her fault for sure!!). The chemistry between her and the ""Kid"" was definitely there, though, which made for some small magic moments. The supporting cast was great, with Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks leading the pack. I liked seeing Christina Hendricks out of 60s attire; sadly, her part was super small.The story itself was fairly straight forward and well told. I had problems with the idea of the ""Kid's"" chivalry, but I guess lone heroes act like that. The graphic violence that started in the second part of the movie was surprising but somehow fitting. The ending threw me off, it didn't seem plausible. I also had problems with the idea that the ""Kid"" all of a sudden developed into this Terminator-style cold-blooded killer. Where did that come from? And the idea that the mother of a young child, already marred by her marriage to a low-life criminal, would still be willing to be with a man who performs an act of unspeakable brutality right in front of her is just ridiculous.The movie surely is unique and memorable. It drew me in and a lot of the imagery will stay with me for a long time. The magic to make it a truly great movie was missing, though. Still, thumbs up.",Drive
1151,doncraw,Film Noir meets Hammer Hardened Hero Maker meets Gangster Heavy Metal,9,19 June 2011,"Ryan Gosling brings down the hammer on that line where logic reason and self preservation become secondary to protecting what is important to you. There are a few moments where he doesn't just cross that line but obliterates it completely.Beautifully crafted pounding action thriller with twisted humor and seriously hard core violence. Compelling tenderness from characters that are unsophisticated in the best sense of the word.This film will go down as one of the best Action films in decades. Car chases that rival and extend beyond Bullitt and French Connection. Violence that bursts out of the screen like a horror film or a bad dream by David Cronenberg. Passing moments of tenderness that are drawn out until you are slowly pulled into the emotional world of the protagonists. Something so powerful, especially when it works, is the use of sharp and dramatic Camera Angles in Drive that mirror the emotional moment of the story drawing you into the characters world. View and angles often extremely low angled and tilted sharply upward, effective at expanding the feeling of voyeurism of being at the dinner table or in the adjacent seat, right in the room with the characters while safely looking up from some shadow or nook or cranny. Very emotionally transcendent cinematography. Night footage was amazingly successful at capturing the range of light and shadows, on a technical level the audio and video were strong and assured. Not only the first robbery but all the way through the film right up to the final resolution of the plot, the night was a familiar environment for major turns in the story (pun intended). I will return hopefully soon to expand on this review, but I had to write something tonight because this film is ten times more badass than any Transporter or Fast and Furious fare that is usually sold in their all too obvious packaging.

Personally, it disappoints me that so many were turned off and maybe even walked out on this. I too suffered at first, but the movie is nothing but a steady crescendo of intensity. The director starts manipulating time itself with beautifully framed shots and distorting slow motion. This dramatically intense movie is undeniably refreshing from the sequel money maker hell that has been the past 15 or so years. A stunning soundtrack that lyrically fits each scene is still cruising around my head, most inevitably leading to the iTunes purchase of the entire album.

Third: If this film isn't in your top 10, you should officially retire from watching any film with substance ever again. In conclusion. This film is incredible. Watch it, and enjoy it.

1154,emhook-16-14066,Drive... My review,9,25 September 2011,"First off, I want to say I have never seen a movie like Drive. I heard great things from my friends and the critics before I found an opportunity to see this film. I hyped this movie up almost to an irresponsible level, essentially it was going to have to blow my mind, and that's exactly what it did. Tons of movies fall victim to the curse of the hype. Sometimes not given the amount of credit they deserve because of preconceived notions, but Drive surpassed my expectations.Starting with Ryan Gosling, I don't really like him. I'm not even sure why. His role choices aren't a problem. I liked Blue Valentine and loved Half Nelson. It may just be that he looks like another stupid Hollywood hunk, but looking over his filmography, it's not really the case. He chooses mostly indie roles, and thankfully has never played a superhero.His character in Drive is a Hollywood stuntman, with some 'for hire' getaway driving on the side. His name is not mentioned, he is only referenced as The Driver or The Kid. His character is similar to the one he plays in Half Nelson. In both roles, he doesn't speak to a large extent. Most of what he portrays comes from his expressions and his body language. In Drive, he meets the girl in the apartment next to him (Carey Mulligan), and begins spending time with her and her son. There exchanges in the movie are brief, mostly just trading smiles back and forth. You get a feel that his character doesn't really have a personality. I spent most of the movie looking for the peephole into his head, but the turning point for his character comes one night sitting alone in a diner. He is approached by a former associate he once drove for a job, the man jokes and harasses him, eventually re-asking for his services as a getaway driver. The Kid is upset, and threatens to kick this man's teeth down his throat. I immediately thought to myself, ""Ok, now we're getting somewhere.""It is also important to point out the look and score of the film. The cinematography is grainy which gives the city a rough and gritty feel. It takes place in Hollywood, but you wouldn't know it from what they show us. You don't see any celebrities or tourists shopping around town. The events that take place are secluded and rarely escape the crime polluted side of the city.The score has everything to do with the pacing of the film. The soundtrack is made up of electro 80's pop songs, but really only a few songs are played. The first act of Drive is mostly silent, sort of letting the characters and the story grow organically. There's a lot of downtime, grocery shopping, car garage, lots of driving. Sitting on shots longer than most people would like, but it gives the film it's art house feel.The speed of the film jump starts when Mulligan's ex-convict baby daddy comes back into the picture. Without giving a lot away, the next forty five minutes involved me readjusting in my chair and frequently rubbing my face. The build up with the score is intense, I felt very uncomfortable, this is probably the most intense movie I have ever seen. It's also significant to mention by the end of the second act the movie comes to a eery halt, all the tension building up to the climax disappears. I'm sure this was not an accident. The director Nicholas Winding Refn is giving us time to comprehend what's been lost, and time to figure out what the driver must do next. This launches us into The Driver's last stand and the conclusion of the film.Refn chooses to do the violence in a very B movie way. It reminded me of a Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino 'esque' over the top formula for killing. The most memorable slaying award has to go to the scene in the elevator. Gosling brings down a man who has come to his apartment to kill him, afterwards, for good measure he repeatedly kicks his face in. After about the 7th or 8th kick, I'm confident I heard this man's skull cracking, it sounded like Gosling was stepping on a plastic container. It actually reminded me of how they mutilated Hitler's face in Inglorious Basterds. Between that murder and a copious amount of other stabs and gunshots. It was apparent to me, Refn was not trying to hide the blood. Some of it even travels on Gosling's jacket from scene to scene.Drive is easily one of the best movies this year, if not the best. Gosling is not extraordinary, but he does nothing to ruin the film. And if you don't wanna see this movie because Ryan Gosling's in it. Go see it for Bryan Cranston, or Ron Perlman, or Carey Mulligan, or Al Brooks (out of nowhere), or the bodacious Christina Hendricks from Mad Men. If you haven't already seen this movie, go see it. If you don't wanna see it, go see it anyway because you are making a bad decision.http://themoviehook.blogspot.com/",Drive

1156,anthony-suomi,Drive; an unexpected surprise,8,1 January 2012,"Drive came out early October here in Finland. I didn't even look twice at the poster. Look rather boring actually. Just some cr*ppy American gangster film again. Looking back, I could say, oh boy I was wrong.It received an R-rating, but in Finland, they use age limits, according to ones age. Drive was classified as a K-18 movie. This means, you will not show the trailer during the adverts, before films that got limits such as K-15 or less. So, it wasn't until recently, I actually got to watch the trailer. I logged into IMDb and typed in ""Drive"". First thing I notice, the rating of 8,1 and around 70,000 users had voted for it. I was rather impressed. Then I watched the trailer. I was now extremely willing to see this movie.In short, the film is about the ""Driver"" (Ryan Gosling). He works as a Hollywood stuntman, surprisingly, driving cars. Driver also moonlights as a wheel man. He meets Irene (Carey Mulligan), a rather sweet woman and her child, Benicio (Kaden Leos). While he movie moves on, he seems to fall in love with Irene. Irene tells him, that her husband and the boys father, Standard (Oscar Isaac), is in jail. He is also about the be released. Family and friends arrange a little ""welcome""-party for Standard and everything seems fine. One day, Driver finds Standard beaten up, because he owes money to the ""bad guys"". They want Standard to do a job, but he refuses. Driver tells them, that he will do the job, if they leave Standard and his family alone. The rest, you shall find out, by actually watching the movie.I have been reading many comments and little reviews on this film, and I noticed, that many people were either saying how ""weird"" the film was, due to its difference from other Hollywood action films or that you will not understand this film if you have not seen many films, especially ones made in the 70's and 80's. Luckily, I have seen many films and also films from the 70's and 80's. The film did seem rather peculiar, but I believe that the soundtrack had a major effect on that. Also the fact, that actual violence, has not a major theme in the film. In my opinion, there was rather little proper action in this film. Do not attempt to read between the lines, Drive is still one hell of an action film!I really enjoyed Ryan Gosling's performance in this movie. I had never seen a film with him in it, so the standard it quite high for him now. His rather quiet character, who can literally explode into sudden violence, amazed me, mostly because of how realistic it actually it. How many people in real life act out like the Hollywood action heroes? Not too many. There is not too many people identical to Gosling's character either, but that little something, just makes it all seem so real. The scene, where the Driver goes down to the strip club to confront Cook, shocked me. Just that moment where Gosling slides the hammer out, you just know, that sh*t is really going down! Had scene, had and still has some serious action and thrill in it!Irene, played by Carey Mulligan was also a nice, sweet character. The second you lay eyes on her, you think ""okay, that's the good girl and i was rather obvious that compulsory ""love"" connection would be between Drive and Irene. There is one scene, the lift scene. I thought that was going to ruin the whole movie. But actually, that sweet long kiss with the mellow music combined with the brutal assault on the man in the lift, was something, I again was not expecting. Nice touch have to say.I have nothing special to say about the other characters or the actors behind them. The whole cast performed marvelously in my opinion, splendid choice.As for the action parts, I have to say I really enjoyed them. The scene in the motel, was a lot more violent that I was expecting for this film. Then again, my expectations on this film were all f*cked up, and almost everything was against my expectations! With also those fancy car chase scenes, I was really surprised when I saw the estimated budget for this film. ""Only"" $15 million. To me, of course that is a crazy amount of money, but this film has a much lower budget, than many many other action films, that in my opinion, have much less intense and realistic special effects.Drive surely deserves its place on IMDb's ""Top 250"" and its nomination for the Golden Globe award. As I pointed out a few times, I really enjoyed this film and I recommend to anyone, who is interested in films in general or to someone who wants a good action film, without all the cliché bullshit.I rated it a solid 8/10. My review is also available in my blog (slightly modified): Criticberg. I would appreciate some comments :) thank youAnthony",Drive

And to top it off, some of the most unjustified and unnecessary violence that I've seen (even more than in Irreversible, which is also bad, but at least has some concept).I'm really surprised that Gosling decided to appear in this.

It has a simple soundtrack with some very appropriate indie songs, accompanied by a unique dialogue (if you can call it that) that makes you feel the scene instead of hear the scene.Ryan Gosling's character is a cool, mysterious, reluctant ""hero"", calm and collected facing friend or foe, only releasing the inner beast when pushed too far.Great cinematography, some very dramatic shots with superb use of lighting, the director really knows when to cut the talk and just show the audience what he wants in a scene, complimented by some really refreshing new takes on what a ""car chase"" can be.

The movie is marvellous with great drama scenes and have great acting and also a great script, and well done story(when a mean well done, it is a great one). I need to say I don't saw a movie like this in years... This movie touch you psychologically a lot, and have great soundtracks.

1164,Shkyboy1991,Drive as Film Noir,9,25 September 2012,"Film Noir is a cycle of movies exploring the darker aspects of modernity and usually set in a criminal underworld or exploring the consequences of a criminal act; these films are usually low budget thus focusing on the character development. This helps the director to portray a character from a different light. Film noir can be beautifully portrayed to the audience using techniques that Hollywood blockbusters would not even consider using. Expressionistic lighting and unique camera angles define this film into the category of film noir. Drive is a perfect example of film noir in the modern age as it depicts a story in modern Los Angeles, where the main character is a Hollywood stunt driver and a getaway driver who meets a mother and son that captivate the story, the iconic anti-hero in Drive is known only as ""The Driver"". Drive is all about character development, we are not really sure what kind of character the anti-hero is until the story unfolds. The Antihero is someone with some of the qualities of a villain, up to and including brutality, malice, and ruthlessness, but with the soul or motivations of a more conventional Hero. The character is depicted with a toothpick constantly in the corner of his mouth while he speaks little and remains a mystery to the end, though we never doubt his fundamentally good nature, he has a surprisingly light, even boyish voice that can seem to be escaping his throat, rather than being sent forth from it. The cinematography to Drive is a masterpiece as it completes the cliché film noir genre, from the soundtrack which portrays a seemingly old LA feel to it but in a modern LA setting. From the very opening scene this is clear as it there is no music just the intense feel of the moment we see the main character on a getaway mission till the moment he gets away the soundtrack begins and we get a sense of unique storytelling about to unfold. The camera angles used here are beautifully done as we get a sense that we are in the car with the driver. The street lights hitting Gosling's face as he drives are all mixed to give a dark feeling. The cinematography and the soundtrack are so important to Drive, they are almost characters. They are intertwined and tonally aligned and it makes for a really absorbing experience. All in all this is a must see film and well deserves an 8 out of 10.",Drive
1165,aamichia,Disappointed,5,30 September 2011,"I don't know how in the world this movie got a 8.5. This movie was bad in my opinion. The producer/director over did it with the slow motion camera, I almost felt that half the movie was in slow motion. The main actor was very dull, didn't say much, I mean maybe it was good that he didn't say much throughout the movie. The movie is called drive and I understand he's just a driver but give him a script that includes more words then ""yes, no, all I do is drive"" The story line was okay, but every story line is basically the same, just how you write the script and the actors to play the role. I just think it could of been better, maybe more time into producing the movie and better actors could of really gave this movie what is deserved.",Drive
1166,AndrewC2805,"A troubling, exciting, rather perfect film.",10,8 November 2011,"I think Nicolas Winding Refn can't be described as a ""cult"" director anymore. This film should bring down the hammer to that. It also puts down all the skeptics and leaves them shaken. If I were to describe this film I would say ""Le Samurai"" meets ""A History Of Violence"".It is more satisfying than both of those classics. Some movies have this undeniable grace and intensity to them. Drive is no exception, but it races past that labeling at full throttle. It is subtle and rough. Compassionate and sexy. Violent and, yes, extreme. I loved this film.Ryan Gosling plays Driver. Nothing formal, yet his boss (Bryan Cranston) says it in such a way (he calls Gosling ""kid"" a lot as well) you sense a long time friendship between the two and the name ""Driver"" becomes formal. I found myself sucked in already.Cranston also provides Driver with cars. Driver moonlights as a getaway driver for crooks. The opening scene shows us Driver staring off into the city, explaining his methods and rules over the phone. Actually, methods would be him opening up to others how he works. No, Gosling's expression shows us he means business and he is laying down the law.Driver is detached but likable. We know nothing about him though, he barely even talks. When he is spoken to it takes him a good minute to reply. What he did say I was holding on to for days. He has this twitch of madness in his eyes that echoes Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver) while possessing that cool expression of calm. If I had hired him as my getaway driver, I would feel confident with him behind the wheel.He soon meets his apartment neighbor, played by a gorgeous and damaged Carey Mulligan. She has a son and her husband is in prison. Driver soon shows her that he cares for her and her son. He drives them around and never forces anything upon her, nor does she upon him. They obviously love each other at one point, but the glances they exchange say everything. It is beautiful and equally devastating. You want to see these two be together and have a life, but she is loyal to her imprisoned husband.Right when it seems they are beginning to start something worthwhile, Mulligan gets a call saying her husband will be released soon. When she reveals this to Driver there is this stare you just need to see for yourself to soak in. I cannot get over the depth behind their faces. Driver continues with his life after seeing Mulligan and her son are in good hands with the believably changed ex convict. But he soon finds the free man beaten to a pulp. He owes some bad men money, and if the debt is not attended to they will kill his entire family.Driver cannot allow this. After a heist gone horrifically wrong (with Driver assisting the husband) the film descends into the dark depths of Driver's madness. He goes to such lengths to protect the only people he loves it is almost inhuman. He is a monster we soon find out and probably insane. Something has snapped inside Driver, he is not normal at all if you couldn't already tell.Soon Driver becomes entangled with Albert Brooks, a gang leader roughing up everyone in the vicinity with a grin on his face. Brooks is accompanied by a brilliant Ron Perlman who just seems to love picking on Cranston but is emotionally abused himself.I loved this movie with a passion, but that is not what I felt walking out. I was polarized. It may have one of the best endings ever. How it is executed and the music playing over it was chilling. There doesn't seem to be much score here, but there is, and the score is catchy and 80's like. If that isn't enough nostalgia there are certain songs in this film (most notably Real Hero) that make you feel like you are in the Driver's seat going fast. Well, it made me feel that way.I was caught up in the moment during every second of this film. I cannot single out a best performance because the whole cast is just perfect here. Never annoying, always compelling. Nicolas Winding Refn deserved that best director award at Cannes and deserves it at the Oscars in my opinion. Sure he won't win, but look at how passionately filmed every frame of this film is. There have been other great movies this year. Melancholia, The Tree Of Life, I Saw The Devil. But Drive takes the cake for me because it won't even give me a chance to eat it. The film makes a clear distinction, watch now, think later. When I thought about it later I cried my eyes out, the experience was so powerful and flooring that I felt like someone hit me with a bag of bricks.I noticed something about this review and that is I keep saying ""it will make you"" or ""it will suck YOU in"". Honestly, I can't make guarantees to all of you that you will love it, but even if you disliked it or even hated it you cannot deny Refn's brutally honest craft. The best example of perfect directing in the film takes place in an elevator. That is where the sexy, the stylish, the extreme, and everything in-between mixed in.",Drive

1169,qwerasd1709,Bleak but beautiful crime cinema,10,17 March 2014,"Drive was the darling of the Cannes film festival in 2011 and the breakthrough for its visionary director Nicolas Winding Refn. Refn, whom is previously known for his gritty Pusher trilogy and his heavily experimental Bronson and Valhalla rising,pushes genre limits in this stunning urban fairytale about a getaway driver who assists his ex-con neighbor pull of a robbery after falling in love with his wife. Drive is genre bending, it takes inspiration from early westerns and 80s noir films, in particular Michael Mann. Although it could be considered ""pulpy"" drive seems to avoid the cheese and instead opts for occasional outbursts of extreme violence and unrelenting tension. Gosling is on fine form as the nameless driver who is at times heroic and horrifying. To sum it up drive is a pulsating and aggressive film experience that should not be missed",Drive
1170,nielsijzerman,"Flat variation on the so called ""Homage"" genre",4,13 December 2011,"This movie, or so I've read, has to been seen in a certain perspective. It's meant to be an homage to a certain genre of 70's/80's flicks in which the silent man with no name who has a possibly violent past kicks the behinds of evil crime lords who want to evict the really nice family from their premises. Like in ""Shane"", but different. In the sense that this is kind of bad.The first 10 minutes where promising, showing off with camera angles, riders and the lot. Acting wise, there's not a whole lot wrong with it, it's the directing or perhaps editing that killed the momentum. It's just too slow at times. After a while though, the camera tricks (especially the dramatic riders, zooms and extended no motion close-ups) tend to annoy you just enough to stay awake for the unnecessarily complicated, but still boring storyline.Edit: I will watch this film another time.

The characters were not good and I could not enjoy the movie. All the slow motion was just ridiculous and also all the profanity. Both were not necessary to the story. As much as I like Carey Mulligan and Ryan Gosling both of them couldn't save the movie. What else can I say? I would not tell people to see this movie.

The performances in this movie are flawless from Ryan Gosling ( playing a mysterious driver that doesn't talk much) to Ron Perlman, everyone out stands in their performances.The dialogue is incredibly intriguing and makes you care and creates interest in each one of the characters. But without a doubt, the directing in this artwork is what makes this movie worth while. The director Nicolas Winding Refn provides to it's audience breath taking images of not only slow shots but also car chases field with details making this movie a masterpiece.I understand that this movie might have been criticized because of it's lack of action scenes ( only two car chases in the entire movie) and i blame it in the misleading advertisement made to promote this movie.But overall, if you go to this movie hoping for a well written, acted,directed and hoping for an addictive soundtrack, you will LOVE this movie.sorry for my English",Drive

But with little doubt I can say that Ryan Gosling might already have played the role of his career in Drive. His acting is phenomenal, makes one wonder if the story outline of the movie was almost 'made' for him.Besides a great performance by Ryan Gosling the story that leads Drive is told very well. The way that this film captured the tension in the theater was amazing.

I thought it was terrible the first time around, then mediocre the second time around. But only the third time did I understand this movie. I'll admit I went into it the first time with completely different expectations. I expected a cool blockbuster type action movie. I guess I didn't research it enough. Some of my opinions still haven't changed - There were mad throwaway characters. The story wasn't the best and was sloppy. The plot was rushed but the scenes were carried out soooo slowly, if that makes sense. The driver was a pretty unique character though. The music was far from what you would expect from this kind of movie, but in a good way. There was a bunch of ambient noise, which reminded me of The Social Network. There was also some great catchy electronic pop, which is the last damn thing you would expect in this movie. There was no dramatic over the top music. The tension was built up fine by barely any music at all, which movies rarely do. But visually, it was over the top; you wouldn't expect this much over the top violence in this movie. I didn't know it would try to be an artsy and stylistic type of movie, but it definitely succeeded in those aspects if you paid attention. It was really just a quiet, slow type of movie. But I realized that was the intention. I guess you could say his character didn't really develop much, but he was meant to be a quiet lonesome badass all the way through. Some scenes were silly at first, but not in a way where they were terrible. Like Ryan Gosling threatening a guy while a bunch of topless girls silently watch. Or when he wears a prosthetic head and watches his next target. But he managed to show so much by saying so little. I don't want to say this movie is one of the 10 best movies of all time, cause it isn't. It doesn't get a free pass for the plot just because the style was great. But it was definitely worth the watch and one of the best movies I've seen this year. I've actually never seen anything like this and it's probably one of the most unique movies I've ever seen. It's one of those movies where you really need to pay attention. If you take your eyes off for too long, you're gonna miss some great subtle, beautiful moments.8/10",Drive

I like the classics (Citizen Kane, Casablanca, etc) and I can even like the occasional modern popcorn flick from time to time (yes, including Michael Bay... from time to time).My point is, despite this, I thought 'Drive' was a miserable experience. I hadn't seen any previews for it, so I had absolutely no idea what to expect going in other than reviews saying it was good.Ultimately what I got was a pretentious, wanna-be indy film that's trying to be an action film (or perhaps a 'statement' on action films), that was just flat-out boring.Ryan Gosling's unnamed protagonist is completely blank. I understand there are people in the world like this, but he was a totally uninteresting character who did little but stare at people and smirk.There was legitimate drama, quality acting, and the little action we got was fantastic, but there were such long stretches of almost-literally nothing, it made the experience absolutely painful (and this coming from a guy who loved Darren Aronofsky's ""The Fountain""!). While everyone is entitled to their opinion, I truly don't understand how anyone could have honestly liked this movie, unless they were having sleeping problems prior to watching it.The only consistently good thing about this movie was the soundtrack, which I absolutely loved.

1181,jsm_macd,Reminds me of movies from before the industry gave no credit to the viewer,9,3 February 2012,"I don't really review movies much, but this one stood out in such a way that I was compelled to write one.Right away I brace myself for the mediocre, a movie that relies on flashy gimmicks, fast cars and big boobs and slick names, much like what you would expect from movies such as the ""Fast and the Furious"". Instead the main character doesn't even have a name. I was shocked to find a movie that had such emotional depth and so much suspense, and I mean FULL of suspense. That's saying a lot for a movie where the central character barely talks.That's another thing, Ryan Gosling's character has so few lines the viewer is left wondering what he's about to do next, with no hint or suspension for the upcoming.There is a lot of violence in this movie, done very stylistically.Overall a decent flick, I recommend.",Drive

I felt I was sitting waiting forever for something to happen. Great cast, but the 80's slow music added to the slow roll of the entire movie, was just too much on top of the typical story of a lonely guy with a good heart and a number of wrong turns in his life. I just didn't connect with this movie. There are no turns of the plot, no unexpected scenarios or even a good follow through after an action scene, which were in fact like just two if not one during the entire movie. The plot is weak and I am sorry to say that I pretty much saw the end coming. So, to sum it up, my wife fell asleep after just 30 minutes. It was just a boring movie.",Drive
1183,culuumbia,A homage to the 80s that sometimes borders on the farcical.,7,15 September 2011,"From the moment the movie starts there is a sense of the familiar and yet unfamiliar as our eerily calm protagonist avoids capture in a intelligent car chase probably more realistic than anything shown on screen in recent years.The direction and cinematography of the movie is smart, creating a vision of LA that seems familiar from movies such as Collateral and Terminator 2. The scene driving though downtown LA with the synthy 80s soundtrack particularly reminiscent of the Foxx/Cruise vehicle.And yet for all this, the violence in the movie seems to border on farce with way too many visceral over-the-top deaths that don't seem necessary to the plot at all. Perhaps this is also paying tribute to the slew of megakill movies that came out in the 80s (Commando / RoboCop / Red Heat to name a few). Violence isn't portrayed in the same way by Hollywood anymore; it feels cliché, a pastiche.Ryan Gosling does an impressive turn as an almost unfazeable anti-hero. Carey Mulligan pouts a lot in a dreamy whimsical fashion and is believable in a too young to be a mother way. Ron Perlman totally hams it up in a very enjoyable turn as a shady crook trying to make it big. Bryan Cranston proves once again his versatility in a being a mechanic that constantly gets life decisions wrong making him and others surrounding him pay for it.Some tighter editing and this movie could have gone the way of being a classic and will certainly do well in the box office.",Drive
1184,PooperScooper95,"A Movie With All The Right Trimmings, Stylized by Alluring Sounds and Images But lacking in depth and tension",5,16 September 2011,"So I'm fairly fresh from seeing this infernal piece directed by Nicholas Winding Refn, and maybe after it has settled a little, I might have a better appreciation for the film, and possibly give it a higher rating. *doubt it*. Let me start by saying that no I was not expecting a quintessential Hollywood action/thriller; filled with thrill inducing car chases, reminiscent of the ""Fast & Furious"" movies. I understood going into this that it was going to be a art-house production, I mean I wouldn't expect any less with NWR being attached to this movie. So all those fan-boy hipsters that say things like ""you probably didn't like it cause it wasn't some big Hollywood budget blockbuster,"" save your breath. I am a fan of art-house movies, as well as little known directors who showcase brilliant movies. With that being said, this movie just wasn't that good. And here are a few of my grievances: The story ( I use that term loosely) in its limited entirety was just plain unrealistic. I don't understand why a movie set stunt driver/mechanic would have such grave knowledge on the perfect getaway--OK maybe that detail can be disputed. But can someone bloody explain to me why he is so damn good at kicking a**? Not just your everyday, school yard a** kickin', but like Secret Ops, specialized training kind of kick-ass. Was he apart of the U.S. Navy Seal team that nailed Osama? I don't get it. I also don't get why he was so quiet. Even when he did talk I could barely comprehend what he said. Oh and the long, drawn out awkward silence? Now I am a fan of movies that don't need heavy dialogue to convey a message, or tell the story, but in this movie it was unnecessary. Driver (Ryan Gosling) would look at Irene (Carey Mulligan), she'd look back, then they'd share a nice minute or two of just gazing into each others eye's. Seriously? No one acts like that in real life. I'm surprised Irene didn't get a creep vibe from the moment he gazed silently at her. Then again, she too had a perpetuating gazed, accompanied by a puppy like, watery eyed appearance that could make Satan's heart tingle a little (not necessarily in a good way)--So I guess they are a match made in heaven.Another thing that was privy to me, was why Ryan Gosling's character was so invested in the life of Irene and her little boy. I mean they barely knew each other, and I don't even think he had spread her legs at that point. OK, now for the positives, I will say that the direction/camera work was remarkable. That I dare anyone to argue with me. The cinematography was riveting, the colors, the lighting, very reminiscent of Tom Ford's work in ""A Single Man"". I would love to live in a place where the sun always shines at a quarter of an angle of your face. I would also like to credit the actors even though they don't need my credit at all. I mean Ryan Freakin' Gosling. No words. *Le sigh* And Carey Mulligan has already proved herself to be a sensational actress. And of course Albert Brooks gave a stellar performance. So they are all commended. I wish more could have been done with their incredible talents. Oh and one more thing, I loved the music. I'm a early 90's baby so that 80's retro music totally blew my mind. I just wanted to stand up out of my cushioned theater seat, and dance my socks off. I really enjoyed the song that was playing during Standards welcome home party. It was literally eargasmic. In conclusion, I was pretty disappointed in this movie, it was just...lacking. That's all I can say, it needed a little more of everything, except the violence. I think that was enough. I'm upset that I didn't enjoy it, cause like I said I'm a huge fan of art-house, as well as Ryan Gosling; I don't know why he hasn't put a ring on it already. But anyways, those are my thoughts on my experience with Drive.",Drive
1185,chema-garcia-soto,A master piece of Art,10,17 September 2011,"This film is magnificent. The director combines a quite violent story with an incredibly good film technique that plays with the lights, music and gorgeous photography to build ever lasting moments of deep melancholy and sensibility. The film follows an hypnotic pace that using musics and silences that create extremely intense moments. Ryan Gosling does a superb performance in a role where he is only using 100 words at most to express a varied rainbow of feelings that goes from love to anger, and from tenderness to revenge. I was surprised by how much he was able to communicate saying so little. I haven't seen such an artistic piece since the Black Swan. Regardless of the story, it is a pleasure to watch such a unique piece of art. Nevertheless, the story is quite good so I give this film a 10.",Drive
1186,gilchrist-162-575945,25 years too late,1,17 September 2011,"Drive is a movie that is full of film noir and tense scenes that are stitched together to tell a semi-interesting story about highly UNinteresting characters. Think the Transporter meets Risky Business without any of the redeeming qualities of each. Back in the mid-80s, this would have been original and creative. Perhaps new movie goers will find this exciting and edgy, but for anyone 30+ they will wonder why did they choose to go back to this format of movie producing. The acting (besides the performance by Al Brooks - not a personal favorite of mine, but someone who did a nice job playing the bad mob guy) is poor - more accurately almost made me physically ill. No one says much, but I felt like the writers were stretching a 30 minute story to a 90 minute feature. As for the main character - I liked him much better in Crazy, Stupid, Love (I think of him as the stupid part, but did his role well) but I believe he'll have 1-2 more good years and then fade into the abyss. What should have been 'tough' and 'sensitive' came across as 'catwalk model-like' and 'low IQ'.Summary - I was looking for an exciting mob/heist/action movie and got stuck watching a mostly boring movie with a bad theme and mediocre acting. I would not watch this again if it was playing on a long airplane ride and I had nothing else to do - my lowest rating.",Drive

Just go see it and decide for yourself. All of the negative reviews of this movie have been from people admitting that they were expecting an action packed blockbuster.

1190,lightshox,Pulsing,9,18 September 2011,"This movie was great. It was unusual and felt more like a theater space being filmed instead of a movie. That partly made it great. These set pieces felt so unique and singular. Action sequences flowed like liquid onto film accompanied by a spectacular. I repeat, spectacular soundtrack. The sound acted as dialogue in a lot of the scenes which I enjoyed very much. It never felt like a music video; it felt like an internal monologue for the characters. Each track lined up so well with the blocking and direction it was almost scary. These 80's pop punk beats fused with synth made for one hell of a ride and a vicious one for certain. The actors did very well. Each actor had their set and sometimes the music was their partner. There were times when their expression and beats made each scene because I remember the feeling of the scenes more than the dialogue. That feeling propelled throughout and was amplified by the cast and sound. It wasn't a movie about what was being said. It was about what was being done. This movie drove up my spine with neon lights and grit. Great job to the cast and director.",Drive

I was expecting to be blown away by a vehicular adventure along the lines of The Transporter. Instead, I got this crap. Basically, Hollywood to a 10 minute movie idea and tried to turn it into a 100 minute movie. That would have been fine if they added something worth watching. Instead, they setup their camera and just let it sit there. Then, they moved the camera to another location and just let it sit there for a while, too. Uncomfortable silence is one thing, it is another thing entirely to just be uncomfortable because nothing is being said... or done.",Drive
1192,alyssa72104,Drive,10,18 September 2011,"Apparently, Ryan Gosling is much more than a pretty face. Being a girl who's mooned over him since I hit puberty, it's hard to accept he's so much more. I knew this of course, the minute I saw Half Nelson or even Lars and the Real Girl, but this is the first role that actually shocked my system. He has very little dialog in Drive and that doesn't drag the film in any way as far as I'm concerned. Ryan's fantastic ability to easily SHOW the audience that this is how he he feels, this is how he's going to handle it, was great and unnerving at times. It was not just an action film either. There weren't obnoxious clichés or stupid, unbelievable fight scenes because the driver somehow knew karate. It's realistic and a had an actual plot. It felt like this gritty place and this rough character were part of a world I could have lived in at some point. I didn't feel like I was watching some green screen on some sound stage.I haven't left the theater feeling this satisfied with what I sat through in a long time. Will it be overrated, over analyzed and over discussed as time goes on? Oh I'm sure it will. Does it deserve bragging rights and the cult following I can only hope it garners? Hell yes. From what I saw, Ryan Gosling deserves the praise. He even made me believe that Carey Mulligan was something worth fighting for (which is hard because she strikes me as blah) but I believed it and I rooted for him.

Just like No Country for Old Men, it is tense and you start to develop a feeling for the characters in this movie. For those who thought they were coming to see an action movie, well this may not be for you, but if you were coming to see an action/drama then yea this one is definitely for you. It all builds up to some violent bloody deaths in the end though and if you were looking for that you will have to wait for an hour, but after that hour then that is when people start getting shot and stabbed. Ryan Gosling's character literally stomps a guys face in inside of a elevator after he kisses Carey Mulligan's character, which I thought that whole scene was very well shot, the tension you feel when they walk into the elevator and you know something is about to go down, but then he kisses her for about 30 seconds, and then turns around and beats the guy down to the floor, then he just stomps his face in, the look on his face and Carey's face was absolutely perfect.

1195,brycer9000,5 minutes of action...followed by boredom and disgust,1,19 September 2011,"If possible, I would rate this movie a 0. I did not pay for my ticket, and I felt bad for the person who did for wasting their money.The film opened with fairly repetitive music reminiscent of the 1980's, which could be OK, but wasn't really my thing. The credits were done in a bright pink unreadable font that was quite distracting and seemed out of place. It would have fit better opening a movie like 27 Dresses or the like.After the opening credits, a fairly intense and well planned chase/action scene unfolded. And then the film dropped off a cliff into the abyss of boredom. As another review put it, the film was only 100 or so minutes long, but it felt around 140. The long pauses intended (I think) to be artsy ended up making the audience feel uncomfortable and awkward. The lead character literally only spoke about 30 lines in the whole movie, most of them 5 to 7 word sentences, or an ""ok"" or a ""yeah"" that came at least 10 seconds too late.In the one scene as ""Driver"" and Irene are riding the elevator to the garage, he notices the mysterious man with them in the elevator has a gun and believes him to be sent to kill them. So what does he do? He pulls Irene aside and a slow motion kiss follows. The elevator stops and he proceeds to slam the other man's head into the wall, then repeatedly stomps on the man's face. One shot actually shows the man's skull being crushed and his face sinking in beneath the blow of the Driver's boot, blood splattering over everything. The entire audience let out an audible ""Eww"" and could be seen shifting uncomfortably.This movie was a waste of money for the ticket, and the 13 million dollars spent on making it, not to mention the time of all the audience members. I very rarely watch a movie and say I would never ever consider watching it again, but I say it with Drive.Artsy? Poorly done. Disgustingly violent, boring, and awkward?

The only direction Gosling seemed to have was to always wait at least 60 seconds before responding to anything or answering any question. Most of the violent scenes would have been more effective and chilling if we could have imagined in our minds what was happening. Director's choice was to make it as graphic as possible though. I think this movie was a waste of talent of several good actors. The storyline also needed help. There were just too many questionable decisions made by characters. Why would the driver walk into a situation he knows is deadly but not be prepared? Why would Irene, mother of Benicio, whom she adores, even consider taking up with a man she actually sees stomp another man to death? Don't waste your time on this movie.",Drive
1198,KyleWardle,"""I don't sit in while you're running it down. I don't carry a gun. I drive.""",10,28 May 2014,"Drive is a unique and daring film that has the audience immersed in its world in the first five minutes. Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson, Only God Forgives) is behind the wheel of this cinematic masterpiece. He shows his versatility by not only executing visually beautiful and evocative scenes, but he also creates action sequences that will raise the hairs on the back of your neck. Ryan Gosling (Half Nelson, Blue Valentine) leads a stellar cast as the unnamed 'Driver' who has three occupations, by day he is a stunt driver/car mechanic and by night he is an exceptional getaway driver who offers his talents to the highest bidder. He is a loner with little to say, with the potential to be incredibly brutal, he could burst into a violent rampage in a heartbeat to protect the ones he cares for. The only company he keeps is 'Shannon', owner of the garage where the driver works, and is portrayed amicably by Bryan Cranston.However, the story takes an enthralling turn when the driver becomes involved with his neighbour (Carey Mulligan) and her husband (Oscar Isaac), an ex-con, who owes money to the wrong people. Gosling's character offers his services, that sets off a deadly chain of events that lead to the introduction of the films primary antagonists: two mob bosses, chillingly played by Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman, with Brooks even shaving his eyebrows in a bid to appear more menacing in the role.Drive will surely be acknowledged as one of the best films of the past decade and will become a cult favourite in the years to come, it is a must see for any film fanatic. It's tremendously directed with equally endearing acting. The film exudes style with it's 80's electro style soundtrack. The brightest light of the star studded cast is Gosling, who in spite of having very little dialogue, gives a brilliant performance with his facial expressions and body language, he thoroughly shows why he earned an Oscar nomination for his performance in Half Nelson. The cinematography will undoubtedly be studied for years to come, it is evident that every frame was meticulously planned. A perfect example of this: during the first getaway scene, the camera never leaves the car, fully immersing the viewer in the film's reality.Although the film may sound action packed, it is not. However it still provides an exhilarating thrill ride with help from it's intriguing story and likable characters. Drive is also one of the most brutally violent and gore filled films I've ever seen, If you are not comfortable with violence then this may not be for you. Winding Refn makes a familiar plot feel fresh, he injects his own stylized tone and hidden symbolism, which makes the film much more artistic and thought provoking. Drive is a riveting and haunting experience that will clutch its fingers around your spine and not release you until the end credits roll.",Drive

I would rate this lower if I could.The movie starts out so great. An super intense, but quiet getaway that was pulled off perfectly. Sadly it only lasts the first 5 minutes and then it drops.The main character doesn't say more then 20 words in the first 45 minutes. Its more of a dramatic staring contest, than a movie about a good driver.I like how under memorable quotes from the money they use his only 3 lines.This movie was more awkward then anything, and had the audience laughing at it because it was such a joke.I only paid $5.99 to see this movie and still feel like I was ripped off.",Drive
1200,bobmessinger,A Scenic Drive,10,22 September 2011,"This isn't a film that's going to break any box office records but, deservedly, this is the kind of film that's destined to develop a following in the footsteps of the average early Tarantino flick. Don't be fooled by the movies dynamic opening scene, this is a slow burning candle of an epic crime drama. Great cast and award winning direction from Nicolas Winding Refn. Drive mostly coasts along with an occasional nitrous oxide injection - in all it's crimson plasma glory. The soundtrack gives the film a unique neon edge and lends itself to the tension building throughout. Characters like Standard, Cook and Blanche come and go quickly like speeding cars passing on an LA highway while Driver and Irene settle in the inner lane, occasionally interrupted by the traffic, one trying to prevent a deadly collision, the other unaware of the dangers that lay ahead.Ryan Gosling shines in the lead role. Driver is a man of few words, a cross between Mel Gibson as Mad Max, Charles Bronson as Paul Kersey and, yes, Tom Hanks as Forest Gump. The Gosling character has a Gumplike soft spot for Irene and son Benecio which fuels his inner Kersey and leads to scenes of horrific violence. Driver is resigned to his fate but determined to play it fair in a game that has no rules.Carey Mulligan might come across as miscast in her role as Irene. Like Driver, Irene vibes a quiet resignation in this dark corner of the world. Mulligan isn't miscast so much as her character is misplaced living in the run down apartment with her ex-con husband and more or less becoming a pawn in a dangerous game being played by mobsters, Los Angeles as chessboard.Bryan Cranston delivers as usual, making an easy transition from Walter White to Shannon on the big screen. No small task given his iconic role in Breaking Bad, you forget instantly that it's the same actor at work. Try watching James Gandolfini in his mobster True Romance role (or any role for that matter) and tell me you aren't having a hard time thinking ""Tony Soprano"".Albert Brooks is intense in his role a Bernie Rose. Most memorable is his characters killing of Shannon, done completely void of malice with matter of fact clinical precision and the compassion of a ER physician treating a small child with a broken limb. Rose is simply a gangster doing what he has to do and unlucky Shannon can't catch a break to save his life. Literally. Nico (Ron Perlman) is reminded, in the aftermath of a heist gone wrong, that cleaning up after Bernie Rose is job best done with plastic gloves on. If the satin jacket isn't enough Driver verbally injects the fable of the ""Scorpion and the Frog"" in a call to Rose, setting up their fateful meeting. The final scene is the very epitome of the fable playing out in a restaurant parking lot although it's hard to tell who's playing the part of the frog as both Driver and Rose deliver the sting. Cleverly done but much of the ending is left for the viewer to decipher in the ""blink of an eye"". There are small nuggets in the film that are bound to confuse the viewer. Bernie once referring to Nico as ""Izzy"" for example (which can only be explained by reading the James Sallis book that inspired the screenplay). Drive is a film that deserves further inspection. It's probably not for the Twillight crowd but it certainly deserves a place in the niche of cool crime dramas. Think a dark and moody Pulp Fiction, minus the black comedy, with more than a hint of oddly romantic innocence amid bloody consequences.",Drive

Yes, I have hated other movies with fervor, but the difference is that this one is getting good reviews. It's baffling. Watered down globs of super convenient plot points that serve as a medium for its true purpose--pretending that long, overly drawn out, purposely awkward scenes of pauses and bad acting is artsy and innovative. I'm sure we are supposed to be ""like, oh my god, that's like, so unusually realistic"", but... there's a reason they usually cut that out of scenes. It's BORING.I'm sure there will be people who say 'oh you just don't get it', but what is annoying about this is that there is nothing to get. The supporting characters over-deliver corny lines and the main ones stand, smile slightly, and say nothing, and you're supposed to believe some big, metaphysical connection between them. 'Oh but he speaks only when necessary'--that's the lamest excuse I have ever heard to cover up a lack of ability on all fronts. There is no substance here, and those of you comparing the gore in the few tolerable seconds to Tarantino are not only just wrong, but insulting to someone who doesn't use cheap devices and actually takes time on character development.

Ryan Gossling, usually a good actor, seemed completely stoned throughout the movie, and brought very little to the table. His character's lack of emotion was never explained, and did not serve to further the storyline at all. The supporting characters, except for Bryan Cranston, also had no depth. The storyline was extremely slow and often seemed to wander. For a movie about an action movie driver who is a driver for illegal activities, there were very few driving scenes, and those it did include were way too short.

Ryan Gosling just does a great job here and proves he's an amazing actor.The soundtrack is another thing that adds so much to this movie, as well as the supporting characters.

1205,hainesk0125,So artsy it forgot the action and the driving!,1,25 September 2011,"If you like movies with a lack of dialog and small bursts of action then this may be the movie for you. However, if you are expecting an action packed movie about a guy that does some amazing driving with lots of stunts then you may want to pass on this one.After sitting through this horrible movie I left the theater wanting nothing but my money back. A real movie should consist of more than silent head shots and people staring at each other. He stared at the girl, he stared at the boy, he stared at the enemy. After the first 30 minutes of the movie I thought Ryan Gosling's character was mildly retarded. Really this movie should have been called Autistic Driver. I'm not sure why his character lacked normal social skills, but it only added to my frustration with this movie's inability to deliver the greatness it promised.",Drive

1207,jasper-173-283049,Emperors New Clothes,1,30 January 2012,"Seriously people, don't believe the ridiculous hype about this movie, it is without doubt one of the worst movies I have seen in the last year. My wife and I are huge movie fans and watch on average 5 new films a week, 10 minutes into this film we are both looking at each other with a 'is this movie for real' look on our faces, and by the end we realised we had just wasted 2 hours of our lives we would never get back again.Rylan Gosling is a total joke from start to finish, his total lack of any script is just the start, in fact by the end of the film (and yes we did make it to the end, somehow) I was glad he still wasn't saying much, and the little that did come from it was just clichéd nonsense. This man cannot do the strong silent brooding type at all, especially not wearing a daft white satin jacket with, wait for it ..... a scorpion on the back, and a toothpick in his mouth.The plot, what there was of it, is so old and tired and so overdone, the whole film was completely predictable. None of the characters have any depth or interest to them, probably due to the lack of any script. Even Carey Mulligan, who is a real favourite of ours, was wasted and looked rather uncomfortable in her rather dull character - the single mum at home. And the clichés just continued at Ryan became the child's new 'best friend'.The violence is also completely at odds with the rest of the film. It is extreme, graphic and vicious, which is fine and dandy if the rest of the film demands it, unfortunately this film doesn't and it looks like it's been thrown in just for shock value.I really cannot understand why such a piece of second rate and boring drivel has got such amazing reviews on here and from some critics. Just before this we watched The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly again, now that has everything this movie doesn't but seems to be trying so hard to emulate - characters that aren't black and white, minimal dialogue to add to the tension, and stunning camera-work to keep you captivated.Save your time and money and watch this classic instead, Drive has nothing to offer but annoyance and the WORST soundtrack I've ever heard.",Drive

If he was meant to play this character as wooden, boring and uncharismatic, I give him full marks.Action scenes were OK at best.I couldn't wait for this to end, that was the best part. Pretty much every comment i overheard as I left the cinema was a criticism of this rubbish. Ryan Gosling, bad move signing up to this, you're better than this.Do not waste your time and money on this garbage, you will regret it. The people saying they are seeing this again are deluded...it makes me wonder if they are affiliated with this film.",Drive

When i came out of the film i thought wow this has got to be one of the best movies i have ever seen.they balanced it out very well. it had action but also had a story which some movies do not have as they focus more on the action sequences and forget about the story.i cant believe anyone would think this movie is slow. it is a classic cult film and it should hold up well over the years as it is a great film. please do not hesitate to see this film it is truly a masterpiece. 10 out of 10,Drive

Everything about this movie stunk...the acting, the direction, the pace (as in snails), the editing was done by a first grader and the music was like nails to a chalkboard. If Hollywood is attempting to go retro then it needs to look up the textbook definition of what ""retro"" is first before tossing together a heap of frankenstein clichés and passing it off as avant garde. ZERO stars out of a million...... p.s. can people pleeease stop employing Carey Mulligan...AN EDUCATION isn't an excuse to keep going on pretending shes actually versatile, and while your at it maybe someone can tell Albert Brooks that his room at the permanent career pothole hotel is ready because he's been ignoring that memo since 1990's Defending Your Life",Drive

WTF?!?! 1. Even if you can look past the complete lack of action (or any real driving scenes, for that matter) you should not ignore that this movie makes no sense. Ryan Gosling is marketed first as a heist driver, then as a stunt man/mechanic... then some sort of savant in the driving world ... then his investors end up blacklisting him because he coincidentally gets involved with them through a robbery with his next door neighbor... an illogical plot twist that is never explained or clarified in any capacity.2) Even if you can appreciate the cliché 80's style (right down to the font used in the title/credits... good one guys...) it doesn't actually work if the main character drives a 2010 Chevy Impala and caries an iPhone. I get where they were going with the ridiculous scorpion jacket and blah blah blah - but again, it doesn't work. Whoever developed the (pretentious-assed... if you don't get it then you're not indie and cool enough) soundtrack should be shot.3) This movie never gets past the drama-that-isn't. Whether through RIDICULOUSLY drawn out pauses (""almost autistic""... to quote another review), overdone gore (but no actual driving... WTF???), terrible lines (""This car would be a pussy-mobile!"" or ""The tires still have tread"" when referring to a recently purchased, $300,000 stockcar)... it almost gets painful.

However i watched this with a couple of friends and after the first 10 minutes we were all bored but thought it would get better. Ryan Gosling was very dull and his character had little to say throughout entire film. The story itself was lacking anything to keep you watching and the soundtrack was awful throughout. Some may say its a good film but i can only see the IMDb Rating for this going down as more of you watch it as it has since i watched it. Don't always go on what other people say but with this one believe me or find out by wasting an hour and a half of your life. 3/10 from me as it was so boring!,Drive
1213,FilmFantic,Style over Substance,5,4 October 2011,"I feel I have to write something about this film that so many are going crazy about. Having looked forward to this film, I have to say I was not a little disappointed. I don't want to spoil it for people so I'll try an describe my feelings not the plot. It is well shot and it has a feel of an eighty's pop video, which reminded me of a Madonna video, perhaps it was the electro pop soundtrack. Much has be said about Ryan Goslings performance, and does play it with aloofness and has a cool Estwoodesque manner. Its called Drive, but it is not Bullet, so If that's what you expect forget it. The film is mainly very long still shots of Ryan Gosling, doing not very much and saying even less. As I said it is well shot and the director borrows heavily from Michael Mann in Heat, and Ridley Scott in Blade Runner. There is violence, some unseen, some graphic. But not totally believable, it is not just that Gosling just doesn't quite manage to pull it off. He try s to portray some kind of dangerous psychopath and, for me, it didn't work. The lack of much dialogue was also very irritating. On the whole I feel this film is way overrated",Drive

Very slow film that never gets going, fair enough i prob don't appreciate any of the arty farty great stuff in this film, but it was miss-advertised to me. I was hoping for action, car chases, brawls, interesting charismatic characters. Like suggested in the trailer.. All i got was a cringe-worthy, wet Ryan gosling that was, well awkward to watch. I still have haunting memories of this film, for instance the countless scenes where him and her ( it'll make sense if you watch it ) just sit in her flat staring at each other with horrific music playing. Rant over, could have gone on a lot longer..... basically i have no idea why this film is currently rated at 8.4??? If you want to see a film around that rating that deserves it, try Goodfellas, Scarface, The Departed. They are engrossing, memorable and impressive. This is total rubbish",Drive

One of the best films I've seen in years and glad that there are still people with visions making movies. A breath of fresh air from your norm. Great Film hands down.Do not give negative reviews if you walked into this movie expecting Transporter because the title of this movie is not Transporter and is probably the furthest thing from it.

Unbelievably crude. The Jewish producer, distributors, supporter and anyone else associated with this production should hang their head in shame. That Albert Brooks would be involved shows he can just not sink any lower. When the Ryan Gosling character asks the child about bad guys and learns that ""sharks will always be sharks"" to what does this refer? The religious beliefs of none of the other characters are discussed or included. Only Jews are mentioned, made to look violent,money hungry and almost laughably immoral. It's like Nazi propaganda films in the 1930's. Who wrote this screenplay and what was their not especially hidden agenda? The worldwide distribution will only perpetrate these fantasies further.",Drive
1218,andrea_bernasconi,Pretentious,2,10 October 2011,"Positive: nice soundtrack, nice picture (but is it really necessary to repeat 4 times the same slow motion shot showing the actor face on a dark background?) Negative: complete lack of rhythm, no dialogue will be remembered and actors have no expressions or psychological depth. The (weak) plot is messy and based on several coincidences. The end is easily expected and the love story is dull: new neighbors, car broke and strangely he is there to help, best-friend of the son, ... As somebody in the previous reviews has already pointed out: ""I know what the creative intent was, that the character was just something of a ""blank canvas""... The biggest problem here is that Gosling can't tone down the smart and charming enough for us to believe that he's as socially isolated as his character really should be. And, again, he tends to try to substitute blankness for intensity. It doesn't work."". ""A man of few words but who looks smarter than anybody else. He is ridiculous taking himself so seriously.""

1219,lauraninjas,Someone give this guy an Oscar...,10,1 February 2012,"Drive was an insanely wonderful break away from these over-hyped macho blockbusters that rely only on explosions, using 1,000 rounds of ammo per minute while keeping a babe on each arm (and not a great aim on the target). Goslings' character to audience bond strengthens at the same time his plans are coming undone. The ability for this guy to be silent for most of the movie is what proves how great of an actor he is. When the momentum builds, there are scenes where no matter what is going on in the background, you cannot take your eyes off his face. The violence is almost beautiful as it gains speed, spirals out of control, and takes your breath away. The casting is superb, the soundtrack is spot-on and could not be more perfect. It has cars, girls, muscles, and fights. This is a REAL macho movie like you've rarely seen, and do you want to know why? These actors can really ACT! Imagine that. From the lead roles to the people you've never even heard of on this cast, every one of them has it right. All action movies should be like this and I, for one, hope there is a new trend of copying this style. I wouldn't complain about movie prices any more if they were all this good.",Drive

It's entertaining but it's not Bullitt, folks. CrispyCrunchy says: ""See it because it will make you a better person.""? You've got to be kidding ...Not particularly impressed with Ryan Gosling - in anything yet. Always seems to come across as the silent, smooth-as-silk tough guy (he doesn't even have a name, just ""Driver"" ... sends shivers), but I think it's more like Ludes with Wild Turkey and forgetting his lines. Albert Brooks is great, but he usually is. Took me a minute to recognize Oscar Isaac from Robin Hood, and he's definitely got the role(s) of a weasel down pat. But Ron Perlman? C'mon. Stick to Hellboy sequels and Red Lobster commercials.Let's also not pretend this is an original. Written by? Screenplay? Please. See Ryan O'Neal's 1978 ""The Driver"". Add ""The"", remove the R and we've got ourselves another movie!Frankly, I think Chris Pine's attitude would have made it a better film. Save your money and wait for it to come out on TBS.

Brooks seem to have really pushed himself for this and his acting really stood out.I understand that Nicholas Winding Refn is his own self but really his style in this movie feels a lot like something by Quentin Taratino. Which, depending if your a fan of him or not, may be good or bad.An overall great movie that was definitely my favorite of 2011. It's definitely worth checking out.

I have seen almost every movie on IMDb top 250 and this one Does NOT belong on it. I would normally give this movie about a 6 or 7 but it's ranked 130 of all time ahead of movies far better than it.

Good action but not for families at all !It's bloody and messy as hell. As for me I enjoyed and my wife also, so a film that couples can see and enjoy together.

This is because this movie is so so bad that I won't advise anyone to go through it.I will be brief. Drive is an awful and boring movie. When I first heard about this movie, I expected racing cars, action, car smashes and suspense. I was TOTALLY deceived. From the minute I started watching the movie, I knew that it was going to be monotonous. The main actor is mysterious and talks little. He gives no charisma to his role and is certainly not there for entertainment. If you want action movies with lots of sound, gun scenes,etc..i would not recommend Drive. My overall rating: 1 out of 10The movie name is totally misleading. If you want action, racing cars, explosions, etc.. you will be as deceived as I was.

They should have hired Vin Diesel to inject some talent into it. I'm a movie fan, not a professional critic. However, here goes. Drifty dreamy camera angles and pans. Poorly delivered lines from most of the cast. Completely inappropriate soundtrack. Lots of wooden, dumb looks from the actors. I can't believe I was suckered into renting this.

1231,Ethnic_Tension,Far from a good movie,4,13 November 2011,"I have watched many movies from a range of countries and decades. I believe every good movie either has a good plot or a good story to tell. Brilliant movies have both.Drive has neither. It lacks a plot and the story is slow, disjointed and lacks believaility.The first half of the movie establishes that the main character has a crush or is in love with a neighbour with a kid. Seriously, you do not need to spend half a movie establishing something so simple, not to mention the main character is a complete stalker / creep bordering on mentally disabled. The second half of the movie is the main character getting revenge for a robbery gone wrong. All the second half of the movie establishes is how truly dumb the main character is. Btw, it's not because of the unhappy ending (Mind you I prefer unhappy endings).There are serious plot holes as well. One previous reviewer mentioned that it was never explained why there was a second car at the heist gone wrong, only to be told off by another reviewer who loved the movie. There IS no explanation - why would you rob money from people you have sent to rob it in the first place, especially when you aren't paying two of them, and the one you are paying is in on the second robbery?!?!?!Further, many reviewers appear to suggest those who do not like the movie would rather see CGI nonsense. I do not like movies which substitute film making with CGI. However, this movie is not a good example of one.I find it difficult to understand what people see in this movie. It is an attempt at a meaningful, character driven movie which falls flat.If you want to see a movie with a good plot - watch Ghost Writer or Oldboy If you want to see a movie with a good story - watch Barry Lyndon, Shawshank Redemption, Goodfellas, Casino If you want to see a movie with good driving and limited CGI - watch Initial D, The Legend of Speed, Taxi (French movie) or Grand Prix If you want to see a good artsy action movie - watch A Clockwork Orange",Drive
1232,christophhh,Amaaaaazing.,10,18 November 2011,"This is truly one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It's captivating from the very start and truly entertaining all the way through.Drive presents Los Angeles perfectly. It shows LA as the seedy, yet beautiful city it is. It captures its dream-like qualities and its often dark ways. The film has an increasingly dim undertone; most of the scenes take place during the night time. At times it is strikingly violent, with interchanges showcasing the beautiful skyline under romantic moonlight and reminiscent 80s synthesized love songs. Gosling is flawless in this film. He speaks only when necessary and delivers every line with completeness. Themes include loyalty, as well as love and death.Drive is an instant classic.",Drive
1233,cjbrunton,"Modern noir ""masterpiece"" for the Bay/Bruckheimer Gen",7,19 November 2011,"A woman in Michigan recently filed suit against the distributors of Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive, claiming the trailer misled her into thinking it was going to be like Fast And The Furious - that there was in fact very little driving in the film. She has my sympathies.I bought Refn's critically well-received previous effort, Valhalla Rising, on blu-ray expecting something along the lines of The 13th Warrior and instead got an exercise in Viking existentialism so pretentious and excruciatingly tedious I wanted to scratch my eyes out. Drive also features lots of ponderous staring into space, stretching on into minutes, but this time the payoff is a little more worthwhile. The professional criminal with a heart of gold trying to set things right caper is scarcely original in westerns and film noir and Refn self-consciously apes from the very best: Point Blank (1965), The Getaway (1972), and Thief (1981). Opening titles in fluoro pink Mistral over DP Newton Thomas Sigel's highly stylized neon drenched Los Angeles cityscapes combine with Cliff Martinez' poppy and at times icily atmospheric synth washes that conjure up both Tangerine Dream's Thief soundtrack and Giorgio Moroder's music for Scarface (1983) creating a cool Miami Vice 80s vibe. Refn's use of violence is comparable to David Cronenberg's superb A History of Violence (2005) and Eastern Promises (2007), brutally intense and frighteningly realistic but dealt with quickly, never garish nor gratuitous.Action sequences are handled with precision. Car chases shot the only way a car chase should be shot, with practical stunt work not computer animation, free of shaky cam, and edited in such a way that, although kinetically super-charged, they remain easy to follow.The biggest speed bump preventing Drive from overtaking the iconic greats to which Refn aspires is in casting Ryan Gosling in the lead. Gosling is pretty good at chewing a toothpick, but he isn't fit to do up Lee Marvin, Steve McQueen or James Caan's shoelaces – mind you in the new Hollywood, who really is?Like Valhalla Rising, Drive is attracting more favorable reviews than it probably warrants. One reviewer on here even calls it Citizen Kane meets Taxi Driver! While it's certainly very good, it's hardly ""the best of the year"" (for me that would be Rise of the Planet of the Apes/Warrior tie and Red Dog) and I can't help but think that if the film had been released back in the day it would have quickly vanished without a trace.",Drive

1235,shaun-perry92,A Film to Redefine the Genre,10,1 December 2011,"Drive is a movie I went into knowing about the hype, some people had applauded it, calling it a masterpiece and others had damned it. It really is a love or hate film there is no doubt about that. I loved it, Director Nicolas Winding Refn does an amazing job, using the slow motion scenes as a beautiful motif. The director Wes Anderson comes to mind as he uses it in a similar fashion; highlighting a certain emotion, something that is truly important to it at that point in time. It wasn't just a rifle shooting with the shell hurling out of the chamber like something from a Zack Snyder film. Ryan Gosling does a great job as the driver, the man with no name, a clear inspiration. Bryan Cranston was terrific as usual as the nice guy in the middle of it all. Carey Mulligan was also a stand out, this film lived or died by its actors because of its very simplistic dialogue, it was all in the reactions, the facial expressions. The 80's nostalgia compliments the film well, helping to brighten things up in what is a very dark piece. If people are expecting a fast and the furious type film like how the trailer depicts it to be, don't see it. Its a movie for the movie lovers, if your tired of seeing that same old Hollywood car chase that gets more and more silly see this film, its a breath of fresh air into the genre.",Drive
1236,affan_bin_mahmood,Absolutely over rated,5,2 December 2011,"I have never written a review before, this is my first. I watched the movie after looking at its strikingly high rating.OK I agree that it is a fine movie, but it is absolutely over rated. Having songs in it is a nice touch. But the main character pausing for so long in most of the scenes absolutely does not deserve such a high rating. Also, I expected the movie to have a happy ending ""like the main character meeting the girl"" or may be a sad ending ""like the main character dying"", none of which was the case.The movie seems to be a low budget production ""have a look at the animation during car accidents"". However, I do agree that for a low budget movie, it is a pretty decent piece of work. I would have given the movie a 10 if IMDb was a low budget movie rating database. Otherwise, the movie doesn't deserve anything more than a 5 rating in my view.No offense to anyone. Whatever I have stated, are only my views.Best!",Drive

But the opening credits with an 80's soundtrack sound really pulled me in (I wanted so badly to get out).The dialogue seems more directed at the moments of silence between characters. Pauses that seem outrageously pointless and become quickly tiresome rule the film.An indie film that proceeds to take me no where I want to go. I would pass this film by and have no regrets.",Drive
1238,saenzjay,Not what you expect from a the typical Gangster Action Movie,8,6 December 2011,"I just watched the movie and I think that it is very good, but not really engaging. Probably this is the main flaw of the movie as a viewer, it never gets you inside the story or build anything that makes you care about the characters. I think that this is a realist view of a gangster story, no stunning special effects or CGI, no larger than life moments, no epic music... just the story of a nameless guy trying to do the right thing. He tries and fails, because the driver is no super hero, just a hero that got involved in a really bad situation trying to help another guy and his family.I like the chemistry between Irene and the driver, no cheesy lines or cliché romantic scenes, just looks and smiles, the way she sees him carry the kid to bed. That's in complete contrast to the other side of the movie, the killings and the gore, that catch you by surprise. The characters are unpredictable and that's a good thing. Going back to the beginning, the movie is good, very good, but it won't take your breath away, just a couple of Woah! moments. The car scenes were realistic and tense, but not exciting. The whole story is good, but there's a plot hole regarding the why they were stealing the money? that affects how you react to the way things developed.",Drive

Never heard a car shift while driving in reverse. Also didn't know that the Chevy Malibu or Impala, or what ever the hell he had came it stick. Funny how he rev-matched the gears without reaching for a shifter. This movie was a wast of money, and it pisses me off even more to talk about it.

1240,satyam_mishra2002,Brilliant movie. Good direction! One of the best I have seen.,10,4 September 2019,"I was just re watching this and I noticed something. At the start of the film, Shannon mentions that Driver is stunt doubling for the star of the film. That means the mask is a mask of the main protagonist in whatever movie's being shot, which adds a more fitting meaning as to why Driver wears it. Because he finally gets to be the good guy, the real hero, as he's been wanting all along. He's the stuntman / hero - It was completely missed in this review . The frog/scorpion is a no brainer - but wearing the mask illustrates / metaphor that he is in fact the hero . Though Chris indirectly mentions this by X lines reality / Hollywood - Its key as his nature was never really that of the scorpion - by definition. Early in the movie, the Driver has a ""staring contest"" with little Benicio, telling him ""you blinked."" In a film this meticulously crafted, no detail is unimportant. During that last suspenseful scene, I was freakin' waiting for that blink. It had to happen, it was foreshadowed.Scorpion & the Frog story - Driver references the fable of The Scorpion and the Frog: the frog agrees to carry the scorpion across the river; the scorpion stings the frog, saying ""it's my nature"" and both drown. Driver can be seen as The Frog of the story - he drives/carries criminals (scorpions) around in his car, but is inevitably dragged into their destructive world (stung) leading to everybody's downfall. Driver's jacket has a scorpion on the back, just as the frog carried the scorpion on its back. Effing BRILLIANT MOVIE! This is the CINEMA I live for.",Drive

Its very well shot, the cinematography is great, the music choices and the synchronization with the film is excellent. Based on these things alone, I recall feeling like I was watching a really really well done music video, at certain moments. At times it feels like the movie goes a long time without dialogue, and music is playing, and there's slow mo, and interesting camera angles, the whole 9 yards. And it all looks and feels really great.But on the flip side, nothing else is really happening. Its a standard revenge story. For me personally I don't know if that's enough for me consider a movie great. The movie definitely leaves an impression though, which is more than a lot of movies these days, and that says something for the film. I liked it even though it felt like I didn't want to like it.

1250,adwin-smy,"Not quite as I expected, and kind of overrated",6,22 December 2011,"Well, I'm one of those people who sees the reviews first before watching the film. And when I bought the DVD, I was kinda excited because this film's rating is high, 8,2 that is.Then I watched it. I was so excited seeing the prologue when The Driver's carrying out a heist. I thought it was going to be something like a high-tension chase between The Driver and the polices, and that's implying how I expected this film was going to be. But honestly, for the first half of the film, I was quite sleepy, when it was filled with far-from-action-like plot orientation, but instead a slow, dark and gloomy orientation. But, yes, I admit it went better at the beginning of the later half of the film, when The Driver takes Standard to a heist, I thought the tension was going better until the end of the film, but instead, now it went down again to a gloomy and dark story of violence and vengeance. Not to mention there's so many flaws and weaknesses to this film. Like there's no character development, lots of meaningless scene (ie. the river scene, the movie-making scene.), unrealistic scene (ie. the cliff scene, the elevator scene, etc.), and despite those, would you think it's THAT easy to kill mob people with just a hammer? Aren't they supposed to have guards around them? Too many things left wasted, actually.Come to think of it, this film is the same as Faster (2010) starred by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Where the main character is a nameless bad- ass muscled driver who seldom talks and went around the neighborhood killing people to avenge some problems for his dark past. If you ever watch Faster, then I told you, this film is quite the same with it.So if you expect this film to be an action-packed and filled with breathtaking action scene, you're wrong.Hope that helps.",Drive

1254,mikepomery,What could have been mesmerising winds up meandering,2,7 January 2012,"Let me first clarify before the flames begin: I love a slow-burning film. I love a slowly simmering plot culminating in a carefully realised finale. Most of my favourite films are from an era when the audience was given a bit more credibility as to their intelligence and patience.So, by rights I should find something in this film to forgive, but I just can't get over the many monumental cinematic roadblocks blocking such satiation.I recently saw Valhalla Rising, a previous offering from the same director, and while that story was perhaps slightly too simplified to make room for ambiguous interpretations, it was still a visceral and visual triumph. Where did that director go? And who is this new guy? This film is a mess. Exquisite cinematography and precise focus would have been a big redeemer if it wasn't for the most exaggerated usage of the now popular 'Hollywood Teal and Orange' colour-retouch. In this film, it has now progressed into a garish blue and yellow affair that saturates everything on screen. Once you notice it, the fact that most background props are coloured either blue, yellow or orange where possible is a jarring experience. I was shocked and surprised when Ron Pearlman showed up in a purple sweater. He later showed up in a blue shirt and yellow tie...Visuals aside, the acting is for the most part too wooden. This might be down to a lot of miscasting, especially for the protagonists. Ryan Gosling just does not have effortless machismo, so the excruciatingly long periods of his silently brooding come off looking as though he forgot his lines. Carey Mulligan appears vapid and disinterested in her role and Christina Hendricks has a brief cameo as confused girl No 2.While there are good performances from Ron Pearlman, Oscar Issac, Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks, their lack of screen time and poorly thought out characters ultimately waste good actors in bare-bones roles.So there is one thing left that could have saved the movie from all these huge flaws; a compelling story to divert our attention from the miscast actors, garish visuals and strange normalisation levels when it comes to sudden eruptions of car sounds...Lucked out again guys. The story is exceedingly standard fare, trimmed down to make room for long periods of silence and filler scenes. It could be told in 20 minutes and not appear rushed.What all this adds up to a flat, meandering, convoluted film that will leave you feeling not a little disappointed and let down by all the hype.

The relationship between the main character and the mother is set up in a strange way .

I love Ryan Gosling, I love Albert Brooks, and I was pretty excited to see Ron Perlman and Bryan Cranston in the credits.I understood this was a movie about a stunt driver who also worked as a getaway driver, and it had a romantic element. I knew almost nothing else about the plot, other than it was a thriller. Often, that's the best way to see a movie.However, as soon as the pink, cursive script started in the credits, I knew things were going to be off. I understood the credits were implying a nostalgia for the 80's. That was obvious. But visually, it just didn't match up. So we had nostalgic 80's script with scenes that were very obviously from 2011. This continued with the soundtrack, which placed 80's-style pop songs on top of brooding, contemporary scenes. Don't get me wrong, sometimes by juxtaposing two elements that obviously don't belong together you create something new and wonderful. Here, it simply reminded me I was watching a movie. It caused me to critique vs. experience, which is almost never a good sign.Because of the niggling wrongness of the soundtrack, I ended up being more critical of the script and overall story, which were thin. While the acting was good, perhaps excellent, it couldn't make up for the other elements that were lacking.

The irony of course is that it's exactly this element of the movie, the driver and Irene's characters ability to express their thoughts/feelings through simply eye contact, stares, smiles and other facial expressions and body language as well as the beautiful camera work that sets this movie apart from the usual Hollywood blockbuster nonsense.The Driver(hero) character is an introverted individual hence he why he says very little(again not like the usual Vin Diesel style lead role) but he is supremely cool at the same time, note the carm collected pauses. The pauses between dialogue from the Driver are majestically done, Goslings timing and performance here is exceptional, they manage to deliver a feeling of tension, passion, happiness, excitement, comfort and coolness personified to the viewer. Its a lesson in how an audience can be captivated and intreged by nothing more than two people, so comfortable and happy in the each others company, simply enjoying the silence/moment, who needs CGI, guns and explosions. The short but shocking violence that breaks out in the movie along with THAT mesmorising and beautiful lift scene, of course perfectly completes our mysterious driver character.

1264,ddonohue1-266-771256,"Film Noir... for me, not so much",3,15 January 2012,"Having read some of the other reviews that raved about this film I expected more. Having watched it, I doubt that I'll watch it again to give it a second chance.It felt to me like the writer, director, producer and editor were all pulling in a different direction on this project.This movie dragged around in front of me horribly. The far too frequent slowed down scenes, scenes that didn't fit or enhance the film at all, the lack of substance of a script, and the bland acting of the main characters didn't support the genre for me at all. The plot was leading and obvious, as it had to be with so little dialogue, or expression between the main characters.The overacting of the rest of the ""name brand"" characters made the storyline less and less believable as the show dragged on. Ron Perlman is a guy I love to hate in a lot of series and films, but this cookie cutter character from him left me feeling like he was woefully typecast and uninspired.In my opinion, watching the main character's face slowed down and unchanging despite the mood of the scene or the moment, is not acting, it's the opposite of acting. And if it doesn't make the film any better, then it's not bad acting, it's bad movie making.Undermining this film from the start were the goofs and continuity errors. The less interested in the film you are, the more of them jump off the screen at you. Watching the front of a Chrysler 300 nearly fall off, then seconds later passing the vehicle it's chasing looking factory fresh Ugh.The audio track was drab and repetitive enough for me to sigh to myself and roll my eyes every time it started playing. I never found it tense and artsy, just drab, too similar throughout the film, and uninteresting.The few action sequences and purposely overdone gore scenes, supposedly placed in there to contrast with the low tide of the rest of the film, felt out of place, and did little to make this anything of a better film. It was almost as if they were a last minute add-in to provide Trailer fodder and get the film watched by a broader audience in regular movie houses.Film noir, for me? I'd have to say no.

In my first viewing of this film, I was utterly in shock at how beautiful the picture looked, and the fact that Refn can keep the audience member intrigued in the movie without dialogue, is a skill that is quite frankly absent from many directors today. Acting as icing on the cake; Drive also has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in a movie. The soundtrack is such a unique compilation of songs, it is fascinating to listen to. If you are like the typical movie goer today, and you're only looking for cheap thrills and action, do not watch this movie and then give it a lack-luster rating. If you are a true appreciator of the art of film as well as astounding camera work. Then I could not recommend this movie enough,. Without a doubt, Drive deserves a 10/10.",Drive
1267,rileyfletcher,Top 10 Films made.,10,25 July 2012,"Drive's invigorating soundtrack, eccentric and beautiful cinematography, incredible acting and absolute perfect directing engraves your mind and leaves you astonished to what you've witnessed. The soundtrack is so similar to Bon Iver's Calgary, which uses synthetic tunes to enable a sense of amazingness? This film is indescribable, I don't know what it was, but as I was watching it, the film definitely touched me, in a way that no other movie has, except for maybe Fight Club, although the two aren't comparable. I felt as though I was experiencing watching my self as the movie went on, the outcastness of Gosling, captured the bouncing energy that was made from this film and it inevitably allowed for me to really believe in this movie. After seeing this wonderful film, it's now a part of my soul till my death. Absolutely beautiful.Thank you.",Drive
1268,travis_muise,A Masterpiece,10,23 January 2012,"I wish I could give this movie a rating of 500/10 in hopes of balancing the bad reviews. It's startling to see how many people missed the point completely with this one. It seems as though the current state of the movie industry has conditioned the movie-going public to simply want more: bigger, faster, louder and sexier. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good car chase or gun fight as much as the next guy when I'm in the mood for something with a little less substance to pass the time. This is not one of those movies.Drive stars Ryan Gosling as a Hollywood stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver for hire. We don't know anything about him; not his history nor even his name. We get hints throughout the film that he's not exactly innocent, and the opening scene seems to suggest that he drives more for the thrill and challenge than for money. When he meets his neighbour Irene, played by Carey Mulligan, and her son he becomes instantly attached, and will do anything to protect them. This includes helping Irene's husband, who was recently released from prison, do one last heist in hopes that the mob will leave him and his family alone. Through coincidence and misunderstanding, things go wrong, and nobody is safe. The driver's commitment to protecting Irene propels the last act and turns a drama into a revenge flick of the highest order.Everything is top notch. From the performances to the cinematography to the much talked about score, which gives Drive an undeniably 80's feel, this film is extremely well executed and engaging. Even the quick flashes of brutal violence are well done and serve as jarring punctuations against the slow and almost surreal movement of the film.This movie seemed to go over a lot of people's heads. Perhaps misleading trailers are to blame and people were expecting something with more cars and more action, but to dismiss a movie when it doesn't live up to a two minute trailer is just not fair. This is not a movie in which every detail needs to be explained, or one that needs to be wrapped up in a neat little package by the time the pink script of the closing credits appear on screen. This is a movie in which we step into a world created by an extremely capable cast and crew, and we watch a story unfold against the backdrop of stunning visuals and a pulsing score. We don't enter at the beginning, and we don't leave at the end; we absorb what's shown to us and are left to appreciate the mystery of the driver and art of a perfectly crafted film. It's a movie in which a small stretch of silence can say so much more than 10 pages of dialogue. And to those of you who say Ryan Gosling does nothing here other than look cool, he's a stunt driver by day and getaway driver by night with a mysterious past: that is the definition of cool.",Drive
1269,simonhfirenet,Really poor!!!!,3,25 January 2012,"I cant believe the reviews this film gets, thin plot, gash story, boring characters, but some good but very limited action. This is basically a rubbish low budget film shot at a snails pace with limited dialogue and a gash soundtrack to try and make it look and sound 'cool', all it did was bore me to tears, epic, epic fail...... The bad guys were pathetic, the chick was vacant, even the main character was really quite lame. There are attempts to persuade the audience he is a total bad ass with a secret past, because he has a scorpion logo on the back of his jacket, what? It doesn't come much shallower really, oh and then there's the race car, the mafia, the weird setup, what a total mess. This film is all over the place. If it was a bit more gritty with deeper depth and history to the characters then this film might be better. Save 100mins of your life and go watch Leon, Ronin or Layercake again instead.

1270,DrivingMissMulligan,An Absolute Masterpiece of a Movie,10,16 October 2018,"Drive (2011), by the excellent Nicolas Winding Refn, is hands down my favourite movie of all time. It's got everything:Ryan Gosling (in what is perhaps his greatest role to date) as the brooding, methodical driver, bringing the glory days of Steve McQueen to mind.Carey Mulligan, Oscar Isaac, Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks all doing career defining work as supporting characters.Cinematography to die for. This movie oozes cool, it's slicker than anything that's ever come before it. Fast cars, glimmering neon skylines and a dark, fascinating vision of the streets of Los Angeles, far removed from the glamor of Hollywood and the Beverly Hills.And last but not least, a killer soundtrack.
It's perfect. It got me into synthwave and 80's retro tunes. Combined with the cinematography it creates an atmosphere like nothing i've ever experienced before.Do yourself a favour and go watch this film if you haven't already. And if you're on the fence about it - put on the first five minutes and then decide. If you're not hooked by the time the title comes flashing in to the sounds of Kavinsky's ""Nightcall"", I don't know what else to do for you.",Drive
1271,yakuz,"Hot review, after the screening",10,24 September 2011,"Just got back from the movie, which in the language of Star Trek - restores faith in the Federations. ;) To the point, the film is generally a story about the attack that went wrong, we know many such stories, but that which is told in the style of recent times is rare, unfortunately, that is, with respect to the viewer. If you feel hurt by serving us and now works after leaving the cinema feeling that if your brain had a butt, it would hurt him unmercifully - reach for the Drive.For me, Drive relied on the pillar which is the fascinating main character of flesh and blood that is not enough that he is reticent to even film the remainder of the nameless character. A man wonders what the devil sits in his head. This consideration favors even brilliant execution - a phenomenon that manifests itself, which my primitive person is called a pulse of the film - pumping, respectively on the next screen portions of emotions. I can not refuse to drive a wonderful style emanating calm, almost magically hypnotic narration. Each shot is a feast for the eye, and a true masterpiece is generally sound and manipulate musical path.By the way, do not be fooled by trailers, the movie has absolutely nothing to do with the so-called cinema of chimpanzees likes of Fast and Furious, no, God forbid, no. For this, following the Drive ready for some really strong scenes, because the impact can be seen nowhere on the potency of the manufacturer's stupid trying to lower its age category. Sorry for my English, I just want to say - go. Go and watch, you may not come into your tastes in such a nice way to hit the mine. Perhaps ye will a little pretentious, but it is really most pleasant thing that met me this year in the cinema. 10/10 from me.",Drive

I wanted to love this movie, i did love the look, the style, the cast & acting, i loved the fact that it delivers little dialog and no back story. Unfortunately it also failed to deliver the story, which lurks somewhere in the background and might have been good. Only thing that bothers me is this: Driver is neighbor to a woman whose husband Stander shares a prison cell with Chris who is somehow associated with Nino who is partner of Bernie who is acquainted with Shannon who is employer of Driver. OMG! If the images of the brooding driver had just been a little shorter, there would easily have been enough time to tell the story, so that it makes sense. What a disappointment.",Drive

I only spent a dollar on it because they showed it at my college movie theater and I had a little free time. I do not really know what people see in Ryan Gosling. The first half of the movie he only said one or two words at a time and there was a lot of scenes of just him trying to look BA. It seemed like they were trying to make an 80s film noir, but failed. The only good actor in it was Standard and he was only in it for two seconds. The dad from ""Malcom in the Middle"" was in it and he played his part relatively well. Also the film was way over the top in grotesque murder. Lastly it seemed that the actor who played Bernie Rose was trying way too hard to act the same way Gene Hackman would act in any of his movies. I wonder if Gene Hackman turned the part down. I know I did not really talk too much at all about the plot, but I feel I saved you from seeing it. It should be up there with movies like ""The Room"" and ""Troll 2"" but those were low budget films this movie actually had money to pay for actors and car chases.",Drive

The opening scene is pretty good and looks to be a great setup for an outstanding movie with gut wrenching stunts and obviously driving. The movie turned out to be horrible after that, and there was VERY little said, little conversation, just all around weird and awkward. There was NO narration. The music was horrible and did not fit anything that was going on in the movie. Some scenes resulted in just flat out impossible or uncalled for gore. Overall the main character was completely different the second half of the movie, a calm collected professional at some point makes a switch to a boarder line lunatic.

However, since I had hoped for some good entertainment, character development and perhaps a few action scenes here and there, I was sorely disappointed. I have heard the term ""self-indulgent"" thrown around but I never fully understood it until seeing this film. The director seemed more concerned with showing off his ""artsy"" (and frustrating) camera angles and poignant, silent, moments (where the characters sit around, saying nothing to each other) rather than offering up a good movie. There is very little character development (I couldn't care less who lived or died, except for the little boy)very few scenes where you can actually see someone or something up close ( so many artsy long-shots)and very little action except for a few gruesome stabs with a knife or stomps of heads. Very disappointing. Very boring.",Drive
1277,a-utrapped,Not all it's hyped up to be...,5,1 February 2012,"The movie was desperately trying to be artistic, but, through my eyes, was definitely not. While watching the movie, I noticed many familiar film-tactics, such as displaying blood as beautiful art and slow-motion-drama. These were wonderful executed by the likes of Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino. Nicholas Winding Refn, the director of Drive, attempted to display both of their brilliant talent into his one movie. What happened instead was a muddled and dragging mix of the two, which resulted with long openings, dragged slow-motion scenes, and overly- gory violence. Seriously, a girl's head exploded. Neither masterfully beautiful, like Scorsese, or ragingly shocking, like Tarantino. Just plain, cringe-worthy. Also, the slow-motion scenes. They're a bit played-out, wouldn't you say? Something to ponder over.When Gosling isn't out making deals with criminals or doing the stunts of actors who ""do their own stunts"", his character spends time with his neighbor and her child. She's not a single mother either (but she will be), as her husband is in jail for a short amount of time. (When I say short amount of time, I am referring to the long introduction.) The Driver develops feelings for his pretty neighbor, which would push him to get involved with the aforementioned crime deal. Even though Gosling shows no apparent feelings for her, through facial expression, it is evident how much he loves her. No sarcasm intended, he truly loves her. At least that's what I gathered from it. As for her son, this was a touching plot line, always appreciated in most movies. However, in the dark, sinister undertones of Drive, it proves to be an obstacle for both the Driver and the movie itself. Really, it just drags on, almost painfully slow. Again, these are simply objective critiques. If not, then I mean for them to be.Onto the best part of the movie: Albert Brooks. In most cases, I don't generally like Albert Brooks; in movies such as Muse and The In-Laws, he played a bumbling, whiny fool and I didn't care for him at all. In Drive, however, he provides an exceptional turn into a malicious, sly criminal who executes his responsibilities with composure and swiftness. Considering the first description of his typical character, I'd say his performance here was absolutely grand. Based on my evaluation, I'm sure you can guess I was more than disappointed to find that he was not nominated for an Academy Award.

The perfectly drawn characters, the mythic story, the dead on performances, the artistic direction, it all works for me to deliver everything I want from a film.Ryan Gosling's performance is incredible. The way he is able to project his emotions and hold back at the same time really sucks you in. You really want to know what's going on with this guy because you just know there is something important he isn't talking about. Carey Mulligan delivers a similar powerfully quiet performance where you don't need dialog to tell you what she's thinking or feeling. You just get what's going on with these people because the performances are so real. And of course she's beautiful and vulnerable and you love her the moment she smiles at you.The rest of the cast deliver solid performances and I thought Albert Brooks was excellent. Great casting.This movie is, of course, highly stylized and so it's perfect if you understand that art isn't science. Watch it the first time just to drink it in.

1282,slythster2002,This movie is not for everyone.,10,30 March 2012,"But, this movie is fantastic. Ryan Gosling brings out so much emotion in such an understated way that it is fantastic.To the point, if you are expecting something in the mold of a Bond, Fast and Furious, XXX mold (extreme CG graphics, cheesy one-liners, and lots of dialogue) then look somewhere else. Not that those films don't have their own time and place, because they do. I do enjoy the occasional bad acting, bang 'em up, shoot 'em up films. But that is not this film.This film is limited in dialogue, and hands the viewer very little information in terms of back-story and detail. It isn't driven by plot twists, as you can typically predict what is going to happen. In fact, the movie does very little that would be considered ground breakingly new to the cinematic world.What it does do is give you superb acting, a fantastic, character driven plot, lots of action (chase scenes and violence), and tension that draws you into the film. This is a violent film, but not to the point that the violence dominates the movie or is glorified. In fact, the film almost seems apologetic about the gore. As the title implies, cars are very important to the movie, and every scene involving a car is done fantastically. And there are moments in the movie that left even a sterner, manly man like myself in tears.Gossling, Mulligan, Cranston, Brooks, Iaasac, and Perlman all play their characters fantastically and it is amazing that none of them, or this move, or its director, Nicholas Winding Refn, didn't win more awards than they did.

The pace of the movie was tediously slow, leaving some of the scenes downright awkward. I couldn't tell if they were trying to paint Gossling as some type of r*tard or something, because he never spoke, and literally had only ten lines in the entire movie. I also didn't understand the pink text and 80's font used for the opening, as well as the 80's music played throughout the entire movie. Before you jump down my throat telling me I don't know anything, and I should've read the book first before bashing the movie, I ask you: isn't that the point of a movie?

I have no problem with people disliking the film for what it is but to misunderstand it and review it as such, I will leave you to play with your action figures.This film is all about how it makes you feel, with an often haunting and liquid soundtrack that immediately pulls you into this dreamlike mood. You immediately like Goslings character and the instant relationship he has with the little boy and the vulnerable mother. The quiet and mild natured Driver'a relationship with those he cares about and his unbeatable talent reminds me greatly of Leon but that point is the only link as this film is a completely different beast. I was genuinely taken aback with the turnaround in fearsome personality and gripped until the final credits. The idea behind the music filled scenes without dialogue is to set your imagination working much in the same way a book does. Wonderfully shot and well thought out soundtrack.

It's interesting that none of the articles or reviews I have read about ""Drive"" made mention of this fact.Sure, the film was based on a novel, but that is no excuse for a revisiting of the 1981 classic without some attribution. As brilliant as Nicolas Refn is, his brilliance was in replicating the mood of a Michael Mann film, right down to the synth-heavy soundtrack (although no one could do a better job than Tangerine Dream - who did the ""Thief"" soundtrack - in this department).I easily could give this film ten stars ... it's that good (including smashing performances by Ryan Gosling and Albert Brooks). But Quentin Tarantino reveled in viewers' noting all of the mini-homages of numerous films which were included in ""Pulp Fiction.""

He was mysterious such that we all wanna know who he is but never do, we all know that there is someone inside that drives our way. He symbolizes the positive ego anyway so it has both good and bad both love and hate both revenge and compassion. A gateway to both heaven and hell. The choice is what matters.

They are always threatened by the negative ego, hate, anger, greed, guilt and suffering. The drive choose to protect, choose to protect them from the previous mistakes of the life, the guilt and does this at the expense of his own being. The movie is a story about human being. There is everything that we all have in the movie. There is always a part in us that is strong and hero enough to sacrifice. So I loved the movie because it is about all of us.

Guy eyes up a woman who happens to be married but find her self falling in love with a guy who obviously likes her 6 year old kid more than her. But if its romance you want you have the wrong film again, the most romantic it gets is where Mr lost for words thinks hey I know what will really impress this woman, I'm going to crush a guys skull right in front of her, Lucky for him shes a widower at this point so it never failed to woo her. after killing god knows how many people in front of countless witness this guy walks around covered in blood and simply uses a Michel Jackson mask to hide his identity. blaa blaa blaa very predicable and long winded. I might watch it again!",Drive
1293,olkou,A perfect match for a Sunday night,10,24 June 2012,"It's not just a classic action movie, it really is a masterpiece along with its soundtrack. The principal characters are stunning. Carey Mulligan, unexpectedly branching out from her usual typecasting, plays the part of a young mother and an inmate's wife so naturally that one could hardly imagine she has never had such an experience in her real life. Ryan Gosling as an extraordinary and poised stuntman in the beginning has turned out to be a man of principle by the end of the film. The main thing is that nobody tries to tie you up into a knot by telling two or three parallel stories, nevertheless the plot is intense and makes you feel truly involved in every situation the characters have to face. You'll enjoy every single minute of the story and your boyfriend will also love it)) The only question left is how on earth I could have missed it last year - it would have been fantastic to watch it on the big screen!",Drive

I watched the movie with a friend and both came to the conclusion that the film was overrated. A lot of people talk about the cinema when rating the movie. I was looking for an action film. If you are looking for an action film I would not recommend this film. The film is slow going and rather hard to watch. Had we not paid to see it, we would have turned the station.

I think a fair rating would be to give this film a score of 3-4/10, in all seriousness I will not trust IMDb ratings anymore after seeing it. It is hard to put into words quite how pretentious, slow and irritating this film is. The fact that Goslings character barely speaks and ignores most of the other characters throughout the film is completely implausible, poorly portrayed and utterly infuriating to watch. Everything about the style of the film is wannabe hip, such as jarring inappropriate pop music which goes on interminably, endless lingering shots in which nothing happens while the characters stand staring moronically at each others as if they are on strong tranquilizers. Although surprisingly, despite the wannabe trendy style of the film all of characters involved are extremely clichéd, predictable and boring. Much of the plot seems as though it could be out of an early 90s daytime TV show. Despite this it still manages not to have any of the tacky charm of other dated crime films, instead the entire experience is depressing and frustrating. This is really one of the worst films I have ever seen.",Drive

Then it drops back into first gear. They spend the first half hour of the movie dragging you through a hum drum spectacle of events that show you nothing relevant about this guys real character. You are lead into a relationship that they never plan to develop. Now maybe some people are impressed because the producers and director take the extra step and spend some real money to create some extremely realistic violence. That's when I mistakenly thought I was going to walk away with a feeling of satisfaction. But that was it, unless you are into see some really creative kill shots you're going to waste your time with this movie. I gave it a 1 because Ryan Gossling was great in this role.

There was far too much graphic violence without any entertainment value. I left feeling completely empty and mad at myself for watching the whole thing (even though I fast forwarded through most of it and didn't miss one speaking part!) This movie was absolutely wretched and I am sad to see Ryan Gosling attached to such an awful film! The music and costumes made it seem like something straight out of the 80's instead of a movie that was just released on video this year. I hated the ending and felt that there was absolutely zero credibility to it. The show really seemed to drag on forever.

I would drown that guy in a toilet. And what's with the jacket? Trying WAY too hard. I understand that people enjoy it because it is different than the majority of stuff they put out nowadays, but I really don't understand what's so great about it.

So i did it. :) After the first 10min I got sucked into the story and the great actoring of Ryan Gosling and Bryan Cranston. No scene and no dialog are too long, no gesture is missplaced. This movie is just a masterpiece for me. Sure, not for everybody. But this is not commercial mainstream standart, this is art! And art lies in the eyes of the beholder. Thank you! Sebastian",Drive
1300,hodgess,"Some good stuff, but not a keeper",4,26 February 2012,"Seems to be a major dichotomy of viewers here. People either love this movie or they hate it. The reason, I think, is because this is not a formula movie. If you are looking for a Jason Statham-style shoot-em-up, this isn't it, although the driving footage, little of it that there is, rivals some of the best I've seen and looks real. If you are looking for a Vin Diesel-style high energy movie, you won't find that here. This movie is sloooow most of the time. I mean fall asleep slow.So...what's to like? Well, if you are a devout follower of Ryan Gosling, he does a pretty good job of fitting into the mold Refn gave him. Probably a bit of a stretch for him...although I have to admit I'm not a follower so I don't know for sure. Albert Brooks plays a really excellent, understated but brutal bad guy. His caring nature is accentuated by his partner Ron Perlman's pure thug disposition. Carey Mulligan was the epitome of a girl any man, good or bad, would love to rescue. Great casting there...great casting in general.The anti-hero concept is a little over-rated, I think. It is certainly not new. I consider ""The Professional"" (Now called ""Leon: The Professional"") from 1994, where Jean Reno protects a young Natalie Portman from the crooked cop Gary Oldman to be one of the best of all time. Many, many actors have done them, some better than others. Try ""Man on Fire"" with Denzel Washington going to great lengths to save somebody he was hired to protect. Lastly, there are three elements of this movie that, good or bad, set it apart from the pack. First there is the incredible lack of dialog. I often felt like maybe Ryan Goslig was supposed to be mentally deficient in some way. You did not get the impression his inability to carry on the most basic of conversations was any kind of Rambo-like intensity. It was truly awkward, as though the writers wanted to tell a story, but simply weren't good enough or didn't want to be bothered with even the slightest witty dialog. The second element is the ""Why this and not that?"" concept. Not why the movie, but why did a million things that weren't really needed occur, while others that should have did not? We are never given any background to give us empathy for the characters. Why was the ex-con husband portrayed as truly caring for his wife. Through that dialog we learned a little about the girl, too. But there is no explanation of how Gosling's character, never even named throughout the movie, became the nut-case that he is. All we get is a little history with his boss that reinforces that he likes cars. No other background....at all. Perhaps this is the intent. It did not enthrall me. And the third element was what appeared to me to be an unraveling of the plot toward the end. If Gosling's character was proactive about eliminating threats throughout the movie, why the departure at the end? Because of a promise made earlier? Unlikely. Why would somebody go to such lengths to protect the girl and not make an effort to be with the girl? It just didn't fit.So, what you get in this movie are a few stand-out scenes. You will remember them by the good acting, the excellent action, the brutal blood and gore and one weird scene in a strip club. Unfortunately, those scenes are separated by achingly long stretches where absolutely nothing happens...right up to the very end. Fade to black....",Drive
1301,natecalhoun,Gosling's profile is not a plot device,1,27 February 2012,"Most U.S. movies have a montage at some point, usually about 75% of the way through. They typically function to fast forward the plot towards resolution and they allow directors to try their hands at the music video. They are a lazy tool; but they can be fun, if a director has earned the right to the montage by virtue of previous character development.""Drive"" has at least three montages, one less than twenty minutes into the film and they are all the same--expressionless Gosling in profile, various views from an automobile window, some helicopter shots of L.A. They are moody, twee and powerless.This movie was a torment to watch, with cast members dialing in their performances (Gosling most of all), punctuated with vicious, blood-spattering murders and the odd, tough guy-makes-a-threat scene.The first five minutes promised something this movie did not deliver: interesting, atypical, strategic escape driving; if there'd been a few more scenes of that variety (creative, tense, interesting), I wouldn't have been groaning out loud so often.This is derivative, sentimental in the lamest ways, badly scored, badly filmed and poorly acted.

From the stoic performance of Ryan Gosling to the beautiful direction of Nicolas Winding Refn, I loved it all.Winding Refn clearly worked hard to give this film a very potent 1980's atmosphere with the soundtrack and subtle inclusion of retro cars/wardrobes/etc. At the beginning of the film, I had no clue what the setting was until I saw a modern Chevrolet Impala. I almost got a Grand Theft Auto: Vice City vibe from it which, as a fan of the game, I enjoyed. His techniques in the direction of the film were very new to me and he utilized styles and angles I've never seen before. +1 for innovation.Gosling, Mulligan, Brooks, etc. all give amazing performances and you develop a relationship with all of the characters very quickly, whether good or bad. Although, it is a bit odd seeing Ron Perlman play a hardcore mobster.But keeping it short and sweet, I got a distinct Tarantino-esque feel from Drive with the long, draining pieces of dialogue and short spurts of brutal violence. For this reason, I could understand why people hate the film. It takes a lot out of you and you have to be ready to watch it. That being said, I'm a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino and his style of direction. Winding Refn's style is similar but not quite so don't go into this expecting to see a B-version of Reservoir Dogs or something.All in all, the film is beautiful. I now know why it got a 15-minute round of applause from the Cannes audience. This is a brilliant movie and I could watch it over and over again. It gets a 9/10 from me.",Drive

Where is the driving after the opening scene?? Drive's the name of the movie, isn't it? The movie quickly goes from driving to an alternating sequence of gore and nothing. There are extremely unnecessary violent scenes that I was not at all expecting. And between these scenes is Ryan Goslin staring at a wall. The acting in this movie is no good. Goslin speaks no more than 5 sentences the whole movie, which is supposed to add to his mysterious character, but for me it just created awkward moments in his conversations.The plot is very dry, and the movie is quite slow despite promising beginnings.

The Masterpiece of 2011",9,22 April 2012,"Never wrote a review on IMDb before, but since i have been reading all these negative reviews regarding the so called ""slowness"" or lack of dialog, i felt it was necessary to share my thoughts about, in my eyes, the masterpiece of last year.To begin with, if you haven't seen this title, do yourself a favor and watch it.You definitely have to see it without expecting a ""Fast & the Furious"" fast action fix type of movie. It's the whole vibe of the movie, including the amazing score that will leave you thinking as if you were in another world.And while the casual moviegoer might think of it as a slow film, its the raw emotion (or lack of) of Ryan Goslings' character that makes this movie a masterpiece. The pauses between conversations, scenes where Goslings' character is looking out of a window, zooming in on his shadow, just add to the whole style of the movie.I think its a really hate it or love it affair, once you sat through a viewing you will either be feeling you saw the most immersing, beautiful film in years, or you will think of it as tedious & boring.If you belong to the latter, i have lost all hope in humanity. I seriously think that the people who gave this movie a bad review, are either wishing this movie was directed by Michael Bay, or have no perception of raw emotion.I missed the opportunity to see it in the theaters, and boy do i regret it. The movie was nominated for the Oscar in sound editing, and that was more than deserved. The score was absolutely amazing, and made the movie so much more immersing.And trust me, after you sat through the movie, you will be wanting to buy the soundtrack to immerse yourself back into the dreamy atmosphere that it offered.I saw ""Drive"", with high expectations, and it totally lived up to them.

Someone, somewhere, is laughing it up while innocent film fans waste hours of their lives on what I can only describe as the worst film since Twilight. And trust me; I do not say that lightly.What can possibly be so wrong with this film that you mention it in the same breath as the film that did for cinema what Hitler did for the Jews I hear you ask? I only have 1000 words but I'll try to get most of it in. The direction is pretentious and boring, more suited to a real-time plant growing nature documentary than what is billed as a supposed action film. Overly long shots of people not saying or doing anything robs the film of any chance it may have of developing a modicum of pace within the confines of a truly awful script. And I mean Awful. The sum total of dialogue could be contained on a few scraps of toilet paper and would have probably been put to best use in the same fashion. Acting is so-so, with some good moments from Cranston and Brooks, but by the end of the film I could not fund it in myself to care about a single character; so I can't even be bothered talk about the acting.There are some good moments, the violence scenes are original and excellently done, although I couldn't help but feel as I witnessed a man being stabbed in the eyeball with a fork that it would probably be less painful than what I have just had to sit through.I am normally not this scathing but I thought it was the only way I could get across how diabolical this movie is. Do not be fooled into watching it.PS why didn't I talk about the driving in a film called drive? There is none.

1318,finnanders-344-891601,Original take on the classic action hero movie,9,15 April 2012,"First off I want to say, I love this movie. To me and many other reviewers it's an artsy and fresh take on the classic action hero movie. The pace and atmosphere along with the soundtrack completely sucked me in. I had my doubts about Ryan Gosling, but after seeing the film I can't imagine another actor more befitting the role. The acting and execution of this movie is, in lack of a better word, COOL!I've read a lot of reviews about this movie here on IMDb and people seem to either love it or hate it. And that's OK. People have their likes and dislikes. But what annoys me is when people slag the movie off because it's not what they want it to be. I've read many strange complaints. For example, some reviewers don't like our hero's outfit that stays on him for most of the movie or his behavior/personality. As many other aspects of this movie I think these elements are simply an ode to the classic movie hero, as well as an artistic take that we rarely see in action movies. It also helps mystify our hero. Some complain the plot is too thin. Bet you didn't complain about that after seeing the Fast and the Furious!? I agree, the plot is thin and somewhat diffuse, but as stated above the core of this movie is the classic action flick, and so in many ways it stays true to that style. The plot may appear even thinner as the movie is not as CGI or explosion fueled as most action movies.Many of these negative reviewers could just as well say they hate apples because they don't taste enough like oranges. If you bite into an apple but are expecting and wanting the taste of an orange you'll be disappointed, but don't slag the apple off for not succeeding at imitating an orange. It's simply not an orange. If you can't roll with the unexpected, then don't watch this film. With this movie a lot of people seem to have expected it to be a more standard action movie with clearly defined characters and plot. The first few minutes of the movie can be a little misleading as it appears to be a straight forward action/car chase movie. But to my pleasant surprise it wasn't. The base of this movie is the retro action flick with the unchanging and determined hero at the center, but Danish director Refn has transformed this blueprint into an exciting, gritty, modern, and somewhat ambient package.I appreciate many have never heard of Winding Refn (the director) or seen his movies, but what I can say is don't expect this guy to produce a standard blockbuster (at least not yet), expect something different instead.

Its more of a lame love story that involves a lot of staring and smiling. Be sure to steer clear of this horrendous movie. Because its a complete waste of time.

I really, really enjoyed Drive. The trailer gives you the wrong impression of what you're getting into, but that isn't the movie's fault, it's the marketing team's. After watching it I read a fair amount of the reviews here on IMDb, and on a lot of movies I would just chalk up the negative reviews to personal preference; different strokes for different folks and all. I would say the same about this movie, but don't let the content of the negative reviews here dissuade you. I have never written a review for this site, but I have also never had such strong feelings for the reviews either. Many of the negative reviews criticize the acting, specifically Gosling's, and the plot. Those reviews are correct in the Gosling doesn't say much. Neither did Eastwood in the Man With No Name trilogy. There is much more to acting than dialog, which this movie understands, and excels in. As for the plot, all complaints I've read on this site are dead wrong. There is a key point in the plot that many feel is not explained and that is frequently mentioned in this regard, which I won't spoil, but it most certainly is explained. How people could miss it is beyond me in fact.I absolutely loved this movie, and I will recommend it to anyone who asks. That said though, not everyone is going to like it. It's not an over-the-top action flick, doesn't have flashy special effects or corny action dialog. It has complex human emotion, told not necessarily through word, but through action and expression, facial and bodily.",Drive

Quite a warm music contrasts with brutal and plain existence, where violence is shown realistically to avert the viewer from this side of reality, saying ""do not enter"". He acts strange at times, which puts a question if a hero idea fits into our world. It also seems so, if you think why he helped the man, and how it turned out (do not help, do not be a hero in this cruel world, it won't pay back). The idea with using retro-stylistics at times isn't clear to me, maybe it has something to do with movies of that time. The visual style as well as music was a great experience.

AND had no prior knowledge to the director Nicolas Winding Refn's previous films. Not only that, but they completely missed the point. """"in short: terrible reviewers""Now for my review of the film: Sublimely hypnotizing cinematography freezes the viewers eyes to the movie screen. An experience like no other, Drive throws you into the world of a Hollywood stunt driver that moonlights as a getaway driver only to have you thrown even deeper into his psyche and the relationship he fosters with a seemingly single mother an her little boy. only to have you pulled out of the majesty and thrown into a nightmare when the woman's ex-con husband is released from prison. The ex-husband isn't a bad person, but he got involved with the wrong crowd. Seeing the husband get beaten, the driver gets involved to protect the boy and his mother.

The catchy tunes in the movie sets the mood, it draws you in, then there's the performance by Gosling, explosive & defensive nature, then the moments of calmness.It makes you want to be a silent hero! The people who matter normally say the least, they take action when it's needed with few words. That is Driver. For those who watched and didn't enjoy it, please don't review it. Just let it be.. .or just forget about it completely. Giving this film a negative review is not doing it any justice. It's a film for old souls, not 'transforming' hearts.

Get used to it if you decide to go see this movie based on IMDb's rating...For starters, I first used IMDb over 10 years ago and this, is my first review. Why review this movie? Because I have to tell you There is absolutely no way this movies deserves a 8.4 rating. It's a 6/10 AT BEST; and what you are witnessing here is a giant SCAM, here's why:Directing. It's OK. The visuals are good (6/10), the first car chase is pretty good too and the lift kiss scene is well thought. That's about it, everything else in this movie is sub standard or average at best.Scenario. My criticism will be as creative as the scenario itself: it's uninspired, boring and anyone could have written it. And I really mean it.Empty dialog. It's not like the dialog is poor or badly written, the problem lies in the absence of any dialog ! 30 seconds of blank in just about every scene, it's so bad and boring to the point that I don't even care if the character is dead at the end, I'm just craving for the credits. What an epic fail of a movie ending. It might be the worst movie ending I've EVER seen.Ending. See above.Acting. Ryan's usually great acting doesn't show in this movie at all. It might be contagious as it's the case with most actors here except maybe Ron Perlman who's OK as usual (6/10 again). As much as I understand the novelty behind the toy boy play-Mobil acting, it really doesn't work here. Novelty isn't always good, it certainly isn't here. Ryan's character looks like some quarterback smart ass that's still of the age where pretending to look cool wearing a tight jacket and being a man of few words is enough to BE cool. Doesn't make the cut here Ryan, maybe it'd have worked if I was 12 who knows. It's so bad, sometimes I caught myself regretting the main character doesn't get punched in the face more often, make him swallow the ridiculous Stallone-stolen toothpick.Paperthin characters background. ""He came to my shop 6 years ago out of nowhere"", didn't think of something else mister writer ? No background for the main character with such a long introduction ? seriously, how can you do this to your audience ?Chemistry. No chemistry at all between the two lovers; is there love, sexual attraction or anything at all ? Ex con inviting his wife's lover to the diner table; seriously ? The love story is just as believable as the IMDb score really...Trailer / Value for Money. OK maybe the movie doesn't deserve being sued about that (yeah, it's being sued). But what a misleading trailer ! Call your film ""Drive"", show nice cars, talk about driving and have ONLY ONE DECENT CAR CHASE ? I could go on and on for hours, but I think I covered most things so let me make a positive conclusion: most of the decent things happen in the first 5 minutes, so you can walk away then !! how's that ?As to how the movie got that rating, I don't know.

1339,jordans-tumblr,Strays from the book into perfection.,10,26 July 2012,"Don't make any assumptions here, Drive is not your run-of-the-mill getaway driver action film, and anyone who approaches the film expecting something along those lines will be sorely disappointed.What Drive is, is a masterpiece in cinematography, choice of soundtrack and above all, acting. Anyone who criticises the film's almost total lack of dialogue has missed the point - the driver has no name; he is an outsider. He has nothing to say to the other characters in the film because of Ryan Gosling's immense screen presence. The ability to make a moving story of love and betrayal with hardly any speech should be considered a massive achievement - Carey Mulligan and Ryan Gosling make magic on the silver screen.However, it should not be forgotten that the film strays considerably far from the book it is based on. Hispanic Irina from the book has been abandoned in favour of Caucasian Irene, the non-linear structure of the book has been scrapped in favour of a linear progression, and most noticeably, the driver has been turned into a near mute. Although, one of the most favourable features of the film is that this works on the screen, and after watching the film it just feels right that the driver didn't speak, that time progressed naturally throughout the film.Another thing that many people have had disagreements over in this film are the sudden outbursts of ultra-violence - the cranium stomping incident in the lift, the brutal murder of Blanche in the motel room, and the drowning of Nino in the ocean, but frankly, the film would just become too quiet, too subdued, and could have even started to become boring if these elements had been left out.",Drive

In turn I received no such thrill and spent two dreadful hours enduring the dull emotionless acting of Ryan Gossling.

1346,coryarose,Great thrill ride,8,4 October 2012,"The stereotypical ""White Knight"" appears in many films, but the role of the Driver ranks as one of the most brutal and explosive, while maintaining heroism to date. Drive, directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and released on September 16, 2011 in the United States, is a beautiful art-house film reminiscent of the Tarantino's style in Pulp Fiction. Ryan Gosling gives an explosive performance in a movie that is surprisingly but tastefully minimalist.The film stars Ryan Gosling as the Driver, an unnamed professional driver who holds jobs as mechanic and stunt driver during the day, and has a secret identity as a getaway driver. The Driver meets a girl, Irene (Carey Mulligan), in his apartment elevator and falls in love with her, even though she is married and her husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac), is in jail. After the two have bonded and everything seems to be going well, Standard returns from jail with a debt to pay, which jeopardizes the safety of the girl and her son. The Driver decides to help Standard repay his debt and keep Irene and her son safe by driving for a heist being pulled by Standard as repayment.The cinematography is one of the main factors why the film is so successful. Refn took great care to create an amazingly real experience. During the tensest parts of the film, where a Hollywood movie would have used music to create suspense, Refn relies on the uncomfortable silence (successfully) to create tension. The film is set in gritty Los Angeles and has intertextual references to Walter Hill's The Driver through similar plots, setting in downtown Los Angeles, and mainly silent protagonists.Drive is a great thrill ride that is truly beautiful, and adds a real, believable atmosphere to the world in which it is set. This brutal but tasteful film will be enjoyably experienced by many.",Drive

The problem with this movie is that while the driving, the footage and a superstar in the driving seat, is all well and good (for those who enjoy it) but there is practically no dialogue what-so-ever. Ryan Gosling comes off as this quiet vigilante/bad boy who (from what I saw in another review) is described as a Clint Eastwood character in his early western features.

1349,bilavideobill,A Cult Classic for Good Reason,10,7 July 2018,"Drive is one of those movies where, if you know the characters, you know the outcome - not because it's predicable, but because it's Biblical. It's a study in character, cause and effect.The Driver (Ryan Gosling) is a quiet loner, in the apartment down the hall. He doesn't say much (not even his real name). Maybe that's because still waters run deep. Maybe it's because he's living two lives - one as a Hollywood stunt driver and one as a getaway driver for jobs handed to him by Shannon (Bryan Cranston), who works for Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks). Next to his brother, Nino (Ron Perlman), Bernie is practically civilized for a gangster. Then again, if he were everything he seems to be, he wouldn't be a gangster.You know that phrase, ""Get a life?"" The Driver gets one when he notices pretty neighbor and single mom, Irene (Carey Mulligan). She's quiet, too, and lonely, what with her husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac) stuck in prison. There's a quiet chemistry between these two that could slice through butter, reminding me of how nice it is when movie people don't tell you everything that's going through their mind every second they're on screen. There's a sense that if you let it, these three would find a way to fill the gaps in their lives.But then Standard gets out of prison, and the dominoes start falling, not necessarily in the directions you expected but with the logic and fatality of a Presbyterian sermon. What's great about this film is that everybody does what they're inclined to do, for reasons that are compelling to who they are and what they want - in the face of what you might predict looking down upon the maze of their lives. They don't see the maze, just the path before them. Each character is firmly committed to it. My mom used to say, ""We can't win for losing."" Maybe there's a reason for that.I love this movie. The performances in it are first rate. There isn't a bad scene. My only regret is that I can't go back in time and see it again for the ""first"" time. It holds up really well. It's one of those movies where, if you catch it on cable, you stop what you're doing. ""I just want to watch this scene."" If you're not careful, you'll end up watching the rest of the movie because it's compelling. And maybe that's what's so compelling about this film. Yes, we get the pun. ""Drive"" is about a driver, who drives by day and drives by night. We all have our inner and outer drives. But every character in this film is animated by a hidden drive - whether it's to make money, please others, have a normal life, live in peace or be, as the song says, ""a real human being, and a real hero.""Film fans will recognize the similarities between this film and the James Caan classic, ""Thief."" There's an early scene, involving a watch, where you think this is going to be Jason Statham in The Transporter, with a virtuoso driver who lives by a Caan-like personal code. But to its credit, Gosling's character is less governed by his head than his heart. This is not a movie about people who think, let alone think it all through before they act. It's a film about people who feel, whether they're acting on fear, lust, anger or love.",Drive
1350,jfcieslak,This is the continuation of the best that action and noir had to offer.,9,8 November 2012,"What I cannot stand about recent developments in American cinema (whatever genre be it really), are primarily two things. 1. The terrible intellectual laziness, insensitivity, and lack of original vision, which result in copy- pasting attitude. Music, dialogs, acting, casting, shots - all of it are just plaster casts, and all directors and writers seem to have turned into laborers, filling the 'successful film' prescriptions. 2. The ""rub it in your face till you understand"" attitude, when it comes to laying out the plot. There can be nothing left unsaid, all jokes explained, all mysteries resolved, all romance explicit, to the point of nausea. Of course there are great exceptions, like Cohens, but even more ambitious films, or those branded as, you know, 'avantgarde' seem to be placid and based on cheap in your face effects (vide ''Black Swan""). Drive comes to the rescue. And it comes in big style. It taps right into the core of what once was great about American movies, movies like Duel, Vanishing Point, like Killing of a Chinese Bookie, hell, even like Charles Bronson films. It has vision, it is nuanced, it is stylish, and it contains that special something, the electrifying atmosphere of mystery, darkness, which all crime/noir films must have to deserve their name. I was concerned at first, because a criminal who falls in love and escapes the bad guys is a recipe for banal, teary plot, but it was just all played out with masterful skill and balance. And finally, what a relief! I was spared the irritating details of all those unnecessary cookie-cutter scenes, especially on the romance side. A Man meets Woman? A take of him standing, a take of her, next to her broken car, he approaches, cut. Period. You know the rest, and you don't need to have it explained any more. This film is a gem. And I would say it is the essence of true and great American cinema... if not for the fact that the director is Danish and main character is Canadian. They both could teach the other guys a lesson. I was tempted to give a 10. But let's just leave that score for that one movie which never will be made.",Drive

WHO THE HELL RATED THIS MOVIE SO HIGH?! The only way you would like this film is if you were off your on drugs.The script is written really badly, The main actor mumbles all the time.There is almost no background noise for most the film.It plays ambient movie really out of place for no reason.He tries to go on a date with a married woman when he find out the husband is in jail.And there are some dumb mobsters.Someone magically acquired 1million dollars and they went to steal it.The mobsters don't know how to use guns and a skinny guy with no martial arts skill beats them all up.If you like good films, Don't waste your time on this just watch transporter because this is pretty much just a rubbish rip off of that.",Drive
1352,Bentbins,Ferociously self-indulgent,3,28 November 2012,"Slow, slow slow! And I'm not talking in comparison to the over-cut rapid- fire action movies that are so prevalent these days. I'm talking about a relatively weak story that is masquerading as an art-house film. Walter Murch, who wrote In the Blink of an Eye, would probably be turning in his grave at the editing. The editing (and many of the shots) are far too long, for no reason, as far as I could tell.Self-indulgent to the point where I feel I want my money back. I'm told that I haven't written enough lines. How long does it tell to comment that the film is second rate? An example of a self-indulgent shot? Well, I couldn't give any without spoiling and I don't want to do that. But when you are watching the film, count how many seconds before the next cut. And, compare it with Murch's dictum that the cuts should mimic the natural blinking of your eye as you blink and effectively create a new scene in your head. You will be blinking a lot more than the editor has cut, even in the slow scenes that are presumably trying to engage our emotions.",Drive

The special effects were OK- but the film was alternately draggy and super violent-not much else in between.I wondered if it had been written by a teenage girl.The music was good-but I felt that the director was trying to copy David Lynch films-that ""heavenly"" music during scenes of goodness and closeness. I was so bored!I saw the film through to the end hoping it would redeem itself but it only came up with an ending that didn't make sense and removed the lead character further from reality.",Drive
1354,spamporch,Not a movie for car guys.,5,30 December 2012,"Now that I live near a Redbox, I can rent movies for a day and play them on my computer. (I have a DVD player and receiver, I just don't have a TV. Bigger priorities.) One of the movies I picked up tonight was called Drive, starring Ryan Gosling.Yeah, yeah, I know: I laughed as I clicked the ""check out"" button, wondering how straight-laced pretty boy Ryan Gosling was going to do in this movie. And truth be told, he wasn't the biggest detractor.The very first scene, when the very first musical score started playing, I laughed. Somehow, someone wrangled up all of the old people who created the worst movies the 80s had to offer, and involved them in making this flick. It became the common theme throughout the film, and I'm really surprised I didn't see the women wearing leg warmers and side ponytails. And I don't mean to say the actors & actresses were doing a poor job. I'm talking about the score, the production, the direction. Even the font chosen for the credits. Or maybe it's like a bunch of 24-year-old kids watched Molly Ringwald movies back to back with car chase classics like Two-Lane Blacktop and the original Gone in Sixty Seconds, and then decided they could make a movie with the best of those worlds.Except, those worlds are in completely separate universes.One of the points the director tries to make is that Gosling's character doesn't say much, but when he does, it's important. Other actors can pull that off; Steve McQueen comes to mind. Quiet, reserved, but still tough as nails. But the pauses are way, way, way too drawn out. I've seen enough movies (and lived in real life long enough) to know when you pause for effect and impression, and they doubled, sometimes tripled that amount. But that doesn't mean the audience's impression is doubled or tripled - long pauses become uncomfortable or hilarious, depending on the scene at hand. I don't know if that was a director's choice, or they were trying to make a 40-minute movie take up enough time to actually be put in a theater.The girl is cute, the supporting actors are believable enough. But putting a bunch of decent actors together does not make a good movie. (Example: 1991's Nothing But Trouble.) Even baby-faced Gosling doesn't do too horribly (although it wouldn't kill his character to show some facial expression once in awhile. He's like the male version of that Twilight chick in this movie). The only time he shows emotion is exactly when he shouldn't: When his girlfriend's husband gets shot, A. what is he even doing out of the car, and B. what were you expecting, you child? You've been using his wife as eye candy for a month, you met him 3 days ago, and him getting shot while you help him rob a pawn shop in The Valley caught you off guard? Really. Even the car chase scenes are horrible, and I've seen enough to know. I won't even get into the glaring continuity errors, I'll just say that weaving some cars back and forth on a road with different camera angles does not make a chase scene. (Well, maybe in a 24-year-old's mind it does.) Slim Jims don't work on modern cars, pretty sure you have no idea what you're doing to that carburetor, and who picked your crummy ride, the '73 Malibu? You couldn't have drove that Road Runner in the shop? Are you serious? Note to Hollywood: It would be cool if car chase movies actually had gear heads for consultants.There's no sex but a serious amount of gore. Jason Voorhees would nod approvingly and Hannibal Lecter should bring some vintage chianti to this bloodbath. It's actually one of the more impressive parts of this movie. Sure beats out the inane love triangle plot dreamt up by a 14-year-old girl.I give it 4.5/10, would rent again, maybe in a year or two.",Drive

The story is easy and predictable, characters are shallow, conversations non existent.. Did I mention, it looks good? I forgot to mention that the car scenes, which make the core of the protagonist's character, are boring and repetitive. In conclusion one could say that this movie is like a remake of a bad, but then really bad without nostalgia bad, 80's movie.

1357,acerostas,Dreadfully bad movie,1,20 January 2013,I would like to start out that I do not normally write reviews on movies but I was forced to watch this movie due to its hype and good reviews and others shouldn't have to share the same fate. The best thing about this movie is its cinematic damn near perfect. The Music sounded fine but if you actually listen to the lyrics you will realize its repetitive and distracting. My biggest problems with this movie is that it has no basis on reality with the fact that the main characters 'acting' a close second!SPOILER!!Spoiler from here on out!Pointing out a few scenes that made no sense. First am I the only person that the strippers at the strip joint made no attempt to even act during this scene they all just looked on blankly and carelessly as he threatens the guy. the elevator scene was Terrible random kiss giving the guy a perfect chance to kill them witch ruined all the shock value of the gore scene that came after leaving me thinking how utterly stupid the whole scene was. Using a mattress as cover during the motel scene was completely dumb. Many points of the movie I actually laughed at even when they are trying to be serious. The terribly written action scenes I can normally overlook but the acting and the nonexistent character development destroyed this movie. The acting or lack there of is what most normal people should notice right away with dialog replaced with stares and awkward silences. Based on the character we can safely assume he was locked in the basement most of his life and just doesn't have anything useful to contribute verbally. The fact that his best time in his life was his small talk with the wife and kid was the best time in his life further supports my basement theory. The director tried to portray a sense of stoicism what we got was very awkward silences and stares that not only made the characters look uncomfortable but the audience as well. If a person like this acted this way in real life it can only be described as creepy but he is immediately accepted and the supporting cast are quick to share all of their problems with him without him saying a word. If you ignore the implausible way he got accepted by this family and just went with it the way he selflessly wants to help them is really touching if you also ignore the random kiss later on in the movie that voids all acts of altruism. If you are a person that likes to delude yourself by placing meaning and substance where it is absent as well as take giant leaps in logic this is the movie for you otherwise avoid this movie at all costs. This movie certainly is different than the crap a Michael Bays will throw at you but just because this movie avoids all main stream ways to make a bad movie doesn't mean it didn't find its own unique way to be a terrible movie. I rate this 1 out 10 it gets a single point for cinematic and no points for failing at everything else and the music wasn't good enough to award a point.,Drive

1359,saavy87,A girls perspective: Pretty Good,7,6 February 2013,"I enjoyed the movie overall. I DID NOT enjoy all the extreme goriness. It seemed unnecessary; the audience can get the picture without all the gruesomeness. Some people have said that the lack of dialog between the Driver and his love interest is a negative thing, but to be honest I loved their interactions. The sexual tension between them was very obvious and really sweet, *spoiler* and then once you find out she is married and still cares for her husband you can understand some of her silence- she was obviously trying to control herself and not get too wrapped up in him even though she was having a hard time denying the way she felt with him. I loved their scenes! I also loved the cinematography. I can't get enough of sun flares and late afternoon sunlight. This movie was FULL of it. It also showed some really great views of LA. The Driver totally had a Clint Eastwood or old time hero feel- kinda like a more violent and tormented Jeremiah Johnson. In a strange way the Driver's character made sense to me and as a viewer I liked him almost immediately. What didn't really make sense to me was the ending. I hated it! *spoiler* Did they end up together or not?! I thought him killing the last guy and leaving the money would have taken care of everything and cleared the way for him to go back to the girl. I hate it when a film leaves the audience with not enough closure! Frustrating. Overall pretty good movie- riveting, haunting, beautiful filmed, too violent!, mediocre ending.",Drive

But if you know the director of this movie at least one bit, you will know that this isn't your average crowd pleasing blockbuster, but a more thoughtful and meaningful film about the human condition and how to rise above it, and become superhuman. This in fact is the best Punisher film that isn't named Punisher, and best superhero movie in a long time, if you would like to define it as such, because this movie doesn't really have a genre. It is an action movie, a thriller, a pyschological movie, a horror movie and so on and so on. It simply evades classification and is it's own thing entirely, so it is just mine opinion that it is a sort of a superhero movie, but it isn't really that original. The movie feels a lot like Taxi Driver, or Thief, and it certainly feels it's influences on it's sleeve, which isn't necesseraly a bad thing, but it's still worth pointing out. The Atmosphere that Refn crafts is dense and full of emotion, every scene, like a vacum, sucks you into the universe, and you become a part of the world, eventually all characters start to feel like real people and especially the driver. You can exacly understand whats going on in his head even when he is silent,abd he is silent most of the time. Ryan Gosling gave such a wondwrful performance in this film and the character is so damn likeable that you can't help being invested the story. He is a guy who seemingly doesn't have any family or friends, whose silence is louder than words and whose evolution from a robot to a human bean and eventually to a hero is really exhilirating to watch.",Drive

I have enjoyed 'Drive' several times throughout the last 2 years and have decided belatedly to write my findings for you equally sceptical, over analytical cynicists out there. Unashamedly I initially expected a film about a dubious hero who can drive good and gets into some serious excrement that he has to try and find a way out of. I am straight, so the prospect of Goslings semi naked anatomy was neither here nor there to me. However, there appeared to be a romantic element in the DVD synopsis, It was getting late, I wanted to get drunk and decided it may be a good mix of action/ romance that the wife would pay attention to and divert her icey scrutiny away from yours truly for a few hours. I knew Bryan Cranston held a key role (much admired) so I drank lots and braced myself for the lovey-dovey-weepy-sniffy-yawny-snory abomination that some of IMDb's original reviewers had led me to believe beforehand....I am not going to dwell on scene after scene nor will I be spoiling the plot but the opening of this movie was attention grabbing. Gosling picks up his kit and exits the motel room, mission in mind, and then something really unexpected happened...Electropop dynamic Kavinsky's 'Nightcall' kicks-in with 80's hot-pink titles and from there the movie was fascinating, carving out a niche genre of film making which surprised the hell out of me.If your going to simplify most movies as previous reviewers have then you can probably sum the plot and storyline of most movies up in a few well-considered words and I suppose 'Drive' is no exception. However, what is the exception are the patient moments where nothing much is happening but at the same time you are a slave to the screen and captivated with both beautiful & atmospheric intensity coupled with a soundtrack which would never usually tickle my tastebuds but added a sublime haunt during some scenes,keeping me transfixed throughout.I consider to be a wonderful story of love, benevolence and obscurity.

Ryan Gosling doesn't only play the ""Driver"". He is the ""Driver"". But also the other actors in supporting roles like Carey Mulligan, Ron Perlman, Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks play very well.

This film had the potential to be a lean, mean machine, but the director opted for some sort of Euro vibe instead, with lots of long, mood-setting sequences, several of them involving drives where no one speaks. The result was a slow-paced film that failed to build much tension most of the time and, in my view, didn't succeed as a thriller.Nevertheless, the performances were very good, especially the senior criminals, who humanized their ilk the way that Clint Eastwood humanized the characters in Westerns in The Unforgiven.

1371,oconnor-rile,Drive,7,24 September 2013,"Nicolas Winding Refn creates an engrossing crime-drama based in Echo Park, Los Angeles that makes you rethink how an action based movie should be made. The location of the movie plays a big part in understanding what is going on. Echo Park in Los Angeles is a two and a half mile area that is one of the most crime-stricken and densely populated areas in LA. Refn creates characters that develop throughout the movie into people we can all relate to. Drive manages to isolate itself from other movies through the acting of Ryan Gosling, the plot of the movie itself, and the screen writing of Refn.Ryan Gosling never was given a name and barely said more than a couple words at a time, which played very well into the character he was portraying in the movie. Gosling's character was a professional stunt driver for movies and ran a side business of a get-away driver for criminals. The driver was soft-spoken to say the least, an example of this is when Gosling goes on a date with his neighbor, Irene. The date consists of very few words but the audience can feel the emotional tension between the two actors. Even though Gosling is soft-spoken he still manages to get his point across, this is prevalent in the scene where Irene's husband Standard Gabriel gets beat up by mobsters who Standard owed money too. Gosling finds out about this and gets straight to the point by demanding Standard to tell him who beat him up and why.The plot of the movie plays itself out throughout the whole movie and keeps you guessing what is going to happen next. Although it comes off as a typical, run and gun, save the girl action movie it is much deeper than that through the use of different movie-making techniques. The director Nicolas Winding Refn keeps the audience on their feet by introducing new characters such as Irene's husband Standard Gabriel who had been in prison, tying old characters from the beginning of the movie back in at the end, and creating twists right up to the end.Nicolas Refn did an incredible job with the screen writing, every single character in the movie is very easy to relate to and the setting plays along with the characters. This plays into the plot of the movie revolving around crime. Refn created a fantastic character in the driver which is played by Ryan Gosling who plays the role perfectly and makes the character even better. He also created a very relatable plot through the relationship between the driver and Irene, the screen writing was very relatable also and the two complimented each other very well. In the final scene where Gosling leaves the money, he finds himself driving along an open road with a stab wound. Even with the stab wound the driver seems to be in no pain, he is just enjoying himself driving, and waiting for the next step in his life.",Drive

1373,vincentlewtas,the dynamic of Nicholas Winding Refn's distinctive auteur style and Ryan Goslings chilling intensity make Drive one of the best films I've ever seen.,10,7 October 2013,"Drive is one of the very few films that I can actually watch repeatedly without getting bored. Even though some people complain that the film is ""too slow"", I'd go ahead and say that there's a haunting calmness about it which I find compelling to watch. The film focuses on 'The Driver' - a very quiet and lonely man who isn't blessed with much of a back story (or even a name for that matter). However, he's a kick-ass stunt driver, and a phenomenal getaway driver, providing a service for organised crime. Eventually, his life is severely disrupted after the beautiful Irene's (Carey Mulligan) ex-con husband embarks on a disastrous endeavour, which sees The Driver, and the few people he loves and cares about plunged into danger. Nicholas Winding Refn's auteur style is very prominent in this movie, which seems to have improved/developed more since 2008's 'Bronson'. One big improvement was Drive's retro soundtrack, which complements the film beautifully. The Driver is a bit of a cult hero, and a 'real human being' (watch the film for the reference), with his own super-heroic symbol in the form of an iconic gold scorpion. Better still, Ryan Gosling portrays 'The Driver' with so much passion and intensity that you are genuinely shocked and intimidated by his actions, leaving you fearing what his next move might be. A word of advice would be to keep him away from hammers. The vivid visual style, slow, intense pace, amazing performances and strong, gripping story-line all collectively make this film the absolutely superb film that I regard it to be. 10/10",Drive

He would almost steal the show if it were not for such an awesome supporting cast. Ron Perlman, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Carey Mulligan and Bryan Cranston are truly electrifying. At no point did the film feel slow for me. It was beautifully shot, rich in symbolism, contained fantastic dialogue,a booming soundtrack,it was very entertaining and the pacing was spot on. Of course those looking for a movie along the lines of Fast and Furious will find nothing here.(There are only two or so car chases in the film)Likewise if you're one who strongly detests violence or cringes at it in films, this may not be the film for you as the second half of the film gets very dark and very gruesome, very quickly. SPOILER: Ie: One scene involves a man getting stabbed in the eye with a fork. Yet if you are somebody who sees more than just entertainment in films, or someone who may have passed it off initially or is unsure about it I urge you all to see it.

I just love everything about the movie, the camera angles, the music(in the right moments)some of the effects and the acting isn't half bad either(Cranston,Brooks). At first, I thought Gosling's ""Driver"" character was boring with the lack of dialogue going on but the more I watched the movie the more I appreciated and ultimately understood his role.

1379,seanphitz,A new direction for noir titles.,9,5 December 2013,"Went into this film blind, no self-spoiling on wikipedia, never seen a Gosling film, much less a Winding-Refn film, but merely choose Drive out of my Netflix suggested category by cover alone. And VERY happy i did. Gosling gives an amazing performance as the unnamed 'Driver', sometimes referenced to as simply the 'Kid'. Driver is cool, James Dean cool, rarely emoting and only reacting when he needs to protect someone. Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman are equally excellent, fueling each others outbursts as Jewish mobsters. Bryan Cranston has a smaller, but no less pivotal, role as Shannon, Driver's boss and only accomplice in crime with a gimp leg received as payment for debts accrued in bad deals made with Brooks & Perlman. I classify the film in the noir category (some may say neo-noir) because of the beautifully shot scenes of neon-lit L.A., drenched in shadows and swimming in blood, but not too much, only when least expected. The only reason Drive doesn't get a 10/10 in my review is the somewhat sluggish character development, and because I believed Carey Mulligan's part could have been better cast.",Drive
1380,jkm77ca,Tedious time consuming overly artsy crap!,1,16 February 2012,Where do I start? Let me see.... a movie that could have been shot in under an hour if the characters hadn't taken so long to say their lines instead of vapidly staring off into space or the needless shots of said characters posing for effect. This film disappoints on so many levels that I can't begin to describe them all. The art house fairies on here loved it of course because if it seems haunting and beautiful well that mirrors their own sad lonely existence. I saw this movie based on many reviews saying how amazing and must see it was and I should know better having fallen for this ploy before. Do yourself a favour and save your hard earned money for a worthy film such as Warrior. You can take that one to the bank. Please avoid Drive at all costs!,Drive
1381,radiohead654,Goes nowhere,4,13 July 2014,"I've read a lot of reviews about this movie, so I was really hyped before watching it. And I have to say, it didn't meet my expectations at all.I'll start with the main character. We didn't get to know the driver's character at all, because he barely spoke. He had no personality, and he mostly came off as bland and emotionless. I doubt anyone found him relatable at all.Not a lot happened in the movie itself. It felt like he was going nowhere, and when things did happen, it wasn't very exciting. It was unnecessarily long, and the ending lacked that 'punch' that good movie endings have. I hate using the word 'boring' to describe movies, but, well, it was pretty boring.I did like the directing and cinematography. The best thing about the movie is the atmosphere. Drive, visually, is beautiful. But the soundtrack felt cheesy and out of place, like out of an old TV movie. Maybe I completely missed the point. I always liked straight forwards movies better than artsy and vague ones. Just watch 'The Place Behind the Pines' instead.",Drive
1382,Repconn,"Subpar pacing, still great",7,15 December 2013,"Seeing the trailer and plot of the film, I was really surprised with the kind of movie it turned out to be. From the looks of it, I expected a run-off-the-mill heist movie. But ""Drive"" is much more, it is a crime drama, a Tarantino-style pop-culture reference and overall a good movie. But to me, it fails to be one thing: well paced.After a very interesting opening that introduces Ryan Gosling's ""driver"" and his skills, the movie starts to slog through about an hour of exposition, which (don't get me wrong) isn't necessarily bad, but a bit overlong, taking away time from the slightly rushed finale. What really bored me at times was the lack of dialog. I know that the Driver was intended to be ""a character that mostly communicates non-verbally"", but it seemed to me that he doesn't communicate at all. Most appearances of Gosling's character along with Carey Mulligan's Irene are more awkward than romantic or interesting.This is neither Gosling's or Mulligan's fault, who on the contrary did an amazing job. This too can be said for most actors in this movie, especially Bryan Cranston. Most characters are well written and equally well performed.But after the slow start ""Drive"" finally gets to business and shows its true strengths. The remainder of the movie is visually great, the story unfolds and twists nicely and Ryan Gosling gets to show his acting skills. Without wanting to give too much away, the big finale is disappointingly obscure compared to the graphic nature of the film before. But the film ends with a very memorable scene, marking its spot as one of the most interesting films of 2011.""Drive"" may be too subtle for many fans of normal action movies; marketing it as a heist movie certainly didn't help. But anyone who considers him- or herself a movie enthusiast should definitely check out this little gem at least once.

It ends nowhere and you don't understand why it began in the first place. Very pretentious, some obvious and pathetic attempts at copying the style of other directors into a tasteless mishmash. Shallow plot, if there is any intended, and dull screenplay which actually matches the whole idiocy. Really - zero happening on top of a stupid action story.Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan stand up to their talents and act well, but that doesn't really help the movie. Matter of fact, it is quite bewildering to see two such actors starring in such a sheer nonsense. Doesn't really do them any justice.

1384,proof-films,A Waste of TIme.,2,21 January 2014,"When it comes to film making, I'm all for innovation, and new trends to create a masterpiece or just a good piece of work! Drive is an attempt which tragically fails on all ends. This film is just wrong on everything! The Character development is a piece of crap! Well there is none. Our protagonist, if you can call him that, had an undeveloped characterization which is used as an excuse for him being mysterious. I'm all for mystery, but not in a movie titled ""Drive{ which opens with a car chase and robbery. The main character's emotions were all over the place? Maybe he was psychotic, but usually in a movie you can tell if someone is a psychotic character or not. The characterization contradicts himself by being compassionate at certain times. Is that a socio-path? Maybe. But not quite like any I've ever seen in a film!The development of this character is all over the place and I don't know if any one who viewed it received a clear cut answer on what type of guy the ""Driver"" is. The next issue I had with the movie is the script. Now given, some films don't have a solid plot, but those films are usually followed up with pretty strong characterizations, point of views, and action which this film lacked at necessary times to be what I considered a good film. Certain scenes drag out too long not adding to the story of the film. We don't find out what this movie is about until after 45 minutes into it. That's too long to hook you audience. So in my opinion, this film lacked a strong plot, and strong character's. There was no sense or realism associated with the time period as well! Bad Acting! The acting was shitty! It just wasn't good. Which I'm not saying the actors in the film can't act, I feel that the poorly developed characters led to no real dramatic performances or excitement, which is another contradiction because the film starts off as if it is going to be and action film and gets very melancholy and dramatic.The Title of the film is misleading! There was not enough driving in this damn film to be called Drive!. It should've been called "" Road to Nowhere"" or some crap like that! I believe the Director was trying to create a new type of film making, and it just failed! The emotion was all of a certain points in the film!Also how the hell is a Chrylser 400 supposed to keep up with a mustang 5.0! A major contradiction in this film! It just sucked! I gave it 2 stars because the cinematography was good!This film made me very angry! I saw it for free! Thank goodness I don't go the movies anymore!

1385,dlnkfd-kcono,Extreme Violence- Mysterious guy crushes head completely caved in with his foot.,1,24 January 2014,"This film is just an excuse to show extreme violence, and promote a satanic agenda. Watch the fall of society as we know it with images you wont forget, like the above scene in an elevator- nice, graphic.Nicolas Winding Refn will pay a price for the damage to the world, and the satanic violence he has thus brought to into peoples lives.The 'Mysterious Guy' ( Ryan Gosling's) foot is actually shown caving the guys head in like an egg, where at that point, the victim begged for mercy. Not satanic? that's naive.Movies like this one, create a mental infection.This mental Infection manifests in the human personality as deranged and destructive behavior, drug-taking, abominable cruelty and depravity, gangster operations, and sexual excesses.Thus has a vicious circle of malignancy and perversions of thought and activities been created by entertainment and media magnates. The purpose – to capture egocentric public vested interest.This type of film has become the new Bible of human behavior.Personal tragedies unknown to human kind a century ago, have become rife and people live in fear of walking the streets. Households are barricaded behind high walls. Family and social problems are taken into regular public debate – and so the saga of human misery is perpetuated.We create our world, and the more we use our imagination, and fill our minds with violence, the more we create in the physical world.This is the BEAST stalking our lands and feeding a miasma of beastliness into innocent minds.",Drive
1386,breno-cadastro,First time i strongly disagree with IMDb Score...just not a good movie,3,4 February 2014,"I just created my account to post about this movie...Altought the first action scene (which is 5-10 min long, I don't know) is pretty good, in the next 30 minutes of the movie nothing much happens.The movie could have 1 hour total easily...so it's slow and boring.About the driving...well, there isn't much, at least real action car scenes. He drives a lot, but at 50 mph from nowhere to no place. And the ones that are action scenes, i didn't think the editing was good at all, the cameras and stuff. It don't get you excited.I'll say that Gosling plays the part very well, but the problem is with the carachter...nobody knows what's his past, why is he that way OR what the hell he is thinking.I'm a guy, and I'm not gay, therefore Gosling doesn't add up to the movie himself, and the chick is pretty weak - i didn't like her at Wall Street 2 as well..I'll say that the only good part of the movie is the one with the hookers on the back and there was some tits hanging around.

1388,angus-silvie-939-506861,Drive away from this one,1,4 March 2014,"After I have watched a film I usually have a guess at what the IMDb rating is before logging on, and, taking into account that every film has people who love it and people who despise it, my guesses are usually pretty accurate, often spot on. Drive is the first film where I was way out: I predicted a generous 5.4 and was astonished to see 7.9! It does seem that many people have mistaken long dull scenes where nothing happens (eg a car drives along a road in a town with little traffic, we see the windscreen view of it driving along, crossing some traffic lights, then carrying on down the road, then driving along for a bit more, all in silence, then after a while we suddenly cut to the next scene) for art-house creativity. I would call it 'let-down' filming: you watch the scene because you assume a bad-guy car is going to come racing out of a sidestreet and launch into a chase so you are a little on edge, but nothing happens so you just think 'eh? what was the point of that?'.Now, the acting. Albert Brooks was good, Bryan Cranston did the best he could with the material, but the rest of them.... I am sure Ryan Gosling is usually a fine actor but here he had two facial expressions: Blank Stare and Slow Annoying Grin. But worse than all of that was what all the other negative reviews have mentioned: the silence.If someone asks you a question, in real life the human race generally gets along by giving some sort of answer, even if it is a mumble. If you walk into your place of employment and your boss and friend who has given you a job for the last 6 years sees you and says ""How yer doin', kid?' I would expect you to reply 'fine thanks', or something similar. Here though, our man says nothing. So the boss rambles on, hands him the keys to a car, tells him about the car etc etc, while our man takes the keys and gets in, continuing to say nothing. Is that even remotely realistic? Apart from anything else it is just rude.And so it goes on, all through the film. Questions answered with a stare. Some questions rewarded with a short comment, but only after a long silence during which a slow look at the floor then back up again is all the viewer can enjoy. Everyone seems to accept this behaviour as normal and just go on to ask another question or smile quizzically back but in the real world someone would have punched his lights out long ago. He was driving me mad, I actually found myself shouting ""Say something, dammit!"" at the screen, in a vain attempt to move things along a bit.Talking of driving, there wasn't much of it in the film despite the title. The violence was contrived to make it more shocking than it needed to be, Ron Perlman's character swore uncontrollably for no reason other than make him sound like the Big Gangster even though there are far more effective ways of getting this across, and the whole plot just seemed unlikely. Yes, I know it is fiction so sometimes you must suspend belief but you have to be able to connect with what you are watching and in this case I couldn't. For example, a man watches another man drive unremarkably around a circuit for a while and this convinces him to invest $300,000 in the man to race cars? The same man decides that the best way to kill a petty crook who hasn't done him any harm is not to use a knife, but first select the fork to inflict some light torture, then go back for the knife? Our driver puts his foot down in a 300bhp car but all the cars around it seem to continue to be going at the same speed; at the end he leaves all the money behind, he is also impervious to a serious and deep stab wound.... and so on. It all seemed a bit weak in the 'believability' department.When another reviewer said they should have put an 'l' at the end of the title they weren't far wrong. To all those who think this is a wonderful film, count up the number of people like me who don't normally write reviews but felt compelled to do so in order to give it one star, we can't all be philistines who don't appreciate a good film when we see one. There are better films out there, there really are.",Drive
1389,MonsieurBison,-Cinema fantastic-,10,14 August 2011,"A truly beautiful and hypnotic film.I've seen the last few Nicholas Winding Refn films, and while I liked both Bronson and Valhalla Rising a lot, they were both ""difficult"" films, in that both structure, pacing and tone were bound to alienate some people, and of course they were both marketed as somewhat mainstream films while being anything but.Part of the irony of Refn's situation is that he makes films about ""Primal"" man- and these protagonists invariably commit acts of great violence on those around them. This violence puts his films into the genre categories that Hollywood recognises and promotes to the public, resulting in trailers for Refn movies that grossly misrepresent the sophistication of the actual film. In that way, Valhalla's intense, slow-burning and almost dialogue-free mythic exploration of our savage past can be repackaged as a ""Vlad the Viking goes to the New World"" action movie.Yet both Valhalla and Bronson were highly ""directed"" films, revealing a very strong hand in control of the material. And so, I was extremely curious to see what Refn would do with the material, and whether he would be able to rein in his sometimes obtrusive style in order to allow the story more room to breathe... I shouldn't have worried. I think the director has managed to balance a genuine artistry with the demands of the genre in a way that is rarely, if ever, achieved. I absolutely loved it. Just stay the hell away from the trailer, as it reveals far too much, and again, misrepresents the film's true ""feel"".Driver has a tone of wry amusement at everything around it, much like Gosling's half-smirk, pivoted on the toothpick perpetually in the corner of his mouth. Schmucky gangsters and mob clichés provide some laughs, but the heart of the film is Gosling's portrayal of the unnamed? main character and his sweet, underplayed romance with Mulligan and her young son. While an ethereal synthesizer-pop soundtrack provides an at-times tender,at-times mythic undercurrent, the car chases and action scenes, when they come, are tense, brutal and brief- far more Eastern Promises than The Transporter. Mulligan plays her character all trembly, wet-eyed, sweet and innocent and is swept away by Gosling's quiet strength and self-assured charm, while Gosling speaks little and remains a mystery to the end, though we never doubt his fundamentally good nature. The seasoned supporting cast are all very fun, except maybe for Kendricks who is relegated to a fairly irrelevant part. Of course, this is really Gosling's film, and he inhabits the character completely, turning what could be a straightforward Hollyood tough-guy role into a complex and contradictory character, self-confident and physical, yet clearly lonely and possessed with a certain peculiarity and stillness, almost reminiscent of De Niro's Travis Bickle.Visually the film is lush and gorgeous. Like Michael Mann, Refn and his cinematographer are able to instill LA with a sense of life and character that most directors just fail to do. Unlike Mann however, Refn opts for warm orange tones over Mann's hard blues, and in one particularly beautiful sequence the familiar LA cliché of driving down the dry LA river is taken to an unexpectedly joyful conclusion. Despite its absolute craftsmanship, Driver is probably not for everybody, which makes me sad. People who prefer bald-headed muscle men slugging and wise-cracking their way into their wallets should of course stay away, as this bears very little resemblance to the standard Hollywood fare associated with the genre, and they might well be disappointed.But for me, Driver was sweet, surreal, mythic, tense, fun, hilarious, revolting, and surprising. See it because it will make you a better person.And so, 10 out of 10, because it deserves it.",Drive

1394,harry-67-135659,A beautifully crafted classic.,10,30 July 2014,"Drive is easily one of my favourite films of the last few years and after the first time viewing it I was tremendously surprised. I had gone into the movie expecting a run-of-the-mill action/thriller movie about a getaway driver; somewhat in the style of the Transporter series. However the strengths of this film come from the understanding of what it is and the raw power of the script. This film has real depth to it and there is actually a distinct lack of vehicle action (to the disappointment of some who were expecting an intense car film). Ryan Gosling puts on what I believe to be one of his greatest performances and can evoke emotion without so much as a single line of dialogue; the stoic and unnamed driver has scenes whereby all that is necessary to understand what is playing through in his mind is the subtle look of his eyes. However when the film does decide to become more focused on the driver's innate ability in his criminal profession, it still leaves the viewer in awe. Anyone who has seen the film will remember the perfect example of this being the immaculate intro sequence which I will say is without a doubt one of my favourite introductions to a movie of all time. The film features an absolutely brilliant musical score and is one of the rare soundtracks that I found myself actively seeking out on the internet only to purchase later on and listen to on a regular basis in car journeys or just when I'm in the mood for some awesome easy-listening electronic songs. Drive reminded me of how much I value a good performance from Bryan Cranston and Ron Pearlman and I will most assuredly be looking out for more of Albert Brooks' roles. Without spoiling the ending I can say that the constant tug-of-war struggle between being a good person and succumbing to a more dark persona is brought together wonderfully with other seemingly insignificant scenes earlier in the film surprising me at how well they fit into the overall theme. The editing and cinematography in this film is superb and I cannot fault it at a single point; I found it particularly clever that the shots in the opening getaway scene never leave the inside of the car (this is something that I did not pick up myself but after going back and watching the scene again it only enhanced the experience further to think more about what was going on in the director's head). An all-round great movie and I would recommend it to anyone.",Drive

I had only coincidentally approached this film after hearing Kavinsy's 'Nightfall', which is present in the film's supreme lush 1980's inspired soundtrack. As a fan of rich electronic instrumentals, I knew I was instantly in for an absolute beast of a 21st century movie.The reason I say '21st century' is this- I could be seen as a 'peculiar' man, in that I live in the past. I get a huge sense of nostalgia from masterpieces such as 'Drive'. I yearn for certain arts, music and style that just easy to come across anymore. I desire beautiful music- as all GREAT films have brilliant soundtracks which immerse the viewer into the story and the film's events. This soundtrack compiled by Cliff Martinez (who I had previously not heard) of various synthesiser driven tunes and instrumentals, does this film great justice. Up there with the best, without even employing the 'biggest' names. The cinematography of this masterpiece,directed by the Dane Nicolas Winding Refn is also something that is excellently executed and should be applauded. It has a certain subtlety to it. Never doing too many rapid cuts or transitions or containing overly dense situations and CGI- despite this film having its dark moments. It simply doesn't need to.Having said that, this film is rather tense, at most times. This resolves around the star character of Driver's (Ryan Gosling)struggle to be somebody, stuck between being a mechanic, a stunt driver and a getaway driver, assisted with his mentor Shannon (played by Bryan Cranston). It seems that Driver does not want to be stuck in the same ordinary and slightly miserable world that the naturally innocent, compassionate, but helpless Shannon is.Driver encounters a window of opportunity when he meets his new neighbour, Irene (Carey Mulligan), a mother and the wife of a soon returning convict-Standard (Oscar Isaac), whom he falls in love with. However, this relationship would prove to be hazardous to Driver as he becomes embroiled in a serious of treacherous events, including the complexities of the connection between the two mechanics of Shannon and Driver and the Jewish mobsters of Bernie (played superbly by Albert Brooks), who is compassionate, melancholic yet to the point and Nino (Ron Perlman)- who is quite the same but much more vulgar.The film presents us with a barrage of issues to consider and includes wonderful, but also fragmented character development which works well. There is a stark contrast of characters and their ideals. All however, are looking for a way out. The film presents itself as a near perfect work of art: the setting conveying a showcase of 'glitz and glamour' (the beautiful night lights of L.A., a city waiting to be explored, or so we thought) the small-time appartments of ordinary citizens overlooking palm paradises and small oasis' (namely Driver), and the classic food outlets where different people congregrate to talk business.Gosling's role demands very little, yet he creates a lot from his sense of melancholy and insularity and forces us to empathise with his situation and, actually, makes us question the other individuals' roles and pursuits at the same time- even if they aren't helping Driver's cause.Finally, this emotional, slow-moving neo-noir art-house action crime thriller really is a must see for anybody looking for a perfectly balanced film of art and should be applauded as the crowning film of 2011, along with the French film The Intouchables. You will be left stunned. If only there would be a thought-out sequel!",Drive

This film has risen the bar for other film makers to follow. The cinematography has inspired me as I'm sure it has for other DP's, the script was very well put together and the lack of dialogue works perfectly as this is often done badly.The cast of this film couldn't of been done any better, the characters are believable yet stereotypical which I think is a very hard balance to get right!

I enjoyed Refn's extreme violence and his unique visual style, especially with the lingering shots. And here? Well... I'm in the minority here, but I think OGF is a better movie than Drive. It didn't have the same visual flare and the long drawn out pauses that worked in OGF felt awkward and clunky here. Drive showcases some top-notch performances from Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan and some amazing visual composition by Refn. But, Only God Forgives did it better in a much more spectacular way, even it was far more vague and strange. I also found myself being bored at times, even though I am well-accustomed to Refn's slow burn style. I also found the ending to be a bit flat and anti-climactic. Overall, a good yet disappointing Nicolas Winding Refn film.",Drive
1406,dylanabowen,Drive Review,9,9 December 2015,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***Car chases, mind blowing action, and a touch of romance. What would crime films be without these three key elements? The film Drive incorporates all three of these, but adds more of punch to the action. Director Nicolas Winding Refn, who has a lack of drivers license or knowledge of cars, goes outside of his comfort zone, taking on the film adaptation of James Sallis's crime novel of the same title. Refn's adaptation brings new perspective to the world of crime films with beautiful cinematography that puts the viewer right in with the action. The filmThe story follows a stunt driver referred to only as Driver (Ryan Gosling), who works part time as a get away driver for heists, but also works at a garage owned by Shannon (Bryan Cranston). He is drawn towards his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) who's husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac) is in debt to powerful mobsters, and tries to help clear his name after being released from prison. While Standard is in prison, Driver spends much of his time helping out Irene by giving her rides and watching over her and her son while Standard is still in prison. Shannon is a business partner with the head of the mob, Bernie Rose played by Albert Brookes, and his friend Nino (Ron Pearlman). The film's cast displays a beautiful performance, especially Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks. Cranston and Brooks are counterparts throughout the film, but have a chemistry matched by no one. Ron Pearlman also delivers a strong role as the tough guy Nino.Refn's directing style is very artsy and involves an excess of silence, which may throw a first time viewer off; however, the film does pick up with extreme violence. Most of the cinematic shots of Driver are profile shots that are enhanced by side lighting to add his mysterious nature. Gosling's character is mostly silent throughout the film, also adding to his mysteriousness and showing he is indifferent to his surroundings until the girl he loves in danger. Like a book, Driver is not to be judged simply by his appearance. He becomes ruthless and will no allow anyone to stand in his way.There are a number of horrifying, gory, scenes throughout the film such as the head stomping scene in the elevator. When there is a violent scene-involving Driver, the action is slowed down. It causes much suspense and puts the viewer in the shoes of Driver. As a reference to the fable of the scorpion and the frog, the violence simply expresses how Driver is being dragged down. Everyone Driver has attempted to help (symbolic of the scorpion) have self-destructed and caused a chain reaction, which in turn causes Driver to get himself in to deeper trouble.Juxtaposing the darkness and violence, the music casts an eighties like vibe that would make fans of eighties movies and music proud. New Retro Wave floods the background music to establish the mood of the action. The theme song, ""A Real Hero"" by College ft. Electric Youth, consequently plays an immense roll in contrasting the darkness pent up inside of Driver and his being a hero to Irene and her son regardless of what he does to be deemed as such.If you are a fan of crime films, this is definitely one you do not want to leave this one out. The action and cast alone will bring you pure joy from their outstanding performances, namely Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks. Drive will leave you wanting more, and ending ambiguously, may just do that in good time. Whatever you do, do not sleep on this one.",Drive

From an inability to chew on a toothpick to the over the top skull crushing violence, his character seems to jar with his appearance and not in an ironic way. The film has been described as 'Noir', its not but it is trying very hard, unfortunately failing in the process. All this would have been forgiven but for the denouement of the film which was simply illogical. The title could have described a fast paced petrol head 200mph thrill-fest, its not that. Or it could have referred to intricate character development where we get to consider the drive and motivation of the characters involved but that never really happens either, all we get is a leading man who says very little and a loose plot that never manages to grab your attention enough to give a damn anyway.",Drive

Personally, this movie touches all aspects of emotion, whether suspense, action, mystery and love.Ryan Gosling has outdone himself. Even without many lines, he was able to show himself through the scene itself. the audience is able to easily depict the drivers true feelings and understand him like he is your friend. the music and costume also plays a crucial role in aiding the 50's vibe of the film.

The intent of the hero is never established, there are so many charterers who do nothing but float in and out of the movie. It also has a heroine who has no role, there is deafening sound each time our driver who is a driver takes the car out for a drive. the music stops after some time but the pace in the movie never picks up. In any other logical list this movie would have been relegated to the movies of shame list. When i heard about it for the first time it had a rating of 8 or 9 on IMDb, at that point in time i had to watch the movie.

1414,gunner14,"Promising, but not quite",9,19 September 2011,"Drive's first getaway sequence is one of those fantastic film openings which is both intriguing and utterly compelling drama from the very beginning. Edge of your seat stuff and it's only just started.The ingenious getaway sucks you straight into Ryan Gosling's character - who is he and why does he getaway drive for a living? Ryan Gosling seems to be one of the biggest names in Hollywood at the moment, with two big roles coming out simultaneously. But here he is given no name and has little to say and a large air of mystery. This is perfectly fine at beginning, I loved watching his brain tick without being quite sure what was going on beneath it, but it did get a little frustrating as the character remained constantly distant and never quite human enough to be sympathetic or mean enough to seem threatening.It's got a strong plot. The Driver works as a car mechanic and moonlights as a criminal getaway driver. He falls for Irene (Carey Mulligan) and because he cares about her and her kid, he makes the strange but nevertheless understandable decision to use his getaway skills to help protect Irene's husband, who's just been released from prison. Things go wrong and the Driver quickly finds himself in the midst of slightly more than he bargained for.What really made me keen to see this film was the fantastic cast. Alongside the much hyped Mr Gosling, we have Carey Mulligan who last time left me an absolute wreck in the devastatingly emotional Never Let Me Go. Unfortunately, in Drive her character is never given any chance to show any depth. Also in supporting roles are Bryan Cranston (who blows me away every single week with his incredible performances as school-teacher-turned-drug-manufacturer in AMC's TV series, Breaking Bad) who does a good job as an overconfident schemer and mechanic. Other big names in the supporting cast include Ron Pearlman and a truly unrecognizable Christina Hendricks, who looks a million miles away from her role on Mad Men.So it's a cast that oozes with talent and potential. They all do a good enough job although I really wish certain members were given more to do and I was slightly frustrated by Gosling's silent dead pan (I know, criticize Ryan Gosling - my nerve!). If a lead character is going to be so silent but also such a morally ambiguous (and violent) hero, then I would like to see a bit more intensity in his face. The film contains a lot of violence which seems straight out of Tarantino's Textbook and although I never shy away from watching the blood being spilled, I don't feel the tone quite built up to the execution of the violent which is very bloody indeed. It didn't so much feel gratuitous, but it just didn't match the tone.It's a very quiet film despite the gore, a decision sometimes coming across as brave and dramatic and at others feeling awkward and unnecessary. I do feel this stops us from really getting into the characters' heads (especially the Driver and Irene) when sometimes you just want to know how they're feeling and I don't think the direction always managed to convey these emotions.The soundtrack is extremely odd. Often ambient and pulsating, building tension and matching the rhythms of a car but then all that good work is spoiled by the big moments which sound completely ghastly. The dream-pop refrain 'a real human being and a real hero' pops up a couple times and just made me request the sick bag rather than the cathartic ending they were going for. I don't want to say too much, but in terms of action the ending could have been executed so much more boldly and instead felt a bit limp.Admittedly, I have come across as rather harsh. It is stylish and well polished. It does feel intriguing but just lacks the pay off required. It's a strong dramatic effort and I can certainly understand it's appeal and I admire its audacious silences. Despite its faults, I wish it the best of luck.Review via moviefilmreviews.wordpress.com",Drive

The violence isn't fun to watch. It's real and gritty. I wouldn't say Ryan Gosling is a badass. But he is definitely portrayed as a professional with tough decisions to make. You see a person take into action what needs to be done in order for survival. And you see that fear, remorse, and anger in His facial expressions. This film shows what humanity will do to protect innocence of a family. Anyway, not going to go very deep in it. You will see what I mean once you watch it. I give this an 8/10.

1416,dylanbuteau,Best movie i've ever seen.,10,3 August 2016,"Will say ""spoilers start here"" when there are spoilers, i will keep them at the end/bottom. Good soundtrack, good cinematography, good story, and good acting. This movie is a breath of fresh air that breaks the mold in so many ways. Its portrays a main character with a personality rarely seen on screen. It's the farthest thing from cookie cutter, i highly recommend people to see this movie, it's a must see. Spoilers start here. Our society isn't very accepting of quiet/anti-social personalities, all decent paying and non-back-breaking jobs these days require enthusiastic, sociable people willing to be something they're not that they foolishly call kindness and professionalism. So its fitting seeing quiet/anti-social Driver(the main character) working as a mechanic by day, and a get-a-way driver by night. I think he only works at the garage for a cover and to have his connections to Shannon for his night job. It's also fitting that Driver, in this city of illegal activity that he is involved in, still has a sense of morality, which gets him in trouble. The acting is great, for a movie with a fraction of the dialogue of most movies, a lot is said. The love story in this movie is refreshingly different with an even more refreshing ending. The only big mistake is an editing mistake in Driver's first get-a-way driver scene where hes on the bridge and the helicopter spotted his car and Driver hits the gas, we hear the engine roar but the car remains the same speed as the other cars on the road, which is probably due to the tiny budget given for the film(they probably couldn't afford to close the road and redo the shot).",Drive

If this is a typical 7.8 on the IMDb scale, there is some serious grade inflation here, worse than what you see in your typical elite college and that is saying a lot.

1424,vollkeinheld,"Same old story, new design",7,13 January 2018,"When looking at it from a distance, ""Drive"" is an action film about revenge. The movie has a love story, betrayal, a father figure and motivations for every character. A classic story, nothing new, but ""Drive"" presents it in a way which I have never seen before.
The movie uses its - by now famous - soundtrack to create a neo-noir world which we get sucked into in the first minutes. Intelligent use of silence and impressive camera-work push the audience into their seats. The opening scene creates an incredibly dense atmosphere, which is sadly broken throughout the movie.
In my opinion, the movie suffers from its fear of straying too far from the path of modern Hollywood action thrillers. The protagonist has to be loveable, even though we know that he is quite the heartless guy and his love interest is even shown to fear him at one point in the movie. Needless exposition is given about the intentions and motivations of the 'bad guys'. The atmosphere created in the opening scene is given up to tell a more than mediocre story, in fear of scaring audiences away with a too artsy approach.
Nonetheless, when the movie realizes its strengths, it is really good. Subtle acting, creative use of violence and well executed action scenes make this movie seem like a modern interpretation of the action genre, not daring too much, but still enough to elevate itself above the others.",Drive

Bryan Cranston, who I like generally, played a caricature role that reminded me of Burgess Merideth in the first Rocky. The only compelling supporting role was that of Oscar Isaac who brought some serious intensity to his role.A movie can be artistic without being stupid. There are a couple scenes in this movie that are outright ridiculous. If this is a great movie, then the bar has been lowered for greatness.Good looking, hit-and-miss soundtrack, good lead acting, poor supporting acting, and peppered with several amazing action sequences.

1435,Amals_View,A true Masterpiece (I'll explain why I'm not exaggerating),10,24 October 2018,"Drive is probably one of the best films ever made. Do not think I take those words lightly. From plot, to script, to character building, to direction, to acting, to cinematography, to sound design, everything in this film is painstakingly thought out, developed, and executed. Unfortunately, in it's brilliance of execution, it's made to look so effortless, that I couldn't make up my mind almost until the end about whether the fact that it seemed that every last thing had been thought about, was intentional and genius to the extreme, or just pleasant coincidence. Indeed, some viewers, who would approach this film without an ability or desire to appreciate the intentionality of every last detail, would be forgiven their opinion of the film as boring and slow. Nevertheless, Drive is a masterpiece.Reminiscent of the lone cowboy films of the mid century and later, Refn's modern take on the theme, is a beautifully portrayed artwork with a neo-noir feeling to it. The excellent cinematography, lighting design, sound design, and art design, all led masterfully by the direction of Nicolas Winding Refn, make this film one of the most multi-sensorily absorbing and satisfying feasts you would get a chance to experience. The tension is artfully built and maintained, and released in sudden bursts, in gorgeously choreographed high intensity scenes. But what I, personally, cherished the most in this film, was how it has a multitude of layers, which are skillfully peeled back by the director as the film progresses, all the while being stunningly underpinned by Ryan Gosling's powerful performance. Refn has always had a penchant for working with method actors, with Tom Hardy in Bronson, and Mads Mikkelson in Valhalla Rising standing testament to that fact; and Gosling is no different. He portrays the dichotomy of the strong but silent, ruthless but caring, powerful but gentle, and criminal but good-hearted lead character adroitly. Carey Mulligan, does a wonderful job portraying his sweet, timid, and lovely opposite number. With a support cast, including Mulligan, of Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman, the film is carried on able shoulders.What impressed me the most was the sophisticatedly evolved level of restraint in storytelling, which enhances the film by understanding that what is excluded is equally important to the storytelling method, as what is included. Every character has been fleshed out to a fault, and the viewer is navigated on a journey through the complex web of motivations and decisions of every one of them. The viewer is made to constantly engage with each character as a result, and update his/her opinion on them with every passing scene in an attempt to understand them correctly. The film treads the fine line of the moral grey area with ease, where the viewer ends up rooting for the enigmatically complex lead character, despite him showcasing bouts of extreme violence.A rivetting lead performance by Ryan Gosling, and an artistically talented and skillful film-making crew ensure an instant cult classic.",Drive
1436,timbutler-39557,Retro electronic soundtrack + long silent exchanges and odd smiles = awful film,4,28 October 2018,"This film is utter nonsense. I'd rather watch the notebook.This isn't a Tarantino film. This isn't American Psycho. This is a waste of everyones time, and should be cast into bin along with other such nonsense such as selfie sticks and self balancing scooters!",Drive
1437,raymilesprime,Put the glasses on!,3,5 October 2011,"I understand why Twilight is popular. Don't think it deserves to be, but I get how it exploits its market.I get why Top Gear is popular.I get why Family Guy is popular.I get why Jersey Shore is popular.I get why Epic Movie was popular.I get why crack cocaine is popular.But I seriously do not get why Drive doesn't get a single solitary bad word said about it and every aspect of it is praised like it was Gone With The Wind. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I saw NOTHING OF MERIT IN THAT FILM. NOTHING.I feel like I'm Roddy Piper with the special sunglasses. ""SOMEONE AGREE WITH ME PLEASE!!""and you know what if they'd just marketed this film differently or cast another actor, a decent actor, that does genre movies, like say Jason Statham, this movies would have BOMBED.",Drive
1438,moredothif,underrated masterpiece,9,3 December 2018,"Most of the problems with the film people bring up is not at the fault of the film but how it was advertised. its slow because it needs to be. just because you thought
it was going to be some action packed fast and furious type movie doesn't mean u should denote the film for false expectations. its not an action movie but a crime drama. personally i enjoyed the film and to this day is my no.1. the direction is so beautiful and real, we don't get movies like that often. its directed like it actually happens and that's what reels you in for the drama part.as far tone most complain of the switch between action and slow scenes boring or strange. but that's the point, we are supposed to feel like driver, always changing but never happy until Irene arrives.also people complain of the gore, saying it was unnecessarily gory. wrong, now the scene in question is the elevator scene and the motel room scene.
each provide a realistic use of gore that pays into the movie if you are paying attention. it is supposed to represent the way driver is always going to be a bad guy instead of the real hero he wants to be. both serve as a visual representation, especially the elevator scene, of the old fable about a scorpion and a frog. where the scorpion says he needs to cross a stream and he will ride the frog, the frog says he will sting him. but the scorpion reply's, if i do we would both drown. so they cross the stream, but halfway the the scorpion stings the frog and as they drown the frog asks why, the scorpion simply says, it is in my nature to do so. this is the story of the driver where he is the scorpion and Irene is the frog. the gore is his sting, when he finally cracks he drowns.and thats why i love this movie so much",Drive
1439,telefoonvandj-31034,"Long, boring",4,4 January 2019,"Driver was among the most boring films I have ever seen. The main character, played by Ryan Gosling was just plain weird;he had like 10 lines at most in this entire movie. Overall there was just a lot of awkward staring scenes, filling most of the movie, and a few violent, and to some even discusting fighting scenes that just didn't fit the character.",Drive
1440,brad_the_dad,2011? More like 1989,1,30 January 2012,"Okay, so every driver flick doesn't have to be over-the-top like the Fast-and-Furious franchise or the Transporter trilogy, but ""Drive"" is soooo lame. The hot-pink color of the credits and the lame soundtrack had me double-checking the release-date on IMDb before the first (of oh-so-few) words were uttered to see if I had rented the wrong title. Nope, 2011. My wife loved Gosling and friends in ""Remember the Titans"", and enjoyed ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". The night before I had watched Gosling in the dark ""Blue Valentine"". But this film was garbage and I don't think I can blame it on the actors. Not sure who was trying to channel their inner Werner Herzog or John Woo, but ""Drive"" didn't feel artistic, it was just boring and predictable.This is my first review -- I felt compelled to try to spare someone from squandering their date-night like I did. All I can say is thank goodness it was only 100 minutes long! If I can save just one viewer from suffering through this, my effort won't have been wasted.",Drive
1441,bgarrett-25075,Albert Brooks is outstanding!,10,11 January 2019,"I know the movie is old now and this is my first review, but I just watched this tonight for the first time in years. This movie still holds up and is still in my top 10.Everything about this film is top notch, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the camera work, the acting, and the dialogue (less is more sometimes...its more accurate to reality IMO). But of all the facets of this film, Albert Brooks steals the show! Every performance is perfect - Cranston is fabulous with his jazz style dialogue, mostly as libbed - but Brooks is suck a menacing yet reassuring presence.It's hard to think of a villain that has been this grotesque and yet this likeable at the same time. He not only is amicable and loyal, he is ruthless and narcissistic. How this man didn't win an award for this performance is beyond me.Top 3 out of my top 10 overall...just a fantastic film overall!",Drive

Awful.",Drive
1443,MadalinMarinescu,The scam of the century,6,25 September 2011,"I've been an IMDb member for about 5 years or so and I've rated over 650 titles. I never wrote a review before though...""Drive"" is the most overrated movie I have ever seen. When I got out of the cinema the other night I was outraged. But not in the ""I want my money back!"" or ""I want my two hours back!"" way. I was outraged because this movie is rated higher than ""Leon"", for example. I can name a hundred movies that are better than ""Drive"" but have lower ratings. In my opinion it's a 6/10 movie. Full of clichés, weak plot, no dialogue and uncalled for explicit violence scenes. The cinematic was good and the soundtrack was OK, but that doesn't add up. Everybody is talking about the acting. Well, what acting? There are no characters, not even one line of dialogue to be remembered. Ryan Gosling acts like he is the most awesome person in the universe. Moving around with his hands in his pockets or with his arms crossed on his chest, with a toothpick in his mouth like he's Stallone in ""Cobra"". A man of few words but who looks smarter than anybody else. He is ridiculous taking himself so seriously. But hey, he is a mechanic, part time stunt driver, part time get-away driver. How cool is that? Maybe he should have also applied for a school bus driver position so his sensitive side appear more clear to us and soften our dull old hearts.And what's with all that violence? Broken skulls, throats cut, blood everywhere all of a sudden. These scenes just don't fit in the movie. It seems that they were added just to shock the audience and to impress the 12 year-old who managed to get tickets. And don't get me started on the screenplay flaws...Anyway, there are so many things that I didn't like in this movie that they wouldn't fit in 10 reviews. I believe though that his rating will eventually go down. I mean, 8.7? Lets have some sense. That's how ""Matrix"", ""The usual suspects"" or ""Forrest Gump"" are rated... ""Drive"" is just a ""B"" movie and doesn't deserve to share the spot with any other film above. Unless, the world turns upside down.EDIT: OK, I was a bit out of line regarding the title of my review. It's just a highly overrated movie.",Drive
