0,MartinHafer,A wonderful film,10,6 March 2009,"Before I discuss this exceptional film, I need to point out that there is a lot of truth to this film if you are looking for what it was like in psychiatric hospitals in the 1950s and into the 60s. The hellish practices and dehumanization was definitely true of many facilities during this era. However, today, many of the horrific abuses are no longer relevant. So, while some will point to this film as proof that psychiatry in general is evil personified (such as the Scientologists), for the most part, this isn't the case today. Shock treatment is rarely done today and when it is, it's nothing like it is portrayed in the film and it actually has therapeutic value when all else fails. Lobotomies are also thankfully a thing of the past. So, while debating the pros and cons of hospitalization and medications is reasonable today, don't assume the film is in any way like psychiatric institutions today--many of which have been closed or severely reduced in size as well as the length of stay of the average patient.The film begins with a cocky sociopathic criminal, McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), being sent to a psychiatric hospital from prison. It seems McMurphy thinks that by ""playing crazy"" he'll have an easier time and shorter stay in a hospital instead of prison. However, over time, he comes to see that a mental hospital is a pretty sick place--particularly when it comes to the crazy staff who run the place. McMurphy responds to this system by constantly fighting it and trying to subvert their needless rules and control. Some of this is very funny (such as the fishing trip) and you can understand why he would fight the oppressive ways of the hospital. In the end, however, the system ultimately crushes him like so many others. The conclusion is certainly something you won't forget!Although Jack Nicholson was great in the film as were the rest of the ensemble cast, the star in the film was Louise Fletcher. She played the coldest and most awful nurse in the history of film. Her tough performance truly made the film. Otherwise, if she hadn't been so utterly devoid of humanity, the film just wouldn't have worked. Oddly, the film's producers had a hard time accepting her for the job--and she was the last one cast in the film.Exceptional in every way--the writing, acting and direction. The only reservation I have regards the misuse of the film by anti-psychiatry groups. However, I am glad the film was made as the abuses of the industry need to be understood and not forgotten.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
1,TheLittleSongbird,So much good about this movie...,10,23 January 2011,"What an amazing movie! I cannot begin to describe how good One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is, the whole film has the word classic written all over it. The production values are of top notch quality, and Jack Nitzsche's music is excellent. The film also has a brilliant script, superb direction from Milos Forman(who also directed one of my other favourite movies Amadeus) and a compelling story. The pace is spot on, and there are many memorable scenes especially the very poignant yet harrowing ending. The characters all add a lot to the film, especially Nurse Ratched who is oppressive and terrifying. The cast are all terrific, Jack Nicholson is superb in one of his best roles and Louise Fletcher is just unforgettable as Nurse Ratched. Among the supporting cast are Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Douif, all great. So overall, I cannot fault One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, it is considered not only one of the best of the 70s but one of the best ever, and it deserves that reputation. 10/10 Bethany Cox",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
2,bkoganbing,The Ultimate Backfire,10,15 January 2009,"It took a dozen years for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest to make it to the big screen from Broadway. In 1962 Kirk Douglas made his one and only return to Broadway to star as Randall P. McMurphy on stage with Joan Tetzel as his nemesis, nurse Ratched. Douglas bought the screen rights, but by the time anyone was interested in doing the film version, Kirk was too old for the part.That may have been a break for the movie fans because as much as I like Kirk Douglas, I can't see anyone but Jack Nicholson doing this role as the free spirited McMurphy. McMurphy's a low level career criminal type who statutorily raped a girl as he put it '15 going on 35'. He decides to fake a crazy act while in prison to get out of the work farm he's assigned to.So Nicholson's goes to the mental hospital where he meets an odd assortment of people whom he discovers voluntarily checked themselves in there, mainly because it's easier to stay there and not take all your psychological baggage into society. That's a crucial difference that Nicholson finds out the hard way, his new friends most of them can pack up and leave anytime they want. He's sent there by the state and the state determines when he's ready to go even if it's past the allotted jail time he was sentenced to.The state in this case is Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, one of the great Dickensian names ever given a movie character. Louise is the ultimate control freak and these people who've shut themselves away from life are her ultimate tools. When Nicholson comes in, he hasn't given up on life like the rest of these poor souls, he becomes a threat to Fletcher's little empire.It's hard to believe that such a smart guy like McMurphy would not have known the rules about commitment. Still it doesn't detract a bit from the overall quality of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.Though the topic is not a fixed one to any era, the script does leave many oblique references to the Sixties in the film. The electroshock treatment and the lobotomy operations depicted here were by 1975 no longer in use. They were pretty barbaric and the mental health profession discarded these, but not before too many lives were shattered with them. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest swept the main Oscar categories, it won for Best Picture, Best Director for Milos Forman, Best Actor for Jack Nicholson, Best Actress for Louise Fletcher and Best Adapted Screenplay to Lawrence Hauban and Bo Goldman. Brad Dourif was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but he lost to George Burns in The Sunshine Boys.Louise Fletcher never got the career mileage she should have for playing Nurse Ratched. It took her years, but she did get another career role in television as the ruler of Bejor, Kai Winn on Star Trek Deep Space Nine.One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is one timeless classic, it will be popular a millenia from now.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
3,Leofwine_draca,Classic movie,10,21 August 2013,"ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, an exploration of life inside a mental institute in America in the 1970s, is THE definitive exploration of mental illness put on film. It's a classic for a good reason, a movie that has it all: laughs and heartache, drama and pathos, feel-good moments and scenes of pure tragedy. The film is an adaptation of a novel but it's the screenplay which proves so successful, making perfection out of the story elements.Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast in the edgy lead role, playing the new guy who comes into the ward to shake things up a bit. Nicholson always has that wild side to him and he plays it perfectly here. As the antagonist, Louise Fletcher has a much more rounded character than you might expect; although she's cast as the villain, she's more complex than that, truly convicted that her ways are the best.The film is also notable for the prevalence of familiar faces in the supporting cast, many of whom went on to better things. Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif and Will Sampson are the stand-out players, many of them so young as to be virtually unrecognisable, but all revealing the greatness to come.The intensity of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST builds as the story progresses and the stakes are raised, with the narrative in the end proving to be a life and death battle between humanity and the establishment. It doesn't get much more powerful than that, huh? And the ending, although bittersweet, is sheer perfection realised on film. I can't wait to watch this one again.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
4,SnoopyStyle,Great acting performances from everybody,9,31 December 2013,"R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) has been sent to the mental institution for evaluation. He's in prison for statutory rape of a 15 year old girl. He has a history of fights and assault charges. The prison thinks he's faking to get out of work details. Inside the mental institution, he finds a whole range of people with disorders, and one controlling Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).Jack Nicholson is a rebellious man who's itching to break out of the oppressive dictatorship of nurse Ratched. Louise Fletcher is completely cold hearted, and projects great interior anger. It's all on her face. This is a movie of great performances from everybody. It's not just Nicholson and Fletcher. Everybody is spot on. There isn't a false note being struck.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
5,Hitchcoc,Excellent Film-making; Excellent Casting,10,30 March 2006,"Take a book like Ken Kesey's which did startle some and had a good following. I read it in a graduate English class. I remember setting it down and saying, ""That's a pretty good book."" It is well written with insights into the characters, but I didn't get the life I did in the movie. Throw a good director and some great character actors into a film like this; add Jack Nicholson, one of the most complex actors on the face of the earth; throw in Louise Fletcher with her soft spoken acts of terror; and you have a real film. Even though there are a few differences between the book and the movie, I actually enjoyed the book more the second time because the movie extended, for me, the depth of the characters. I don't know if Kesey would like to hear that, but sometimes it becomes a win win situation. The mental patients (some people choose to call them psychos which isn't fair) are wonderfully alive and full of their own being. Nicholson's character comes along and pulls out the humanity from them. I met some of the most wonderful people when I worked at a state mental hospital for a time (I now teach Junior High kids, which is a whole other issue). How would you like to be treated, given their setting? Medicated and controlled? There was a lot of that where I worked and I always thought, you may as well sentence them to death as treat them as you are. I think things are a bit more enlightened now. I think that maybe the movie helped a bit. This one has always been a top ten film in my book.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
6,Horst_In_Translation,"A true classic, packed with great performances",8,10 February 2015,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is one hell of a movie. Not only does it deliver fully in terms of comedy and drama, but it also managed to win the five big categories at the Oscars back in 1976. Jack Nicholson gives the maybe finest performance from his career and that says a lot. Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched regularly makes all-time villain lists and this film is considered one of the greatest examples of how the movie is better than the book it is based on, namely Ken Kesey's novel. So congrats to the writing team Goldman/Hauben, of which the latter never wrote another screenplay than this one here. And to director Milos Forman who, now in his early 80s, gave us many more great films during his 50-year-long career.If you take a closer look, you will see that this movie starts the way it ends. With a camera shot outside the institution. At the beginning a car approaches, possibly the one bringing McMurphy and at the end we see Chief leaving to freedom. Everything in-between (except the boat trip) takes place behind the walls/fences of the institution. We get to see several sessions with sadist Ratched in control, which usually end up way worse for all the inmates than they started. As I mentioned earlier, there's moments when you can never be sure which direction this film is gonna take in the end, comedy or drama. That is also why the final developments are so shocking for everybody. Is it an uplifting ending? Or a depressing? I'm not sure. You have to decide for yourself. The boat trip was certainly the highlight in terms of lightness. Everybody had such a great time with the evil nurse not present. I liked how McMurphy acted as if catching the fish was something so big, such a huge event to boost the inmates' confidence.Apart from that, it is also interesting to see how the employees of the institution act. Some are sadist and like to humiliate as well, some almost treat the inmates equally at times, like during that big party scene. Obviously, the scene when Billy is caught with the woman by Nurse Ratched is very significant too. You could argue how Ratched's own sexual frustration may play a role in the way she reacted ruthlessly and pushed her unstable patient into suicide. She is maybe an even more interesting character than McMurphy. But is she lead or supporting? I'm not sure about that with McMurphy being so much in the center of the movie. But maybe that is just due to Nicholson's great screen presence. Anyway, it's fascinating to see how Ratched hides her mean behavior behind alleged seriousness: She allows the poll, but still decides the outcome. She tells that the more insane members count as much as everybody else as they are part of the institution as well etc.And there is a water application (not sure of the exact name) that plays a major part in this movie too, as this is basically the means to freedom, at first only seemingly with McMurphy, but in the end actually with the Chief, also a very interesting character. However, the early significance of this application is also shown as his little demonstration about how McMurphy at least tried makes everybody brave enough to vote for seeing the baseball game in the face of Ratched's evil eye.Finally you could argue: Did Chief do the right thing in the end? Or, what if McMurphy had been the doctor and Ratched was one of the patients (as it should be?). Would it be better for all the other inmates as they seem to get along with him well. Is it even possible with McMurphy's anti-authority lifestyle and approach. Anyway, if you see that this film was made in the 1970s you could certainly applaud it for its liberal attitude towards sex, nudity, alcohol, authorities and possibly even euthanasia towards the end. Be warned that this movie has two very intense scenes: first the medical procedure taken on McMurphy after the first brawl and finally the pillow scene. Stay away if you maybe can't handle these. Or better look away as it would be a pity if you missed this brilliant film because of that. However, completely in contrast to that: If you have perceived asylums as something creepy (just like many others) so far, you may change your opinion after seeing this film. The inmates all seem fairly harmless compared to the one person in control of them.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
7,Prismark10,Joker in the ward,7,1 March 2014,"I rewatched this film after going through some of Jack Nicholson's earlier performances in Five Easy Pieces and King of Marvin Gardens.He won an Oscar for this film, it is here we get the 'Jack' mannerisms that crop up in later films especially as we see aspects of the 'Joker' as soon as he appears on screen.It is almost 40 years since the film was made. I never realised the film is set in the early 1960s as it had a contemporary setting especially as we see 1970s cars in some of the exterior scenes.The film also has what were at the time unknown actors that have become stars in their own right. Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif, Vincent Schiavelli. Even the producer Michael Douglas managed to become an Oscar winning actor!Convict McMurphy (Nicholson) enters a mental hospital thinking it would be easier to do time there than an ordinary prison. He brings chaos in his wake that stirs the other patients.We have had similar themed films done since then and even parodied on numerous occasions. So there is a lot of familiarity to the story even if you have never seen the movie before.McMurphy's behaviour brings him into conflict with Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher.) Nurse Ratched is a cold, icy character who lacks empathy. As McMurphy mentions she is not playing a straight game.Although it could be said that it's McMurphy that has brought chaos with his wilful rule breaking. Her mask slips at the end when she humiliates Brad Dourif that brings tragedy.One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is an example of the edgy, adult 1970s cinema. It dealt with mature themes. It is not an epic dealing with a grandiose story yet it still won the Grand Slam of Oscars with Best actor, actress, screenplay, director and film.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
8,classicsoncall,"""...ahh, Juicyfruit.""",10,24 January 2007,"Though it may not rigidly adhere to the novel, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is still a riveting story, moved along powerfully by the roiling battle of the minds between it's principals, Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). When I was much younger I often found myself with the same attitude as many of the reviewers here that find fault with a less than faithful line by line adaptation of the source material. However having seen enough films that stray from the original novel, I chalk it up to the poetic license taken by the screenwriter in an effort to tell an effective story. In my case, I had read Ken Kesey's novel before the film was made, and then again after seeing the film during it's original theatrical release. Honestly, unless you read the book and watch the film virtually back to back, I don't think you'll come away from the movie unimpressed. In fact, the one difference I can recall with clarity between the two concerns an element in the novel that I'm satisfied was changed for the movie. In the book, the character of Cheswick drowned during a recreational swim in the pool. With Nicholson's first appearance on screen, you can note the glint in his eye that would also serve him well in 1980's ""The Shining"". His aggressive behavior has managed to secure confinement to a mental institution instead of a work farm where he quickly understands that his nemesis Ratched operates the asylum much like a a rigged carny game. It's interesting to note that throughout the story, Ratched's hairdo is uniquely styled to resemble a pair of horns, and she's more than willing to offer McMurphy and whoever takes his side a devil of a time.My favorite scene of the film relates to my summary line above, when The Chief (Will Sampson) reveals he's not deaf and dumb, and McMurphy revels in the fact that the Indian might be an even bigger con man than himself. It was McMurphy's cultivating of that relationship along the way that helped The Chief understand that he could be as 'big as a mountain'. I can think of no other film ending that winds up being so depressing and uplifting at the same time; you'll want to believe the Chief when he tells his friend he's coming with him. It's a chilling moment. With a repeat viewing, take note of the Chief's expression when McMurphy attempts to lift the sink to win a bet in an earlier scene. It's where the seed was planted for the Chief's escape.It's a tribute to all the talent involved in this movie that makes each character vivid and memorable, even those that don't have any lines. Danny DeVito, Sydney Lassick, and Christopher Lloyd are stand out in their respective roles, for each virtually their first major big screen appearance. Brad Dourif is probably my favorite modern day character actor, his work as Doc Cochran in the Western series ""Deadwood"" is tour de force.Interestingly, in addition to 'Cuckoo's Nest', Ken Kesey also wrote what remains to this day my favorite novel, ""Sometimes A Great Notion"", telling the story of an Oregon lumber family. Even though that story is told from the perspective of differing narrators, it moves along seamlessly without confusing the reader, and in many cases, one doesn't even recall the switch taking place! That book was also made into a film with the same name, but you might find it broadcast under an alternate title, ""Never Give An Inch"".",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
9,gavin6942,Very Fine Film,8,5 May 2010,"I'm going to make this very brief: you have a nut-house with Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Michael Berryman and Brad Dourif. Then, you transfer a violent prisoner (Jack Nicholson) into the asylum, who is sure to rouse the nuttiness of the patients there. That's really all you need to know.Of course, there's more to it than that. Nicholson's character takes it to a whole new level, doing things that are not only unpredictable but at times rather extreme. Not crazy extreme like cutting himself or flinging excrement, but just testing authority.What to watch for: when does testing authority go too far (and who is the bad guy when it does), and who is helping the patients more: the nurses on staff or the strong personality of the new patient?",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
10,lee_eisenberg,This will remain a classic for all time.,10,15 August 2005,"Based on Ken Kesey's novel, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is still the ultimate story of rebelling against authority. Jack Nicholson gives the performance of a lifetime as mental patient Randle Patrick McMurphy, resisting the dictatorial Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). I just can't describe how great this movie is; you have to see it to understand that. Among other things, it disproves the notion that Oregon-filmed movies suck (mostly caused by movies like ""The Postman"" and ""Men of Honor""). Watching ""OFOTCN"", anyone can see why it won the top four Academy Awards for 1975.

11,jboothmillard,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,10,25 February 2005,"From Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director Milos Forman, this is an excellent story based on the novel by Ken Kesey. Basically Randall P. (Patrick) McMurphy (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Jack Nicholson, in his greatest role) is the free spirit with several assault convictions who, after convincing guards he is crazy, is put into a state mental home. He has a different point of view though, and is ultimately a rebel in amongst the real mental patients and the hospital staff, particularly his main enemy, ward sister Nurse Mildred Ratched (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Louise Fletcher). But during his time in the hospital, he actually helps some of the patients make progress. These patients are a variety of then unknown actors, including Harding (William Redfield), stuttering Billy Bibbit (introducing BAFTA winning, and Oscar nominated Brad Dourif), Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick, who played another Cheswick in Carrie), Taber (introducing Back to the Future's Christopher Lloyd), Martini (Danny DeVito), and faker Chief Bromden (Will Sampson). The best sequences I always remember are all the group meetings, McMurphy jumping over the fence and stealing the bus of patients taking them fishing, the late night party (and attempted escape), and of course the tear-jerking ending where (after choking Nurse Ratched) McMurphy has had a lobotomy (taking out some of his brain), Chief kills him (euthanasia) and chucks the sink at the window to escape. Also starring Ghost's Vincent Schiavelli as Frederickson, The Shining's Scatman Crothers as Turkle, Louisa Moritz as Rose, Mews/Marya Small as Candy and Delos V. Smith Jr. as Scanlon. The film was produced by Michael Douglas, who had played McMurphy on stage. It won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted From Other Material, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Music for the great score by Jack Nitzsche, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Film Editing, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Screenplay and Best Sound Track, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

12,ccthemovieman-1,"Looking At This Famous Film Then, And Now",8,8 April 2006,"Like most people, when this film came out in the mid '70s, I thought it was great. Being still young and Liberal, I, too, looked at the rebel as the good guy and the authority figure as the bad guy....just as Hollywood has wanted us to do for a half century. Over the years, I watched a couple of more times and then stopped maybe 20 years ago.A funny thing happened when I looked at it again a few years ago as someone in their mid 50s: I looked at the two main characters in a totally different light.For the first time, now that my Left Wing rebel days are over, I didn't see Nurse Mildred Rachet (Louise Fletcher) as an evil person. On the contrary, the woman was just doing her job. I also appreciated Fletcher's performance more in here. She is outstanding, especially with her facial expressions. The only negative I could find on her was late in the film when she threatened to tell on ""Billy."" Jack Nicholson's character, ""Randle Patrick McMurphy,"" was generally an obnoxious ass. He must have set the Hollywood record at that time for most usages of the Lord's name in vain. I lost count on all the GDs. But Nicholson's performance was still outstanding: that hasn't changed in my eyes. He was also the perfect actor for that role.Who could argue with either of those actors getting Academy Awards for their performances?Yes, the story was good but it was the acting in general which made this such a memorable film. Without Nicholson, Fletcher, Will Samson, William Redfield, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito (I didn't recognize him!) and Christopher Lloyd, this film wouldn't have reached the heights it did.This is an unpleasant film in parts. Mental illness is not pretty, but it sure was a memorable film, I'll give it that. Unlike most reviewers, I don't love this film, but I respect it. It hasn't lost its power, either, nor is it dated.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
13,rmax304823,On Being Sane In Insane Places.,8,6 March 2016,"If you enjoyed ""Cool Hand Luke"" you'll enjoy this for similar reasons. A rogue is thrown into a total institution with a gaggle of passive inmates, organizes them and gains their admiration and allegiance, goes too far, and is defeated by the agents of social control.In both films the story is gripping, exuberant, painful, and allegorical. The psychiatric hospital of 1963 is no more the enemy here than the Southern prison camp. It's the social system with its demands that is the target, and the figure who rebels against the rules is its Prometheus.In both films, too, you'll find sterling performances in the lead roles and among the supporting players. It's one of Jack Nicholson's best, and the director, Milos Forman, isn't afraid to use the editor in order to make the most of it.One of the supporting actors, Louise Fletcher, won an Academy Award for her performance, and she deserved it, just as George Kennedy deserved his for ""Cool Hand Luke."" Fletcher's features and demeanor are perfectly suited to the role of Nurse Ratched, the personification of the social system. Her face seems made of half-melted wax, changing subtlety from fake-pleasant to honest resentment at Nicholson's leaching away of her power over the inmates.There's a knowingness in her anger, as if, underneath the robotic ministrations, there's an extremely perceptive apparatus at work. She reminds me of a stern arithmetic teacher, specifically Miss Velma Spurge, a knotty spinster, of Hillside High School, may her soul be barbecued for eternity.I don't think I'll get into the plot. It's full of surprises. So was the author of the work, Ken Kesey, who was a kind of link between the Beatniks of the late 50s and the hippies that came later and drew their inspiration from acid and a general taste for the colorful and the sensational. Kesey was a genuine innovator. His novel, on which this film is based, is written from the point of view of the Indian chief. Kesey was also the focal point of Tom Wolf's book, ""The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,"" one of the rare instances in which Wolf finds something to admire about noncomformists.See it.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
14,moonspinner55,"Difficult, fascinating drama runs on pure emotion, not logic...",7,22 May 2006,"Multiple Oscar winner is an astounding, gripping piece, although occasionally the material allows too much showing off for its star and the four-letter dialogue coupled with the bleak material can be exhausting. A softened (albeit no less hard-hitting) film-adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel about sex-deviate Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) sent to a mental institution instead of prison, quickly butting heads with the stony head-nurse on his ward (a hissable Louise Fletcher playing Nurse Wretched--uh, Ratched). Ostensibly a downer, the film does get a rousing kick from Nicholson, going full bore with an actor's relish and infusing the movie with unpredictable, kinetic energy. Director Milos Forman helps us get to know the patients at this hospital, easing us through the preliminaries and yet sparing us none of the ugliness. Still, this plot is a bit thin on the screen; Forman does his best to ""open up"" the material, which was first produced on the stage, but the sequence on the boat is more an emotion-based relief for the audience's benefit than a logical turn of the story. Tough-going, compelling film is occasionally brilliant, with Nicholson and Fletcher both winning Oscars, as did Forman and producer Michael Douglas. *** from ****",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

16,edwagreen,Surviving the Nut House ***,8,9 March 2006,"Jack Nicholson's first Oscar winning performance as a patient in a mental institution.Based on Ken Kesey's best seller, we come to realize that the heads of these institutions are in desperate need themselves. This movie correctly showed what goes on in these institutions.Nurse Mildred Ratched was skillfully played by Louise Fletcher, who won the best actress Oscar. Needless to say that an argument could be made that Nurse Ratched was a supporting performance. Fletcher also benefited from the fact that Elizabeth Taylor and Anne Bancroft turned the part down. Could one imagine Geraldine Page doing this role? She would have had a field day with it.Anyway, Ratched is an instigator. She riles the inmates up and then steps away after calling for emergency assistance. She is sicker than anyone confined there. This nurse actually believed that she was helping the patients by her strong beliefs in instilling scheduling and no change in the routine for the inmates. Obviously, she turns on McMurphy because he is a threat to her very existence.Nicholson, ideal for the role, made the most of it. His refusal to conform shall lead to his ultimate downfall. Note a strong performance by Brad Dourif as one of the inmates, who Ratched destroys in one of her blistering fits.Remember our short friend Mr. Cheswick?

17,Coventry,Insanely perfect,10,5 March 2021,"This will probably be regarded as a very blunt and unpopular statement, but I think that almost one third of the films listed in this website's top 250 do not belong there. Particularly among the first 50-100, there are far too many movies that are either vastly overrated and/or only listed so high because they have large and obsessive fanbases that vote continuously to keep them up there. The opinion naturally doesn't count for a handful of films that are - and forever will remain - undisputable masterpieces. ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is such an undisputable masterpiece, and it actually hurts to see that a landmark like this is getting pushed back in the ranking. I remember, a couple of years ago, this was #5 and all of a sudden, it's only at #18 now.Anyway, I certainly do not always concur with the choices of the Academy Awards committee, but it was the right decision that ""One Flew..."" triumphed in the five main categories, and this in spite of the tough competition that year (""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""Jaws"", ""Barry Lyndon"", ...). When your film is considered the best in those five areas, including best script and best film altogether, you can safely conclude it's pretty close to perfection. The story is definitely one of the most absorbing ones ever told, with courageous themes and utmost fascinating characters, and strengthened by the flawless performances of the ensemble cast. The authenticity of the asylum setting, Jack Nitzsche's music, the cinematography and about half a dozen other things all contribute to its pure genius.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
18,sunwarrior13,A Cinema Classic,10,11 January 2012,"With an insane asylum standing in for everyday society, Milos Forman's 1975 film adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a comically sharp indictment of the Establishment urge to conform. It features Jack Nicholson,Louise Fletcher,William Redfield,Brad Dourif,Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd.The film was the second to win all five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Actor in Lead Role, Actress in Lead Role, Director, and Screenplay) following It Happened One Night in 1934, an accomplishment not repeated until 1991 by The Silence of the Lambs.Playing crazy to avoid prison work detail, manic free spirit Randle P. McMurphy is sent to the state mental hospital for evaluation. There he encounters a motley crew of mostly voluntary inmates, including cowed mama's boy Billy and silent Native American Chief Bromden, presided over by the icy Nurse Ratched. Ratched and McMurphy recognize that each is the other's worst enemy: an authority figure who equates sanity with correct behavior, and a misfit who is charismatic enough to dismantle the system simply by living as he pleases. McMurphy proceeds to instigate group insurrections large and small, ranging from a restorative basketball game to an unfettered afternoon boat trip and a tragic after-hours party with hookers and booze. Nurse Ratched, however, has the machinery of power on her side to ensure that McMurphy will not defeat her. Still, McMurphy's message to live free or die is ultimately not lost on one inmate, revealing that escape is still possible even from the most oppressive conditions.Viewed more than 30 years after its release, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest remains a very good motion picture compared to present movies.Jack Nicholson stars in an outstanding characterization of Ken Kesey's asylum anti-hero, McMurphy, and Milos Forman's direction of a superbly-cast film is equally meritorious and a cinema masterpiece.The on screen battle between Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher serves as a personal microcosm of the culture wars of the 1970s -- and testament to the director's vision that the film retains its power more than three decades later.What makes it memorable after so many years is that it remains a marvel of contemporary filmmaking due to its intelligence, entertainment value, and themes such as pondering on life, manhood, and how society can be much scarier than nurses in white coats.A classic indeed.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

21,Boba_Fett1138,A perfect mixture of entertainment and drama.,9,6 August 2005,"Czech director Milos Forman seems to be obsessed with rebellious characters that don't like to go with the flow. Just think about Larry Flynt in ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" or Andy Kaufman in ""Man on the Moon"", in the two most recent movies of Forman. The central character in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" played by Jack Nicholson is also one of those characters, that wants to break the routine and even starts a revolt against the staff and nurse Ratchett in particular, in a mental institution.The movie is perhaps more comedy and entertainment than heavy drama. Still that doesn't mean that the movie isn't filled with some powerful emotional sequences. The tension between the patients and the staff gets more and more notable and grows throughout the movie, which eventually leads to a 'wonderful' ending which I'm not going to spoil.Yes, Jack Nicholson is truly splendid in his role and it seemed like he was improvising all his lines and actions during the entire movie. It was a really Oscar worthy performances, which he also received. Another Oscar winner for her performance was Louise Fletcher, which in my opinion is a bit too much credit. She plays her role well but nothing more than that. She did not deeply impressed me or anything. This movie also marks the debut for some today well known actors such as Danny DeVito (he looked so young and different!), Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif, who also received an Oscar nomination.Really one of those movies that you must have seen at least once in your life.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Touching and moving, a great cinematic experience",10,3 July 2004,"Jack Nicholson is a great actor. No, not a great actor, a spectacular actor. This is a film from fairly early in his career, as well as it is for several other actors in this film, who later have had long, great careers too, including Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. The film has some unforgettable moments... who could forget Louise Fletcher's icy stare, Jack Nicholson's smart-aleck remarks or Will Sampson's impressive, almost entirely silent performance? The film portrays the horrible truth about how patients were treated in mental institutions back then, and tells the story of someone who desperately wanted to break out, to rebel, to change things, for himself and for the others. I was compelled by this film, from the very first frame. I never took my eyes off it, and I will definitely be thinking about this film for a while. I thought it was great the way one of the very first frames depicted the institution as something far more similar to a prison than a hospital. Milos Forman did a great job of making that contrast very powerful to the viewer. The film is very moving and a truly beautiful cinematic experience. Every single actor gives a stellar performance, every single character is perfectly written, every single line, every single frame is absolutely perfect. I wouldn't change a thing in this film. It has a great pace, you never lose interest, but it never seems to be rushing to get through it, either. It's simply perfect. I have not read the original book, but if I ever come across it, I might check it out. I have only seen this film once, but I will definitely watch it many times in years to come. I recommend this amazing piece of great cinema to anyone who has at least a slight interest in the drama genre, or any fan of any of the actors, as they are all in their absolute prime in this film. 10/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Just the stare she gave was icy and induced frowns. Louise Fletcher played that role too well, almost like she was made for it.As good as Louise was, Jack was better.

Their battle of wills in a mental institution symbolizes the battle of humanity against oppressive authoritarianism, and if Nicholson's character happens to lose this particular battle, the movie implies, humanity is determined to win the war.Looked at now in historical context, this film was one of the last gasps of anti-establishment film making. Vietnam was ending, American political corruption was starting to fade into memory, and the boom years of the 1980s were not far away.

A drama with good humor in it and top notch performances all the way around. Seriously though, when I first saw this movie as a kid I did not like nurse Rached and I did feel bad about it because she was the nurse and nurses are supposed to do what is best for you. Then later I found out you are in fact supposed to hate here, and despise her and I do feel that way about her and do not feel the least bit bad about it. One of my regrets over this film is that Jack Nicholson's character did not break that witch's neck and at least take her out. Most of the movie is not quite that dark as we have a new patient that comes into a mental ward and kind of rallies the patients to go against that nurse whenever possible. He makes friend with an old Indian who never speaks and does a lot of other things during this fine movie dealing with the patients as he makes friends and tries to make their lives a little less on schedule as it were. Nicholson turns in a very fine performance and I think he won an Oscar for his role, and if not he certainly deserved one. I am not sure but I think Louise Fletcher also got an Oscar as well, and if not one was certainly deserved in her case too as I really disliked her character. The movie runs over two hours, however it is a quick two hour run time as the story and characters are just to good for it to feel as if the film is dragging. The ending though is sad and like I sad Jack Nicholson's character could have had the same fate, but man it would have been so nice if he could have just snapped Ratched's neck.

28,Wuchakk,The spirit of freedom vs. the spirit of legal-ism,9,21 October 2012,"Set in the early 60s, the story involves R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the ""mental illness"" card to get out of prison time, thinking it'll be a piece of cake, but he's wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy's ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) is a film you'll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn't 'get' a lot of the insights the film conveys.The movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their ""therapy"" is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer's expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be ""dealt with.""A lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched ""isn't that bad"" or that ""she was only trying to do her job"", etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film's brilliance: Ratched's malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she's authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.The filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Joan Crawford in ""Mommie Dearest,"" which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn't such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).McMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he's impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.Nurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That's because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that ""appearances"" are not about inward reality and, worse, ""the letter kills.""Despite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it - the humble - not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you'll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren't any good people in such institutions, of course).No review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of ""Chief"" Bromden, played effectively by Will Sampson.The film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes.GRADE: A",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Finally to see it altogether, Jack Nicholson is perfect as McMurphy. Nurse Ratched is well played by Louise Fletcher. Nurse Ratched is seen as the villain and labeled one of film history's villains. I don't see Nurse Ratched that way though. I don't know her enough. I believe she is doing her job which is difficult heading a psychiatric ward.

The constant mental battle between McMurphy (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson) and nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher) is a delight to watch. You feel so much hate for nurse Ratched. All the other actors are brilliant in their roles. You kind of want to slap them in the face and wake them up to face reality.

31,SimonJack,A novel and film of importance for their time,9,1 May 2021,"Treatment in a mental hospital. It's based on a 1962 novel of the same title by Ken Kesey (1935-2001). Kesey wrote the story after working a couple of years in such an institution in the San Francisco Bay Area. Keysey was born in Colorado but lived most of his adult in Oregon. While attending Stanford University on a graduate fellowship in creative writing, he took part in government studies of hallucinogenic drugs. He had other successful novels after this, but Cuckoo's Nest remains his signature work.All of the performances in this film are very good. And the film clearly deserved its top five Oscars in the Academy Awards, as well as the top five Golden Globes and four of the top five BAFTA Awards. Very few films in history have come close to sweeping the top five in the three major worldwide English-speaking film organizations. Louise Fletcher was superb as Nurse Rached, and Jack Nicholson as Randle McMurphy was outstanding. Nicholson was 38 years old and nearly 20 years into his career in 1975. He had reached stardom by 1970. Although he would receive two more Oscars after this, and five more nominations, nothing Nicholson has done since 1975 can come close to his performance in this film.Most everyone knows about the plot of this film, so further discussion of that isn't necessary here. I would just add that there was and continues to be some controversy over the film and what it depicts. Indeed, some actresses who were offered the role of Nurse Rached, turned it down because they saw a heavy misogynistic tone in the screenplay.My wife and I saw this film when we lived in Virginia. She was a trained RN with considerable hospital experience. Although by 1975 she was a full-time homemaker raising our children. I mention this because I've often found it most interesting to discuss a movie afterwards with someone who has a background, training or experience in a subject covered in a movie. Neither one of us had read the novel. Of course, one doesn't know how much of the novel itself may be fiction, including some possible details that may have been fabricated. Then, how much of the movie may have been fiction or revision from the novel? Just judging on her studies, continuing education of the past 10 years and reading, my wife said she wasn't surprised at what the movie showed.This was about the time that treatment and practices in mental hospitals in the U. S. had come under considerable scrutiny. Many had been changing or were about to make changes. No doubt, this movie spurred them and others into action for major changes. The biggest cultural change coming out of this period was the shift is much more treatment of mental illnesses outside of the institutions. Many more patients could remain living at home with family members, or with family and friends in their homes, or in group care homes that had more openness and freedom.In the early 1990s, when I resided in Oregon, I met Ken Kesey. He spoke at a special Holiday performance of the Portland Pops in Portland's Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall. He had made his home for many years in Pleasant Hill, not far from Springfield and Eugene, in west-central Oregon. And, although his book was based on experiences when he lived in northern California, he had adopted Oregon as his home. Since the Beaver State had become a favorite place for location shooting of movies by Hollywood studios, Oregon became the place for setting the 1975 movie. The fishing scene is the only one not shot in Oregon - it was at Fort Bragg in northern California. But the boat boarding scene took place in Depoe Bay, Oregon. Filming was also done at the Oregon state Mental Hospital in Salem, and around Salem and other locations. Except for the hospital, I've been to all the Oregon places used for filming several times and know them quite well.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

I guess this world of mistreated mental health patients has been so well documented, even if not too much changes. The film begins sensationally with Jack Nicholson really enjoying himself as the new inmate, meeting and inter relating with the existing inmates. This is Milos Foreman at his best, allowing and encouraging his actors to find their inner characters and develop a wildly exciting and believable situation to develop. Unfortunately the serious matter of misuse of what we now know as ECT comes to the fore and if the film doesn't quite degenerate into farce, it is some way from the original Foreman concept of the people being what is important.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Often regarded to be one of the greatest films of all-time, I see no reason on why we should deny it's accomplishments.Jack Nicholson stars as McMurphy, a recidivist criminal serving a short sentence on a prison farm for statutory rape, is transferred to a mental institution in 1963 for evaluation. He is anti-authoritarian with a history of violence, but he exhibits no signs of mental illness.

It's the world we poor lunatics live in, subjected to the bureaucratic rule of one set of oppressors and the economic pressure of another; forever chasing the promise of happiness, which here appears in the guise of liberty  but always obliged to swallow Miss Ratched's bitter little pills.""-	Le MondeMilos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) is arguably the most poignant cinematic social satire ever released through Hollywood  a tragic drama with streaks of bittersweet comedy lined throughout. The film uses a remote mental institute as a metaphor for society, and its odd inhabitants are likewise supposed to represent those of us who allow ourselves to be pacified by the bureaucratic oppressors. If we all rebelled like Randle P. McMurphy, would the world be a different place? And every time a free spirit like Randle is tamed, do we lose a fragment of our own freedom?Released during a time when the nation's stability was a prescient issue and Americans were confused by their own surroundings, Forman manages to channel a built-up rage that he releases through the Jack Nicholson character. ""Well I tried, didn't I? At least I did that,"" Randle (Nicholson) tells his fellow inmates of the hospital after attempting to lift a heavy water outlet from the ground. He struggles, but is unable to lift the massive slab of cement, and faces the stark realization of failure, perhaps for the first time in his life.Randle has been sent to the mental rehabilitation center after being convicted of statutory rape of a minor, and assault. His plead is insanity, but the employees of the establishment are convinced that he is faking this illness in order to avoid being sent to jail.Randle arrives for a six-week visit at the institute dressed in the clothes of a grimy everyman, complete with a beanie cap and a smug grin on his face that reeks of self-confidence. Randle soon finds that life at the institute is not as pleasant as he assumed it might be  Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) takes an immediate dislike to Randle's rebellious nature, as he continually sparks uprisings amongst the crowd of typically indifferent patients, most of whom are startled by Randle's fearless attitude. He leads his troops into battle against Nurse Ratched, challenging the triviality of daily events, questioning everyday schedules and programs, escaping to go on boat trips, and throwing wild parties in the middle of the night.Randle, through his irreverent approach to life, befriends Chief Bromden (Will Sampson), who is described early on as ""dead and dumb."" Of course, he isn't, and Randle's relationship with ""Chief"" eventually defines the essence of the film. By the finale, we realize that the story is really being told through Chief's perspective, and Randle is the link to the rest of the story.Other inhabitants of the institute include the up-tight and eccentric Harding (William Redfield), the stuttering Billy Bibbitt (Brad Dourif), the innocently child-like Martini (Danny DeVito), and Taber (Christopher Lloyd), all of whom find themselves strangely drawn to the infectious wild nature of McMurphy, who opens their eyes to the joy of life, and in the defining moment of the film, explains that they've been convinced they're crazy, and are no less ordinary than the wackos who roam the streets outside their nest. The film is not a critique of modern psychiatric treatment. Instead, Forman aims higher at a monumental allegory about society, and in doing so creates a masterpiece of comedy and drama.Forman, a Czech director infamous for his satirical sense of humor, lends a simplicity to the story that gives it a sharper edge; instead of using artsy camera shots or influential effects, Forman (who has gained a reputable career over the years and is responsible for a number of motion picture masterpieces) lets the camera take on the perspective of another patient in the hospital. We attend the daily seminars, escape for a boat trip, have an all-night party and get caught by the bitter Nurse Ratched, who witnesses the suicide of a patient towards the end of the movie and immediately insists that everyone continue on with their daily routines. McMurphy is outraged by her ignorance and schedules, and his proceeding actions eventually seal his own fate.The film owes most of its success to Nicholson, whose career-defining performance has never been surpassed ever since  he isn't just playing McMurphy, he is McMurphy. With the beanie cap and the faded jeans and the general cynical edge of a man abandoned by society, Nicholson portrays McMurphy flawlessly. He was one of the big screen's first anti-heroes (followed a year later by the equally iconic Travis Bickle), and still remains a priceless capture of a time and age in America's past when its citizens  feeling betrayed by the Vietnam War  had no place to turn to, and in the end, slipped into a daze of self-destruction.The movie took home all five primary Oscars in '75, making it the first film since ""It Happened One Night"" (1934) to have a clean sweep of Best Director, Best Actress, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture. Needless to say, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" deserved them all, and is still an amazing motion picture masterpiece, even 29 years later.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Basically the film is confined inside a mental institution, among a breed of patients, a newcomer McMurphy's arrival stirs Nurse Ratched's tyranny, whose strategy of manipulating those deranged is to coerce them into retread their horrible past and force them suffer under the name of group therapy, such a detestable character, Louise Fletcher nailed it, a borderline leading role, Fletcher's Oscar victory may raise some controversy, but her performance is impeccable in accentuating a devilish incarnation of obstinacy and ruthlessness. Nicholson won his first Oscar in his heyday, as McMurphy, a petty criminal has a sane mind, threatens the authorities as a black sheep in the group, whose devil-may-care boldness and utter naivety (assuming that the institution is a much better place than a prisoners' reforming farm) conflicts in the process of his freedom-seeking and his direct influence on other real mentally-impaired ward mates, ultimately, his tragedy is a boomerang to his gullibility and self-considered kindness, which squanders his best shot of escape and obliquely preconditions Billy's final breakdown. The ambivalence of McMurphy's heroic recklessness is the most intriguing topic of the film, he is not an amiable fellow, a ruffian on the street with a rebellious attitude, it is not in his intention to ameliorate his fellow mates' condition, his presence does not have an initiative motivation, what he does is his knee-jerking response of a living soul who hankers for an unsubdued environment which the society refuses to proffer. There are many political allusions can be extracted from the film, to which I shall not refer since I am no American and am unfamiliar with the history, but the film garners a great amount of impressive supporting performances, Dourif's big screen debut is stutteringly poignant, whose demise is a facile move in heightening the tension, but performance-wise, it is more awe- inspiring than the two leads aforementioned. Sampson, as the Chief, symbolizes the hope of the unsuppressed, his back-story is curtailed and his pretense has never been given a chance to be expounded. Two old-hand actors are surprisingly seen in this film when in their youth, a tough Lloyd and a meek DeVito, and many deceased names also, Crothers, Redfield and Lassick, the latter is another show-stealer, over-the-top but strikingly hilarious. Forman's preference over classical music also reflects in the film, the opening score from Jack Nitzsche hums along with a melancholic tone and the symphony-driven pieces are inserted into the right place at the right time. There are many memorable shots, e.g. Nicholson being electric-shocked and Fletcher being strangled are too authentic to stare, on the whole ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a sound accusation towards high-handed suppression and dominance, its sociological impact even rises above over the film's own integrity of a gem made with excellent cast and wry irony.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
38,Red-Barracuda,A definitive New Hollywood film,10,4 April 2011,"On occasion the Academy gets it spot on. When this movie won the top five Oscars for film, director, actor, actress and screenplay it wasn't in the least bit undeserved. In fact, it should have picked up another one for Brad Dourif's incredible support performance as the troubled Billy Bibbet. But in this instance the Academy played it traditionally and gave that statuette to the elderly George Burns in an act of sentimentality. Still five out of six isn't bad.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is an example of the type of film that the major studios used to turn out back in the days known as the Hollywood Renaissance. In those halcyon days a number of challenging and provocative pictures were released by the big studios. It was a golden time for cinema and auteurs. This film is prime example, seeing as it is clearly aimed at an adult audience and it is not afraid to be shocking. Despite having an uplifting finale, Cuckoo's Nest is anything but a happy film. There is a great deal of humour but it's interspersed with a lot of bleakness and downright depressing scenes. It's not afraid to take risks with its audience; it ultimately respects them enough to do so. For instance, if this film was to be made today, do you honestly think the central hero would be a man jailed for statutory rape with an underage girl? Its details like this that mark out this feature as something designed to challenge its audience.Acting is universally magnificent, with Jack Nicholson truly in his element as the charismatic R.P. McMurphy. It's one of the all-time great examples of screen presence. But really there are no weak links in the rest of the cast at all. Louise Fletcher of course won the other acting gong and deservedly so with a cold unglamorous role that she nailed to a tee. The aforementioned Brad Dourif was perhaps the best performer of all though, his Billy Bibbet is truly an incredibly skilled creation. Everybody else was great too.Serious dramas don't really get a lot better than this. It you haven't seen it you really owe yourself the pleasure of experiencing this magnificent film for the first time. And if you have seen it, read the novel it was based on by Ken Kesey, and see the whole story from the slightly different perspective it was originally conceived with. I'm sure you won't be disappointed with it, it's a literary masterpiece. It's one of those rare times when both book and film attain the very highest standards.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

40,OllieSuave-007,"It's a great, maddening drama.",9,28 November 2015,"This is a great drama about felon R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) who gets himself transferred to a mental institution to escape labor duties in prison. Once there, McMurphy gathers a group of the mental patients to rebel against the oppressive and authoritative Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).For a drama, the plot is incredibly well-paced from start to finish, which keeps you captivated at the story, from McMurphy's heated exchanges with Nurse Ratched to him breaking the patients out to enjoy a day of fishing. The characters are well-developed as the plot delves into the individual backgrounds of each of the main patients, including Taber (Christopher Lloyd), Harding (William Redfield), Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), Chief Bromden (Will Sampson), Martini (Danny DeVito), Fredrickson (Vincent Schiavelli), and Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif). The therapy group sessions between them and Nurse Ratched are what I think the highlights of the film as it generates the film's mood, plays on the minds of the patients and instigates the ensuing drama and tension.Great acting by the actors - my particular favorite is that of Louise Fletcher. She portrayed the nurse as just a person doing her job, almost oblivious to her authoritative, cold stance and power-hungry grip. The characters generate both sympathy and indifference - especially that of Nicholson's character.Great drama throughout and it all leads to an incredible ending.Grade A",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
41,ElMaruecan82,"Existence is defiance ... Thinking is subversion ... ""One Flew"" is inspiration ...",10,6 March 2011,"Looking at the gray screen, R.P. Mc Murphy comments an imaginary baseball game with such enthusiasm the images seem to come alive. All the inmates of the Mental Institution are laughing, cheering and shouting, while the head administrative Nurse, Mildred Ratched, asks for silence. But for one brief instant, they're free, and this freedom, as illusory as it is, has never been so palpable, it was freedom to challenge the authority, to transcend the limits of a blanked out TV set this short but powerful moment perfectly illustrates the philosophy of Milos Forman's masterpiece ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". One of the all-time greatest films and most inspiring invitations to rebel against the tyranny of establishment.In fact, the greatness of the film exceeds the context of the story, but I think what makes it so impacting is the presence of a clear antagonism through the interactions between two polar opposite sides of human nature : order and rebellion. Order is represented by one of the most iconic and despicable cinematic villains ever: Nurse Ratched, perfectly portrayed by Louise Fletcher. A woman, whose soft voice, cold eyes, and passive aggressive attitude is the incarnation of the cold tyranny of rules, as sterile and unproductive as they are. Doesn't this ring a bell? You know, where every thing must go the way it has always been, for no other reason than that the opposite reality would be dangerous. What deviates, what is different disturbs and must be brought back to the road, or eliminated. Fascism? Not so far. Anyway, this tyranny does have a castrating effect on the inmates, all males. And the liberation will come from the protagonist, R.P. Mc Murphy, Jack Nicholson at the peak of his career, playing his most inspiring and unforgettable role. McMurphy as the character who best defines Nicholson.McMurphy, with his inseparable beanie, malicious eyes, pornographic cards and foul-mouthed (body) language, is not just the hero of the film, he's also a tragic icon of New Hollywood, a wave that provided one of the greatest films of history. Almost a Christ-figure, this is a man who will sacrifice many opportunities to be free, in order to free other inmates from an unfair perception. From the dictatorship of a society that treats them as outcasts, as people who deserve to be domesticated, to repress their nature, if they want to become or to be considered as normal. This is the ultimate freedom, the one of the spirit, almost Nietschian: to accept yourself instead of trying to be accepted by society, and screw society if she labels you as crazy. It's your freedom of thought and any form of thought is subversive. This defiance is taught by McMurphy as soon as he enters the lives of this world made of weird faces, funny attitudes, and unpredictable reactions, after discovering the masquerade. They are this way, because they're asked to follow some rules whose only purpose is to give a pseudo meaning to their lives, because life is supposed to be guided, to be punctuated with rituals and cycles, it's the lobotomizing effect of routine: medication time, music, exercises, the so-called therapy where they have to share their problems, highlighting the true sadistic behavior of the Nurse. They don't even realize how alienated they are, and how this monotony will never solve anything but just keep them away from the rest of the world, maintaining a normality in microcosm.McMurphy breaks this routine, making Nurse Ratched his enemy. His free-spiritedness grows on the inmates who start talking, raising their hands, challenging the power: the ultimate rebellious attitude. And another strength of the film is the ambiguity of McMurphy's character who might as well be perceived as a rebel who just want to make a mess, while Ratched is the one who tries to maintain some order. Those who label Ratched as fascist will probably face the pro-Ratched who'll consider McMurphy as an anarchist. But this is an intellectual debate while the movie deserves to be taken on a more emotional level to understand how Ratched is the true villain of the film. Her irresponsible sadistic behavior will provoke one of the saddest cinematic death, not because she deliberately wanted to kill but she was so coldly heartless, she didn't find another way to assess her power. She obviously regretted the act when it was too late, but she pushed the level of respect and obedience to the extreme, twisting the concept of order into dictatorship.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is not about who's crazy or who's not, after all, before the fishing scene, didn't the inmates ironically look like doctors, especially the famous Dr. Scanlon? It's about resurrection of repressed personalities, through playing poker, basket-ball, fishing, drinking, having fun, becoming ourselves, by refusing to be passive and to be the actors of our own lives. The film is driven by a wonderful supporting cast, probably the most memorable non big-star supporting cast where each character is authentic in his own way, Cheswick, Sefelt, Scanlon, Harding and the tender, fragile and suicidal, Billy Bibbit  and of course, the Chief, who like us, is the witness of this dramedy. The Chief, whose growing friendship with McMurphy will lead to one of the most heartbreaking and noblest gestures, the most inspiring movie ending, sublimated by the scream of Christopher Lloyd as Taber.A sad ending foreseen by McMurphy in this unforgettable long close-up during the party scene, McMurphy probably figuring that this will end badly, that there's something so rotten in this world, it's better to enjoy the present without caring about tomorrow, the meaning of this close-up remains a mystery, even if the next scene brings some answer. But men like McMurphy are indispensable to prevent order from becoming an alienating force. And instead of being lobotomized by the obsessional psychological tyranny of being normal, anyone should be able to flee over his own cuckoo's nest.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
42,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Lighthearted and free-spirited yet surprisingly dark and ultimately poignant.,7,19 March 2018,"This eclectic tale of a sane man pretending to be 'insane' in order to gain a lighter sentence manages to make a few poignant commentaries on society, freedom and acceptance while also maintaining a dark core story that isn't afraid to be bleak but also isn't afraid to be fun. 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975)' keeps a lighthearted and free-spirited tonality that allows for the more pessimistic points to have extra punch whilst never spoiling its overall 'live free' message. The fact that it is so free-flowing can sometimes lead to a lax pacing, however, and the increasingly tiresome escapades of the protagonist can become a little, well, tiresome after a while. The film ends up as an affecting and memorable experience, though, one that highlights the 'odd' in 'oddball' but makes it work wholesale with an amazing central performance from Nicholson alongside some surprisingly super supporting performances - including a few familiar faces, too. 7/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
43,gbill-74877,Brilliant,9,2 February 2021,"From top to bottom, one of the all-time great casting jobs was done for this film. The electroconvulsive shock therapy scene is one of the most horrifying and disturbing of any kind that I've ever seen as well. This is just a fantastic film, truly immersing us into a mental institution and the feeling of powerlessness.Even though he's crude, the rebellious Randall P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) does more to help these patients than the nurses do because he treats them with respect, and as people. As he puts it, they're ""not any crazier than the average asshole on the street,"" but they're subjected to a system that strips them of dignity and whatever remaining power they have over their own lives. It's a system perhaps needed for those who have completely lost touch and are chronic, but which is broadly applied, unnecessarily, to all. It's a system where electroconvulsive shock therapy may be used as intended, therapy (albeit questionable even in that way), or as a cruel punishment at the whim of a self-righteous nurse (Louise Fletcher), who revels in exerting absolute control over her emotions and the lives of those around her. On the surface the staff are there to help the patients via therapy, but it really seems to be about power, and the resulting struggle between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched is memorable.There is also a subtle comparison of the powerless and humiliated patients to the plight of Native Americans via the character of Chief (Will Sampson), something perhaps more notable in Kesey's book, which was narrated through the eyes of this character. The scenes at the end with this character were devastating, and absolutely haunting. Great film.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

This is just a flat-out perfect film and I could not say anything to criticize about this amazing film.This movie is pretty much about some guy named McMurphy, a patient at a mental hospital, who wants to change the routine of the hospital. But Nurse Ratched will not stand for that.This and Chinatown are the films that brought Jack Nicholson into the public spotlight. He is just too darn good in this film. I also loved the performance by Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched. She is not the typical villain per se, but she affects her patients psychologically rather than physically. I also mention actors such as Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif because they were all really good.This movie certainly deserves the Oscars it won back in 1976. Also the score, cinematography, and the rest of the film is just too good. My favorite scene is the fishing trip that I felt brought the inmates closer together. I cannot see how anyone would dislike this. I rate this film 10/10.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

I loved at the beginning, he was kissing on one of the guards cheek because it looked as if he was free to go from the asylum but he really wasn't. This movie made us give attention of history, Mental Institutions were cruel and horrifying places for those individuals with disabilities. I thought Murphy absolutely loved spending time with the patients, he deeply cared about them regardless of name-calling or language he used. It really did get me thinking while I was watching the movie. I was astonished that Danny De Vito was Martini, he looked so different and I know well what he looks like! I thought he was just a person who was just involved in the movie. Well there you go, you just find out these things out of the blue! Christopher Lloyd was brilliant too, he looks so very much different from a crazy nut of a doctor to a mentally disturbed patient. I thought the ending was really upsetting, I honestly was heartbroken that Murphy was lobotomized and the Indian guy smothered him because he didn't want to suffer.

50,ironhorse_iv,You have to be crazy to hate this movie! This movie is a masterpiece,9,8 March 2015,"Put a straightjacket on me, because I think this movie is insanely good! Based off, Ken Kesey's novel of the same name and directed by Milos Forman, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest tells the story of Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a convicted criminal admitted to a mental ward, when he pleads insanity, to escape labor duties in prison. Once there, the rebel, wild-man, McMurphy bump heads against the authority figure, and head administrative nurse, the oppressive Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) on the way, she treats her patients. McMurphy believes that they should be treated like real men with more personal freedom, while Ratched couther his argument by stating that any more freedom, would lead to chaos, anarchy, and death. In my opinion, while she play as the villain, she's in fact, she was somewhat, right and correct by her judgment, but the way, she enforced order on the mentally disable in highly crude and inhuman. In fact, by egging McMurphy on, she made things much, much worst. One might view this movie as anti-institution, anti-religion or anti-government. One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was written in 1959 and published in 1962 in the midst of the civil unrest. It deeply changes to the way psychology and psychiatry were being approached in America, while also challenging, how government should treat its people. By the end of the 1960s, the controversial movement towards deinstitutionalization has become, a real deal, while trust in government officials were in an all-time low. When 1975 came, most of the mentally ill found themselves, untreated and living in the streets and government being highly criticism for corruption and overused of power. The 1970's were bit anarchism at the time. It wasn't until later, that things became more balance and confinement. In a way, social institutions do serve a purpose; and the movie serves as allegory tale, showing how things like order vs chaos can become really off-balance. The movie really goes into deep detail on how different authorities, McMurphy and Ratched control individuals through subtle and coercive methods. A supporting character like the Chief (Will Sampson) talks about 'the Combine' in reference to the mechanistic way, both manipulate and process individuals. Nurse Ratched controls the inhabitants of the novel's mental ward through a combination of emasculation and subtle shame. While, McMurphy controls his fellow men by encouraging them to be wild men and challenge conformism. It was no surprise that both Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicolson won Best Actor/Actress at the Academy Awards that year, as both delivered such a gripping, gritty, and genuine performances. The movie has just as good, supporting cast with several unknown actors of the time, stars like Christopher Lloyd, Danny Devito, and Brad Dourif helping in. I like how the movie was shot. Forman's direction is dead-on, as he manages to capture the monotony of routine on the ward without allowing the film to drag. You get how eerily quiet it is. Order is impose on the patients with almost religious cult-like rigor. When the medicine is delivered. It's like communion. It's so zombie-like. The animal running along a man-made chain fence- representing wild vs civilize. The movie is full of hidden gem themes like those examples. Yet the movie was missing a few things from the novel such as the Fog which symbolize a lack of insight and an escape from reality and McMurphy's Moby Dick Boxer Shorts, which interpretation as a phallic symbol and blatant sexuality. It can also represents the pervasive evil that inspires Ahab's obsessive, futile pursuit. Both Ratched and McMurphy is trying to humiliation the other, by exposing the faults of each other's gender. A third interpretation is that Moby-Dick stands for the power of nature, signifying McMurphy's untamed nature that conflicts with the controlled institution. Although it's hard to find fault, it's certainly possible. Overpowering women are seem to evil by the writers and weak women are shown to act like sex object. It's somewhat noticeable that the movie is a bit misogyny. Another thing, is the movie's love letter message to society anarchy and black and white approach when it comes to, the hospital vs the patients. Another fault of the film is how the Chief was cut down as the narrator and put into a much smaller role. Much of his life prior to the hospital was not shown. You see a lot of Native-American themes throughout the film, despite that. The music by Jack Nitzsche, sounds something out of a western. It's represented the struggles of true freedom over confinement. Despite its dark and strong drama undertones, there were some comedic tendencies. It was a lot of fun to watch, as the drama slowly evolves into tragedy toward its conclusion. It's wasn't slow and painful. It was a very entertaining, well rounded film. The movie has aged well, with newer DVD copies, putting out the best quality for it. Overall: The film is powerful, and moving. It's a must-watch. I recommended it.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
51,kenjha,Crazy is Funny,8,5 December 2009,"The Kesey novel about the inmates of an insane asylum is turned into this Oscar-fest by director Forman. Nicholson comes alive as the convict who convinces authorities he is crazy rather than a criminal and then creates havoc at the asylum. Fletcher is perfect as the strict, unemotional, and rather sadistic nurse that Nicholson clashes with. The other inmates are excellently played by a cast that includes then unknowns like De Vito and Lloyd. Dourif is impressive in his film debut. The first half of the film is the best, particularly the therapy sessions that are both funny and poignant. Later, it turns serious and loses some its momentum.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
52,The-Sarkologist,"A film that deserves its praise, but comes nowhere near the quality of the book",8,6 January 2012,"If there is one thing that I would suggest that is strange about this film is that how could a film, based of a book written by a known drug user (Kesey loved LSD) that is clearly an attack at conformity and control in society be made into an academy award winning film. Personally that is a question that I do not know the answer too and in a sense probably can never know the answer too, though I do know that this book, written amongst the beat generation as an attack upon government, has now become required reading in highschool (I believe, though I know that I read this book when I was in highschool). I guess one of the reasons is that while this book is now a very popular book, it looks back at a time that we do not know and cannot remember, and thus in a sense sanitises the message. In fact there are a lot of books that are now on our reading list in which the writer, at the time, was considered a reactionary against the status quo, and in some cases, found themselves locked up as political prisoners. It is not until years after their death that the true literary genius of the work becomes appreciated.As for the film, I must admit that it simply does not impress me in the same way that the book does. In fact it is a very rare incident where the film is as good as, or even better, than the book. The rare case would be where the book was utter rubbish, but a film maker comes along, who actually likes the book, and is able to create out of the book a film that encompasses what the film maker likes about the book. While that does not necessarily hold true in this case (the book is far better than the film) I do feel that this is what Milos Foreman has attempted to do here, that is try to capture the essence of the book in a new media.For those have seen the film but have not read the book then I would encourage you to do so. I do feel that he does try to capture the essence, however there are numerous aspects that would be very hard to do, such as getting into the chief's mind, and even trying to bring out his paranoid schizophrenia. In the book the Chief is the main character, however the main character in the film is McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), and while the Chief plays an important role, he is not necessarily the central figure.Like the book, the film focuses on the conflict between McMurphy and Nurse Ratchett, however I noticed that in the film, Ratchett seems to always hold all the cards, and McMurphy tries, and fails, to beat her. This differs from the book where it is clear that McMurphy seems to always have the upperhand, namely because he is a central figure among the patients on the ward. He is their leader, their messiah, the one who opens them up and makes them feel confident with themselves. Further, in the book, there is actually quite a high bodycount, one which Ratchett tries, but fails, to pin on McMurphy. In the film only Billy Bibbit dies, and when McMurphy responds in the way that he does, it does not seem to have the same impact. The book is clear in that after McMurphy busts Ratchett's vocal chords, she does not have the same hold over the ward as she did previously, and moreso, there is the scene where McMurphy literally defrocks her (though it is still a metaphorical sense in which he rips off her clothes) which further emasculates here. She is never the same again afterwards, but this is not the same in the film. It is clear that Ratchett still retains her sense of dignity, and it is clear (as opposed to the book) that it is McMurphy that has been emasculated.Finally, I wish to suggest that in the film we have less sympathy for the patients than we do in the book. Throughout the film they are fighting and bickering amongst each other, and both Ratchett and McMurphy sit back to watch them go at each others throats. Obviously there is Ratchett as judge, jury, and executioner, with no appeal allow, and this is similar in the book, but in the book McMurphy does take control of the meetings, and the ward, over that of Ratchett, and every time Ratchett believes she has wrenched the ward back from him, McMurphy has pulled the rug out from underneath here. This is in particular with the Doctor, whom McMurphy builds a good relationship with, while in the film, the Doctor is clearly on Ratchett's side, meaning that one weapon that McMurphy clearly has in the book, has been blunted in the film.Don't get me wrong, this is a good film, but the more I think about it, the more that I come to realise that what has happened is that a popular, and well written book, has one again been blunted by the Hollywood machine to create a scene that is more palpable to the powers that be. While books are much less expensive to write, and require a lot less investment (even more so in the days of the internet), there are numerous authorities that need to be pleased for a film to be released. It is only where the film is produced outside of the American mainstream (and even the tremendous amounts of funding are still required) that the standard is relaxed, and we are able to see films that challenge the status quo.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

The acting from the entire cast is absolutely brilliant, especially Jack Nicholson, but sadly this could not save the film for me. I found it dragging with too much talking and too little happening. Yes, it is a very well made film. Yes, it was interesting to see how the criminal (Nicholson) changed everyone's lives and added life to their otherwise monotonous existence. Nevertheless, I'm not fond of talkies, and also found the film just too long to remain interesting.Somehow the film also seems pointless in the end. The film revolves around proving whether the criminal is insane or not, but they never follow through on this...",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

I didn't require CGI and untalented famous celebs to be featured in it. All it needed was talent and a superb story.The movie was filled with legends of that time.

It's based on a novel that I'll never read.

I also liked the performances of Will Sampson as Chief Bromden.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is a movie which show us a man (Jack Nicholson as McMurphy) who is committing crimes and then he fakes being crazy and goes to a mental hospital for treatment.In this mental hospital he constantly comes into conflict with a superior nurse who is really strict.

58,zkonedog,One Of The Most Intriguing Characters (And Plot lines) You'll Ever Watch,10,11 March 2017,"Far too often, movie-goers of the current generation dismiss films from the 1970s as ""too old"". You see, the film might not be spotless, the fashions may be out of date, and no computer- animation is in sight. Fortunately, films like ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Next"" exist to show that some themes are relevant in ANY era.The basic plot of ""Cuckoo"" centers on R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a troublemaker who is being ""evaluated"" by a mental institution because, frankly, the law doesn't know what to do with him anymore. During this trial period, however, McMurphy (clearly no crazier than the lot of us) begins to ""stir up"" the other ""patients"" by trying to get them to stand up against the domineering Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and showing them that a real life doesn't have to include pills, wanderings, and white uniforms (especially when he finds that most of them are ""voluntary"" anyway!). Unfortunately, for McMurphy's sake, this ""rash"" behavior sends a ripple effect through the entire facility that ends up in disastrous effects for him.Having a wee bit of experience in the mental-evaluation field, I can say that the issues presented in this film are still being hashed out on the ""battlefields"" of such facilities to this very day. What is ""crazy""? How can one detect it? Is it possible to fight against institutions of the state? Upon finishing the viewing experience, those questions (among many others) will float around in our head long after the TV is turned off.The incredible acting in the movie also increases the enjoyment factor exponentially. Nicholson is brilliant, as usual, while the cast of ""cooks"" (including a very young Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito) are at times a riot, but also can be quite touching. Plus, Fletcher's Nurse Ratched (though never outwardly violent) is one of the creepiest, most hated characters in the history of cinema.Thus, if you have never seen this film, please go out and do so NOW! It may not be overtly flashy like the big-budget epics of today, but its message and acting will immediately rank it quite high on your ""favorite films"" list. It deserved every Academy Award it won in 1975.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
59,eddie_baggins,An ageless classic with an all-time great central performance,10,30 March 2021,"An ageless Oscar winning classic that has lost none of its power in the years that have followed its release, Milos Forman's quintessential drama One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is an incredible feat of movie-making that is surely one of the most perfectly molded examples of finding an actor suited to a particular role as Jack Nicholson takes charge as the incarcerated R. P. McMurphy and delivers one of the very best cinematic performances in the process.Following the hi-jinx and exploits of McMurphy as he finds himself transferred from prison into a hospital facility for the mentally unstable, a facility that is overseen by the dastardly Nurse Ratched (played unforgettably by a steely-eyed Louise Fletcher), Nest is at times heart-warming, at other times heart-wrenching and frequently very funny as Nicholson and his fellow inmates/cast members remain front and centre throughout as McMurphy tries to maintain his unique sensibilities as well as help those around him in very dire situations.From the moment we are introduced to McMurphy from the films opening scenes right through to the films much talked about finale, Nicholson is a force of nature in Forman's effort and he commands your attention whether or not his commentating a make believe World Series baseball game or taking himself and his compatriots on an unsanctioned fishing trip, its a tour de force piece of work, an undeniable act of performance power but also not the sole reason Nest has managed to become the revered work it is.One of histories most underrated directors, Forman's work behind the camera that captures screenwriters Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman words is equally as on song as Nicholson's main turn, while the ensemble that was recruited for Nest's cast is one of the all-time great examples of casting with the likes of early times Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Douriff ably supporting Nicholson and Fletcher with help from industry veterans William Redfield, Sydney Lassick and a scene stealing Will Sampson as Chief.Watching these performers work with one another and off one another is an absolute delight, it doesn't take long before you're completely hooked on the journey McMurphy and his fellow patients are on and throughout the film you'll laugh, cry and feel that rare joy you get from watching such a well put together piece of storytelling that's humanity and heart is constantly on show from beginning to end.Final Say -There's a reason why One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest often finds itself near the tops of peoples favourite films list, a resounding success in all areas and a film that features one of the all time great lead performances, Milos Forman's classic is top-tier stuff.5 Monopoly pieces out of 5.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
60,johnnyboyz,This is one cuckoo's nest you're going to want to take the time to visit.,9,7 August 2007,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is not just a good film for fun and entertainment; for people watching it for its funny script and great Nicholson performance, but it's also a great film as it contains numerous clever conventions and tricks that really help you zone in on the situation and ultimately, put you there in the film with everyone else.Although set in a mental institution, I never really got the feeling the bulk of these people were, indeed, 'crazy'. The group that we are presented with seemed fine, just a little socially inept perhaps apart from the character of Martini (De Vito) whom was a little odd. I first had this suspicion when I saw them all playing cards with one another to reasonable success although McMurphy's (Nicholson) expertise in card playing later on only emphasises the incorrectness from earlier on. Martini's so pleased to be finally playing cards correctly that he just keeps exclaiming: hit me, hit me, hit me. This idea of having a comic and often dramatic film set inside one of these places makes for pure gold.This brings me onto the character of McMurphy. Obviously the audience watching this film aren't as crazy and (hopefully) aren't as socially inept as the characters we focus on in this film so that means we're going to relate to him the most as he's the most like us although some may swerve more to Billy (Dourif). Although brilliantly acted by Nicholson, he is further emphasised through the fact he's not wearing plain white like the rest of the inmates, meaning he stands out. McMurphy's reactions to what was going on, especially during the group therapy sessions, also stood out as they were pretty much my reactions also! I was smirking and looking confused at what was happening; McMurphy even gets restless with these people, something we all would feel after a while in that situation.Also, watching McMurphy's relationship and friendship build up with the character of the Chief (Sampson) is just as fun as it is fascinating. There's this huge, native American who's supposedly dumb and deaf yet McMurphy gives him all the time in the world to try and develop him. The basketball game scene is particularly memorable in its hilarity and the way in which it shows Chief engaging and succeeding in what it is he's been told to do. Remember: we think he's dumb and deaf.Another piece of clever film-making is the Chief himself. In a way, I think the Chief is perhaps supposed to represent the audience in the sense that if the audience was a character, they'd be the Chief. He doesn't talk or do much (similar to what an audience does when they watch a film), he helps McMurphy out when he gets involved in a fight with a guard (Whilst I was watching, was praying someone intervened and it just happened to be Chief) and we even see things from his point of view (the only time it happens in the film) as McMurphy winks at him to show he's OK. So this is very much putting the audience in the film as one of the characters; of course this is played with later on when certain things are revealed and regarding whether or not people escape: I find it very symbolic who does and who doesn't.In conclusion, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is just one of those films that is funny, engaging, entertaining and is actually a very smart film considering what I think it does regarding all the characters and everything. This twinned with the character of Nurse Ratched (Fletcher) who I stress isn't so much as evil as she is doing her job, still looms every now and again threatening privileges. I am not surprised this film won so many Oscar's as it would still do today  a great and very memorable film.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
61,filipemanuelneto,A masterpiece that everybody must see,10,16 December 2015,"This film tells the story of R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), whose criminal record earned him a season in a labor camp. To escape this verdict, this smart guy decided to pretend to be crazy in order to serve the sentence in a mental hospital. In this new environment, McMurphy show resistance to rigid and austere rules of behavior imposed on patients and zealously fulfilled by the head-nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), causing a number of situations where he seeks, in his own way, returning to colleagues the joy of living.Directed by Milos Forman, a veteran of the seventh art that this film helped to immortalize, this movie has great actors, among which are a remarkable Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson, who took here one of the most memorable performances of his career. Sydney Lassick, Brad Dourif and Danny DeVito, in the role of some patients in mental hospital, are also noteworthy. It's a film about freedom and resistance to oppression, a film that teaches us to seek out the good side of things, even in the worst circumstances, and that the worst prison is what we do about ourselves when we give up. The film is full of scenes that range from humorous to the touching but conquers by it's bewildering end, seemingly incomprehensible until we reflect about it and understand the kind of freedom that McMurphy was entitled.Touching, exciting, touching, are adjectives that aren't enough to properly characterize this true work of art, whose beauty was dimly reflected in awards it has received, and which contained the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Drama, Best Actor Drama, Best Actress Drama, Best Actor Debut, Best Director and Best Screenplay and the Oscar's for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

63,TheMovieDiorama,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is brimming with memorable characters.,9,2 March 2018,"Films today just don't have that sense of story and character, it's more visual narrative and overacting. There's no overacting here, every performance is understated in their own unique way. Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, is cool, calm and collected and yet her mannerisms exude terror. Her authoritative figure and soft spoken voice just adds to this, so much so that the patients in the state mental hospital are petrified of her. Randle McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson, is just a common criminal who to start with plays along with the other patients. However, upon the realisation that he may not ever get out...he starts to find ways in order to escape. I found his performance captivating and clearly he is great and portraying crazy people, just look at The Shining. He is able to control the smaller scenes with his charisma and own the bigger crazier scenes with his excitable energy. His raucous behaviour puts the other patients at risk of certain procedures such as the controversial electro therapy. What really compelled me was the similarities between the mental patients and the outside world, to which McMurphy says that there is no difference. The screenplay for that scene, well every scene actually, brings life to each character. From the first 30 minutes, every character's personality and state of mind is indicated to us. There are no boring characters, each of them have unique qualities and that is something you don't see in every film. Loved the fishing boat scene, adored Chief's and McMurphy's friendship and appreciated the time and effort spent on character interactions. The way they talk to each other in the therapy sessions just felt natural, and to balance the screen time between them all was just genius.

67,jzappa,"It's a Comedy in the Truest Sense: It's a Tragedy, Too.",10,7 February 2011,"Whether it's better or not, the persistent battle in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and whom it's between serves as a secluded epitome of the culture hostilities of the 1970s more creatively, engagingly and powerfully than Joe, Midnight Cowboy or Five Easy Pieces before it, matched perhaps only in that regard by They Shoot Horses, Don't They? The big difference is that Cuckoo's Nest is hilarious, and a comedy in the truest sense: It's also a tragedy. There's a quietly unmitigated close-up of Nicholson a little more than halfway through. We become aware of it because it hangs on warily. It shows R.P. McMurphy pensive. It comes at the match point flanked by the mirth and mischief of the previous portion of the film, and the closing deterioration into misfortune. What is he feeling? Is he plotting more insubordination? Grasp that all is hopeless? The vagueness of what McMurphy is thinking is the film's driving ambiguity. It all leads up to a late scene where he's found asleep on the floor next to an open window. Has his soul finally expired? Subdued for the post-classical '70s into a fable about society's imposition of conformism, it almost knowingly disregards the truths of mental illness so as to turn the patients into a set of snuggly characters ready for McMurphy's egging on. We learn that one is not actually mute, one doesn't have to stammer, and others need not be debilitated by introversion or dread. They'll be healed not by Nurse Ratched's medication, Muzak and counseling sessions, but by McMurphy invigorating them to be guys, to watch the World Series, go fishing, play basketball, get smashed, get laid. The memo for these miserable patients is: Be like him.The movie's naive attitude toward psychosis is not actually a weakness of the movie, as it has no concern with being about that. It's about a freethinker in a lockstep system. Nurse Ratched, who is so uncompromising, so insipidly certain she's right, characterizes the American ""cult of motherhood"" at its militant maximum, and McMurphy is the local color who wants to escape from her form of society. The movie is among other things deeply afraid of women. The only two depicted optimistically are McMurphy's hooker acquaintances Candy and Rose. I mean this as an comment, not a censure.McMurphy's backstory is inferred early on. He was sentenced to a prison farm for doing the deed with an underage girl, and has been sent to the mental institution for ""evaluation."" He's observably a rabble-rouser, and yet acutely egalitarian: He takes the patients head-on, treats their disorders as choices that can be reordered, and attempts by pure power of determination to break them free into a nibble of independence. The movie views them that way, too. The cinematography and editing provide reaction shots that nearly always have the same implication: A given patient's rigid expression is misconstrued thanks to the new perspective given by McMurphy. For instance, McMurphy has stolen the boat and has the group aboard. When he's interrogated, he introduces them all as doctors, and there are quick cuts to close-ups of each one looking vaguely formal like clockwork. This has nothing to do with mental illness but everything to do with slapstick.Nicholson's performance is one of the acmes in a lengthy career of enviable anarchists. Jack is a much-loved American presence. And if his performance is rightly praised, Louise Fletcher's, notwithstanding the Oscar, is not valued enough. This may be since her Nurse Ratched is so meticulously loathsome, and since she exemplifies so utterly the traits we all have been trained to fear in a particular variety of female authority, a woman who has fused sexuality and sympathy into responsibility and rectitude. Dressed in her distantly militaristic nurse's uniform, she is at once bondage mistress and dungeon master, followed everywhere by the petite, non-speaking nurse who is her altar assistant.Since we react so ardently to her we barely see Fletcher's performance. Her uncanny composure, her pokerfaced ""fairness,"" her obstinate observance of policy, as in the scene where she orders McMurphy to get a majority vote in order to watch the World Series on TV, regardless that a majority of the patients don't comprehend what they're voting on. Later, when McMurphy's ultimate fortune is settled on, note how the male overseer hesitantly proposes he be returned to the prison farm, though Ratched resolutely gainsays him.This great human comedy stays everlastingly well-liked as a subversive fable, but realizes its triumph by thoughtfully electing to utilize the mental patients as droll exaggerations. This initiates the fishing excursion, which is simultaneously the most enjoyed, and the most deceptive, scene in the movie. It's McMurphy's noble-cheerful flip of the bird at Ratched and her breed, but the oomph of the sequence can't camouflage the anxiety and bewilderment of men who, in several instances, don't know where they are, or why. Bear in mind by contrast the understated, late-night monologue by the Chief, who talks about his father. This is a window into a genuine character with genuine and fascinating issues, and leads up to the bittersweet release of the very final scenes.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

And yeah, I guess there's something there. Everything in this film simply works. And it works very well together. Jack Nicholson as the chaotic McMurphy and Louise Fletcher as nurse Ratched, who controls the mental ward with an iron fist, are both phenomenal in their roles. Nicholson is of course Jack Nicholson, but Fletcher's role, especially right next to Nicholson's, also must be praised. You're constantly being kept wondering whether her efforts to force the patients into an iron tight, rigid order are because that's what she believes will help them or is it just because she truly doesn't care and simply wants everything to go exactly like she prefers.It's also a really professional-looking film. Cinemacraft at its finest. Although, I have to admit that 60s mental hospital is not exactly the most exciting of locations, but then it's a character movie anyway. The score is also atmospheric and moody in just the right way. The opening shot alone instantly sets the pace.I guess sometimes you just have to admit that you don't know something.

I said it looks into issues of mental health, rebellion (and the ways it can be conducted), failing institutions and tyranny and control.

74,dee.reid,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" - 10/10",10,24 August 2003,"It is widely believed by a number of critics that Milos Forman's 1975 Best Picture-Winner, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (only the second film in history to win all five major Academy Awards), is an anti-establishment, anti-conformist, anti-anything.  I think it's all of those things, plus the most crucial element that some seem to be overlooking: You can't defeat the human spirit.  This film is remarkable in its portrayal of people who are uniquely human, and director Milos Forman knows this, especially during the opening scenes at the hospital when he shows us the patients going about a daily routine of standing in line awaiting medication.  Jack Nicholson is brilliant in a winning performance as R.P. McMurphy.  As McMurphy, Nicholson is a rebellious con artist who faked insanity to avoid time in jail, and is sent to a mental hospital where he encounters the dispirited patients and runs afoul of Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).  McMurphy begins to enlighten many of the patients, including Billy (Brad Dourif) and Chief (Will Sampson), a mute and deaf man who everybody thinks is retarded.A truly unique film that isn't to be missed.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

78,CubsandCulture,"Complex characterization leads to poignancy, symbolism.",10,6 January 2019,"On first viewing it is so easy to see this film as the tragedy of how our individualism is crushed by the system and the man, who in this case is a woman. McMurphy is nothing if not an individualist. Nicholson uses his natural charm to imbue McMurphy with the American iconoclast spirit. One first viewer it is so easy, perhaps too easy, to see Nurse Ratched as a domineering petty bureaucrat who wields power for its own sake. Fletcher is unreasonable in her reasonableness. The characters are strikingly linked. He's freedom and license and chaos. She is control and order and discipline. McMurphy and Ratched are the fire of the 60's being put out by the vinegar of the 70's. This story has survived time because its interest are so of the time it was made. Add in a critique of institutionalization and this is a very good film on first viewing.It is only on future viewings do you see the true greatness of the film. Ratched has her good points, and McMurphy has his bad points. Yes he an individualist but he is also antisocial. Yes she delights in arbitrary power but she uses it judicially. To the film's great credit I think both characters can be read as anti-villains or anti-heroes and this complex nature makes the drama hit all the harder. They *both* are directly causal in a tragic fate of Billy.Forman directs with a precision here that is very much need to support the screenplay's nuance. This film just gets better with age.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
79,estebangonzalez10,McMurphy vrs Nurse Ratchet,10,15 September 2010,"¨ And now they're telling me I'm crazy over here because I don't sit there like a vegetable. Don't make a bit of sense to me. If that's what being crazy is, then I'm senseless, out of it, gone-down-the-road, wacko. But no more, no less, that's it.¨ R. P. McMurphy is one of my favorite movie characters and probably Jack Nicholson's best role to date (although he has had several great and memorable ones). It is as if he was destined to play this character all along, and will forever be remembered as this over energetic guy trying to help and free his fellow patients from the order, discipline, and boundaries set by his nemesis, Nurse Ratched. The movie may be criticized by a few people for not portraying psychiatric patients truthfully, but that wasn't the purpose of the story. This is a very smart tragic comedy that focuses on the struggle between a complicated free spirited man (who happens to be a criminal as well) and a very cold, over controlling, and disciplined Nurse who thinks her way is the only right way to do things. She runs the institution like a General who orders his soldiers. Her treatment doesn't seem to be helping her patients at all, and only seems to refrain them, while McMurphy's crazy, radical, and anarchic behavior actually improves their well being. A clear example of this is that Nurse Ratched is so blind and focused on doing things her way that she doesn't even realize that Billy has stopped stuttering. Maybe she did notice it, but since it wasn't accomplished by her methods she makes sure he goes back to being his usual self by blaming him for his actions. Louise Fletcher gives a terrific performance playing this cold hearted character so well; she isn't your typical villain who knows is evil and only wants to hurt people, she actually believes that she is right and that her methods are the only ones allowed. The two characters are so different from each other that they just end up complimenting their performance. The reason we love McMurphy so much is because he represents the fight against abusive authority figures, such as Nurse Ratched.For those who aren't familiar with the plot I will briefly explain it. R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) has been sentenced to prison for several assaults and a rape conviction. The guards have doubts whether or not he is mad and needs mental treatment or is faking it, and therefore is sent to an institution where the doctors can analyze his behavior. Little does McMurphy know that in the ward he is placed at there is even someone more controlling than the prison guards, Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) who runs the place with absolute authority. Among the very submissive patients we have Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), who has suicidal impulses, Harding (William Redfield) who suspects his wife cheated on him although he has no believable proof, Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), Fredrickson (Vincent Schiavelli), Taber (Christopher Lloyd), and Martini (Danny DeVito). McMurphy catches his eye however on Chief Bromden (Will Sampson) because he could be useful to him due to his big size and seems to be outside of everyone else's radar (including Nurse Ratchet) since they say he's deaf and mute. McMurphy befriends the patients, plays cards with them, basketball, talks about the World Series, and tries to teach them a thing or two about being men (he even finds a way of taking them fishing). He defies the Nurse's authority and makes a bet with the rest of the patients that he can put an end to her daily hospital routines and break her, but when McMurphy realizes that in the institution he doesn't have a release date like he would have at prison he tries to find a way to escape.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic that has enjoyed success ever since its debut in 1975 , and it continues to be beloved by movie fans around the world today (it ranks at #9 on the IMDb Top 250 Films of all time). It was actually only the second film to date to win the grand slam of Oscars: Best direction (Milos Forman), Best Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Actress (Louise Fletcher), Best Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman), and Best Picture (Saul Zaentz and Michael Douglas). The screenplay was adapted from Ken Kesey's novel and he wrote after his own personal experience when he volunteered to work at a Veteran Hospital in California. The screenplay took a different approach (so much so that Kesey sewed the film and has refused to watch the final cut,) in the novel the Chief narrates the story. The film will be remembered for its very memorable characters, and there are several great scenes in the movie (when McMurphy narrates the imaginary World Series game to the guys, when he takes them fishing, his confrontations with Nurse Ratchet), but it will also be esteemed for the very climatic and powerful ending. This is truly a great film and has stood the test of time. This is a must see movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

84,slokes,Flower Power's Last Hurrah,7,1 May 2006,"""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" feels like a movie lost in time because it is, a 1970s release set in the early 1960s, influenced by the late 1960s and, if the IMDb is an accurate measure (and I think it is) as popular today in a culture drastically different from those eras mentioned above.Why is it ranked below only 11 other movies all-time as of this writing? I have no idea. It's an incredibly well-acted film, by a cast of no-names who would go on to popular careers (and two who didn't, Brad Dourif and Louise Fletcher, give the best performances). It masterfully builds tension, unfocused at first, to a point where it is barely endurable. There's nice bits of comedy to leaven the proceedings.Jack Nicholson, whose lead performance as inmate R.P. McMurphy is also something of a title role, tells the director of the mental institution where he is being admitted that he got into trouble because he liked ""fighting and f---ing"" too much.Normally a Nicholson film would leave it there, letting you soak in his rude, rough nature. Here the official gives the expected embarrassed nod, then raises his eyebrows. ""In prison?"" he asks, and it's McMurphy's turn to blush.Ken Kesey's novel ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" came out just as the Camelot period of the 1960s was ending, and signaled the start of the ""do-your-own-thing"" ethos that permeated the rest of the decade and which Kesey himself preached. All that was just about over by the time the movie came out, and the message of doing your own thing had found widespread acceptance only in its mutated, discofied, coke-addled form.The film is so committed to its gritty, realistic aesthetic that it never makes clear who to root for. McMurphy, more in the movie than the book, is out for himself, his interest in shaking up the inmates having less to do with any humanistic urges than a desire to have more interesting people around him to steal cigarettes from. Fletcher's Nurse Ratched is widely accepted as one of filmdom's great villainesses, except Fletcher's nuanced performance suggests someone more blinkered than bad, sincere in her concern for her charges, even McMurphy. When she does commit a rather harsh act late in the film, it's so out of character it feels like a cheat.Maybe I'd like this film more if I was a bigger Nicholson fan, like everyone else. Especially in the 1970s, he always seemed to play variations on the R.P. McMurphy character. I'd be more impressed with Nicholson's career if he played Nurse Ratched. But it's a good film, very tough in the way director Milos Forman plays off the texture of the famous documentary ""Titicut Follies."" The acting is so naturalistic it's like the actors never knew when the cameras were rolling and just improvised.It reminds me in that way of another film made in 1975, ""Nashville."" Me, I would have given ""Nashville"" the best picture Oscar over this. And I would have given ""Jaws"" the nod over both of them. But according to the voters of IMDb, the ""Cuckoo's Nest"" Oscar was one of the most deserved in history.

89,Steffi_P,"""You're not a goddamn loony now!""",5,6 February 2011,"The 1970s were the golden age of politicised cinema. Race, sexuality and militarism all came under fire more than ever before. Meanwhile, the loosening up of codes governing motion picture content meant that pictures were now more frank about sex, violence and other taboos. While this was generally a good thing, what it really brought out was that for all the social advancement going on women were still very much the losers in the sexual revolution. A case in point is One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, a picture of spiteful misogyny wrapped in the politics of mental health.Now I'm not normally one to pick apart a movie for ""hidden"" meanings, but in this case the subtext is unequivocal, unpleasant, and has rarely been discussed. It begins as early as the excusing of McMurphy's criminal past. In the first scene at Doctor Spivey's office his conviction for statutory rape is played down, passed off as natural, and the fault of the girl in any case. On the ward, it is the tyranny of women in authority that keeps the all-male patient group down, preventing them from enjoying such stereotypically masculine pursuits as gambling over cards, watching baseball, going fishing and, of course, getting laid. Even the handful of females in the story whom we never see – Billy's overbearing mother, Harding's unfaithful wife – are portrayed as villains and causes of the patients' being committed. The only acceptable women in this worldview are ones like Candy; they don't answer back, aren't educated and aren't fussy who they sleep with.But of course, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is hailed as a passionate plea for the rights and dignity of mental patients. And it does truly make some commendable points about institutionalisation. It gets a lot of things wrong too though. The idea that those diagnosed with mental illness do not require professional attention has never been substantiated (on a side note, isn't it interesting how the mid-70s was also the time when the anti-psychiatric cult Scientology first began to gain currency in Hollywood?) It's also worth pointing out that lobotomies do not leave people in a vegetative state, and while I would never condone the procedure, the implication that a lobotomy renders someone fit only for euthanasia is an insult to all the living people who have undergone one. And surely the message of the movie is somewhat blunted by the fact that it's set fifteen or twenty years before it was made, during which time there had been significant reform in mental health provision. Of course, the movie's defenders may say the exact accuracy of the psychiatric hospital setting are irrelevant, as it is supposed to be a metaphor for something more wide-reaching. I suspect that ""something"" is little more than Ken Kesey's misogyny.In spite of all this however, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is admittedly very well made. Milos Forman is a superb director, one who eschews long takes but makes remarkable use of multiple camera set-ups. His shots, while not exactly glaring close-ups, are nevertheless composed to focus us entirely on people, with very few wide-shots. This has the effect that we become barely aware of the dimensions of the set but become totally absorbed in the human story. One of the most brilliantly crafted scenes is the first ward meeting where they discuss Harding's problems with his wife. Forman keeps several of the ""chronics"" in the background of those talking-head shots, both to remind us of their existence, and also for the dynamics of the scene – for example Bancini's twitching arm which sets the pace of the mounting tension. Forman's coverage and the magnificent editing by Richard Chew create a very rhythmic form of visual storytelling for the scene's conclusion, as we cut from the agitated Bancini being lead away by the orderlies, to Vincent Schiavelli resignedly puffing out cigarette smoke, to Jack Nicholson's accusing glance at Louise Fletcher, to her steely and self-satisfied glare. It's as if every shot is a subtle comment on the one that went before it.Speaking of Nicholson and Fletcher, one cannot ignore the superlative acting in this picture. In the lead role Nicholson is completely unbridled, simply letting his trademark wild-man act run riot, and yet he tempers it with moments of seriousness, dropping the act and becoming compellingly real for example when he proposes to rip out the hydrotherapy unit and escape. Fletcher by contrast is a model of understatement. Just below the icy exterior you can see her anger and resentment bubbling away, and even when she does give way to her emotions you can see her character trying to restrain them and maintain that professional gloss, spitting out her lines through clenched teeth. Each of the patient characters is superbly cast, with performances that range between attention-grabbing craziness to devastating realism, and this goes for the men playing the so-called chronics as well.One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is a massively popular and highly-acclaimed movie, and though I have some huge reservations about it, I can fully understand why it is so widely enjoyed. It's themes and ideologies are often abhorrent – a fact that should not be overlooked – but it is undoubtedly a stunning piece of cinema.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

By this time it has been well-established that this is a truly great film, with an excellent multi-layered script and an absolutely brilliant performance by Jack Nicholson. However, I think the true strength of this movie is partially in the supporting roles. The supporting cast never turns into lame caricatures of mental patients, all of them give very realistic performances. Their characters are mentally unstable, but they're still real people you can side with. They're likable guys, and they need to be because otherwise the contrast with nurse Ratched wouldn't work out. Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd, Will Sampson, Danny DeVito, in my opinion these guys add just as much to the movie as Nicholson does. Furthermore, this film has one of the most memorable endings I've ever seen. It's so fitting, it's so touching, and despite the nature of it it still leaves you strangely satisfied.

93,pc95,Getting to the Bottom of R.P McMurphy - Great Movie,8,5 April 2009,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a multi-faceted movie that works on a couple different levels. On the one hand it's a character drama involving the lead Randolph McMurphy played well by Jack Nicholson. He is a brash and alert prone to anger individual Probably on the greater hand it's a commentary on the state of psychiatry in general including many of it's pitfalls and flounderings. The whole problem with psychiatry as the movie alludes to is that there's just too much conjecture and unknown. Is someone ""faking"" it, or is there something deeper? What is mental illness - and to what extent does it work? These are some of the questions the movie brings. Moreover, the movie includes some great scene including the fishing trip, basketball game, and the romping party. I particularly liked Christopher Lloyd's support as the yeller and provoker. McMurphy meanwhile brings empathy and caring for his ward-mates and clearly is struck with cabin-fever, and who wouldn't be. To be forced in place is the idea of prison, the restriction of freedom and liberty - anyway - early on the audience is warned of his prior behavior, so there's little surprise. The performances of the movie are top-notch as is the cast-mix. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is well deserving of it's acclaim. Recommended.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Nowadays almost all filmmakers believe they can only make a good movie by adding loads of special effects and lots of huge explosions ... This movie is so good, so convincing without them. The actors played their roles in such a convincing way that you would think these weren't actors at all, but real psychiatric patients.This movie may be 30 years old, but it hasn't lost any of its relevancy. OK, we don't put our mentally ill people in that kind of prisons anymore, the bars in front of the windows have gone and now we call it hospitals in stead of nut houses. But the treatment hasn't changed all that much. I once worked in such a hospital as a volunteer and still saw things like forced feeding, giving people so much medication until they no longer know who or where they are,...When the movie first came out, some people were shocked because when you watch the movie, you can't help it feeling more attached to the patients than to the doctors and nurses.

95,brando647,Jack Nicholson's Best Performance,8,6 March 2012,"Jack Nicholson is at his best in this classic Oscar award winner from 1975. ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is one of only three movies in the history of the Academy awards to win the ""big five"" in it's year: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Actress. For the uninitiated who might not recognize the scope of such an achievement, just know that's incredibly rare and very impressive. The film is based on the novel of the same name, written by Ken Kesey (whose renowned in other circles for his band of Merry Pranksters and his electric Kool-Aid acid test in the sixties). The novel was originally based on Kesey's own experiences working as an overnight orderly in a sanitarium, the movie is said to very slightly (the book was written from the first-person perspective of the Chief, a supporting character in the movie) but otherwise remains accurate. Randle P. McMurphy (Nicholson) is transferred from a work farm penitentiary to a psych ward when his penchant for fighting arouses questions of his sanity. McMurphy sees his new home in the ward as a chance to cruise an easy life until he is released but fails to realize when it entails. The ward is overseen by the strict Nurse Ratched, a cold-hearted woman who takes her position unwaveringly seriously and shows little interest in seeing her patients as human beings. In his time at the ward, McMurphy makes it his goal to inject a little life into his new ""feeble-minded"" friends and light a fire under Nurse Ratched's miserable rule.Nicholson rightfully won the Academy award for his role here as McMurphy. It's probably my favorite role he's done; one of his best, right up there with his insane performance in THE SHINING. He's an over-confident, free-spirited goofball and you immediately rally with him on his crusade against Ratched. He struts into the ward one day and immediately rattles the establishment. His explosive approach to life begins to work more effectively on the patients that anything Nurse Ratched has attempted. For the first time, the patients on the ward are speaking their minds and it isn't sitting well with the staff. Louise Fletcher is the iconic Nurse Ratched, a performance that has been paid homage to hundreds of times over the years. Ratched is considered one of the top cinematic ""villains"" of all time, but I have a hard time buying into that. Ratched is a horrible person, no doubt about that (and played to cold perfection by Fletcher). But she doesn't come across to me as someone who's inherently evil. She's just doing her job and happens to totally lack in compassion. Her perpetual restrained anger and steadfast desire to follow procedure, regardless of how miserable it leaves the residents of the ward, makes for a fun conflict between her and McMurphy. Still, as great as Nicholson and Fletcher are, the real scene-stealers in this film are the exceptional supporting cast.Let's name some of the highlights: Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd (in his first major film role), character actor Vincent Schiavelli, and the debut of Brad Dourif. The patients on the ward are a great collection of eccentric performances and great personalities. DeVito is hilarious as Martini, a feeble-minded man who appears to find infantile joy in just about everything, and Lloyd is downright psychotic as Taber. He plays the character with just a hint of rage inside (you can see if in the end as he's staring on during the final McMurphy/Ratched confrontation), but enough that you kind of wonder how he's allowed with the general populace. As for Dourif, I didn't even recognize him the first time I saw the movie. He does an amazing job for his first major film and I'm a bit surprised he went on to more eccentric genre performances than valuable dramatic roles. And these are just the recognizable faces in the crew; everyone in the ward does an astounding job of earning the audiences affections, especially Sydney Lassick as Cheswick. It's impossible not to feel sorry for the poor guy as he begins to cling to McMurphy, practically idolizing him. The cast in this movie is superb and the best part of the experience. The movie itself is engaging and contains some of the most iconic moments in recent cinema history (the Chief's escape has been parodied just about everywhere). It can move a littler slower at times and it sort of gets off track for a moment when the patients take a field trip, courtesy of McMurphy. Otherwise, it's a totally engaging film and a memorable experience.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
96,Takethispunch,Superb drama with superb acting.,10,19 June 2016,"In 1963 Oregon, Randle Patrick ""Mac"" McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a recidivist anti- authoritarian criminal serving a short sentence on a prison farm for the statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl, is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation. Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment.McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a strict authoritarian woman who passive-aggressively employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients and keep them submissive. McMurphy finds that they are actually more fearful of Nurse Ratched and her methods than they are focused on their main goal of eventually becoming functional in the outside world. In order to help them achieve this (as he believes), McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader of his fellow patients.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
97,sme_no_densetsu,A classic of the seventies,8,27 January 2013,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is one of the signature films of the 1970s. Based on the 1962 novel by counter-cultural icon Ken Kesey, the movie focuses on the rebellious R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) as he becomes immersed in life within a mental institution. Over the course of the movie he bonds with his fellow patients and steadfastly opposes Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and her dictatorial ways.One of the things that ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is known for is for winning Oscars in all of the so-called 'big five' categories. These include Best Actor & Best Actress, with awards going to Nicholson & Fletcher, respectively. Both contributed excellent performances but they also benefited from some fine support by the supporting cast of mostly unknowns. Early appearances by Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd & Vincent Schiavelli are augmented by notable work from William Redfield & Scatman Crothers. And who can forget Will Sampson as the taciturn Chief?Czech director Milos Forman was also honoured by the Academy and so were screenwriters Lawrence Hauben & Bo Goldman. Between them, they found a way to approach the material that was simultaneously authentic, humorous and emotionally resonant. Among those who lost Oscar bids, particular recognition should go to cinematographer Haskell Wexler and composer Jack Nitzsche.In the final analysis, I feel that the story takes a little while to hit its stride but once it does it ably sustains the viewer's interest right up to the memorable finale. It was up against some stiff competition for Best Picture so the fact that it took home the Oscar is a testament to its overall quality. That being said, I feel that it may be just a tad overrated, though it is undoubtedly essential viewing for any movie lover.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

99,Screen_Blitz,Jack Nicholson flies over the cuckoo's nest,9,19 May 2016,"It is difficult to say which cinematic role defined the meaning of Jack Nicholson's career, whether it's his portrayal as the sadistic psychopath in Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining', the iconic DC villain 'Batman', or his role here as a criminally insane convict with the thirst for rebellion. Regardless, Nicholson has made a man of honest talent, and his talent still lights up to this day. This five Oscar-winning (including Best Picture) adaption to Ken Kessey's acclaimed novel shows this fine actor in what is arguably one of his most roles of his career. Directed by Milos Forman, Jack Nicholson plays McMurphy, a long-time criminal who is caught for criminal activity and sentenced to prison by the court once more. Upon the start of his prison sentence, McMurphy pleads mentally insane in hopes of escaping prison labor and is sent off to an institution for the mentally unstable. Upon arrival, McMurphy witnesses the dispiriting treatment of him and his fellow inmates by the hands of Nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher). Disgusted by her superiority and mental abuse, McCurthy takes matters into his own hands and rallies up the inmates to an effort to start a rebellion against the nurse. Unlike the critically acclaimed dramas such as 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'Green Mile', this movie supplements a more light-hearted and less somber take on the prison genre. Milos Forman grants a fair charm and ingenuity into what almost feels like a Stanley Kubrick-style picture. This director plants an engaging narrative material and a decent sense of dark humor from the ever charismatic Jack Nicholson. His character is the pinnacle of charm and entertainment as he builds solid chemistry with the supporting characters and a heated rivalry with the antagonistic Nurse Ratched who is blessed by a sinister portrayal by Louise Fletcher without giving an over- the-top or downright evil vibe, but of someone who simply doesn't understand the harm she causes. This actor delivers a darkly comical performance to portray the stark and colorful protagonist. Aside from his performance is a large roster of actors including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Brad Douriff and many others who turn in some fine performances but perhaps less memorable. There are moments of laughter, moments of dread, and a few scenes of shock, particularly the ending. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a triumphant achievement by Milos Forman that demonstrates a fantastic performance by Jack Nicholson and a solid script. This movie is a must watch for film buffs everywhere as it serves as a good exploration into the early years of Jack Nicholson's career.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
100,punishmentpark,"Row, row, row your boat...",9,31 July 2013,"I haven't read the book, and judging by some reviews, that's for the better. I've watched this one before, but it was a long time ago. The big question seems to be whether or not McMurphy is 'crazy' or not. Well, he is and he isn't.... He is, for thinking he is going on a vacation in a mental institute. But he isn't, for taking on his co-patients as his true peers and the mental mafia (not to badmouth psychiatric aid, but in 'One Flew...' they don't come off quite well) as his enemy.It's a deeply intense story, where many details really boggle the mind. For instance, why does nurse Wretched have such power over Billy? With one reference to his mother being her friend, she instigates his suicide. This should be unthinkable nowadays, as well as back then. This demeaning of patients, which in this particular institution is more rule than exception, can, with the 'wrong' patient in the room, create mayhem.And there is more to be considered; about the behavior of McMurphy and the Chief, as they both are faking. But the problem with that is, no one in their right mind would fake anything just to get into a mental institution. It is another awkward case of that catch 22, where really there is no right answer to the question.The film takes on even more issues when shock treatment and lobotomies come in, which makes this an important film, especially in those days - I'm not sure if it actually influenced anything for the better, but I wouldn't be surprised if it did. The popularity of the book, the play and the film could hardly have gone unnoticed.P.s. I just found out that the writer of the book, Ken Kesey, wanted Gene Hackman in the leading role. Personally I'd doubt very much if he would have pulled it off as greatly as Jack Nicholson did. The rest of the cast was a joy to behold as well, which really helps make this one a true classic.In many ways a perfect film, but still I'd like to have learned more about certain patients (not in the least McMurphy), their problems and the ways the psychiatric staff dealt with them. 9 out of 10.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

It's one of those movies where you feel like the characters are ones you just want to love. Jack Nicholson was far beyond the boundaries of amazing with his performance. Randle Mcmurphy is one of the best characters of all time, and Jack Nicholson was perfect for the part.Okay, so the movie takes place in a mental institute because Mcmurphy pretends to be crazy so he can go to a mental institute instead of going to jail. He doesn't realize that the institute is in fact worse than prison itself. However, he does make friends with patients of the institute. He soon makes friends with The Chief (Not that other guy from Halo), the only Indian throughout the whole movie. I don't want to spoil anything about the character but he is just as amazing as Mcmurphy in terms of character and likability.I'll stop there in terms of the plot. Watch the movie to truly understand how gorgeous this movie really is. This movie could possibly make you cry, so get tissues just in case. Maybe this movie could help promote mental institutes being horrible Nazi-like places.P.S. If you thought PIXAR movies could really get to you big time in terms of emotion, WATCH OUT, 'cause this nearly breaks the emotional barrier of PIXAR movies. It breaks your heart.Gorgeous movie.

102,pyrocitor,"Both uplifting and disheartening, sometimes both at once",10,14 January 2005,"I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as ""one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles"" and ""one of the classics of the 70's"". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a ""crazy house"" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.-10/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
103,Sirus_the_Virus,Deserved all of the awards it won.,10,6 February 2010,"One flew over the cuckoo's nest is an amazing film. It deserves everything that it won for in 1975. It won for best actor(Jack Nicholson), best actress(Louise Fletcher), best director, and best picture of 1975. The performances were spectacular, so was the direction, and so was the film itself.Who knew that crazy people could be so much fun? Wow I shouldn't have said that. Really there is nothing funny about a crazy person. Thast's why I disliked All about Steve. I hated that movie. But this is a classic. From it's beginning to it's dramatic climax the film amazes. I have always thought Jack Nicholson was a great actor. But here he does something else. He does what he usually does, but it's an improvement. I know, how could such a great actor improve his already great career? Trust me, it's possible.Nicholson stars as R.P. McMurphey, a man being sent to a mental institution. He isn't crazy though. He is just acting crazy so then he doesn't have to go to prison. Of course he doesn't actually want to stay there, but it's better than jail.McMurphey is a carefree guy. As you can clearly tell by watching the film. But McMurphey isn't fond of Nurse Ratched(played excellently by Louise Fletcher). Nobody is, cause she's more like a dictator than a doctor. So McMurphey rounds up the mental patients(such as a young Christopher Lloyd and Danny Devito)and try to irritate her.Louise Fletcher is so good in this film. She really gets under your skin. And there are many plausible scenes with her in it. Such as when she gets strangled. She irritated me so much that I actually laughed when she got strangled.Nicholson's performance really goes without saying. He plays the same cocky character that he always plays. But here he does his best work. So, as you can tell, this is an amazing film that must be seen.One flew over the cuckoo's nest: A",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

105,baumer,The second best movie of 1975,8,22 May 2000,"Cuckoo's Nest is a great film, there is no doubt about that.  But unfortunately this film swept everything that year at the Oscars and Jaws was left out in the cold.  Now Jaws is the film that I consider to be the best film ever made and because of it I used to have a personal chip on my shoulder about Cuckoo's Nest.  I could never understand why a film like this one was so much more heralded than Jaws.  But now that I am little older I can appreciate the fact that the Academy is really quite political and there was no way that a 27 year old director was going to beat out Milos Forman for best picture and best director.  But that aside, I have to admit that ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is one fantastic film.  I just had to get that out of the way first.Jack gives, what I think, is his best performance ever in film.  Here he a driven, tenacious and determined man.  I can only think of two other characters in film that exhibit qualities like Randal McMurphy, and those are Rambo and Indy.  But seeing as McMurphy is more real and more believable, that honour has to go to him.  Cuckoo's Nest is an inspirational film and if there is one line that will always be remembered in this film, it is the line, "" Well at least I tried, ***dammit!""  That is the epitome of what the film and the character are all about.  Sure there is the underlying theme of the common man against evil society but I like it better to think of it just as a film about one mans struggle to rise to the occassion and conquer some very stacked odds.What is also great about the film is to see some actors early in their career.  Brad Dourif, Danny Devito and Christopher Lloyd all have roles in the film and they have all gone on to have extensive careers in the Game. 
There really isn't much more I can add to what Cuckoo's Nest is all about, I'm sure you have seen and read it all before.  All I can say is that is an inspirational movie about not giving up and standing up for what you believe is right.  And it is done extremely well.  It is not as good as Jaws ( nothing is ) but that is not a fault of it's own.  Milos Forman is no Steven Spielberg but that is another story and this film...... ah hell, why don't we just leave it at that.  It's a great film and Jack is at his best.

106,hall895,A Nicholson tour de force,8,26 October 2006,"Every great once in a while there comes along an acting performance which elevates a very good movie and turns it into something very special. Jack Nicholson gives just such a performance in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. He is so good, so perfect in every way, that you are willing to overlook any minor quibbles you may have with the film and simply appreciate the magic and majesty of his performance. This is certainly not a perfect film by any means but the story is so powerful that it almost couldn't help but be a success no matter who was in the lead role. Placing the manic, irrepressible Nicholson center stage takes what always would have been at worst simply a good movie and makes it into something truly memorable.Set in bleak 1960s Oregon, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest follows Randle Patrick McMurphy, as played by Nicholson, a troublemaking prisoner sent to a mental institution even though he is rather clearly not insane. At the very least when compared to the men who will become his fellow patients on the ward McMurphy is clearly the most sane, the most ""normal"" of the bunch. The men he encounters have been beaten down by the system. They've had the individuality, in fact their very lives, sucked out of them by the oppressive atmosphere in the institution. To these men, McMurphy will be something of a savior as he tries to show them there can still be more to life than their dreary day-to-day routine, some hope and joy even behind and hopefully one day beyond the institution's walls. Where McMurphy with his boundless energy, sharp wit and zest for life attempts to bring life into the ward he meets his match in the cold, domineering Nurse Ratched, played with perfect icy detachment by Louise Fletcher. Nurse Ratched very much likes having the men of the ward firmly under her thumb and will not react kindly to having her methods and authority questioned by the brash newcomer in the group. The conflict between McMurphy and Ratched is quite clear. They are fighting a battle for the minds, the very lives, of all the men on the ward. Both Nicholson and Fletcher fall into their roles perfectly. No accident both walked away with Oscars.Where Nicholson and Fletcher are clearly the key figures here the rest of the cast is spot-on as well. Each of the patients on the ward is quite unique and all of the actors involved do a terrific job of bringing these characters to life. Notable in what were very early performances in their careers are some soon-to-be familiar faces, Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd. Brad Dourif as stuttering Billy, Will Sampson as silent Chief...the list of quality performances is staggeringly impressive. These fine actors bring this tremendous story to life. There are some moments which may seem a little out of place, perhaps a little forced. And there are times where things move a little more slowly than one might like. But whenever the movie threatens to really begin to drag there is a burst of Nicholson energy to propel it forward. Enjoyable and thought-provoking, in the end the film manages to be both uplifting and heartbreaking all at once. From the screenwriters to the director, the cinematographer and the wonderful cast it's a brilliant job all around.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
107,marcin_kukuczka,G****** marvel of unique genre!,8,29 April 2007,"Although Milos Forman is not my favorite director, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is one of those movies I find unforgettable and highly recommended. It's storyline is, perhaps, not that action filled, its colors also might seem faded for some viewers, yet, this movie really has a magical power that makes it unique and involving, even if you watch it reluctantly. Why?It's a movie with a seemingly simple plot, with a few characters, but the characters are so well developed that you will find them close to real. That is a very important aspect, particularly concerning this genre since the content of such a movie, as a matter of fact, is primarily built upon characters. The focus seems to be put on McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) who comes to a mental institution as a punishment for having an affair with a minor. However, within the several minutes of watching the film, you realize that you are in a sort of claustrophobic world consisting of patients overcoming problems with their psyches. Everyone is there for his own, has his own trouble, on the one hand, but, on the other hand, they are in a group and get over together. Like in the minority of films, you see characters as real people, there is no room for any cliché! Let me consider the few most appealing ones.Whom does McMurphy meet when he arrives? Among many there is Mr Harding (William Redfield) who is desperate, mocked by others and feels ""peculiar"" because he suspended his wife of marital treason. There is Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), desirous to live alone and to have his own cigarettes at last. There is a giant Chief Bromden (Will Sampson) allegedly deaf who lives within his odd world. There is, foremost, a rigid nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) who does not stand new ideas for the schedule. Finally, there is Billy (Brad Dourif) who is upset due to unfulfilled love. Yet, he does not give up searching a woman... McMurphy appears among such peculiar people and where everyone deals with his tiny world, his claustrophobia of emotions and desires. However, what he (McMurphy) does, how he reacts is absolutely unexpected and astonishing...These characters are presented in memorable moments. First, if you decide to see the movie, pay attention to the boys' talk with Harding, the way they mock him through self-defense. In fact, everybody partly knows that there is something wrong with them, yet they mock others to defend themselves, not to be found ""peculiar"", not to become scapegoats. Second, a mention must be made of the whole memorable sequence when McMurphy takes the boys fishing. It's just humor combined with a terrific atmosphere and a feeling of realism. Finally, Billy's plot is particularly interesting with the shocking ending...But most people will probably agree with me that the strongest point of the movie, except for good direction, good development of characters, great moments, are... the performances. Many reviewers mention this aspect as no.1 and they are absolutely right. Yes, Forman's film can boast one of the best acting ever! Jack Nicholson does the marvel of acting. He is tremendous in this role from the very start to the very end. The swear words that he often uses suit here, there is no exaggeration, no foolishness, no ""bad vulgarity."" Who can forget him saying ""I am the g****** marvel of modern science!"" Louise Fletcher also does a fine job as the nurse expressing feelings galore. Consider her moment when she gives medication to patients, for instance. William Redfield is terrific as Harding with his mimics, his uniqueness among the rest. And Will Sampson as the Chief...what a choice! If there are top notch performances in a movie, that is where you can find them! ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a unique film. It constituted a vehicle for Nicholson where he showed his talent memorably. It also maintained in my memory as one of those films that helped me understand the ambiguity of human psyche (the ending exceptionally proves that). What more can I say about this movie...quite a difficult story, in general, but very well presented; quite odd characters, but extremely well developed; quite a number of unknown staff (as seen from the perspective of 1975) but real actors-artists. If I were to rate the film in general, I'd give it 8/10, but if performances only, 10/10 with no hesitation! G****** marvel of unique genre!",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

A brilliant, yet deeply disturbing and frightening look at the human rights catastrophe that was insane asylums in the early 1960's. All the same, it serves as a greater allegory against the oppressive authoritarianism and violence that swept the nation at that time. In many ways, you can argue that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a horror film. McMurphy is a little off, but not stark raving mad, and yet he still winds up locked away with a garden variety of mental patients at an Oregon psychiatric ward. He attempts to outsmart and conduct a coup over the head nurse Ratched, who runs the asylum with the grip of a fascist dictator. It's hard to watch the dynamic between the patients and Ratched, especially when you remind yourself that much of what this film is based upon isn't fiction. Psychological torture, shock therapy and lobotomies. They really happened in these institutions. By the film's end, our nerves are so rattled, that the sight of Chief bashing through the window with a water fountain to escape the asylum is cathartic and exhilarating.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Not many films have shown us what a mental hospital is truly like. The tough scenes from Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Changeling have us gasping but this representation shows us a true heartbreaking dramatic struggle of right and wrong for patients and the treatment in which they receive. The rules to maintain the peace are justified through strictness and a lack of activity for new opportunities.Enter Randall McMurphy, a man who wants to bring the outside world into the safely maintained hospital. Nicholson's Oscar turn as central character McMurphy shakes the plot up and gives a stunning feeling of freedom to a place confined by rules. So convincing is the Easy Rider that you feel he has the potential to set you free.The supporting cast couldn't be more impressive. Fletcher, De Vito, Lloyd, Sampson and an unforgettable debut performance from Brad Dourif as Billy. One of the finest collections of actors ever cast.Portrayals aside this is all about the concept of freedom in a place which wouldn't allow it, a fight against all odds. This is not like a romantic drama where the guy has to fight against his mistakes to win the girl, this is about a battle. A long fought battle of emotions that brings the best and worst out of people that will scar the contestants for life. The strong concept of freedom is juxtaposed against ideologies of suicide, punishment, sex, loyalty and professionalism, making a highly dramatic story, an important watch, which isn't for the fainthearted.The setting for this 1975 picture gives the story a dark image, even though it appears white and pleasant.Winner of 5 Oscars, One flew over the cuckoo's nest raises important issues about the system and people's well being and with stand out performances it is one of the most important films you will see for a long time.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Jack Nicholson was already a star, but this film made him an untouchable. The nurse Ratched character is still the quintessential metaphor for any unlikeable woman. The film swept all the major Oscars. It isn't hard to see why. It is funny, touching, insightful, and wonderfully acted. The truly great ones are all these things.Jack Nicholson plays a thirty-eight year old habitual criminal who has faked his way from a prison work detail into an insane asylum in 1963. For no other reason than his presumed laziness, he now find himself surrounded by extremely neurotic or downright crazy people. And the staff, led by the heartless Nurse Ratched, only add to the misery. What a drab, and hopeless place this hospital is. Even though everything inside is white, the drab Oregonian sky from outside seems to seep in and add to the misery. The sad thing is, most of these patients are voluntary! They'd rather exist in this terrible place than face the realities of the outside world. Nicholson doesn't realize until its too late that by causing himself to be committed, he will not be able to simply leave when his jail time is up. These monstrous creatures that run the place can keep him inside as long as they choose. This leaves him no other choice but to plan an escape. He even ends up throwing himself a kind of going away party at night when most of the staff has gone home! But his underestimating just how crazy some of his fellow inmates are leads to some tragic consequences. The film has a logical, yet somber conclusion.Nicholson is in top form. He's just wild enough to fool some of the staff into thinking he might be actually crazy. But by time they all agree he's faking, its too late for him. They've got him trapped. Louise Fletcher, as Nurse Ratched, looks like kind of a grownup Mary Ingalls from Little House. Icy stares, and occasional phony politeness radiate from her scrubbed and polished face. She alone is responsible for most of the pain (physical and mental) that these patients face. The cast is uniformly excellent. Some of the actors were making their debuts in successful careers. Brad Dourif is especially eye-opening in his portrayal of stuttering mama's boy Billy. I'd give the film at least nine stars. And of course make it ten since Scatman Cruthers is on hand for a hilarious turn as the lone member of the night shift. Don't miss this film! The Hound.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Impeccably thought through in every department, it swept all the major Academy Awards, and understandably so: it's impossible to ignore.

113,petra_ste,Cool Hand Jack,8,9 August 2008,"The most interesting thing about One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is how easily the script could have chosen the easy road, making protagonist McMurphy (Nicholson) more conventionally heroic and antagonist Nurse Ratched (Fletcher) a fully-fledged monster. This movie, however, defies easy shortcuts.We are shown from the beginning that McMurphy is scum, a violent man with a history of aggression and sex crimes. In a normal situation he would be despicable: he is, after all, a loud-mouthed criminal trying to exploit the legal system to avoid jail. And yet, in the oppressive atmosphere of the sanitarium, he becomes the leader of a rebellion - a righteous one, we feel. McMurphy is the defiant trickster in a leaden, cruel environment... so we end up on his side.On the flipside, Nurse Ratched is not the devil, but an earnest professional trying to do her job. Even if she clearly gets a kick from exerting her authority - the scene in which she stops voting to prevent McMurphy's victory has a creepy ""Stanford prison experiment"" vibe - she doesn't appear to have truly evil intentions. Even her reluctance to send McMurphy away seems motivated by a refusal to give up on him. And yet Ratched is smug, obtuse, devoid of empathy... and she becomes a memorable movie villain.The two leads are perfect. Nicholson gives an infectious performance which won him a well-deserved Academy Award; Fletcher plays Ratched as an icy bureaucrat, her well-meaning cruelty scarier than dozens of foaming-at-the-mouth comic book villains.Still, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is an ensemble piece: the rest of the cast does a superb job too (Forman has always been an actors' director), from young Danny DeVito and Cristopher Lloyd to Brad Dourif, from Sydney Lassick to Will Sampson as Chief Bromden.8.5/10 For another excellent movie Handling similar themes, watch Cool Hand Luke with Paul Newman.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
114,gab-14712,The Nurse Ratched Show!,10,18 October 2017,"I will say this upfront. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is my favorite film of 1975 and is in my personal top ten films of all time. It's an American classic that was beloved upon release and forty years later, it still holds up well in terms of relevance and quality filmmaking. There is just so much to love about the movie. Just watching Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher go head to head is a delight to watch. Those two actors, whom won Academy Awards for their performances, make this movie into what it is. They are very special performances. People call this movie a comedy, but I'm not sure if you can call it one. There are comedic elements definitely, but this is more of a drama. A drama about losing everything for the benefit of others. Thanks to exquisite direction by Milos Forman and a array of performances from a diverse cast, this movie is one that is necessary to check out. Like right now.J.R McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) has a storied criminal past. He has been in prison countless number of times. After his latest crime, he is back in trouble with the law. But in order to escape prison, McMurphy pleads insanity and he is sent to a mental hospital. In the hands of the wretched Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), he witnesses abuse and degradation towards himself and the other wards. In true 70's spirit, McMurphy rallies up the other inmates in order to stand up against the wicked Nurse Ratched.This film is all about the performances and characterization. Without these essential elements, this film would be half the film it currently is. McMurphy and Nurse Ratched are two iconic characters that will live forever in movie lore. McMurphy because of his unique rebellious character who seems like an ass on the outside, but somehow becomes close pals with the majority of the inmates. Then we have the Nurse Ratched. She is not evil in the sense one would think of evil. She manipulates people and uses the flaws of her patients to gain power. Her motives are generally clear to the audience, but she uses such a deceptively calm voice which irritates her patients. There is one powerful scene where McMurphy wanted to watch the World Series, but she uses an unfair voting system to make it clear he cannot do what he wants. In a sense, Ratched makes the perfect dominatrix with her calm demeanor, fishy motives, and that shiny nurses uniform. We also have a variety of important supporting characters. There is Chief Bromden, an intimidating Native American who lives in a shell by ""being"" mute and deaf, but he becomes a pivotal character for McMurphy. Then he have the likes of Billy Bibbit, a young man wanting sex for the first time (and has all the support of his mates), and Traber and Martini whom are more important inmates.The performances are wonderful. Everyone plays off each other incredibly well. The chemistry between Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher was nothing short of brilliant. Jack Nicholson showed how talented he was in 1974's Chinatown, but here he really shines and does more than enough to win his Academy Award statue. Louise Fletcher held a commanding screen presence by being psychologically evil. She just may be one of the more memorable screen villains of all time. Up there with the likes of Darth Vader or Jaws. The rest of the supporting cast did a fine job. We get great performances from many actors who would go on to have respectable careers such as Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif. Will Sampson was the man who portrayed Chief. I loved his character and how meaningful he was to the story. What he had to do for his pal McMurphy was an emotionally powerful scene which added greatness to the movie.One interesting thing to point out is the score of the movie. Scores are used to evoke emotion out of the audience and I think Jack Nitzche's music added something new and original. Apparently he composed the score with the aid of a eerie-sounding saw and some wine glasses. When you hear the score, you'll know what I mean. I didn't like it too much upon my first viewing, but it grew on me and I fell in love with it upon my second viewing.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a beautiful, beautiful film. This is a genuine American masterpiece and it features Jack Nicholson at his finest. His character embodies the stigma of loyalty, rebellion, and freedom. He wants to rid himself of evil, and in the process makes many friends. He endures everything from useless medication to shock therapy, but in the end his loyalty to others is what wins. McMurphy is the symbol of goodness. Nurse Ratched, on the other hand, is one of the greatest villains of all time. A mild complaint is how the film treats the women in the film. Not very well (outside of two girls used to give Bibbit the night of his life), but it works well with the plot. This film is expertly-written, masterfully-directed, and the performances are all genuine. Nominated for 9 Oscars, this is just an amazing piece of art.My Grade: A+",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
115,SmileysWorld,Psychological warfare.,8,7 October 2013,"I like this film's display of the psychological war between the characters portrayed by Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher.Nicholson represents a somewhat bad seed who becomes a hero to the mental patients he joins through a successful attempt to avoid hard labor.Fletcher is Nurse Ratched,a hard nosed and power hungry woman whose actions make her look more like a warden than a nurse.Nicholson soon has his fellow patients experiencing life and feeling better,although perhaps not quite to the point of being cured.Nurse Ratched,with seemingly no interest in the betterment of the patients,but rather seems more interested in keeping them ill to maintain her control over them,sees Nicholson as a threat.The battle is a thing of beauty to watch.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
116,Angry_Arguer,Botched Medium,1,19 March 2004,"I am kicking myself for being so unobservant.  Films, books, and plays are three different art forms and 'Cuckoo's Nest' has the (mis)fortune of existing in all three stages.  None are good examples of their respective forms.Books are plot-driven, requiring the right mix of story with dialog. Actually, dialog isn't necessary to make a popular book as Tom Clancy and John Grisham have demonstrated.Films are visually-driven.  When a film relies too much on the mechanics of books, they fail.  Why have the Clancy and Grisham adaptations faded so quickly?  Because the directors start with a story and then try to visualize it as best as they can while cutting out the guts of the book (the plot)...probably why the #1 comment is ""the book was better"".  Thus a good film, in the visual sense, needs little dialog and even bad dialog can work. Ang Lee, Ridley Scott, and Stanley Kubrick proved that.  These three start with visuals then use plot as an excuse for the vision, that's how they get away with clichés.Plays are entirely dialog-driven, requiring mastery of language to create and perform.  What works in books and films can fail because we take out the scene imagination of the audience in exchange for verbal imagination.  The two don't mix.Well, 'Cuckoo's Nest' (book, play, and film) is nothing unique.  Remember that Kesey wrote his book after Heller's 'Catch-22' and the film adaptation likewise followed Nichols' better attempt.  We can see that if Heller hadn't succeeded this would never have been made.  No one would have been interested in another examination of insanity, but this doesn't even have the clever manipulation of either the narrator or language.In this particular case, the failure falls on Forman.  Dialog and acting are pointless in this medium, especially Nicholson since his ""method acting"" here is no different than the Joker.  Another problem is the emotionless images.  This isn't the calculated coldness of Kubrick, just sloppy filmmaking.  Perhaps this should not have been attempted at all...My advice, compare this to that year's 'Barry Lyndon' to understand when adaptations take advantage of the different mediums.  The problem with America is that we make everyone verbally literate and then expect them to go to movies with the same mentality.  If we raise future generations to be visually literate then this movie would disappear.  That's our dilemma: Hollywood vs. Education.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
117,agmoldham,The academy got this right,8,19 February 2004,The academy tends to honour films that portray physical or emotional problems. In this case the awards were well merited.Randle P McMurphy (Nicholsen) fakes insanity to avoid a stretch in the pen thinking that spending time in a mental institution will be much easier. He doesn't reckon for Nurse Rathched (Louise Fletcher) who is far more daunting than anyone he was likely to meet in the state pen.The two leads are excellent and are well supported by the rest of the cast including a very young looking Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito. 9/10,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
118,jpschapira,Come in...,9,7 March 2008,"Come in and watch, please come in and seeIt starts with a long still shot of a landscape. The most eccentric characters are present in this ward; a place, though another possible character in Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", a film about what Harding (William Redfield) describes accurately in one of many passionate scenes: interpersonal relationships. It's a beautiful piece, with inspiring dialogs, well constructed sequences, peaceful and nerve- wracking moments, daunting images, brilliant performances. The beloved Czech director doesn't leave any emotion out of the table and risks it all on a film (and here comes one of my fixations as a writer and one that in cases like these is impossible to avoid) as real as you and me. Real as reality, as Ken Kesey's (the writer of the novel the film's based on) experience when he worked at a hospital with mentally ill people. It's clear that, besides the writer's true point of view (I haven't read the novel but sometimes it gets lost in the making of a film) and a highly disturbing ending, Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman's (the latter one wrote the script of ""Scent of a woman"") adaptation is a very delicate work.There's a model scene, one that's repeated several times throughout the film. It involves Mildred Radchet (Louise Fletcher and her fantastic cold look), the nurse in charge of the mentioned 'ward', discussing the patients' personal problems in a group. Every one of these group scenes, measured by masterful quick close-ups (that are part of the whole film but work strongly here) ultimately leads up to a mess, which involves shouting and fighting that is not fighting but more like constant complaint. In films like these, I like to stay with my first impression; but if you really want to analyze Forman's complex movie, you should watch it several times and choose a character each time to pay attention to. Without taking it too far, you have Mc Murphy (Jack Nicholson, crazier than ever in a time where he was more natural), the movie's natural main character that, at times, seems just another character of the cast; a secondary player.This happens because the rest of the patients are very interesting and unpredictable. Take the insistent Martini (an unrecognizable Danny de Vito), or the silent gambler Taber (an unrecognizable Christopher Lloyd), or the rebellious Cheswick (Sidney Lassick), or Billy (Brad Dourif), who in one scene shows a major demonstration of courage and instantly becomes a coward again;or Will Sampson's silent Chief Bromden. Talking about it, silence is an important part of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""; something that the characters seem to appreciate, therefore we respect it too. Whenever the music comes in, it's because something's not right, in any perspective. Because music may play in a cheerful moment for this patients, but at the same time it's making someone else's day worse. The same goes for the mood of the film. At times, the patients are so funny that we laugh out loud; but what makes us laugh gets other people's nerves. On the other side, there are moments were we feel like crying because the reality of the film is truly devastating and we realize that maybe we hadn't noticed yet. However, what makes us feel sad, is what others feel it's the right thing to do.There are many characters I didn't describe and I missed characteristics of the ones I did, but I'm no psychiatrist and I don't know so much about personality. But if I could give an opinion (one of those we express when we watch a movie even when we know that's not going to change), I'd say that I don't think nurses are doing a fine job here. You watch and tell me what you think. But come in and watch, please come in and seeIt ends with a long still shot of a landscape. Have you ever really felt complete freedom?",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
119,bellino-angelo2014,A timeless masterpiece from the 1970s,10,5 February 2021,"I always wanted to watch this movie knowing lots of great things about it: it's among the movies that won the most Oscars in the history of the Academy, it's considered one of Jack Nicholson's finest movies and among the highest rated movies from the 1970s. I had great expectations for it with that knowledge, but when I saw it I noticed that the movie hugely surpassed my expectations and made me understand why it has all that praise. Now I can go to the review.The movie is about Randal Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) who, for avoiding spending time in prison, pleads insanity and in the beginning he is sent in a mental institution. He had this idea because, he thought, staying in a mad house will be much easier to swallow than staying in prison. However he'll soon find out that living in an institution with Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), probably the most evil nurse ever seen on film (!!!) and seeing all the other patients (played also by Christopher Lloyd, Danny de Vito and Vincent Schiavelli) mistreated is actually worse than staying in prison! McMurphy plays pranks, wrecks havoc, and always loves to go against the rules and even tries to make the other patients' lives better. His constant optimism and reckless attitude in order to raise spirits can be even funny, but the movie can also be very depressing; the background of the institution is quite sad for a superb story that has even one of the best endings ever!Jack Nicholson is probably at his best form here, on par with the performances he gave in THE SHINING or BATMAN. McMurphy is an eternal optimist that has the goal of raising spirits inside the institution since life it's so oppressive and many of his antics (like when he takes the patients on a fishing trip or when he organizes the Christmas party at the end) can be seen as his own act of rebellion against a system that burns the wings of freedom, and his performance is very compelling as we feel for him as with the other patients. Even when he wants to lift the bathroom fountain for throwing it to the window and break free since he can't stand the nurse, we kinda feel sorry for him because we feel his pain. I read once that Nicholson really studied the character, and it can be seen with the understanding and performance of his character. The other known actors (I already mentioned them above) give great performances too and Nurse Ratched is probably what made this movie. If she wasn't so cold hearted, cynical and tough as nails, her performance wouldn't have had sense.This movie is also a window on what life was like in mental institutions since many of the horrid things seen here (such as lobotomy or patients deprived of their most beloved things) happened in reality up until those institutions were closed or demolished. And this movie had also the purpose of letting people know that the horrors of those times should be remembered for never repeating them again.With more than 1,030 reviews here to date, terrific performances, a great script and a masterful direction, what can I say about this movie that hadn't already been said? I'll suggest to anyone who hasn't seen this movie to watch it at least once in their lifetimes... it's THAT great! And it's among those movies that will leave you lots of thinking even after you saw it. It has so many multiple meanings that one notices only after multiple viewings.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

I had no idea they were in the film until it ended. I call this film a personal favorite of mine, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed PATCH ADAMS.

Yet, seeing this adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel come to life makes one yearn to read the source material.The first thing that one notices while watching this film is the quality of the acting. It's extremely hard for actors to portray the intensity of mental illness in a way that is not offensive. Yet, the supporting cast of Will Sampson, Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd, among others make this a performance to remember. Everyone in their cast was spectacular in their roles. There were times I thought I was watching real patients with mental illness.Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher do a remarkable job bringing the conflict to life. Playing McMurphy and Nurse Ratched, audiences feel the high stakes card game at each act of this movie. Nicholson goes above and beyond in captivating audiences and making this a masterpiece.The writing, dialogue, and plot give each character a chance at full development. Bo Goldman and Lawrence Hauben are amazing at letting each character shine. Audiences can understand the themes brought to light. Themes of authoritarian care, social support structures for the mentally ill, dependencies on said structures, and soul-crushing institutionalism vs individuality.The script was incredible as the audience can never quite predict what happens next. There were moments of real tension felt as the suspense builds and we wonder if our protagonist gets caught.Jack Nitzsche brings alive the entire movie with his wonderful music.

127,DarthVoorhees,Showcase of brilliant acting,9,22 June 2016,"I've been continuing a recent binge of Nicholson films and I finally caught up with the biggest one I had never previously seen. (I know right?) It's a complex film and I don't know if I can quite appreciate it the way others have. I have to say that I did bring in a lot of personal baggage in with the film. I have been hospitalized for depression and I think I wasn't quite able to get the full sense of uplift one is supposed to from it. It sort of really bummed me out at times. The turning of McMurphy into a hero doesn't always work. Because there can't really full be a hero here. It was kind of a rough one. One on hand I totally see why this film is acclaimed as highly as it is. With acting alone it is a complete triumph. In this kind of film it is extra challenging as you don't want to engage in easy choices as an actor. None of the cast do. They are all unique and fleshed out. I particularly liked Danny DeVito's portrayal of Martini. He has such a wide eyed innocence that you'd never expect from DeVito. There's a great moment when the tension is building with McMurphy and Ratched and Martini comes in with ""How are we going to win our money back?"" Nicholson is brilliant of course. I guess what drove me to be a Nicholson fan was his more sinister roles like 'The Shining' or 'The Departed' but he is at his best when he defies expectations. His persona is always entertaining but a character with motivation has to be built around it. 'Cuckoo's Nest' may just be the best at this. The role is tailored made for him and yet it isn't like the trademark 'Nicholson' persona. McMurphy is edgy and sly but he is very much in control. What really was needed and what keeps the film from being perfect is that McMurphy is never given a moment to explicitly face his own demons and insecurities. He isn't perfect. He hurts people over the course of the film. The final tragedy at the end is more his fault than Nurse Ratched's. As a film showcase of brilliant acting talent and to see a premiere actor at the top of his game 'Cuckoo's Nest' is a must. I don't know how often I'll be revisiting it though.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is fully admiring on Jack Nicholson's view of the uncertainy of confused hospital patients. He easily steals the program for his edgy talent, but he is often regarded as an inspiration to his pals, including the ""Chief"". Risking all that he can to give them a new life in the outside world, he is also an acceptably rewarding character that can put smiles to your faces. It's a role that many would choose to take. Enjoyably fun, I'd say!Nicholson isn't the only one, though. The cast of a few ""newcomers"" as patients shows a lot of accurate chemistry. They have conflicting matters between easy and hard realities in which to live. Most importantly is Louise Fletcher as a strictly determined nurse who tries to keep up with her daily routine of duties. Overall, the characters are extremely vital to the whole film itself. Perhaps this did give an honorable mention of Oscar-winning performances.In the end, other than good writing or good characters, a true classic needs ""the works"": a touch of laughter, some fascinating situations, and occasional moments that can be both good and bad. And again, you can't always prove that it's the greatest print on celluloid. Thanks to the exceptional direction of Milos Forman, the movie is hands down, another platinum ""9"" winner in my book, and one of my personal greats.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Milos Forman directs this story of a Randall McMurphy(Nicholson), a man who fakes being insane to avoid going to jail. But he is faced with a problem in the mental hospital and is always clashing with the head nurse (Louise Fletcher). The story is very touching and at times extremely funny. With awesome direction and a flawless screenplay, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, Sydney Lassick and Christopher Lloyd also give very good supporting performances, especially Dourif who plays a young unconfident stuttering patient. Overall there is little to be said about this film that has not been said before, but it is near perfect in every sense, and plays a great message as well as a very interesting story.

133,gigan-92,"""I want my cigarettes!""",10,23 May 2012,"A good old classic from the 70s, definitely unforgettable. Two great forces propel this movie, Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. Their antics are as hilarious as they are dramatic. I'll always love Nicholson as the care-free Randle McMurphy who's indomitable spirit lifts the perpetual inmates of the mental institution to rebellion. Nurse Ratchet, one of those few great villainesses in cinema. Her icy demeanor really sold the brutality of the character. And Will Sampson, how can anyone forget him as Chief? Danny Devito, boy, I hardly recognized him upon first viewing, and he too was pretty awesome. Brad Dourif was eternally great, and Christopher Lloyd also stars. There are just so many great actors here and every performance is so natural you become very connected with the characters.Topping this collection of great performers like icing on a cake is a great story based on Ken Kesey's 1962 novel of the same name. Jack Nitzsche also serves up a subtle yet unforgettable score, got to love his work. If you haven't seen this classic, you're missing out one of Hollywood's best.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
134,movieguy1021,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest: 7/10,7,30 March 2003,"Randle Patrick McMurphy is committed to a mental institution, when he thinks he doesn't need to be there. He causes havoc on the place, but especially on the head Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). Some of the people he lives with is Harding (William Redfield), Martini (Danny DeVito), Sefelt (William Duell), Bancini (Josip Elic), Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), and Taber (Christopher Lloyd).I really had no idea what to rate this movie: it's dramatic but not too dramatic, it's funny but not too funny. I felt inspired, but I had many complaints about it. First off, I felt like it didn't have a central plot. IMDb.com says: `A man sent to a mental hospital finds the head nurse a lot more dangerous than the other patients.' I agree, but we really have no connection between the two. Besides a few arguments, we have nothing to back that up. If it was concentrated more on that than on unnecessary sidetrips, such as when Randle took everyone on a field trip fishing. I see that that shows how he's connecting and how crazy he's becoming, but if it had been removed so more of the initial plot could come underway, it would have helped.Even without music for a lot of the time, I felt like I was being touched by this movie, mainly at the end. However, it doesn't have a central message or theme. It was heart wrenching at times, even over the littlest things, but for a lot of the time it was just `a movie'. I don't want you to think the wrong thing, I enjoyed and liked this movie.Nicholson, who is McMurphy, was excellent yet again. Fletcher was good, but would have been better if she was in more scenes, considering she's the second largest star of the film. She, as Ratched, wanted routine and routine only. I didn't really think she was `dangerous', but if it had been a longer movie, it could have worked. I thought that all of the mental patients were great, especially Lloyd (it was his debut, as was DeVito's).I did notice a few things that I didn't think would happen in real life. First, I wouldn't think that they would allow smoking in a hospital. Also, I noticed that throughout the entire movie, McMurphy didn't have the hospital gowns that everyone else had. Other than that, I would have to say that this movie is very good, but many flaws.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language, violence, and mental themes.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
135,RossRivero99,Nicholson knocks it out of the park,10,13 June 2014,Milos Forman's One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was a great movie to begin with because of not only the acting in the film but the humor in it as well. Based off of a Ken Kesey novel tells the story about a man named Randall Patrick McMurphy (played by Jack Nicholson) who ends up going to a mental institution while getting in trouble with the law way too many times (which makes me think back to Good Will Hunting.)then rebels along with his nutty institution friends to try the best they could to escape while the evil Nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher) isn't there. Director Milos Forman has crafted one of the greatest movies ever made because of it's humorous moments and the electrifying performances throughout.,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
136,raypdaley182,hmm,3,9 June 2007,"Take Jack Nicholson, Brad Douriff, Danny Devito & Christopher Lloyd. All playing patients in a mental institution. And they look like they belong there.Jack looks he literally just walked off the set of The Last Detail and nothing like he did in Tommy (both of which predate this film). Devito looks about 12, he's so fresh faced. It's hard to believe this is the same Brad Douriff that will go on to be in Dune and Chris Lloyd seems to get typecast as mad or a crackpot going on to be mental in The Dream Team and a crackpot inventor in Back To The Future.You get Jack imagining the World Series, Jack escaping, stealing a bus then stealing a boat to take the guys fishing. Jack being given electro shock therapy and faking catatonia.Douriff as Billy is amazing, playing his role so fully. Little wonder he was Oscar nominated for the role that year. The party they throw in the ward with the help of Scatman Caruthers (the voice of Hong Kong Phooey, no less!) is an excellent section of the film.The films main stumbling block is in huge parts so little happens for a long time. Recognisable faces that I couldn't put a name to like The Chief (I know he was in one of the Poltergeist movies) and one of the patients is a hill person from the original version of The Hills Have Eyes. Another one of the men is the subway ghost who trains Patrick Swayze in Ghost.Jack's planned escape fails due to excessive alcohol, the aftermath of the party when the patients are lined up by the head Nurse as they all behave like naughty school children is so funny.Billy (Douriff) is discovered in bed with one of the women Nicholson had invited into the hospital and is welcomed back to the group like a conquering hero having had sex with her.His stutter had gone completely until Nurse Ratched mentions telling his mother. The blame for Billy's suicide can only placed on one person, Nurse Ratched and Nicholson's almost fatal attack on her is not without merit.We are left to assume that Nicholson has been given possibly a labotomy after attacking and almost killing the Head Nurse as he is totally unresponsive and catatonic.When The Chief kills Nicholson, it is in silence with no rage or malice. It is done as an act of release, to free Jack from the prison they have placed him into by doing the labotomy on him.The fact that he then carries out Nicholson's original escape plan is like a final act of defiance to show he was truly free all the time.A weird film but quite enjoyable.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
137,Horror-yo,A fine film that ends on a perhaps too difficult note,8,19 July 2016,"This here is quite a classic film. Nicholson does a great job as the nutty but ultimately sane protagonist, while every other actor/actress plays his specifically written role very well. Notably, Louise Fletcher as the lead nurse. The film does a very good job globally at not dwelling on its main concept and introducing a variety of derivative subplots that all help build the momentum up til the ending. The characters are all well developed, the scenes express their point vividly, there are surprises as it goes and not one dull moment despite the very focused plot at work.I don't do this often in my reviews, but I will give a more personalized opinion: the ending, although necessary to deliver the film's strong conclusion, is perhaps a bit too harsh, like they didn't have to go quite that way and could've found something else. It feels just a little bit *too much* I'd say.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
138,elicopperman,The Story of Individuality over Conformity through Mental Illness,8,13 March 2019,"Adapting a book into a film is a very tough challenge, as they're two very distinct mediums that work in completely opposite formats. One is descriptive and the other is visual, meaning that regardless of the intent behind the making of either commodity, they need to translate well enough to work both ways. In the case of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, given that it's a universally loved feature that won all of the five main Oscar categories, one can imagine that even if it may not have pleased fans of the book, it still succeeded as a flick on its own. So how does it hold up after so many years?The film centers around convict Randle Patrick McMurphy, who gets sent to a mental institution as a compromise away from prison. However, the martinet Nurse Ratched maintains her role as that of a subtly tough leader for all the patients, which causes McMurphy to rebel against such rules. One major aspect worth noting about the feature is the concept of individuality over conformity. Mac is somewhat hyperbolic in his personality, but his desire to bring a sense of reality to all the patients around him is worth admiring for how logical it is. The friendships that Mac makes with each mental patient are quite genuine and even bittersweet, down to the point where you can attach yourself to their own scenarios. Even if Mac can't realistically succeed in making their lives better, the multiple ways he has them live differently is nothing short of lovable.Another big praise to give the feature is the acting, as each performer practically becomes the character they play; once you see them, you'll never forget them. Jack Nicholson outshines as MacMurphy, as he always provides something new to his delivery, including bizarre mannerisms around the patients. Louise Fletcher is appropriately unsympathetic as Nurse Ratched, who despite being strong willed in keeping the schedule monotonous, ultimately has little care for what the patients seek emotionally, making her truly despicable. In addition, the supporting players truly make the film memorable. They range from the anxious Billy Bibbit, to the childish Charlie Cheswick, to the delusional Martini, to the paranoid Dale Harding, to the aggressive Max Taber, and so much more. And then there's the presumably mute one, Chief, who has a lot of charming qualities to him outside of that. The relationship between him and Mac is very touching, as it details how much they both care for each other in spite of their quirks and conflicting lives.Now admittedly, the film is pretty simplistic in terms of plot and character motivations, but I think that's why it works in the end. Because many of the characters live in their own small worlds, whatever happens to them is strictly concerning. So having somebody who isn't actually insane having those who are live a little outside of their ""comfort"" zones can speak to anybody who loathes the status quo. Without spoiling anything, the climax of the feature is a result of what can happen when two differing views clash without forming a compromise on a situation. Ironically, when you do the same old thing over and over as a method of helping your patients out, you barely end up helping them in the long run. Neither MacMurphy or Ratched were necessarily wrong on how mental patients should be treated, it's just a pure case of logic without reason, which are two things we need if we're all to get better.Needless to say, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a modestly written albeit brilliantly acted, well directed and emotionally haunting tale of what can happen when neither tradition nor distinction are ever put together. Of course nobody will ever forget the acting, but what those phenomenal performances were built on were the concepts of mental illness needing to be treated with more care than expected. I can't say for certain how faithful the film is to the book, especially in that regard, but I'm sure it knows all about the consequences coming from institutions not understanding the patient's true necessities. I highly recommend this to anyone who is yet to check the flick out for that factor alone. Maybe you'll think longer about the individual characters, but the main protagonist will be locked in our memories forever for the light he shines on men who would have never gotten that sense of free will anywhere else.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

McMurphy (Fondly regarded as Mac or Randall) has to fight a nurse in a mental institution and before he fails he brought one man, freedom. The Chief got free and indeed freed Mac too. Death can be such a relief in a painful world It's better to die than to go through monstrous pain that shall make us fall one day so much painfully Jack Nicholson as R P McMurphy gave us one the best anti authoritarian, anti establishment, recidivist, performances that we have rarely seen. Look at home, giving the commentary of baseball match, explaining in great detail each intricacy of the game, or the way he brings the patients on one platform by playing a basketball game. He does so many things from fishing to partying, to make those poor sick people happy but succumbs to the torture and is let free by The Chief (Will Sampson). Miss Ratched (Louise Fletcher) is the authoritarian nurse who feels that she is doing a world of good, by listening to the patients giving them medication and controlling them by her henchmen, she is not all evil but most of her certainly is evil. We don't like dictators for one reason, because we want to dictate our own terms, we want to free ourselves from the bondage set by anyone else and bind ourselves by our own will to something. Ratched was hated because she set the terms, irrespective of the amount of pain she was going to transpire within those poor souls.And thus, R P McMurphy, who was till then a sane man, got wild, weird and mad.Watch the movie for performances more than anything. The writing was good but I can't say great as it is mostly confined within the premises of the mental institution where patients stammer, mutter, scream, yell and even be silent. So how they act is more engrossing than what was written. The Chief's stoned emotions Cheswick's fight for cigarettes, Billy's plea not to tell his mother. All are acted out extremely well. For extracting such great acting from the cast, I give Milos Forman, the director complete credit and he has done an outstanding job indeed. He stood out as the watchman, the captain, watched each emotion and molded them wonderfully to make us see what this film stands today.The lighting, sound and cinematography are good. The music was great, it was not that creepy, or sad music, it was just as required for a scene. I'd rate this a great movie, as it brings alive the spirit of rebellion and I love to control my own life, even if I have to rebel for it.

Everything in this film made me think afterwards if things like these still happen in the U.S to mental institutions. The thought of people with mental illness being treated that way was pretty disturbing. On the other hand this what makes cinema perfect: the power to draw emotions from the viewers. Nurse Ratched (portrayed by Louise Fletcher) was a very annoying character and evil one. But the portrayal is what makes the character so well and realistic. Jack Nicholson in another Oscar Winning portrayal and fantastic film. Just proves again what an actor he is. Danny Devito and Christopher Lloyd In early roles before their rise to fame. The movie is inspired by a novel with the same title only to me it felt original because of the writing and dialogue. Every dialogue between Nicholson's character Mcmurphy and the other characters is worth mentioning, such as the monologue he gives when he discovers he can't leave the institution willingly, and that the rest of the patients are in the institution volunteerly. It is well written dialogue that is planted through the entire movie. Although the movie ends with a sad conclusion. At least Mcmurphy made life in the institution a little happier for the patients.

.This came out when i was very young and tapped into the atmosphere then of youth rebellion and solidarity with the Oppressed (sound familiar in 2020?), so first time i saw it i fell in with everybody rooting for hero McMurphy against the Evil Nurse Ratched.Meantime I've had to deal with some psychological problems of my own and gained a lot more respect and sympathy for medical professionals who take on this task.Mildred Ratched is a dedicated career caregiver, and the best way she knows how to do this is single-mindedly focused, and by-the-books to maintain orderly progress for her patients, and it works, for the most part, apart from the brow-beating, electroshocks and lobotomies when things go out of her control, all instigated by Mcmurphy's perverse drive to conquer her as his Symbol of Oppression. Sane or no, Mcmurphy goes thru life in general with a chip on his shoulder that Nurse Ratched just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time to get hit with. She's a victim, not the Monster, and i love to see her returning to work next day after Mc's tried to choke her to death, wearing that massive neckbrace like armor, symbolically proclaiming victory, ready to take up arms and go right back into the fray.Some cloying contrived ""heart-warming"" moments--this is, after all, a mass market targeted movie, so a spoonful of sugar lightens the intense succession of psychic conflicts. Nicholson at his true best, reminds you how much he's effectively been coasting on his laurels for decades, relative to what he did back then.But nobody can doubt the greatness of a movie that makes the lilting strains of muzak sound like Nurse Ratched's fingernails on a blackboard.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
149,nickenchuggets,You will never forget,10,11 May 2021,"What can I say about Jack Nicholson that hasn't been stated already? He's one of the most talented (albeit volatile) actors that most people know about. He's known for playing all manners of men who aren't happy with their lives, psychopaths, killers, and people that are, in general, hard to feel pity for. That is until you watch this movie. Nicholson plays Randle McMurphy, a mentally disturbed man who is serving prison time for sexually assaulting a young girl, among other things. He manages to get himself transferred to a mental institution which spares him the horrors of manual labor. Upon arriving, the audience sees similarly mentally ill men who pass the time playing cards and other meager activities, since the nurse in charge of looking after the men, Ratched, is a truly wicked human being. She's cold and unapologetic when dealing with them, and McMurphy grows to hate her more and more as the movie's plot moves forward. In the meantime, he takes part in numerous misadventures that get him into a heap of trouble later on, such as stealing a bus in order to experience a bit of freedom in the company of his friends. One friend he makes in particular will become one of the most important characters of the movie: a tall native american he refers to as Chief. Chief is introduced as someone who's unable to talk or understand anything, but it's all a ruse to make sure the other people don't bother him. The only person he seems to take a liking to is McMurphy, which is shown to its fullest extent at the end of the movie. After McMurphy and the others host a prohibited party at the institution, Ratched shows up the next day and finds the place comprehensibly trashed. When she threatens to tell one of the men's parents about the sexual and alcoholic things that went on there, he is placed in another room, and then kills himself. This being the final straw for McMurphy, he strangles Ratched in a fit of rage but only succeeds in damaging her vocal cords. At the end of the film, McMurphy is taken back to his bed and Chief is happy to see him, but soon he notices the marks of a lobotomy on his head. Knowing that McMurphy would rather die than spend the rest of his life as a vegetable, Chief suffocates him and then escapes the hospital by breaking a window. A bittersweet end to an amazing movie. The performances are excellent all across the board, with special mention going to Will Sampson (Chief) and of course Nicholson. Louise Fletcher also plays Ratched perfectly, and I'm sure putting a bullet in her head would have been very satisfying for most viewers.

151,Flagrant-Baronessa,The most butchered and unfaithful adaptation ever made,4,28 June 2006,"Milos Forman based his ""masterpiece"" on a true masterpiece, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey, which is one of the best books I have ever read. I therefore cannot judge this film in any other way than to see how well it translated from book to screen. Judging in this way however, the result is unbelievably poor.Now, I appreciate the difficulty in adapting a book to a movie if the book is very abstract, rich in ideas, symbolism or imagerybut One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest is straightforward and linear and everything is very well-defined and spelled-out. It's not rocket science. The adaptation was atrocious and disappointed me immensely.I imagine Milos Forman either read this book in the dark, or read a brief summary of basic events on spark-notes, and completely ignored all themes, narrative, characterizations and symbols because he was in a hurry. He then put all basic events together in a hat, and took one at random and put it anywhere in the movie. Et voilà, he had his Cuckoo's film.There is simply too much wrong with this film that I can impossibly list all mistakes. But here are a few significant ones:1. The fishing trip was huge at the end of the book. It signified the culmination of the development of the characters. Forman put it in the first 20 minutes of the movie and completely wasted it by misplacing it.2. Louise Fletcher was not bad, but what part of ""full-chested"" don't they get? I'm not advocating some blown-up porn star chest here, but why cast a small-breasted actress? Couldn't they just have stuffed her bra? How difficult could it be? It may seem shallow of me to bring up such a seemingly trivial thing, but Nurse Ratched's repressed sexuality vs. McMurphy's raw sexuality was possibly the biggest theme in the book.3. What part of a loud, boisterous entry by a big, tall redheaded man with tattoos don't they get? Why make it into a small, silent entry by a slim, 5'9"" dark-haired guy with no tattoos (Jack Nicholson)? McMurhpy's important introduction was ruined.4. McMurphy's first meeting with the patients showed how truly different from them he was, going around and joking and laughing and shaking everyone's hand, like a politician or a salesman. In the movie, he says hello to one person, then shyly looks around the ward. Huh?? 5. The ward was supposed to be gloomy, quiet and humorless and then gradually change with McMurphy's presence. Well, its initial state was not emphasized at all and people were laughing even before he had joined them. Lame.7. The doctor was made into a shrewd and almost manipulative man in the moviehe was extremely timid in the book, and McMurhpy used him in the jockeying for power.8. Chief Bromden was the narrator in the book. He wasn't in the film and he should have beenif not to stay faithful to the original work, then to explain things that Forman simply didn't bother with.Like I said, everything was very spelled out in the book. So the above weren't my 'preconceived' ideas about what I wanted it to be, but actual truths! How someone chose to ignore or butcher them is beyond me.

McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) who is sent for evaluation at a mental hospital.Upon getting there Randle had an idea that he was to do time, not knowing that he was there till the doctors say he is free to go.He made friends with some of the patients in the institution like mama's boy Billy (Brad Dourif) and silent Native American Bromden (Will Sampson) who all thought was deaf and dumb and whom he called Chief.The psyche ward is handled by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who is seen more like the antagonist in this flick.McMurphy was an instigator of unruly behaviour from breaking him and his fellow patients out from the hospital to go on a boat trip and to a night party at the hospital which led to a tragedy.The movie did have a message, live free, be happy don't allow yourself to be tied down by anyone or anything or let either stand in the way of your happiness.Two of Milo Forman films, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and Amadeus (1984), both gained him an Academy Award for Best Director.The movie was the second to win all five major Academy Awards which were Best Picture, Best Actor in Lead Role, Best Actress in Lead Role, Best Director, and Best Screenplay, an accomplishment not repeated until 1991 by The Silence of the Lambs.The thing about the movie that gets to me most has always been the ending, tragedy never sits well with me sometimes especially in the case of this movie.Well if you haven't had a dose of this movie, then you need to.www.lagsreviews.com",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
153,willcundallreview,Just a Cinema Classic,9,13 July 2014,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a Drama film that is just a classic of cinema and contains performances that are near unmatched. With clashes between characters and the stories delve into the mind of mental patients, the film succeeds in bringing a sweet story with also a dramatic one, even a little humour seasoned in as well. Overall I did have a hard time giving this it's score but in the end I felt this was solidly a sublime film, and here below is why I felt that way.The story is pretty neat, kind of different I felt from many other Oscar winners in the sense that the characters are not dark people and the movie is never scared of being funny quite a bit. It is fascinating to watch too, just to see such a rich storyline play out in front of you, you realise why this film makes many of the best films of all time lists. One other thing I loved about it was that it is also so smartly done, it's lead character brings the story smart lines and also brings the best out in the other characters, just sensational stuff.Jack Nicholson is superb in this, completely crazy yet funny, dark yet excitable, he just brings a wealth of expertise to the movie and his character is one I shall remember for a long time to come in cinema history. Louise Fletcher is great too, she is very calm, and I mean VERY calm yet the way she portrays it just makes it so great to see and her chemistry with Nicholson is movie gold. Look out for Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd among others, truly bringing even more quality to the already high quality film.Milos Forman directs well in truth, I did feel that altogether Nicholson among others steal the show and you kind of forget about the directing involved, but looking back it is done to a good standard. I enjoyed the script as well, as said before it contains humour, and that means the film is never too serious or something that is always dark, it has a few sweet spots in it. Even the score for the film is haunting, yet it is also very dreamy and really works well to say it is in a mental hospital with patients constantly taking drugs to help them, score goes with it excellently. So hard to find much wrong with it, but the reason I don't think this is a perfect film is mostly down to the last maybe quarter of the movie, it just slows down a lot and although not bad stuff, the quality we are used to at the beginning affects it's slightly less good end(the actual end of the film is fantastic though). I could say that not all the actors are great but well we can't expect everything, to be fair to them Nicholson and Fletcher get most scenes and dialogue so it isn't there fault.If you like a classic piece of cinema, go watch it, this epitomises legendary plot lines and characters and serves as a real way to do movies. If your looking for Oscar films, again this is probably for you, this has to be one of the best Oscar winning films around and trust me, some people may find this their favourite film of all time. For Nicholson fans, well where else to start or end than with possibly his best performance, he rules this film and stays with you way past the 2 hours this film lasts, just great really.Overall it is Solidly a Sublime film as said, I will add I nearly gave the a Perfect mark showing just how amazing this movie really is. This film is always worth a watch if your compiling the best movies of all times, truly is one the best and the performances are also some of the best. Another good thing this movie does is not to make mental disease seem just stupid and silly, they actually have hearts the characters and can be very nice at times, very great to see such things happening.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
154,majikstl,"""Don't make a bit of sense to me.""",3,4 January 2002,"I know I'm in the minority, but my take on this film is the exact opposite of most of the other comments here. To me, McMurphy is the villain in this film. He is not the lovable scamp whose madcap antics enliven a mental institution -- as some seem to see him. He is, rather, a destructive, evil force. He is in the institution because he is faking mental illness in order to avoid prison for statutory rape. He has no compassion or sympathy for the other patients in the ward; he uses them as pawns to get what he wants. It is his reckless behavior, and not the ""evil Nurse Ratched"", who brings about Billy's death. In the end, when he mets his ""tragic fate,"" my feeling was that McMurphy is getting just what he deserves. McMurphy is a selfish, manipulative, self-righteous s.o.b., more sociopath than rebel. Rather than being a symbol of freedom, he is the personification of the abuse of freedom, a coward who takes no responsibility for his actions and lives only for himself. As for Nurse Ratched, to me, she is a sadly sympathetic character: a middle-aged, underpaid, under-appreciated nurse-turned-bureaucrat, apparently trapped in job for which she has no real competency. The only thing she can do is try to keep order, something which McMurphy cannot abide. Surrounded by patients she can't help, she has built up an icy wall and an iron will to retain what little power she has. This could have been a fascinating character around which a good film could have been built; McMurphy is just a devious little creep. (Plus, as a one-note heavy-handed, sexist symbol of oppression, I find the Ratched character offensive, but give kudos to Fletcher for managing to give her what little shadings she can.)Furthermore, I find the surface story about life in a mental ward unconvincing and the underlying symbolism about freedom and oppression dishonest. And please, lets put an end to the tired crazy-people-are-saner-than-the-sane-people nonsense; it is a tired literary cliché. As for Nicholson, he chews up the scenery; sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Here, I'm unimpressed. I know this film has sparked fanatical devotion, but as far as I'm concerned, it a total fraud.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
155,jts0405,Nicholson in his prime form,10,27 August 2008,"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a classic to put it in a simple form. This movie really is just an utterly enjoyable classic movie and that is why it belongs in the top ten of the Top 250 on IMDb. Jack Nicholson was extremely young here and really witty at this point in his career. This movie is definitely a great one at that. Danny De Vito is also in this movie, which this was also one of his first projects at the time. The movie is just an amazing motion picture that really does deliver a nice amount of chuckles throughout. Nicholson really was as sharp as a tack in this movie. It is literally the primest form he has ever been in and this is his defining movie to say the least.Easily 10/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
156,gsygsy,Not without flaws,8,17 February 2014,"This is a very fine movie in many ways, most of which were rightly recognised on its release. It is marred, though, by a script (possibly accurately reproducing the tone of the source novel, which I've not read) which has an overly simplistic approach to its characters, in particular to its protagonist McMurphy and his nemesis Nurse Ratched. McMurphy is our typical anti-hero, held up for our approval in spite of being an unrepentant apologist for grim offences; whilst Nurse Ratched is shown no mercy (and therefore given no depth) by the authors. This could have made for a two-dimensional movie. Fortunately the actors reached way beyond the binary world they were presented with and infused their characters with, in Nicholson's case, roguish charm and, in Louise Fletcher's case, inner complexity. They are both magnificent and richly deserved every award they won for their performances.They are superbly supported by a remarkable crew of scene-stealers - Danny Devito, Sydney Lassick, Scatman Carruthers, Christopher Lloyd, William Redfield, Will Sampson - and by a quietly effective, apparently one-off performance by Lan Fendors as Ratched's assistant nurse.The polarities of the film - conformism/individualism, control/freedom - are eternally important themes in our lives. In Milos Forman the film had a director who completely understood the significance of the material, crafting a film of real power with his DOP Haskell Wexler. But to me its message is weakened by the way its women - with the exception of Ms Fendors' taciturn nurse - are polarised as either dragons or whores. I've read that before Ms Fletcher was offered the role of Nurse Ratched, a number of actresses had turned it down because of the script was so misogynistic. This demonstrates why Ms Fletcher's achievement is so great: she carefully sidestepped the dragon the script offered up, instead creating someone altogether more difficult to write off in such simple terms. It is an outstanding performance, and remains the best reason to revisit this film.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

THe story of some mental patients at in institution in the 50's. Sounds awfully simple, but let me tell you it is much more than that. Jack Nicholson gives what I consider his best performance ever as Randle Patrick McMurphy, the most rebellious, independent thinking patient ever seen. All of the characters were excellent and unforgettable, and wonderfully played. Not a single actor can be called out for any flaws. The whole movie you root for McMurphy to defeat Nurse Ratched, and in many parts he succeeds and further annoys her. Danny DeVito gives the high point of his career here also, before falling down the acting chain into lame comedies and dramas and whatnot. Brad Dourif gives his least evil performance I have ever seen as the young Billy Bibbit. Everything about this movie was great, no remake can ever compete with this cinematic art (and I never use terms like that unless I feel its 100% true).

158,charchuk,"Exceptionally well-acted, but the story is lacking",8,21 March 2007,"I found it very well-acted, and the characters compelling and sympathetic, but I felt the story was a bit thin and made the ending not as powerful as it could have been. While I think Jack Nicholson's performance is simply magnetic, possibly because of his energetic character, I found Louise Fletcher's role to be too abbreviated, and, as a result, not as villainous as I was expecting. The performance was great, but I found it to be much more of a supporting role than a lead one. The story just seems to be a series of events strung loosely along, and didn't really lead up to the powerful ending well. The ending was still emotional, though, mostly because of the great performances. The highlight of the film, for me, is the realistic relationships between all the characters - I found no weak links in the expansive cast, and the characters all felt real. I found the direction really noticeable at times, like when McMurphy's reactions are focused on during the argument between Harding and Taber, but wholly unremarkable at others. It's very funny, too, though I feel almost ashamed for laughing at the mental handicaps, and I'm not sure what the filmmakers' intention was. Overall, I found it to be slightly overrated, if only because I thought the story was slightly lacking, but certainly deserving of the accolades for its cast - especially Jack.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

160,roghache,"Over-rated film...a depressing, degrading glimpse into mental institution life",3,3 April 2006,"When I saw the high rating this movie is getting from viewers, I could hardly believe it and simply had to put in my two cents worth of rebuttal. I haven't seen this film since shortly after its release, nor do I wish to view it again. I agree with one comment that it's the most over-rated movie to come out of the 70's. I also concur with another reviewer that Jack Nicholson's character, McMurphy, is basically self centered and not really compassionate at all toward his fellow inmates. This guy is no hero, and let's not make a tragic victim out of him as an 'anti-hero'.The movie chronicles the ill adventures of one McMurphy (Nicholson), who fakes insanity so as to do his time for statutory rape in a mental institution, as opposed to a prison. While there, he tries to liven up the place and drum up some independence for his fellow inmates. In the process, he incurs the ill favor of the coldly calculating and hateful Nurse Ratchet, and is eventually forced to have treatments he would certainly never have envisioned for himself.I really don't have much good to say about any of it. Nicholson isn't my favorite actor at best, though I do realize he won an Oscar for this cleverly captured but rather uninspiring role. As to his character's fate, I found it difficult to sympathize with him. This McMurphy is, frankly, a jerk of the highest order. Louise Fletcher, voted Best Actress, is certainly compelling as the psychiatric patient's 'worst nightmare' nurse. I'll wager a lot of real life nurses in the mental institutions of that era, generally decent people doing a difficult job with reasonable integrity, weren't all that thrilled with the public's new picture of their profession, as personified by the controlling and monstrous Nurse Ratchet. I am personally not a psychiatric nurse, but it doesn't require much brilliance to imagine their sentiments.I suppose the film did bring to light some of the primitive and cruel treatments employed in psychiatric hospitals, such as shock treatments and lobotomies, but undoubtedly some patients were well cared for even in those days. According to this film, one would think that they were all treated with disrespect and malice. Looking back, it's easy for us to judge now, but the medical professionals then did not have the wide range of medications and so on that are available today and often coped as best they could.A depressing, degrading, and vastly over rated film. If you haven't already seen it, you're just as well not to bother. It doesn't make for an entertaining or uplifting couple of hours. The intent of this movie should have been to bring dignity and respect to the mentally ill, but its very title conveys the exact opposite message. I agree with with the reviewer who commented that we are expected to feel compassion for these patients (and should) but this film actually makes fun of them.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Let's say you were feeling a tad suicidal after a serious operation about ten years ago. What would happen is this: you'd find yourself shackled to a chair in a ""mental health facility."" The following day, you'd be driven to another city, where you'd find yourself in a run-down building in the worst part of town. In the bathroom, you'd find the floor and walls literally covered with blood. Some of your fellow inmates would be controlled via ""chemical restraints."" They'd walk around like something out of a George A. Romero movie, drooling and staring sightlessly at you. If you could get to sleep at night (because of all the snoring), you might find yourself awakened by an old man standing over you, cursing you for no reason at the top of his lungs (which he would do once too often and end up being beaten so badly by the brutal, hulking staff members that he literally wouldn't be able to sit in a chair); or find yourself flat on your back, the stitches from your heart surgery just a few days old, lifting your feet to try to fend off a pair of combatants coming your way (they would stop just short of where you lay, but would tower over you until they resolved their ""issue""); or find yourself mere moments from defending- very possibly to the death- a nurse attempting to give out the daily ""meds"" to a psychotic patient actually seven feet tall... In the end, they would give the patient a bus ticket and put them on a bus to any other city in the country they wanted to go to. That facility, I've been told, has been closed for the better part of a decade. Nowadays, if you're extremely lucky, you can talk to a therapist in another city on a television screen once every two to six months for thirty minutes.

169,glgioia,"""She Likes a Rigged Game, Doc""",10,10 November 2002,"There aren't many films that can hold their pop after the passing years go to work on them. This film does. Its just as powerful and fresh as when it was released. In terms of achievement, the movies of the 70s were kind of a garbage dump compared to other decades, so this one really sticks out. As for the performances, its become hard to separate Nicholson from this role, almost as if the character played him. Just like Rhett Butler and Stanley Kowalksi did for Gable and Brando. Magically happens sometimes. Kesey's story too is one of the few great novels of the last century. Director Forman gives a clinic on how to successfully make the transition, what to change and what to include. Material changes are made in execution. For example, the book is told completely through the eyes of the Chief, and the movie does an excellent job of going about it differently, but effectively. The irony of the book is of course, that the narrator (Chief) is the one bona fide lunatic in the ward. This is isnt so apparent in the film, but its not important. The performances by Lloyd, DeVito, Billy Bibbitt are just incredible. One odd bit is giving the Best Actress Oscar to Nurse Wratched. She doesn't do much, just stares straight ahead like a blind person most of the time, so she must have just rode the crest of the film's success. In fact, if you see any of her subsequent work, I think you will agree with me. This film deserves a place in everyone's top 10 list.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
170,dvc5159,"""If he's crazy, then what makes us?""",9,21 August 2008,"Rarely has there been a film with such a raw and unnerving atmosphere than ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. This film is one which truly deserves the Big Five Oscars , including Best Picture of 1975. I picked it up just to see how good it is, and in a positive fashion, got more than I bargained for.Based on Ken Kesey's lauded novel, Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is a small time crook who thinks he can get out of work in prison by pretending to be crazy. However he is sent to a mental institution, where the head nurse is more of a dictator than a regular one, and is behind him every step of the way.What I like most about the film is the chemistry between the actors. And Jack Nicholson clearly shows off his talent here. His portrayal of McMurphy is close to perfection, as his character displays more moral values than most of our politicians in real life. From his inspirational talk to Chief, to heated ""meetings"" with the nurse, Nicholson becomes an acting tour-de-force to be reckoned with, and his Best Actor win for this film solidifies my point. Without him, the movie may be a failure.Another crucial point of the film is the main antagonist, Nurse Ratched, played chillingly to the bone by veteran Louise Fletcher. Sure, this small-size female may be soft-toned, but beware, she has the leer of a king cobra and will spurt out personal questions relentlessly towards weak-minded people to get her dictatorial ways. The fact that she is evil is how cold and insensitive she is towards her patients, especially during therapy sessions. Fletcher also deserves her Oscar.The supporting characters don't have much to say here - we see a pre-BACK-TO-THE-FUTURE Christopher Lloyd (Doc Emmett Brown) in a scene-stealing role as an aggressive mental patient, Danny DeVito as an annoying OCD-like dimwit, and Brad Dourif in a mesmerizing and more sensitive role than his later effort, the killing doll Chucky in CHILD'S PLAY. Will Sampson, however, plays his character Chief with conviction. For a tall and mean-looking giant, he practically has some moral values of his own, yet he doesn't disclose them. However, the whole movie is about McMurphy's feud with Ratched and how it affects everyone around them.The direction is solid, if not slow paced. Best Director winner Milos Forman directs with passion in mind. His direction is crisp and full of sublimity, which gives the film a sort of distinct beauty to it. The dialogue scenes are gripping, and characterization is fully realized with this. The cinematography as well is great, the mental hospital looks grim and eerie and boring at the same time. The music is well-handled, as most of the music appears during the therapy scenes. And of course, the great screenplay by Laurence Hauben and Bo Goldman, who seems to have taken every important aspect from the novel and turned it into cinematic greatness.All-in-all, I have nothing but profound respect for this film. It's truly a real film experience, some of which you do not get today. As a film, it stand the test of time and will remain a classic for many, many others to see. I highly recommend this piece of art, but mind you, it's only for people with patience to see slow movies, so that they can indulge on the greatness much later. For now, enjoy this film.9.9997/10Delton",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

It's easy to see very severe critics against institutions which supposedly tries/controls everyone's willings and actions. Then, we have then these two main characters, whose personalities reflects well the result of the institutional oppressive control:'The Chief' is the man which don't accept what is imposed to him, however he don't has any courage to do the change. He prefers to play the deaf and mute instead.McMurphy is the man which questions everything; the man which the institution don't wants. He is a potential bomb. He is the only one which can make the change. The only one with courage. He fights. The 'real' great man, according to Chief.Of course, there is all the others super interesting supporting characters, like, for example, the man which does not want change,and the one which don't care for nothing,and etc etc etc. But this is for another talk.And yes, the end can be disappointing for some people, generally those which had high hopes for McMurphy.

McMurphy may be inconceivable in the eyes of ordinary people, but when he clearly heard that the Indian chief was a deaf mute, he still moved me by insisting on teaching the chief to play basketball. The Chief has always been an unremarkable little man in the hospital, but McMurphy did not dislike him, but taught him to play basketball seriously. It was exactly this. McMurphy and the chief became friends. He also knew that the chief's deafness was pretended.After the doctors in the hospital forced McMurphy to perform a frontal resection, McMurphy almost lost the kind of desire for freedom he once had. So that in the end McMurphy died in the hospital, and he and the chief's plan to escape from the hospital day and night to Canada failed. But it didn't matter, because in the end the chief fled the hospital, and he left the hospital with McMurphy's wishes. This may be spiritual freedom forever.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

I found her tedious and the AA win for Fletcher a puzzle. McMurphy beats Ratched at every turn until the powers that be basically kill him because the patients love him and follow him. They cannot beat him otherwise because it's his game, and he's an expert. So the film shows us the horror of that kind of power: and not Ratched, rather, the system she belongs to. But there is a win against them. It is Chief, who rescues him, outwits them all, and wins both respect and freedom. It's finally his story and with his flight the hope McMurphy represents. Ratched lost.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

177,PeterRoeder,Don't let the bastards get you down!,8,3 March 2006,"This is an excellent movie. Nicholason is awesome and the acting is generally very good. The only problem I would have with it is the unrealistic way the mental patients are described. This is hardly the way it is to be insane. The movie is also a bit sentimental like for example scenes where we see severely sick people partying at Christmas. What joy could they possible get out of that? However, all this is excused because the plot is so good. The role of the big Indian really makes sense, and this is, of course, really the story of America. ""They killed him."" ""I'm not saying they killed him. They were working on him like they are working on you."" This is the conversation between Nicholson and the Indian. It is very true. This is what ""society"" does to you as a person. There's always going to be some people who are ""working on you"" to get you down. But this movie is saying: ""Don't let the bastards get you down!""",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
178,mmunier,One goes against the grain,8,23 March 2007,"2007, I re-watched this movie that left me with a great impression. When I first watched it, it was I think a little after my 1973 psychiatric nursing training in Australia and may well be the year it was made (1975). From hearsay I had learn that conditions in mental institutions were already much improved from previous years yet quite an eye opening for me. At the conclusion of the film I had mixed feelings about it. I found it much exaggerated to what I did know and experienced. Just the same I could identify so many situation that the movie recreated with such perfection that it was uncanny. The patients themselves were much convincing. The group therapy sessions also reminded me what I had resented in some of our own group session where patients were being manipulated to suite the session and or empower the leader rather than the ""client"". The revelation to the main character that many of the patients were voluntary is very well included and worth to remember to be true, well sometimes with a dash of coercion. Randal may be the hero there and may have many points right, none the less is no angel and his sanity is also questionable. I'm not too sure I go along mental health act regarding Illness versus Criminal behaviour, but won't go any further on this subject.I feel some comments got it right. He is a dangerous misfit who's being assessed about possible ""insanity"" So we almost end up with a contest with the righteous psycho Vs the wrongful psycho. So back to 2007, I hired the DVD and enjoyed it immensely this time. I've alway been a fan of J. Nicholson, from ""5 easy pieces"" milk bar scene till now hardly ever a disappointment(I'm thinking of something Witches of ...) As for Nurse Ratched, no wonder she won an Oscar for best actress too. Denis de Vito...I thought that guy looked so much like him! I'm retired now and don't have that feeling to protect the image of this industry, not because or retirement but somehow I feel more comfortable about the present situation regarding patients (clients!) treatment these days. (Actually I almost feel that the scale is tilting the other way now). Mental health Care is a very complex situation, still with a huge stigma attached to it despite all kind of attempts to rename, disguise institutions and terminology. Let's face it who would like to have any of those patients discharged from the institution and become their neighbourg? Empathy has its limits. Saying this I also thought of our hero here; Would you like him to become your neighbourg too? But if movies generates a little awareness and soul searching into some of us this is something positive. On my DVD was also a commentary that seems to run along the movie again from producers, and other people. this was very interesting. It said that all (acting) patients. were actually actors, and so realistically that when J. Nicholson who turned up latter through the rehearsal was it seemed a little concerned. Another interesting thing is about him again and his dedication to his work, his ""homework"" to his role that made it look so natural. His ""tirade"" on the fake baseball game, I think, occurred 12 years earlier! And that apparently lasted much longer that what was taken for the film. Well I would recommend anyone to look at this as much as the movie itself, perhaps if it is your second go at it, watch this first then the movie to appreciate it even more.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
179,Eternality,Cuckoo's Nest is a must-watch for all cinephiles and is most certainly one of the great American films of the seventies.,10,21 June 2011,"One of the great directors who have made the effortless change from European cinema to the glamour of Hollywood, Milos Forman has two Best Directing Oscars to show for his achievement in two extraordinary films whose fame would forever be indebted to the highly-respected filmmaker from Czechoslovakia – Amadeus (1984) and One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. The latter stars Jack Nicholson in an Oscar-winning performance playing Randall McMurphy, a lazy troublemaker who has a history of violence and now fakes insanity that allows him to be committed to a local mental institution.Randall's arrival shakes things up in the mental institution. He makes friends with a deaf and mute American-Indian called Chief Bromden (Will Sampson) and establishes a love-hate relationship with Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), the institution's dictatorial head nurse. Always up to mischief, Randall's rebellious nature sees him heavily involved in a series of situations leading up to the film's shatteringly powerful climax that is not only emotional wrenching, but oddly inspirational as well. With an exceptional supporting cast of ""mental patients"" played by talented character actors such as Danny DeVito and Brad Dourif, Forman's film is a tour de force in ensemble acting.Both a brilliant behavioral comedy and an intricate drama, Cuckoo's Nest blends strong character interplay with moments of side-splitting situational humor such as the iconic scene of Randall playing foolishly with the water cooler. The sequence that still takes my breath away no matter how many times I see it is the one that starts with Charley Cheswick (Sydney Lassick) pleading Nurse Ratched to return his cigarettes and ends in utter chaos involving nearly everyone in the madhouse. Although the film pokes fun at the unfortunate lives of shackled mental patients, by the end of the film, Forman's sensitive direction would have allowed us to observe the dehumanizing effects of institutionalization.Cuckoo's Nest explores themes of morality, humanity and friendship through its anti-hero and villain. Randall who yearns for freedom in the institution wages physical and psychological warfare with Nurse Ratched, who is hell-bent in enforcing strict rules and regulations. Some would argue that the head nurse is just doing her job, but by the film's climax, she turns into one of American cinema's coldest and most cruel villains. While the film is shot from the point-of-view of Chief, Randall remains to be our anti-hero and our rallying point against oppressive authority. Yet, we occasionally feel that the ruckus he creates borders on lunacy, to the point that it might be difficult to defend his actions.Therein lies the brilliance of Forman's film – the development of a complex protagonist and antagonist whose roles interchange depending on the circumstance. There is no clear case of black or white in this film, which makes it an experience to savor even on its umpteen viewing. Cuckoo's Nest is a must-watch for all cinephiles and is most certainly one of the great American films of the seventies. Highly recommended.GRADE: A+ (9.5/10 or 5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Milos Forman said it is an allegory of a life in communism.. Nevertheless, the fact is still that the McMurphy is a criminal who is just playing it to avoid punishment.. in fact he is kinda manipulating all the others that are less sane than him.. taking advantage of his position in the society being above others..I also do not feel that the nurse Ratched is as bad as the tries to show her. She makes what she thinks is best for the patients.. And they know they can get out.. when she is in control, everything is calm.. no joy, but not a mess as when McMurphy steps in.. that is the other extreme.. Actually my favorite character was Billy.. Poor kid downtrodden by his own mother...Definitely, the patients are not getting a good care. I hope mental health hospitals are being better these days! And if this is an allegory of life.. it may not be only communism.. every person may find tyrannical authorities in his teacher, parents, boss... but I don't think neither approach -> nor total chaos, nor total order is the key..

Especially Louis Fletcher as Nurse Ratched.Never have I seen such a powerful obvious villain so well disguised. I mean, you know you're not supposed to like her from the moment she comes in dressed in black, in stark contrast to the white walls of the mental institution. Yet, her actions and dialogue are so diplomatic that I think a lesser actor wouldn't have been able to pull off the evil inside her soul.This is a pretty depressing film at times, but there are also moments of fun as well. In the end, it's really hard to talk about this film in any solid way. It's complex, but also simple. R.P.

All we really need to say is...its entertaining, its funny, and it will toy with your emotions. Jack Nicholson has been a great actor for a long time, but he never got better than this. He got an Oscar for his amazing performance as ex. convict McMurphy...who thinks time spent in a mental hospital will be easier than ""the joint"". He is in for many surprises. Phsychiatric Nurses can be heavy handed with people who have a personality. Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher) the head nurse on his ward, is finding her ""work"" boring ...so she engages in a private psychological battle with McMurphy.

185,ReelCheese,When People Talk About Memorable Movies...,9,12 June 2006,"When people mention movies that stay with you, they're talking about ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. This deserving Oscar winner stars Jack Nicholson as Randle P. McMurphy, a sane (or is he?) troublemaker sent to a mental institution. Sympathetic to his new roommates, he promptly involves them in cards, basketball, fishing and just plain old fun. However disturbing his presence is to the staff, including strict Nurse Ratched, the newest cuckoo fits right in while breathing new life into the orderly surroundings.Everything clicks in this one. The characters are remarkable and distinct without being exaggerated or unbelievable. The performers are a treasure, arguably constituting one of the most incredible ensemble casts ever seen. Nicholson again proves he's the master at playing characters we think we know while at the same time knowing we may not know. Is McMurphy merely a petty shyster looking for an easy way out or is he certifiably sick? Louise Fletcher is just as good as Nurse Ratched. Although she is often cited as one of filmdom's great villains, she doesn't come across nearly as evil as her reputation suggests. In fact, viewers may find themselves wondering who to trust -- the rambunctious jailbird McMurphy or the professional, buttoned-down Ratched. Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif and big Will Sampson as the silent Native American are outstanding in supporting roles.Given the subject matter involved, not everybody could have turned ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST into such a respectful, dignified picture.

All my memory on her is her square face wearing from the beginning till the end.The plot is not particularly enchanting. But at that era this movie should be a pioneer in depicting MI patients.

Milos Forman invites us to his movie in the credits (naturally) and at the first scene, you already then feel that this is going to be something special. And my God it was! This movie simply has got everything! Humor, Drama, tenderness, empathy, realism, evil. That's one reason I love it. The other? Well, It's once again a tale of the endless battle against good and evil, something that appeals me very much. These two things are the things that makes a movie very good (thats why STAR WARS is my nr.1, good vs. evil and has got every genre in the world).Now, Milos Forman is a very original director. I have only seen one of his movies (LARRY FLYNT) from this, and the two are similar in direction, I realize as I write this. And now it's nothing I can put my word on, but it is. Over to One Flew... It is a very tenderness tale that shows true love of life, and proves that people aren't as crazy as they look. The plot and script didn't lack, who said this? I don't think I have seen one better movie that contains this emotional love. Nothing is dull or boring. Nothing is stupid. No emotions fail. It is a movie witch includes sentimentality that doesn't blow over (that's unusual in a movie from America). Nothing is unbelievable or too amazing. Everything that happens seems realistic. All of this are thoughts born by thoughts that has been in my head ever since I saw this movie. And a 100%-realistic film, that keeps you thinking two weeks later has got to be a good film.Acting, no words to say. JACK NICHOLSON in one of his many master-portraits. He shines as McMurphy. Fletcher is his match in acting in this movie. She is cold, the true evil, McMurphy's nemesis and the enemy of anybody's life. She is a demon. Christopher Lloyd in his best role ever (the nutty professor in BACK TO THE FUTURE is close), Danny DeVito in his absolute nr.1-appearence. His role in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is simply so emotional that you laugh/cry every time he's in a scene. If you look at Scatman Crothers' here and look at him in THE SHINING.

The film is a thrilling drama about mental patients under the iron fist of the cold-hearted, stoic Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher who garnered the Best Supporting Actress Oscar that year as well). This film also marked a high point for a young Michael Douglas as a producer in the early days of his film career as well as the feature film debut of Brad Douriff as Billy Bibbit, a young stuttering, suicidal patient (Douriff later appeared in 1980's 'Child's Play' opposite Chris Sarandon and also played Sheriff Brackett in 2007's 'Halloween').

191,Gubby-Allen,Good film yes. Great film no.,6,2 December 2001,"I chose to see this partly on the strength of it being in the IMDB Top 10 & I have to say I was disappointed.SpoilersThe first hour was excellent, but it seemed everything that could've occurred or been said had, by this point and the last hour & quarter did drag unnecessarily. You done well if you stayed awake throughout the last hour.I believe the viewer is supposed to hate Nurse Radchett. I didn't. I found her ok, and certainly not malicious like some commenters have done. She is only doing her job after all, in an environment where some of the patients are highly dangerous.I've not read the book, but people who have tell me it is one of the worst adaptations ever. I'll have to abstain from that.On the plus side, the acting is just brilliant. Nicholson, DeVito, Lloyd, infact the whole cast are worthy of a best actor award. You genuinely do believe every one of them are mental patients, and play each role perfectly. I struggle to think of a film with a better display of acting in it.Some of the scenes too, are moving, and you do feel for them but I certainly don't find the film depressing. Sadly though, I am staggered people have claimed this to be funny. Some scenes may raise a smile at most, but laugh? No.The ending was also disappointing, infact I'm not really sure what exactly it signified. I can't help thinking the book would've explained it easier.But the biggest problem I had with this film was that I never knew the whole way through whether Mac wanted to be in the hospital or not? Half the time he seemed to love it in there, but then the other half he was either escaping or wishing he was outside. One or two of the other characters were fairly similar too. Why the hell did he keep coming back in again? Or maybe, that is the whole point of the film. He sees the benefits both inside & out & can't make up his mind.I've certainly seen enough Americans leaping away from exploding cars, in films, to last me a lifetime, so I'm not suggesting this film needed that, but at the end of the day, it was set 99% in a mental hospital, and there's only so much you can do in that environment. It just lacked that extra bit of excitement, action, tension & suspense to make it a classic.
Anyway. There's plenty worse films in the IMDB top 20 than this, not mentioning any Citizen Kanes or Fight Clubs, sorry, I mean any names, so I would certainly recommend it, but don't expect it to be upto Star Wars or Shawshank Redemption standard.6.5 /10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

It also brought to us One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.For a long time, I've been wanting to watch this movie hearing all the praise its being receiving. My favorite thing about the film is the casting! Jack Nicholson, Danny de Vito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. These are actors that I've loved from different films! I loved Jack in the Shining, De Vito in Matilda, Lloyd in Back to the Future and Dourif in Lord of the Rings and Child's Play. To see all these actors unite for this one classic film was just awesome, not to mention that Lloyd, De Vito and Dourif are about 30 years younger than I remember them! Now, the story is an extremely interesting one. Its about a man named McMurphy who admits to being insane in order to live his life at a much more friendly place, a mental institute. Here, he begins to change the lives of all the other patients and realizes that Nurse Ratching is holding each of them back. The story may certainly start off slow, but to me, seeing Nicholson act the way he did was good enough for the whole film. I really enjoyed that. The film also spends considerably amount of time with the characters McMurphy and Chief, developing their relationship but also giving plenty of screen time to Dourif's stuttering character! Now this 120 minute movie could've been shortened but really the way the film works is by giving the relationships between characters time to develop.

I usually stick to the old action/thriller esque, but never have I gotten into the classics. Seeing as this was on Netflix, I strangely became interested. First off: JACK NICHOLSON! He's one of (if not, the best) the best actors working today. Second off: beforehand, I knew about broadening by range; and this was a drama-classic destined to be loved. So I had the highest of expectations and thank God I knew nothing of the film beforehand. And when the title appeared and when the film rolled on, I was set back into the darkest of all places. Poetic brilliance to the simple stuff, the comedic (but not purposely) scenes to the dark ones. I watched with an open mind and completely fell in love. The characters are so easy to ease up on, the sick way the movie presents itself, the sheer brilliance in all of the dialogue, music, writing. And combined, all of these elements made One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest one of my favorite films. Beforehand, as said before, I had expectations but never before these kind of expectations. Everything was poetic and beautiful. When Murphy took the gang out to fish or when the characters had random outbursts, they all had me strangely loving and laughing. I know this film isn't a comedy, but the tremendously real acting had me feeling for the characters. Jack's characters was hopeful but awfully dark. He had his moments of true warmheartedness but had his share of evil; hence the title. I never read the book, nor do I want to. Books don't strike my interest but somehow, someway this movie wants me to see what they had done to bring the book to life. The acting was pure genius, and must I note Jack's (once again.) Then we have the last 15 minutes. Spoiler beware... This was probably one of the darkest endings in movie history, but it is so profound and dark that it makes it brilliant. You have a suicide, and Jack's attempt to choke one of the nurses to death. This makes him end up having the effects of lobotomy and his friend kills him and jumps out the window. Mercy killing... This ending had me in tears, it had me betrayed, it was so simplistic but so evil. But so right. I found this movie to be one of the best movies ever. It rightfully deserves it's 8.8 or even higher. It rightfully deserves everything it has been receiving, it even deserves a bow for it's poetic trance. I recommend this movie on all levels.

It definitely holds up well, although there's no doubt that Nicholson's performance makes the film. Without him, you can easily see how many scenes would drag and be downright boring.One thing I noticed upon viewing, is that Nurse Ratched isn't nearly the mean nurse she is made out to be whenever this film is discussed. Sure, she seems to have a ""fakeness"" many times when she caters to the mental patients, but she really isn't that bad at all. It isn't until the end, when she threatens Billy with telling his mother he slept with the girl, knowing he has suicidal tendencies, that she seems wicked. But until then, she really isn't so bad.And nothing against Louise Fletcher, who does a decent job at playing Nurse Ratched, but winning best actress? For what? She pretty much never really does anything more here than give icy stares, and while she certainly played the part well, it really had to be a very weak year in the ""Best Actress"" category. She's a very decent actress as we've seen in her other films, but she just doesn't have to do much here at all. Ratched even looks kind of hot sometimes, and her fellow nurse, whatever her name is, is very hot indeed. She is definitely something nice to look at whenever the film tends to drag a bit. It is also fun picking out the 70's cars in the outdoors scenes, when the film is set in '63. The Pinto and Duster are great! The appearance of Scatman Crothers was a surprise as I completely forgot he was in the film, and his scenes led to some (probably unintentionally) funny sequences with The Scatman doing his thing.But this is definitely better than most films of the time, mainly because Jack Nicholson is just so darn good.

I love a good drama, but I hate run on dialog and the movie had too much of that, but if you stick with it you realize it needs much of it to play out slowly for a character building.Jacky boy did good, but he was just a center piece for the other great actors to play off of. Everyone else is the star, and thats not an insult towards Jack, its true...his character is what puts the story and heart there for the other characters and allows them to open up.It's basically a story about a guy who gets put into a crazy house in order to get out of jail time and once there he realizes a lot about himself and about the human mind..how sane are we and is crazy always our fault or are we trapped inside of the worlds madness...I don't know how to say it, but thats why you watch the movie because it gets pretty deep.Again the acting is great, 35 years later and its still appealing and also its nice to see so many great stars in their early years, looking young and fresh. The direction didn't do much for me here...say what you will.. It was basic direction and the only key thing I enjoyed was letting the actors tell a characters story without dialog at times. The director had a lot of closeups spending quite some time focusing on just human emotions without words...sometimes thats deeper and more poignant than a page of brilliant lines..6 out of 10 stars because Its not perfect, it had a great story, but not a great hold.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

In the institution, he meets Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a cruel, unyielding nurse who makes life unbearable for the patients. After McMurphy has a few run ins with Ratched, he is sent for shock treatments, and war breaks out on ward.This is an intense movie with some great performances all around.

The strange music at the beginning can already attract people. In a short period of time, the shaping of several major characters was reflected. Milk's characters: delusional, lively and unruly. The strictness of the head nurse also has many patient characteristics. The characters is full erected.
At the same time , the plot advances while going fishing. Freedom, life, who would think of group mental illness?
During the meeting, Milk was a little puzzled when he learned that most people entered voluntarily. Mental illness, who will rush to do it? What's wrong wirh society, still......
With the appearance of Milk, this peaceful place was broken and the small society changed. So Milk must disappear. No matter whether he is active or passive. Ok the initiative failed. So, he's dead. The lively, unruly Milk disappeared, leaving only an obedient child.

199,brianberta,A masterpiece both uplifting and disheartening,10,17 April 2015,"This is a very interesting and creative movie with emotion and power. It's about a man named Randle McMurphy who goes to a mental institution. Then it shows his many battles with Nurse Ratched. Nurse Ratched is an obstructionist and nasty character who everyone in the institution hates. Her attitude annoys people greatly even though she barely shows any emotion. Louise Fletcher did a great performance but Jack Nicholson is the one who steals the show. In my opinion, his acting was perfect. He was perfect in timing and character perception. The cinematography was excellent and the haunting score is also equally amazing. The ending takes a dramatic turn making it highly tragic but it shows a great deal of power and emotion and that is what makes it so great as a film. 4 decades later, it still holds up great and it's just as entertaining and moving as it was back in 1975. This is one of the 3 movies in history to receive all 5 top Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay). This is also the most deserving film to receive those awards.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Winner of 5 academy awards- Best actor in a leading role, Best actress in a leading role, Best Director, Best picture and Best screenplay. And this has only ever been achieved twice. The other being The Silence Of The Lambs in 1991. After reading some reviews on the internet about this much acclaimed film, i sat down with my three brothers and watched one of the greatest films in living film memory. After watching the film i couldn't believe how great and sad it was, funny and compelling in all ways. And i could definitely understand why people cried, because it is emotional. The characters who do have mental disabilities all make you understand how hard and frustrating it is.The end was very very sad and hard hitting. Milos Forman has done an exceptional job in creating the atmosphere and situations the people in the film face.To summarise my view, One flew over the Cuckoos nest is stupendous and brilliant, cunning and sad, funny and clever. This can't be mist by anyone.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
202,peeedeee-94281,You Get Out of It What You Bring To It,6,30 October 2020,"I watched One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest about a decade or ago for the first time and found it quite entertaining. It was also interesting to see how many before-they-were-famous actors were in this movie. It was almost like an audition for their future careers to come! The last 30 minutes were, and still is, a roller coaster ride.
Watching the movie recently, with an older perspective on life and social issues, I'm finding the movie isn't so perfect.
I guess you could look at a movie as a metaphor for society and that Jack represents being an individualist and bucking the system. If you're into that approach to living, then you'll totally relate to his character. On the other hand, if you prefer social order and routine, his behavior will be seen as disruptive and anarchistic.
My view on Nurse Ratched has slightly changed over the years. When I first watched the movie, I saw her as the huge villain. But on repeated viewing, I still see has somewhat manipulative, but not a huge villain. I mean, she does punish people based on them doing something wrong, as opposed to, just doing it randomly. I think the whole TV situation definitely put her on the wrong side of things. But it ultimately was a bit of a power struggle between Nicholson's Mac and Ratched. The thing is, the inmates were not feeling like they were missing much. In fact, as Ratched put it, they were in there on their own voluntary choice. Naturally it makes sense, considering these were not violent mental patients.
Now, the one thing I think everyone disagrees upon is the electroshock therapy and lobotomy approach to treating these individuals. There's no disputing that. But I think in some way, this movie did a disservice by putting people who can't take care of themselves in society, in a wrong light. Like they were imprisoned rather than being looked after. Sadly, today, something like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest doesn't exist because so many people with mental health issues, who should be institutionalized, have been given a bottle of pills and told to look after themselves, on their own.
I know I digress, but I guess the overall message could be, do people who cannot care for themselves, need to be emancipated? Or should it be accepted that they do better when they are in an environment that looks after their needs 24/7?
Unfortunately the last 30 minutes of the movie kind of throw all the messages out the window, with violence. Or is that what it's all about as well? As much as you try to control through passive aggressive measures, the violence is always bubbling just below the surface.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
203,GirishGowda,Excellent performances complement a brilliant direction,10,23 April 2010,"The opening shot of the film is a bleak glance at an Oregon morning. The background score is haunting, stirring and graceful. A car is approaching towards what would be a mental hospital. It contains a dangerous man, R.P. McMurphy who has been sent to the mental hospital by the police. He had raped a 15 year old girl (I still can't believe how anybody could do that to a child. Come on people, be kind and civilized. Women aren't just objects to satisfy your needs. Don't be cruel animals.) and gotten into lots of fights at the prison, which thereby was concluded by the prison officials to send him into a mental hospital for clarification on whether he was really crazy or just pretending. He meets the head nurse Ratched (funny name) in the weekly routine therapeutic sessions with the other crazy people. She is controlling and everything proceeds as she wishes. He befriends the other people in the ward and they look up to him as their hero when he does everything he can to irritate Nurse Ratched. In due course of time, he even manages to be friends with the Chief Bromden (no, no. He's also a patient), who is a huge native American and apparently can't talk or hear. But, he confesses to McMurphy later in the movie that he is just pretending. The performance of Jack Nicholson as McMurphy is really haunting. This film has won 5 major Oscars - Best Film, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay (adapted), only 2 others have managed that feat. Danny Devito's debut performance is heartwarming and the stammering boy, Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif) gave such an outstanding performance that the climax will be remembered by everyone who has ever seen this movie. The professor in Back To The Future movies also does a good job here. Everybody in the film give awesome performances. But, I am still wondering, did Louise Fletcher really deserve that Oscar? I mean she played her role really well, but that is what all nurses do. They don't give free rein to the patients and take the hard decisions. The one scene I liked was when Billy commits suicide and both Ratched and McMurphy seem to be thinking that it is their fault for his death and McMurphy tries to strangle Ratched, which eventually leads to a procedure called Lobotomy to be done on McMurphy and he is brain-dead after that. In the beginning, I knew McMurphy was just pretending to be crazy. But, during his time in the hospital we can see the subtle changes in him. How could he allow his lover to sleep with someone else? (maybe she was a hooker, I don't know) And nobody seems to be commenting on Candy (Marya Small) who gave such a sweet portrayal of a woman who likes a bad person, but even then continues to give into his every demands. I liked her very much. The Chief didn't want McMurphy, who wanted to get out more than anything else, to live on like that. So, he strangled him to death and in truly symbolic reference lifted the water basin or something and threw it through the windows and escaped into the bleak Oregon morning. I thought McMurphy was the one who would fly out of the cuckoo's nest, but it wasn't the case. If McMurphy had lived and escaped, this wouldn't be a great classic and it wouldn't have been remembered still today. Director Milos Forman, pat yourself on the back for this amazing gem. Three brilliant moments in the film are 1. the fishing trip 2. the party in the mental hospital. 3. The jaw-dropping ending. This and the very real performances by the actors as mental patients made the film excellent for me. I am only glad that today's mental institutions don't resemble the prison-like hospitals back then. This also represents the society's attitude towards mentally challenged people. There is a scene where McMurphy tells the patients that they are no more crazy than the average goon out there in the streets, that was a brilliant scene. And the shock that flits over McMurphy's face when he finds out that most of them have come into the mental hospital voluntarily and he is one of the very few committed persons in there is awesome. The dialogue after this revelation in which he says to Billy that he should go out there and be in a convertible, bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver is supremely spectacular. I haven't read the book, nor do I want to because I want to keep this amazing version in my head. Jack Nicholson is at his best here and everybody should see this movie at least once before they die. 10/10 - Girish, 20",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
204,freaky_dave,A very disturbing yet incredible movie going experience,9,11 March 2007,"One Flew Over the Cukoos Nest had a deep impact on me, especially the ending which of course I will not reveal.Randall Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) pretends to be crazy in order to get out of prison and work. He is sent to a mental institution instead, and this is where we meet the other patients in the ward. This movie had a lot of actors that would go onto long careers in film. Danny Devito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif were all a part of this phenomenal movie, and they all gave incredible performances.McMurphy soon becomes a hero of sorts for the patients and helps them to improve their psychological well being. Of course soft spoken Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) doesn't like this as it starts to affect her domineering control over the patients. She is truly one of the most evil villains of all time and deserved her Oscar just as much as Nicholson deserved his.This movie was well directed and well acted. I don't think any other movie actors could've made it even half as good. The movie's pacing was excellent, and it also contained some funny moments, but the one thing I didn't like about the movie was that it was one sided towards the patients. With the exception of Scatman Crothers as the night orderly, all the workers, doctors, and nurses seemed inhuman and hateful in this film. We never got any other sort of view of them. Maybe that was the point of the movie, but it still left me a little uncomfortable. After seeing this movie, I don't think I would ever want to be committed to a mental institution ever. So I'll give it a solid 9 out of 10.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
205,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: Nest or Cage?,8,9 November 2013,"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a hard movie to judge. It's not the conventional drama of good versus evil. Writer never tries to establish any character as good or bad, instead he leaves it to the viewer to decide. Whole movie is set in a mental institution where our hero enters, break the conventional rules and all hell break loose finally. The climax leaves you in a bitter sweet taste and you can't escape from the questions it raises to you. Movie is slow paced, takes its sweet time before action starts. It's the Jack Nicholson's finest acting show that keeps you glued to the screen. Lousie Fletcher plays the Jack's counterpart of hard faced rule book following nurse quite competently. All other supporting characters are also well developed and play their part to the perfection. It's not the storytelling or drama that leaves you spell binded but it is the emotional depth and the soulful characters that leave the lasting impression on you. Not to be missed for whom who like the cinema to be unconventional.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
206,erwan_ticheler,Brilliant Acting Makes For A Very Good Movie,9,17 August 2003,"Although the story is not that great,what makes this picture unforgettable is the brilliant acting by the actors,especially Jack Nicholson.His performance is one of the best I've ever seen,his expression is not to be matched.He fakes braindead after having had terror-treatment and lets the other patients very much paralized.Yet Nurse Ratched knows he's faking it.Also great acting is the scene when Jack waits for his girlfriend when she's having sex with one of the inmates,the sad Billy Bibbit.The expression and silence of that moment is very impressive. The other actors are also on their top level,like Louise Fletcher as the legendary ""evil"" Nurse Ratched.She plays it with great determination and it looks not as evil as it should be,that's because she makes it look like she thinks that she's doing the right job. Another great performance comes from Danny DeVito.The ending is,although very sad,in the line of the movie.Again the acting of Nicholson makes it unforgettable.  9/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
207,Artimidor,Rebel with a cause - McMurphy vs. Nurse Ratched,10,16 March 2012,"Very few great films are just simple and straightforward, require no brain-twisting abilities from the viewer, can be enjoyed by practically anyone and have an inevitable impact that resonates deeply. Also one rarely finds films that are entertaining, dramatic, humorous, tragic and poetic all at the same time and on top of that have something to say which doesn't sound moralising. If you're looking for a picture which meets all those requirements ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" fits the bill.Awarded in 1975 with the magic five Oscars covering all main categories (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) it is one of the most effective anti-establishment parables which takes place in a mental hospital, where sane but rebellious Jack Nicholson as R.P. McMurphy fights Nurse Ratched's (Louise Fletcher) authoritarian regime. The two main characters play so well off each other that one almost forgets the rest of the brilliant cast, among them Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito or the young Brad Dourif, but also not to forget the Native American Will Sampson. All of these inmates work well, because the actors were cast to play roles cut out for them. A flawless screenplay guarantees to be instantly drawn into the world created by Czech born director Milos Forman, and our sympathies soon lie with these characters, especially free spirit McMurphy. Yet sometimes the fight for the right thing is a lost cause from the get-go. We might even be aware of it. However, we learn from characters like McMurphy that - flawed as we are - we can have the heart at the right place, even against the odds. And that there's hope in every failure.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

209,datorsiers2,Jack Nicholson's best movie.,10,7 January 2015,"One of the few movies everyone should see, an incredible masterpiece. It had some funny moments and some very sad and touching moments as well, the movie succeeded to deliver both fun and sadness.Jack Nicholson showed how great of an actor he is in this movie, this should be a great example for young actors, If you think Jack was amazing in The Shining, his performance here was seriously the best of the best. And not only him, you can see many very talented actors in the movie, Danny DeVito was just awesome, despite it being one of his first big movies.The end was very unexpected, but it is understandable why they needed to that to Murphy, he was being too hard to deal with, so the only thing left for them was to lobotomize Murphy and make him into a vegetable, Chief was feeling sorry for his friend and put him out of his misery at the end, leaving him as the only one who escaped at the end. Murphy almost managed to change Billy's life, it was clear that after having an intercourse with Candy, Billy was feeling way better, that gave him hope, he was not scared like he usually was, but nurse Ratched scared him again, which lead to him committing suicide and Murphy not escaping the hospital. That was a great message, which showed that not always treatment at mental hospitals and just talking to doctors who do not care about is the way out, a guy, who just showed everyone how fun life can be, changed Billy's life for a moment, if only billy had been stronger to surpass the mental barrier nurse Ratched had set up for him.Really, Murphy killed himself for nothing, he was not crazy, OK not for nothing, he changed Chief's mind, which lead to Chief escaping, but other than that, he gave his life for nothing, the hospital got the better of him.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

All the crazy actors give good to very good performances. The film has many touching and humorous moments while avoiding sentimentality.Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) is a fine example of female abuse of power, she is spiteful, cold and intelligent.

The following observation might qualify as such a point. Over the years-----I have increasingly reflected upon the perhaps novel idea that movie versions of OFOTCN and Cool Hand Luke (CHL)may have sufficient similarities so as to make it reasonable to compare and contrast them with each other.As presented in both films, the male lead characters are quite alike. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and Luke (Paul Newman) are funny, irreverent, charismatic non-conformists who rebel against rules and regulations that stifle their creative individuality and free spirit. Under the confining environment of a rigidly cloistered life, each became the leader of a peer group and helped to change its ultimate destiny. But all this came at a terrible personal price each ultimately had to pay.While one was incarcerated in a mental hospital and the other in a prison farm, the particular problems they suffered with were substantially comparable. Each character somewhat resembled a Christ-like figure while achieving a victory over institutional oppression under the most difficult of circumstances. Their inherent integrity, decency and good humor helped each to succeed when a lesser person would likely have failed. In the end, McMurphy and Luke reached a sort of immortality by inspiring the lives of their peer groups---who then carried their memory forward to another (and possibly better) day.CHL and OFOTCN are great films because of how they depict the power of the human spirit---which against all odds can sometimes attain heights that defy rational explanation. When such stories are presented in a thoroughly entertaining way, they have the potential to accomplish lofty artistic and commercial success. That is exactly what has happened to these two wonderful movies.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, setting, score and acting. All the actors deliver powerhouse performances. In fact many of the actors spent time in a mental institution to get a feel for the real conditions and treatment of patients at the time. Nicholson, Fletcher and Dourif command the screen. The plot revolves around a prison inmate, McMurphy, who feigns anti-social behavior in order to serve out his time in a mental institution. During his initial evaluation he describes despicable and irreprehensible acts he's committed that prompt the doctor to commit him for further evaluation. Once inside it is McMurphy who starts observing. He observes the patients, some commited and some there voluntarily. More importantly he observes head Nurse Ratched. He views her treatment of patients as inhumane through abuse, cruelty, medications and electroconvulsive therapy. That battle of wills begins here. McMurphy decides to practice his own therapy on patients by treating them as human beings as opposed to being castaways from society. Ratched is relentless in her treatment methods. This battle ultimately ends in one of the most disturbing and poetic endings in film history. The plot is flawless, clever, funny, dark, disturbing, violent, unique and cathartic.

213,Gideon24,An Instant Classic,9,8 March 2015,"The 1975 instant classic One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a blistering and intense comedy-drama that was the first film since 1934's It Happened One Night to sweep the top six major Oscars.This film, based on a novel and play by Ken Kesey, is the story of one Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a career criminal who has been given the option of going to jail or going to a mental institution and his swift and immediate battle of wills with the institution's iron- fisted head nurse, Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who he challenges at every turn, not to mention his Pied Piper effect on his fellow patients, which doesn't help endear him to Nurse Ratched either.Kirk Douglas starred in the play on Broadway and his son, Michael Douglas, won an Oscar as one of the producers of this film. Milos Foreman's meticulous direction also won him an Oscar, but it is the electrifying performance by Jack Nicholson that, after four previous nominations, finally nabbed him an Oscar, as he created a truly original character in McMurphy who is a consistent enigma throughout the film, specifically in the sense of whether or not McMurphy is really mentally defective. Nicholson presents a character that allows us to ponder throughout without never being richly entertained for every moment he is on screen. McMurphy induces cheers when he gets overruled to watch the World Series on TV and he pretends to watch the game on TV anyway without turning it on...there is such a joy in watching the other inmates figuring out what he's doing and joining in the game. His final climactic confrontation with Nurse Ratched also will induce cheers.Louise Fletcher won the Oscar for Outstanding Lead Actress for her bone- chilling performance as Nurse Ratched. Fletcher beautifully underplays this extremely unsympathetic character, never resorting to scenery- chewing histrionics, but never forgetting that Ratched is clearly the villain of this piece. It's sad that Flecther's career did a swift downhill after this film because it's a masterful performance of such subtlety and delicacy. Meryl Streep is the only other actress I can think of who could have pulled this role off.Brad Dourif was robbed of one of the few Oscars the film didn't win, Best Supporting Actor, for his moving and riveting performance as Billy Bibbit, the soulful, stuttering manchild with mother issues whose hero worship of McMurphy helps him to develop some backbone up to a point. Mention should also be made of the performances of William Redfield, Danney De Vito, Vincent Schiavelli as fellow patients and especially Will Sampson as the quiet giant Chief Bromden, on whom McMurphy has a remarkable effect.A one of a kind motion picture experience with one of the most beautifully optimistic endings I can recall in a motion picture. 9/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

216,mohit_sinsniwal,"Both uplifting and didheartening, sometimes both at once",9,25 May 2019,"I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as ""one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles"" and ""one of the classics of the 70's"". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a ""crazy house"" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.-9/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
217,imbluzclooby,Groundbreaking film with flaws.,7,8 August 2019,"The 1970's brought us films and books that showed us how an already competent system could also be cruel and inhumane. Due to following policy on Mental Health programs in the US, lawmakers with naïve hope thought everything would remain normal, but more pleasant and humane. The result is that matters have become much more dreadful and have brought more misery to everyone.Cuckoo's Nest, based on the acclaimed novel by Ken Kesey, is not a movie about Mental illness. It is a movie about oppression, power struggle and abuse. It by no means tries to address the state of affairs with those afflicted with mental illness, but rather serves as an indictment against Mental Institutions. Herein lies the many problems people have with this supposed cinematic masterpiece. I have read some critics reviews who are experienced people in the Mental health profession. They didn't feel the characters were authentic or believable to the patients they have worked with in their respective jobs. I believe that. It's also insulting, as one person noted, that to think that all these patients need is a field trip with some booze and hookers to guide them on the path to sanity and freedom. That's a very immature viewpoint that this movie assumes.Jack Nicholson, along with the rest of the cast give energetic and bravura performances, but the film's point really jars with my sensibilities on a few levels. Nurse Ratched, the supposed heartless villain, is really just a firm, no-nonsense woman who's trying to do her job under stressful circumstances. If anyone has ever worked in the mental health profession, they will attest that this film's viewpoint is disingenuous and inaccurate. Mentally unstable patients are often deceptive and violent people causing harm to themselves and others. This movie presents them as passive and gentle souls who are being wrongfully abused.If you're an anti-establishment person, this is the movie for you. If you're more moderate and reasonable in how you balance justice and humanity you will be bitterly disappointed. Most uninspiring is how it never explores mental illness and how it impacts the people who are affected by it. It just shows these mentally deranged/incapable people as zoo animals that you gawk at out of curiosity, or even worse, for laughs. That I found to be disappointing from a movie that needs to reassess its values. So we don't really get any insight on the complexities of mental illness. The central theme is one of a power struggle between our main protagonists, McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and Nurse Ratched) Louise Fletcher.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
218,Torgo_Approves,No words to say,10,25 October 2006,"(r#90) One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was the first ""favourite film"" I ever had. While it is a pretty low-key film and definitely not what you'd call a blockbuster, it was so loved in Sweden that it stayed in cinemas for over 10 years! So why was this film considered so great? Well, for starters, this is Jack Nicholson at his very best, and that says a lot. Throughout his long and successful career, this might still be Jack's best performance (although I'd argue that his scorching scenery-chewing in ""The Shining"" is even more entertaining). The movie is worth seeing for Mr. Nicholson alone. His high energy, quietly sardonic delivery and trademark leer is pure comic gold and McMurphy is a movie legend.The supporting cast is excellent, as well: the petrifying Louise Fletcher, whose demanding screen presence almost steals the scene from Nicholson himself; Brad Dourif in the role of a life-time as the troubled teen Billy Bibbit; Danny DeVito and Scatman Crothers as one of the inmates and the warden, respectively; and even Christopher Lloyd in his smashing debut role. One-hit-wonder Will Sampson makes a great Chief Bromden, and Sydney Lassick, one of my favourite ""no-name"" actors, is hilarious as poor Cheswick who just wants his cigarettes.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is such a massive success because it balances between emotions so perfectly. To keep it simple: the movie is hilarious, sweet, touching and ultimately shattering. The climax is fantastic and will stick in your memory for a long time. Since the movie's basic plot is very simple (wrongfully institutionalized man teaches suppressed inmates at a mental hospital how to have fun) director Milos Forman can effectively play on our emotions without either manipulating or condescending us. There are no musical or visual cues that tell us what to feel, there are no wailing violins when something bad happens. Instead, the performances and story are more than enough to affect us.Milos Forman, who also cranked out several other of my favourite movies (including ""Amadeus"", ""Hair"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"") is probably the one to thank for making this movie as impressionable as it is. There are no unnecessary scenes, no pointless fluff, no cringe-worthy moments in the film. Every scene is needed to move the plot along, to make us laugh, to make us cry. No scene feels like it could have been left on the editing room floor because every part of the film is just so damn good. Forman is one of today's most under-appreciated directors in my opinion. The guy's a genius, and this is by far his best movie.Having read the book which the film was based on, I understand why fans were disappointed by some of the changes Forman made. The novel is a brilliant masterpiece and one of the most affecting books I have ever read. Still, I don't think the differences between the book and the movie somehow make the latter worse. The most obvious change in the film version is, of course, the fact that we no longer see the story from Chief Bromden's perspective, as we do in the novel. I don't think this change was unnecessary at all and it works very well. It even adds a slight plot twist to the story for someone who hasn't read the book, but let's not say too much about that. I know how much it sucks when someone ruins the plot twist for you. *cough*The Sixth Sense*cough* :(Anyway, where was I? Despite some changes in the story, any film fan will see that this is an excellent piece of work, a perfect film to just sit back and enjoy. The script is brilliantly written and the delivery from the cast could not have been better. Overall, a great film if you want to laugh, cry, gasp in horror and just become ensnared in a simple and extremely powerful story. Is Jack's character crazy or not? In my opinion, definitely not. Well, no crazier than ""the average a**hole walking around on the street"". He just got sent to the mental hospital, as he put it himself, because he ""fights and f**ks too much"". Still it's interesting to see how far a man like McMurphy will go to get away from work, and how the other inmates - the true ""psychos"" - react to his extrovert and completely over-the-top persona. The inmates' transformation from quietly respectful and pathetically obedient patients to real people is brilliant. Louise Fletcher remains the same vile, quietly life-destroying nurse throughout, and in the end we cheer for McMurphy when he finally takes the law into his own hands. Fletcher is frighteningly great in her role and handing her the Best Leading Actress Oscar was one of the few smart things that the Academy ever did. A total class act and one of cinema's most memorable character studies. It's a shame her career didn't go the same way as Nicholson's - perhaps she was so overshadowed by the latter's manic performance, no one truly saw how amazing her work here really was.Simply one of the greatest movies ever made. Very few movies can touch this one. -10/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
219,dataconflossmoor,Get Mad If You Want To! This Is Very Realistic!,10,14 August 2007,"This is undeniably one of the best films ever made in the history of movie making.. In 1975, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" swept all four major academy awards... Best Actor (Jack Nicholson) Best Actress (Louise Fletcher) Best Direstor (Milos Foreman) and, of course, Best Picture!! Only on very rare occasion does this occur... Only a handful of films may lay claim to such an honor!! ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is a stunning portrayal of mental illness, and how even the most affluent nation on earth (The U.S.A.) is totally unequipped to deal with it properly!! Jack Nicholson's performance in this movie is one of the greatest performances ever by an actor... The array of all the psychologically debilitating diseases was itemized to a flawless state of depressing realism.. The emotional explanations for the dysfunctional dispositions with everyone in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" were so astutely broken down that it evoked a concise indication that not just any producers, directors, actors or actresses could partake in this film!! Such a depiction upholds the proverbial contention that if you are not mentally disturbed when you go into the ""Booby Hatch"" you will be when you get out of it!! In the case of Jack Nicholson's character, he seemed relatively non-culpable for any intense psychiatric affliction, it was a matter of slight discrepancies!! It is as if he was severely punished for not finishing his cereal at breakfast time!! The talent in this movie is incredible.. I liked the television show ""Taxi"" and it stands to reason why... So many of the actors who starred in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" were in the T.V. Show ""Taxi"" too!! The gripping conversation which dealt with a man who was impotent was perhaps the single most poignant part of this film!! The line I remember in particular was ""Do me a favor and don't be on my side, okay""... In the ""normal"" world, the average person is burdened in his ability to communicate with someone else due to a conflict of interests!! In the case of a poorly funded mental health facility, this apocalyptic predicament manifests itself horrendously, and thus has an intolerable proliferation!! Authorities in the mental hospital are restricted by a serious lack of funding, so they are quick to generalize!! The overall situation which garners societal sympathy at a mental health facility is categorized as ""sad"" and platitudes such as ""we will do all we can"" are everybody's precarious form of consolation!!! Mental illness gets a generic label, and, from there, becomes something which is basically swept under the rug!! Here is where the film ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" expounds on their abysmal dissertation concerning mental illness!!""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" was based on a true story!! Mr McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) was a lone rebel from start to finish with this film!! Whatever the orderlies or the nurses would say, he would disagree with!! It was always an issue that could not be looked at rationally by one patient or the other that compounded the dilemma of mental anguish... Such a plight became the culprit to a lack of thorough communication, and thus invoked an overreaction from the administration of the hospital!! You are branded mentally ill and that is all anyone has to know!! The total lack of egalitarian commiseration with administration was why McMurphy was so belligerent!! The status quo was to subject patients to grave consequences for their actions... Are the nurses and administrators wrong for doing this? Usually not!! It was the gray matter in this film that made it so intellectually riveting!! Mental health patients are often times aware of the fact that they are vilified in the same manner you would a bunch of seven year old kids for not doing their school work!! Their self respect gets relegated to a bureaucratic mandate, and all of this is subconsciously and consciously demoralizing!! If someone were to have a conversation with Charles Manson, they would realize so many depraved patterns of illogical behavior to him, however, if Charles Manson were to say that two plus two equals four, the correct answer does not get changed to five!! What is the point of this example? Mental health patients are not inaccurate in every assessment that they make, just because they are labeled mentally challenged!! What was Mr McMurphy's contention with so many issues is that he would assume a premise of mutual self respect when engaging in an argument with an orderly... This is not a case of defiance, rather an instance of a one on one debate... How quickly the administration would then resort to the cop out of ""Well!!"" ""What do you expect!!"" ""This guy is mentally ill""I have never seen a film like this one!! ""Woman Under The Influence"" which was made around the same time was incredibly spellbinding as well... ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" however, is something which should be put in a category all by itself!! Director, Milos Foreman articulates cerebral despondence to a state of dissonant plausibility with this film!! This becomes an avenue for political debate... Foreman's movie breaks ground on mental illness being one big cacophony of our nation's failure to communicate!! Louise Fletcher is tremendous as Nurse Ratched, her dedication to the tenets of disciplinary policy became vicariously ruthless, her devotion to this standard was extremely deep rooted!! Nurse Ratched's insolence was an aspect of infuriation that was in of itself amazingly thought provoking!! As I have previously mentioned, Jack Nicholson was excellent as McMurphy, the mental health patient who reoriented the ideology of what it means to deal with mental illness... Tremendous film, maybe the best American film ever made... Do you think that sounds strong? Watch the movie first and then tell me I am exaggerating!! REMARKABLE!! UTTERLY REMARKABLE!!",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

It'a shocking, it's funny and IT's POWERFUL like everybody says it is.When I saw this film, at times I was gripping my chair as if something amazing was going to happen and then at other memorable moments I just laughed out loud.The story is inspired by the novel which was written up in the 60's (I think).Besides a true, strong plot, the film has an excellent cast. Jack Nicolson (Batman, The Shining, The Departed), Bard Dourif (Child's Play), Danny Devito (Matilda, Twins), Michael Berryman (Hills Have Eyes) and many more excellent, memorable actors.i have watched this film three times this year and I have to say it never gets boring and it never gets old.A True Masterpiecie of a Classic in my eyes. 10/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
221,MovieFan983,One Flew Over One of the Best Movies Ever Made!!! (And that person was me),10,19 March 1999,"First thing's first, while I watched this movie, I found myself stunned. This movie so entertained the viewer, as it did fascinate, and inform. A chilling, disturbing, and revealing look into the mental institutions as seen through the eyes of a con. Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Lloyd, round out the excellent, and very well casted cast.Jack Nicholson brilliantly plays Randall Patrick McMurphy, an ex-con, who fakes being mentally insane, to enter the institution. As he goes to the hospital, he doesn't realize, that the people, and the atmosphere there is so out there. The patients are really psycho, and creepy. Randall, must try and survive these days, before he has to go to Jail. He has to entertain himself while at the same time, find good in this place of craziness.Lousie Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched, a soft; but strong willed nurse, who will not take anything from anyone, or put up with misbehavior. She watches Randall, and notices something different about him, he's not as psycho as the others, but he is a little out there. Her job is tough indeed, having to put up with all these men, who don't listen, some go crazy and throw fits, and others just sit there and don't do anything.Randall meets many new friends in this place, Brad Dourif who plays Billy Bibbit, is a mentally unstable, but voluntarily institutionalized person. Danny DeVito plays Martini, a slow but charming and sweet man, who means know harm in what he does or say. Christopher Lloyd plays Taber, a man, who also voluntarily institutionalized himself. He also meets Chief, a big 'dumb, and deaf' Indian, who happens to like to play basketball. Randall must try and survive these days with his new friends, and the hospital, as well as an everlasting war as to which they can watch the world series on TV. Put up with Nurse Ratched, and the other patients, doctors, vistors, and nurses. Ultimately leading up to a dramatic finale, that makes you want to stand up and cheer.I think what was best about this film was the realism. I had no problem believing that this was happening. Almost like a documentary, it was striking and powerful, making the viewer not want to stop watching till the end. Some of the sequences are memorable as the basketball game, and the fishing trip. Jack Nicholson, who as always plays his character absolutely excellent, and makes the viewer want to hand him an Oscar himself.The supporting cast, Louise Fletcher, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif also give terrific performances. Danny, Christopher, and Brad's careers all were made with this superb movie. It's all sentimental, funny, dramatic, intense, chilling, disturbing, diverting, and tragic. The finale leaves the viewer stunned and sitting there thinking about what he just saw. See this film, and believe it. I think you will find, its one of the BEST ever.The second film to win all five major Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor (Nicholson), Best Actress (Fletcher), Director, and Screenplay. And it deserved all of them.Rated R for language, violence, sexual content, and brief nudity.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
222,jmillerdp,"Very Good Film, But I Don't Consider It Great",7,27 September 2015,"This is a very good film, set in the grievously antiquated times of the early 1960's, when psychology and psychiatry were woefully and almost brutally out of their depth.Doping up patients constituted pretty much the extent of psychiatric capability. I actually worked in a state psychiatric hospital in the mid-1980's. The patients there were even more in that state than what is shown in this movie.That context is helpful in understanding what goes on in ""Cuckoo's Nest."" I personally don't remember if it is specifically mentioned that the film is set in 1963.The performances are excellent, added to the direction and script. The battle of wills pitting Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher is legendary. The assortment of other characters paint a vivid picture of the different kinds of patients to be found in a state psychiatric hospital of that time.The ending has very much divided audiences over the past four decades. And, it's understandable why. I can see why what happens, happens. It does present a challenging and even brutal commentary on the state of psychology/psychiatry at that time.Because of that, I had a visceral, negative reaction when I have seen it in the past. This time, I can more see why what happened, happened with the ending. Still, I think another 1975 film, ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" is easily superior to ""Cuckoo's Nest."" The perfection of that docudrama has been nearly unmatched since then.So, a very good movie, but I think Academy voters went for this for its message advocating better help for mental patients, than for its actual filmmaking.******* (7 Out of 10 Stars)",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

226,cdjh-81125,Non-Stop Entertainment Despite Lacking in Certain Areas,8,12 January 2017,"Milos Formans, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Next is a film that relys on its characters in the best possible way, it doesn't take them too seriously but Strikes the perfect balance in them between light hearted and at some times dark, I do not consider this film to be a masterpiece but I still think it is one of the most unique I've ever seen. I really mean that, there was not one second of this movie where I was not entertained like I said mainly due to the characters and there interactions, they use the patients mental difficulties to its advantage to make for a lot of hilarious dark comedy. I could not have imagined a better choice to play the lead in this film than Jack Nicholson, there is not for scene where he is unconvincing as this character, he knows just when to go a little over the top but never does it to ridiculous levels. Louise Fletcher was so fantastic in this film she was so utterly despicable in this film, the way she played with the patients and manipulated them for almost her own entertainment is so frustrating to watch, I do have a few issues with the character but Fletchers performance was all but flawless. But in my opinion this films most underrated and best performance is from Bard Dourif he was absolutely amazing in this film, his stutter and lack of confidence made him such a sympathetic character, he has so many great scenes with Nicholson and ended up being this films most tragic character. I also love that the other mental patients aren't just there for comedic relief their very well developed characters who all have reasons for their predicaments. I also loved the battle between MacMurphy and Nurse Ratched was not only hilarious but above all just satisfying to see the Nurse gradually lose control of the people's she's used as pawns for so long. But I do have a few issues with this film and my biggest is that Nurse Ratched while great as a hate able antagonist, she doesn't really get much development, she's really just there to be an evil presence to be tortured by Nicholson. Another thing that I really didn't like about this film was that it was ultimately style over substance I'm not saying that it didn't work for this film I just think it would have made the film just a bit more satisfying to watch if there was some kind of message behind it. I think that this is a fantastic film it's constant entertainment, Nicholson, Fletcher and Dourif where all amazing in this film, it never takes itself to seriously and all the characters where used in perfect ways. 83%/A-",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

228,ScottAmundsen,The Good Stuff Is So Good You Can Overlook The Flaws,8,10 March 2013,"CUCKOO'S NEST is one of only three pictures in Hollywood history to win The Big Four at Oscar Time: Picture, Actor, Actress, and Director (the other two are 1934's IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT and 1991's THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS). And despite some serious flaws I have to admit it deserved every single one of those awards, because the things this movie does well it does so amazingly well that the story carries you along and you don't even think about the flaws until much later.I won't bother to lay out any plot details; even people who haven't seen it know the basic premise: the film is basically a power struggle between R P McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a con artist who fakes crazy to get better accommodations (the State Mental Hospital instead of the County Jail), and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a cold, manipulative, and power-hungry woman who treats the men in her care more like pieces on a chessboard than actual human beings. In brief, McMurphy and Ratched square off into one of the most memorable clashes of conflicting wills ever put on film. Those are the basics, and I'll stop there: if you don't know the rest, see the movie; it's worth it.I also highly recommend reading the novel for comparison, because the book's author, Ken Kesey, is said to have hated the film because in his view it shifted the focus of the story from Chief Bromden (Will Sampson), who narrates the book as a sort of internal monologue and through whose eyes the action of the book plays out, to McMurphy.I have a hard time understanding Kesey's negative reaction, because McMurphy is still the central character in the book despite the narrative voice of Bromden, and to have kept that narrative voice in the film would have been impossible. For one thing, Bromden spends half the story pretending to be a deaf-mute, fooling everyone including Ratched. Forman would have had to let the audience into the secret from the beginning; instead we discover it along with the entire cast. The only other things missing are Bromden's hallucinations, which would have been impossible to film even as recently as 1975; it could be done with CGI in today's technology, but I don't know as it would necessarily be an improvement. The only other difference I noted was that the fishing trip in the movie was the penultimate act of rebellion; in the novel the men have full permission from the doctor, who even goes with them. A bit hard to make the case for rebellion, though Nurse is, of course, far from happy about it.Now for the flaws. To my mind, both the novel and the film have one HUGE flaw: the portrayal of women. Ken Kesey appears to have been heterosexual by all accounts, but watching the film (and especially reading the novel), it is easy to get the impression that he really hated women on some level. All the women in both book and movie fall into a variant on Freud's ""madonna/whore"" complex. The ""madonnas"" in this case are all emasculating ball-busters; be they nurses or wives, these ladies all ""wear the pants"" in whatever situation they are in. The whores are, well, whores: two prostitutes who are really the only pleasant female characters in this thing.The other major flaw is that there is very little actual mental illness in this film. Bromden's hallucinations didn't make it to the screen, and the others, while somewhat neurotic, are far from sick enough to be hospitalized. One of them, Sefelt (William Duell), is an epileptic, hardly a reason to be inpatient. Their problems all seem to relate to the women in their lives, and Ratched has every one of them completely cowed. McMurphy's effect on them suggests that the culture of Momism has neutered these men and that the best therapy for them is simply to ""act like guys."" This misogyny is less pointed in the film than it is in the novel, but it's there nonetheless.Still, these things are easy to miss in light of the film's staggering accomplishments. Jack Nicholson has never been one of my favorite actors, but the Oscars are full of occasions where the role and the actor were so perfectly matched that the actor owned it. Nicholson owned McMurphy; in fact to some extent he has been working with variations of the McMurphy persona ever since.Louise Fletcher, an actress who up to that time had done mostly television, had to audition several times over the course of six months before finally getting the part of Nurse Ratched; director Milos Forman kept telling her she was not quite grasping the part yet kept calling her back to read, and she must have finally found the right notes, or Forman simply could not find anyone he thought was better. In the end it matters not at all: Fletcher's performance as the precise and icy Ratched is a memorable bit of acting, fully deserving of her Oscar, especially when you realize that the character as written is pretty one-note, which placed huge demands on her to make the woman, if not exactly sympathetic, at least interesting. And she goes beyond interesting: Ratched is fascinating in the way they say snakes can make their prey freeze and be unable to move just by nailing them with their eyes.This film has an undeniable power, and even now it is easy to see why it is in the American Film Institute's Top 100 (#33, if that interests anyone).

230,Kubris,"I'm not stuck in here with you, you're stuck in here with me!",9,15 December 2012,"Have you ever found a piece of old schoolwork and realized how dumb you were? That now, with all of your more developed skills, you could've done that same assignment to a higher degree of quality or ease? That's how I felt watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for the second time. 2 years ago I enjoyed the plot, characters, and ending, but now, 2 years and over 150 films later, I can appreciate One Flew Over for what it is: a masterpiece of fiction, and a deceptively challenging piece of art.I'll jump past the plot synopsis and get to the heart of the film: R.P. MacMurphy. The slacker, rebel, that kid in class who just wouldn't listen. How can you deal with a character like MacMurphy? Is something wrong with him? This is a major thematic point in Cuckoo's Nest, and the answers aren't simple. What gives someone the right to make choices for another? What is the point that someone can't think for themselves? Is there a point? Questions beget questions, especially around the idea of ""authority"".That authority is personified by Nurse Ratched. She looks like an authority figure: icy glare, skull- like face. Instantly you dislike the nurse. You're pointed in that direction by the patients. But personally, when looking at her character objectively, I didn't find her bad for most of the film. Let me elaborate: a few weekends ago I met an children's organ transplant doctor. It is the most noble of work, but visually I could tell it took a toll on him. He wasn't rude, or volatile, or detached, but what he described himself as ""serious"". Working in healthcare, seeing things go wrong, that wears you down. I believe Ratched, working (for a long time), hearing mental patients yell about trivial things such as cigarettes, day after day, takes its toll. You wouldn't be a cheerful soul after years of that. Of course at the end she does flex her cruelty and we really grow to resent her, but for most of the film I thought she was just doing her job.This is a great film to analyze because it's so opinionated. Two similar people can see it, and based off of their own experiences will draw very different conclusions about the message and characters. Many others hate Nurse Ratched. I'm sure there are those out there who don't like MacMurphy. Some will say control is necessary, others that freedom is the most important thing out there. Cuckoo doesn't really force you into believing one certain way.The hospital itself if juxtaposing: the setting is a plain, boring hospital with drab white everything, but the characters are quirky and colourful. I loved them all, and didn't find anyone really annoying: Chezwick's extremity, Tobar's big reactions, the Chief, General, Billy, and a near- silent Stanley Kubrick-alike. This band of misfits are a joy to watch, and have some laugh-out-loud moments like Martini eating the dice and the basketball game.Despite the hospital setting, Cuckoo is a generally smile-inducing film with a fantastic script that develops its characters well for the conclusion. And oh, the end. It is really a twist, but the second you realize what's happened, how the chips have fallen, you give an audible gasp. This is one of the great film endings, bitter and sweet, but very satisfying. It may even bring a tear to your eye. 9.4/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
231,schroederagustavo,A great film,10,25 June 2020,"In my mind, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, a film that's constantly found in lists of the greatest movies ever, is about many things. More than anything, to me the movie is about friendship, camaraderie and the idea that the best way to solve mental issues, regardless of their severity, is simply through being human beings. Roger Ebert said it best in his review of the film: ""They will be cured not by Nurse Ratched's pills, Muzak and discussion groups, but by McMurphy liberating them to be guys--to watch the World Series on TV, go fishing, play pick-up basketball, get drunk, get laid."" I don't think the movie really tries to be about mental illness, it just happens that this is the story that they decided to focus on, but the core of the film lies in guys being guys.There is a shot of Mcmurphy, played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson almost at the end point of the movie, where it's a lingering close up of his face and his expression slowly changes from laughter and defiance to seriousness and thought, to finally a subtle smile. The question of course is what he is thinking in this moment. It reminded me of an earlier moment in the film, where Chief talks about his father and the idea of course,not just for Chief, but for many of the characters in the movie, is that what they've done in real life or what they have to face in the real world, is so bad that they would rather stay in this hospital. Mcmurphy then comes in and this idea is questioned and we see actual character development, not just from him but from all of the characters. In the end, Mcmurphy decides to stay, whatever the consequences may be and it's interesting to think about whether or not this signifies victory or defeat for him.All of the characters are very interesting, memorable and unique, the performances are excellent by everyone. Standouts are, of course, Nicholson and Louise Fletcher, who plays Nurse Ratched, one of the most hated characters in movie history. The funny thing about that is, as I was watching this movie I realized that a) she's definitely a c**nt, no doubt about that, but she was really just doing her job. Could she have been nicer and more reasonable? Absolutely. But I don't think she's necessarily evil, even though she is most definitely the villain of the film. Her methods don't work, the therapy doesn't seem to be doing much or the pills, but at the same time, it feels like she really thinks her methods are the only way to solve these people's problems, but it's one of those things of ""the road to hell is paved with good intentions"", I guess.But anyway, it is an excellent, wonderful, heart-warming (although kind of depressing in the end, too) film and everyone should watch it at least once.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

One flew over the cuckoos nest captures the madness of a lunatic asylum brilliantly, without going overboard or overly melodramatic.jack nicholson breathes the role and louis fletcher also does brilliantly. the dialogs are witty and amusing, capturing the effect of the movie beautifully. there is not one scene in the movie thats out of place or boring. the pace of the movie is steady and the story is built up slowly but steadily. in the hands of lesser directors and actors, this movie could have been considered too slow. but the terrific actors and the gripping direction keep the flow going through out and makes it very entertaining.the end, in my opinion, is slightly disappointing - but rather fitting. its just personal opinion. most people love the ending. do not miss this terrific drama, thats more than just a story about a man in a mental asylum. this is a movie about how we choose to live.an insane 9!!",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

As a matter of fact I don't really know how to explain the greatness of this film. i guess the main question is; how do you define insanity? And do we have the right to pretend we're any better? Or for that sake how can we claim to be able to cure mental disease when we have no clue how the brain works. The movie starts with a minor criminal McMurphy (Jack Nicholsen) who pretends to be insane to avoid prison. But as he observes the patients, who by the way becomes his friends, he starts feeling sorry for them, and questioning the doctors means for ""healing"" them. Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher), the woman who is supposed to help them, seem to stir up more problems than she fixes them. So he decides to rebel against the doctors and learn the patient how it is to live again and have some fun. Now to prevent myself from spoiling any of this movie I'll stop here.Now of course Jack Nicholsen is not the only who should get credit for this movie, although he's performance is great. Christopher Lloyd as Taber and this film also introduces Brad Dourif in his first film role as Billy Bibbit. And the one character that holds this film together is Will Sampson as Chief the mute and deaf native American who is more than everyone suspects. i must say he was my favourite in this film.So what is my verdict from this film, 10/10 of course. This film is brilliant, I can't recommend this film enough, go out and rent it, buy it or whatever, this movie is a must see for everyone.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

237,Blade_Le_Flambeur,A beautiful film about life,9,1 June 2003,"Jack N. has also been known for playing loud roles, and this is his biggest one. He plays Mac, a man who's thrown into a Mental institution and he seems to be the only person with common sense. Louise F. plays the Warden and she adds an extremely powerful performance as the embodiement of evil yet at the same time not going too cliche. Both cast members received Oscars for their performances and they were definitely well- deserved. Jack adds in such a variety of emotions, it's hard not to feel his pain. Milos Forman and his always focused direction really bring everything together. His sharp attention to details also help build in the ending of the film. He also brings all the cast members together to do their job. The script is excellent too, emersing itself in the harsh realities of life and how things don't always go the happy way. One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest won five Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Adapted screenplay. Each of them was sufficently earned, but Barry Lyndon should've won one or two of those Oscars. Even though most of the film is excellent, there are still some flaws. The pace here and there gets a bit too slow and things end up just dragging on. Also, eventually the character of the Warden gets old and tired after a while, and the viewer wants to experience something new.

This signifies much more than only the events that are shown. It shows the dark side of the mental healing systems that are used in the established institutions that are hardly meant for curing them.

In this movie, a so called mentally ill tries to alter the situation but finds it difficult. Though he at the ends succeeds in breaking the psychological barrier that binds all the patients our of fear. The escape at the end signifies more than an event, it is the end of the fear that was powered by the struggle of McMurthy.

239,jbartelone,I Wish I Could Give This Film 20 Stars!,10,7 February 2007,"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is the essential landmark triumph of all cinema. It is the standard by which other movies are judged. Nothing will ever surpass this film for its acting, directing, plot development, and the best landmark scenes in any film, period! My own family when acting dysfunctional often quotes scenes and phrases from this film!!!! Who doesn't know this story? Randle P. MacMurphy fakes mental illness to get out of a work farm jail sentence for statutory rape. He is sent to an asylum for a psychiatric evaluation. Being the fun rebel that he is, he sets out to challenge the hospital's no-nonsense rules and regulations overseen by the cold-hearted, controlling head nurse Mildred Ratched. (Or ""Nurse Rat-Sh*t"" as I like to call her!) Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher deliver some of the greatest lines and scenes in movie history. MacMurphy inspires the other patients to instill confidence in themselves, and to rebel against Nurse Ratsh*t so that they can try to get some of their freedoms and dignity back. But she continues to demand that her authority and rules are never to be questioned, constantly belittling her patients with negativity by making them feel uncomfortable in HER ""therapy"" sessions.MacMurphy leads a revolt against the system in several brilliant scenes. The gem is trying to persuade Nurse Ratsh*t to allow the schedule to be changed so that the patients can watch the World Series! (Hysterical comedy here, as well as throughout the movie.) But some scenes are painful to watch, such as a patient's suicide and Nurse Ratsh*t's vindictive cold remarks that the patients should just ignore it as if nothing happened and ""go on with the day."" This callus comment prompts MacMurphy to attack Nurse Ratsh*t in a scene that will leave you cheering! But as punishment, MacMurphy gets lobotomized in a heartbreaking conclusion that you will remember for the rest of your life.This movie was filmed at a real psychiatric hospital in Oregon. Most of the extras were authentic mental patients. The actor who played the Admissions Doctor, Dr. John Spivey was a real doctor, and head director at the hospital where the movie was filmed. Several of the admissions interview lines with Nicholson were improvised.This is the movie experience of a lifetime! Probably several lifetimes!",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
240,IrisNo11,A Timeless Classic!,10,14 August 1999,"This movie isn't one of my favorite movies of all time, but it is one of the GREATEST movies I ever seen in my life.  It's powerful, funny, dramatic, and impressing.  Jack Nicholson gives us a brilliant performance as the strange and hyper McMurphy, who just loves to have the attention focused on him and of course, in many ways, puts a smile on every one of the patients' faces. 
Jack Nicholson is the ONLY actor who can really fit the bill as McMurphy and who could forget Louise Fletcher's moody and cold hearted character, Nurse Ratched, and the thought-to-be dumb and deaf patient, Big Chief.  Every character in the movie is natural and has all different types of personalities, which makes them all very special and better yet, unforgettable.I read the book by Ken Kesey, and in my opinion, the movies better!  A must see for anyone who loves movies!!! :o)",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
241,Don-102,Poetic - Powerful - Simple: The Greatness of Cuckoo's Nest.,10,22 January 2000,"The opening shot of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a bleak  glance at an Oregon morning.  Stirring, haunting music plays gracefully on the soundtrack and a car approaches.  Inside the car is one of film history's most remarkable characters.   ""Randle McMurphy"" is about to bring hope, humor, and a glimmer of reality to some disturbed people in a mental hospital. Jack Nicholson as ""McMurphy"", is something of a paradox.  Is this guy crazy or is he really the lazy, conniving criminal most believe him to be?  That is the magical mystery and start to a journey into mental illness and the effect this man will have on some truly messed up men.Milos Forman directs this all-time classic, which swept the Oscars deservedly, and holds up so well 25 years later.  It is a simplistic film about small people living in their own small worlds.  Manic moments are mixed with poignant acting all leading to an astounding climax.  Not before or since CUCKOO'S NEST has a collection of different characters had such an impact on me.  You could write a book report about each of the patients in the ward.  The two most important people here are, of course, Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher.Nicholson has his greatest moments in this picture.  One brilliant scene has him doing an imaginary play-by-play commentary of the 1963 World Series to the group, who are not allowed to watch the game on TV.  It is a poetic sequence and Nicholson goes crazy with his delivery, describing baseball with colorful anecdotes and profanity.  ""McMurphy"" immediately makes an impression on the crazies and shows them how they don't have to stick to the ""normal routine"".  He knows their names right away, he sprays them with water, he makes impossible bets with them, he introduces them to fishing, and he even gets a suffering young kid (played well by Brad Dourif) a ""date"".  Louise Fletcher plays one of the more reprehensible human beings in film as ""Nurse Mildred Ratched"".  She is a hardened woman, one who makes the daily meetings with the group a contest to see who will win.  Her stubbornness and lack of compassion for the poor guys is rather one dimensional.  That's perfect because that is exactly who she is.  Her strong will to keep things monotonous leads to a final showdown with the free spirited ""McMurphy"" in what is easily one of the most shocking and disturbing climaxes in recent memory.ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST does not try to make a statement about mental illness or how the unstable should be treated.  Rather, it is a very simple portrait of the long days and hilarious scenarios that can come about when a mixed bag of suffering people are thrown together.  Mental illness is nothing to laugh about, but the fact that Nicholson is not really crazy (at least in my opinion) allows us to be amused.  He seems to love his compadres in the hospital.  He is mislead, however, into thinking he can do as he pleases.There is no denying the power of CUCKOO'S NEST.  The two main powerhouse performances are golden, the cinematography is morbid and gritty like it should be, the ""Chief"" is great as Nicholson's right hand, ah, protagonist, and you care a lot about what will happen as the film moves on.  The famous, final shot ironically happens to be an exit of a major character into that bleak, Oregon morning. NOTE: I have never read the book and I find it hard to believe author Ken Kesey has never watched the filmed version.  Comparing a book to a movie is impossible.  They are 2 distinctly different artistic methods of story-telling.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
242,wisemantonofski,Nicholson's Crowning Role,10,4 February 2019,"A swinging pendulum of a film that sways between uplifting comic satire and devastating social commentary, Milos Forman's dramatic adaptation of Ken Kesey's 1962 novel turns the preconceptions surrounding mental health on their heads as it showcases deep and relatable characters in the patients juxtaposed against the cold harsh stare of Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a story told with a level of realism as to almost feel like a disturbing documentary, its a story of the misuse of power over those without the ability to defend themselves and the tragic consequences that can occur, while also driving home the fact that not every story has a happy ending.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

246,IamROCKAS,Loony bin that's full of memorable characters,9,30 August 2020,"I must be crazy to be in a loony bin like this.This might be a weird comparison, considering that the majority of the plot takes place in a mental hospital, but this movie reminded me about my experiences in middle and high school. No, I didn't grow up in a mental hospital and without getting too much into the spoilers, I'll just say that gambling with cigarettes as a value, drinking on school grounds, leaving school grounds to do something stupid wasn't rare in the school that I went to. We also had that one highly disruptive kid that was leading the pack into all sorts of misadventures just because he was bored and wanted to rebel. Once he convinced everyone to skip our chemistry class because the teacher was late and even came up with an escape plan where we all split up into groups and left the school grounds. It doesn't sound fun on paper but the whole strategy and execution felt like a war movie where we had to sneak from the enemy base by relying on the communication on everyone.Getting back on the movie - I liked it. Not as much as I wanted to but I liked it. I got to know all the silly characters and even got a bit attached to them towards the end of the movie. The only movie that comes close to comparison on that level is Dazed and Confused, where you feel like you've reunited with your old friends every time you watch that movie. I'd say the actor here did a spectacular job, including Danny Devito, who I haven't seen in cinema since his appearance in ""Friends"" during one of the shows later seasons. Jack Nicholson, who's performance terrified the following generations with ""The Shining"" was spectacular as the chaotic-good Randle Patrick McMurphy and Louise Fletcher, who's work I definitely saw somewhere else but I just can't pint point where I know her from stood out the most for obvious reasons.Mental illnesses are no joke unless you're watching this movie. Most guys just seemed happy being there and their wild and unpredictable personalities made the watching experience fun. I especially can relate to Billy as I used to stutter back in my school days and I still suffer from mild dyslalia (and let's be honest, my situation with the ladies is not better than his). What I liked most here is that this movie took a simplistic approach to mental illness and it had no interest in being about insanity, it's more about being a free spirit in a closed system. In other words - even though it took place in a mental hospital, its goal was not to showcase how insane people can be in these kinds of institutions. Of course, it had the chance to show how these disorders should be taken seriously and not made fun of but this movie is not about that.In conclusion, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a spectacular experience that had an amazing cast that portrayed events that can be compared to the ones I experiences in my past and showcased messages of independence and bohemian approaches to life.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

251,commandercool88,"Memorable, horrifying, powerful.",10,7 July 2008,"It's difficult to imagine many films aging as well as 1975's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. Though practices have changed and opinions differ drastically than they did when the original 1962 novel was released, this moving and powerful picture remains every bit as good as I'm sure it was more than thirty years ago. It touches brilliance and touches it often, and it's difficult to describe it as anything other than a masterpiece.A beautiful, tragic, maddening masterpiece. A culturally profound and historically significant picture that asks what it truly means to be sane, or insane for that matter. And though it at times can be very funny and genuinely life-affirming, 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is often a difficult film to watch as its many characterizations are all strikingly human. Real people dealing with real problems, all built around a sharp and intelligent observation of how we deal with mental illness.Jack Nicholson has delivered some mighty fine performances during his rich career, and he's sure to deliver some more. But it's his turn here as McMurphy that will surely go down as one of his best and most accomplished pieces of work. It is, like the film, flawless. As he not-so-eloquently (but the ends justify the means, right?) battles both himself and his fellow patients to fight oppression and free the individual from within, an unforgettable clash with Nurse Ratched crackles with tension, both real and psychological. Louise Fletcher turns in an absolutely mesmerizing performance here, bringing to life a truly disturbing character that's both upsetting and very thought-provoking.'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' isn't a film made for the criminally insane, but for you and me. It's an electric story that remains a relevant and relatable piece of artwork. A comedy one minute and a heartbreaking tearjerker the next, few films have achieved a level of excellence as director Milos Forman has here.

256,thewillt08,Amazing and Unforgettable,8,28 November 2012,"Would you go to a mental hospital to avoid a prison sentence? One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a story of patients in a mental hospital and how their life was changed by R.P. McMurphy. McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson, arrived in the ward to avoid going to prison or working on a work farm and he made an impact. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a memorable story that goes down in history as one of the best. Let's start with the characters. Nicholson plays R.P. McMurphy, a criminal who has history of violence and aggression. He was sent to the asylum after acting erratic on the work farms. He isn't really mentally insane, but he fakes it to avoid going to prison. He thinks he can serve his sentence in the asylum and life will be easy. In the asylum we have Billy Bibbit, a nervous stuttering man with depression and anxiety. Cheswick is a nervous man who also struggles with anxiety. The actor who portrays him did a great job in playing the part. Danny Devito, yes little Danny Devito before he really went nuts, plays Martini, a lovable character. Then there's the Chief. Chief is a 6'5"" mute who everyone thinks is dumb as a rock. He turns out to be one of the most important and influential characters. McMurphy originally goes into the ward to avoid prison but he eventually helps the patients in there. He thinks some of them could survive in the real world and he ends up giving the other patients confidence and a type of therapy. Billy eventually stops stuttering for a little bit. Harding has more self control and Cheswick learns to stick up for what he believes in. An example of McMurphy's ""therapy"" is the fishing trip. McMurphy climbs over the fence and steals a bus with the patients from his ward. He takes them to a fishing boat and takes them fishing. McMurphy had his own agenda but he also helps the patients. He gives them an experience a normal man would have and they have fun. One of the best aspects of this movie is the accuracy to the time period. Men with mental illnesses were put in asylums like the one we see in the film. They experienced the different types of therapy. They took drugs such as anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, and anti- depressants. Any means to help them relax and make them acceptable for society. They experienced group therapy, which we see often throughout, and something I've never seen before in hydrotherapy. Unfortunately, during this time period there were a lot of problems. If people were overly aggressive or considered dangerous they would undergo electroshock therapy. Basically, doctors tie you down and put conducting gel on your temples and a rubber mouth guard in your mouth so you don't bite your tongue. Then they literally send a shock through your temples into your brain. The idea was to reset the brain and make you more relaxed and in control. The audience witness's electroshock therapy in the film and it is a little disturbing to watch. You can see the suffering on their faces. Finally there is the lobotomy, where doctors drill into the skull or go through the nose to scrape out a piece of your brain. This turns a man into a vegetable who can barely survive on their own. It is illegal today but back then it was common. Character relationships are important for a successful movie and not many compare to the relationship McMurphy had with the vile Nurse Ratched. Nurse Ratched was the head nurse in the ward. She controlled the groups and she was in charge. Her character is difficult because I couldn't ever really tell what her intentions were. Sometimes she tried hard to help the patients and other times she acted like she wanted to make them worse. A prime example is the one therapy group when Cheswick wants his cigarettes and Nurse Ratched just ignores him. Cheswick grows a backbone and stands up for himself and Ratched tries to put him back in his place and treat him like a dog. That scene really changes the movie and the major events of the movie unfold from there. McMurphy and Ratched would clash all the time. McMurphy would get under her skin and she under his. It made the movie really entertaining and a little comedic at times. Now no movie is perfect and I did have a few problems with it. Mainly it was the ending. It was a fine ending but I feel like it was a little too drastic. I don't want to give it away but it was one of those moments where you smack your forehead and go, ""you idiot."" When you see the movie you will know what I mean. Also what happens to one of the patients is completely unnecessary. I understand he was upset but he didn't have to do what he did. It was a little ridiculous and I can't see it really happening. Overall, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a great movie with excellent characters, a well written script, an interesting, and entertaining storyline. It deserves all the credit it got and will go down as a career making movie for Jack Nicholson. He did a fantastic job and deserved the Oscar he won. This is not what I would call a ""background movie."" Meaning, it is not something you can watch casually. You need to sit down and watch it and pay full attention. That's my advice and without a shadow of a doubt, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and is something I can watch again and again and enjoy every time.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

one of my favorite reads. Some books just can't make a good transition from page to screen; McMurphy is so much larger than life,
so multi-faceted, that no actor could ever portray him the way Kesey did. Nice try by Nicholson, but he just wasn't the right...something (physical build? Attitude?I don't know). Only two novels have, imho,

Script, acting, and directing are flawless.  Nicholson plays Randall P. McMurphy, a free-spirited man sent to the mental institute for statutory rape and other previous convictions. 
  The only difference between Randall and the other patients is that he is very lucid of what is going on in that institute and he is especially conscious of the fact that the evil head-nurse, nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher in her Oscar-winning performance) is there only to make sure that the crazy become crazier.

262,tjgoalie13,"A Powerful Protest, and a Tragedy of the Failed System",9,21 October 2015,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a social protest film that attacked the social stereotypes and tragic failures of the mental health system. The film pulls no punches and is often hard to watch, but is so powerful in it's message that it remains a classic film of the 1970's. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a complex film, about complex people misidentified as simple. Much like other modern protest films One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest applies to one societal problem, but can transcend its subject matter and represent more modern problems, making it truly timeless.Many films have approached the community aspect of human life, some attacking it some defending it, this film seems to do both at the same time. The film contains a major paradox, both criticizing those who shun people from society for their differences, while showing that community is part of the human way of life, and that even society's rejects need community. Most of the shots throughout the film are medium or close ups, which most likely represents what a close group the patients are. It's both tragic, brilliant, and heartwarming to see how a group of neglected and forgotten people can band together, when society turns its back on them.The most impressive aspect of the film is the treatment of the characters, which is most likely a representation of the time it came out. Many of the characters in this film are connected by the fact that they have mental health issues, and they are rejects, but the characters are all distinctly different characters, and not just stereotypes. The treatment of the characters is impressive in it's own right, because today critics would probably say that the film is insensitive, it's humor is occasionally a little crude, but it's the exact opposite, the characters are treated as normal human beings, which is the most equal way to treat any character in any film.The movie contains a very angry message pointed at the methods of treatment for the mentally ill, and is an extremely powerful, albeit a little hard to watch, because of it. Simply put as the film progresses we see all of these characters, go through the horrific treatment they were subjected to, all the while following one main character, Randle. By the end of the film the main character is a vehicle for the message being sent, as the story takes Randall, a broken man, and breaks him permanently. By the end the audience should realize that they have watched a film, exemplifying the tragedy of the failing system.In conclusion One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a powerful, social protest film that uses great characters to send it's message. Beautifully acted, tragic, and infinitely complex, its message transcends its subject matter and represent a tragedy of the system's ineptitude. It's also one of the few movies that can tackle such a tough subject with care, respect, and finesse, it's just in general a great film.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
263,darkjosh,"Not Kesey, But Still Well-Crafted",9,27 November 2000,"Milos Forman's film may not be entirely true to Ken Kesey's novel, but it is still, in its own right, an inspiring, well-crafted, emotional and intelligent telling of the choice to conform or rebel.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest stars Jack Nicholson as Randal McMurphy, a prisoner who decides he'd have a better time serving out his sentence in a mental ward, but ultimately ends up enlivening the patients there and showing them the beauty of life.Jack Nicholson's performance as McMurphy is deservedly Oscar-winning, inspiring, and is surely one of the best of his career.  As the naive Billy Bibbit, Brad Douriff is impressive and touching in his film debut.  Louise Fletcher does well as Nurse Ratched, even though she doesn't really compare to the tough-as-nails Big Nurse as written of by Kesey.  She is more than up to the performance, however, and is effective as the ice-cold Ratched.A truly inspiration film with fantastic performances, terrific scenes, and a double-edged, satisfying ending.9 out of 10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
264,arturmachado-29588,(In)sane,10,4 September 2017,"Excellent drama with some comedy. All the actors are phenomenal in their interpretations, without any flaws! McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) claims insanity to not go to jail and is admitted to a psychiatric hospital. His vivacity and nonconformity spread to the ward's other patients, who are under the supervision of the oppressive and manipulative nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). The conflict of mentalities becomes inevitable, because the nurse does not admit even 'the middle ground' nor a small concession such as letting the patients see a baseball game. As the days pass, the conflict begins to escalate, and in the end, of course, reaches dramatic proportions.This film can be analyzed by several prisms: literally for what it is, a beautiful and dramatic story very plausible and that could very well happen in reality, demonstrating well that the abuse of power is never beneficial however well intentioned. Looking more deeply, it is also one of the best allegories on the subject 'individual vs system', demonstrating that however noble the individual is in his intentions, mind and soul, always ends up under the yoke of the tyranny of the system. And it is clear that the system (whatever it is) is always run by despots who are often unaware of it (that they are tyrants), an inevitability of any hierarchical structure.

267,thesouthfamily2-552-707097,"""I'm a goddamn marvel of modern science"".",10,27 January 2014,"Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is a film so good in so many of its parts. It shows Jack Nicholson's character, R.P. McMurphy, lost in thought. It comes at the balancing point between the pranks and laughter of the earlier parts of the film, and the final descent into tragedy. What is he thinking? Is he planning new defiance, or realizing that all is lost?The mystery of what McMurphy is thinking is the mystery of the movie. It all leads up to a late scene where he is found asleep on the floor next to an open window. By deciding not to escape, he has more or less chosen his own fate. Has his life force run out at last? After his uprising against the mental institution, after the inmates' rebellion that he led, after his life-affirming transformations of Billy and the Chief, after his comeback from an initial dose of shock therapy, has he come at last to the end of his hope?McMurphy has no insights into the nature of mental illness, which is his blessing. He's an extroverted, life-loving force of nature who sees his fellow patients as teammates, and defines the game as the systematic defiance of Nurse Ratched and the system she personifies. In many of the best scenes in the film, this defiance takes the shape of spontaneous and even innocent little rebellions: During exercise period, the patients mill around aimlessly on a basketball court until McMurphy hilariously tries to get a game going.McMurphy is the life force, the will to prevail, set down in the midst of a community of the defeated. And he's personified and made totally credible by Jack Nicholson, in another of the remarkable performances that have made him very credible in this film. Nicholson, manically trying to teach his inmates some interesting aspects of life, sometimes succeeds in translating the meaning of the movie and Ken Kesey's novel into a series of direct, physical demonstrations.The movie's simplistic approach to mental illness is not really a fault of the movie, because it has no interest in being about insanity. It is about a free spirit in a closed system. Nurse Ratched, who is so inflexible, so unseeing, so blandly sure she is right, represents conformism at its radical extreme, and McMurphy is an unstoppable force that wants to break loose from her version of civilization.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

The setting was exceptional and the characters were funny. This is a kind of comedy that is not laughing at the mentally disturbed people, but that shows the other side of their sickness. They want their freedom, they don't know what to choose, and all other details make them interesting characters. We pity them when the guards are mean to them and we finally hate the guards. In normal movies, it would have been the opposite;the patients would be dangerous and the guards would be the good guys. This would be like telling to the audience''those sick people are dangerous.

271,RolloTomasi,"""What do you think you are, crazy? Well, you're not!""",9,6 January 2003,"Whether intentional or not, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" was a sign ofthe times when it came out in 1975. It reflected the anti-authoritarian sensibility of Americans in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Director Milos Forman'staste for subversion is said to come from his war-torn childhood, his parentless upbringing, and finally, the rise of Communism in his native Czechoslovakia.
The film's imitators, many and poor, have tried to duplicate its formula,practically inventing a new genre--the mental hospital drama--probably because of the opportunities for over-acting. An actor's favorite role to play is a mentally disadvantaged person. But Jack Nicholson's character, McMurphy, everyoneagrees, is not sick at all. Some of ""Cuckoo""'s imitators didn't understand that the film isn't about crazy people, but about rules, suppression of the soul, and the desire for power. As McMurphy emerges as a leader among the patients, a battle of wills formsbetween he and Nurse Ratched. At first McMurphy is just having fun. Heoperates on the belief that few of these men are actually crazy. Of course, it works for a time. Eventually it has tragic consequences.
Forman would re-visit the anti-authoritarian themes of ""Cuckoo's Nest"" in""People vs. Larry Flynt"" and ""Ragtime.""  His apparent identification with mad geniuses was carried on with ""Amadeus"" and ""Man on the Moon.""",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

And finally one of the major aspects of this film, is its great set of cast, with the memorable McMurphy portrayed by Jack Nicholson, also the introduction of one of the most monstrous antagonists, the megalomaniac and sadistic nurse Ratched portrayed by Louise Fletcher.

275,tyson-hunsaker,A great classic concerned with human dignity and insanity.,9,4 October 2017,"""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" may be Milo Forman's best work to day and stands the test of time as an enduring classic about an eccentric McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) at odds with a wound up nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). If any film examines the social issues on people's minds back in 75' as well as ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", it's grandeur should replace this one because this film takes a thorough and complex dive into insanity and its definition. Based on the book by Ken Kesey, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is a fleshed out and realized story of a man who pleads insanity to get out of jail/work time and is therefore, admitted to an insane asylum. While there, he disrupts the inmates flow of order and routine and wreaks havoc on the employees with Nurse Ratched. The film tends to balance this tightrope of insanity by presenting characters we not only believe in, but somehow feel we know personally. Potentially due to incredible characterization through outstanding performances, plausible dialogue, and clear direction from Milo Forman. ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" features one of Jack Nicholson's best performances ever put to film; Understandably winning Jack Nicholson a ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" Oscar. His electric and wildly entertaining performances however, doesn't overshadow Louise Fletcher's stern and deeply intimidating performance as a menacing, strict, and unfeeling antagonist. While both our protagonist and antagonist are clear from the beginning, the story wisely blurs that line of hero and villain by asking the audience ""Who is crazy?"" near the end of the film. The film also makes a case to examine the individual consequences wrought on by mental institutions with all their imperfections. When we see images of cages, walls, and windows to represent barriers, we understand a humanistic need to break them and explore uncharted territory. Alternatively, most inmates in the asylum feel so institutionalized by said asylum which stunts further healing from whatever conditions debilitate them. So while ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is wonderfully characterized and unified in plot right up to the end, it feels like an important film with things to say and questions to ask about insanity and what makes a person crazy.While ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is indeed a masterpiece of filmmaking as many lead it to believe, it isn't without its flaws. As the film draws near its end, we learn who was really changed in this story and who's story this is to tell. This was indeed a powerful narrative tool in the end which makes its climax sensical, more context and characterization for this character would've improved the ending for a more satisfying conclusion. A lot more catharsis could've been rendered if we had a chance to connect with that character more and the movie could've driven some more clearer points home to help understand why watching the film would be important regardless of time period. Aside from the smaller negatives, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is an unforgettable and wonderful movie that deserves to be watched and studied as carefully as possible.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

281,varundelpiero,"An intelligent perspective of chaos, order, institutionalisation ,and freedom...",9,20 October 2008,"There's a good reason why this film ranks so high on IMDb's top 250 (as I am writing this, it is comfortably in the top 10): this movie appeals to a wide range of audiences without seeming pretentious or over-the-top (save perhaps for one scene which I will not discuss here for the sake of the potential viewer).Deservedly, one of the few films to sweep the 'Big 5' awards at the Oscars, namely Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Nicholson), Best Actress, and Best Screenplay (Adapted). The film itself is worthy of all the accolades won; it sends the viewer on an immensely gripping psychological ride, with one of the best and most widely discussed endings you are likely to see in a Motion Picture. This was in fact, the very film that catapulted the legendary Milos Forman to stardom (he would later follow this up with the highly successful AMADEUS). The direction is simply superb as is the writing, and it is evident that Forman knew exactly what he wanted from the offset.Jack Nicholson wins his first Oscar in one of the best roles ever portrayed on film. The viewer will constantly question his state of mind relative to the other patients, and to the persons who society deem as 'mentally fit'. It is worth noting that Nicholson was only Forman's third choice for the lead role, after Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando. Maybe the Fates conspired that Nicholson would eventually get the nod, as it is now difficult to imagine either of the aforementioned topping Nicholson's performance.Louise Fletcher is equally brilliant, and the interaction and conflict between these two key personalities is one of the main selling points of this feature. The viewer will question intensely the ultimate motives of Fletcher's character, and this has made for one of the more interesting character studies of all time. Not to be forgotten is Brad Dourif who, in his debut performance, deservedly garnered an Oscar nomination. Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd also have small roles which they perform admirably well, but all this was before they really became famous. In fact, all the actors portraying patients do convincingly well in their portrayals of a wide variety of common mental illnesses, and the casting in this film was simply genius.For the entire running time of ~125 minutes the viewer is captivated, leading up to, during, and well beyond the ending, which is not quite cathartic but will no doubt impinge upon cerebral impulses rather than visceral. Personally, just considering the first 100 minutes or so, I would have simply stated that the film was quite GOOD; it is the ultimate conclusion that propels this film from good to GREAT; perhaps one of the best of all time. This film,like many great ones, stays with the viewer long after the end credits begin to roll.Arguably, the movie may not have aged well since many of the practices in the medical discipline of mental health have improved drastically since the late 70s. However, I find this does very little to upset or throw off the open-minded viewer.I am not surprised by this film's inclusion in the Top 10 since, as stated earlier, it has a very wide appeal, not unlike THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Honestly, this film should not be missed, even if you have to watch it on one of the classic networks with commercials and censorship (Heaven forbid!).This film warrants 4 stars (out of 4). 9/10.

Just a few of many positive words to describe the amazing 1975 Milos Forman classic, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. a moving and sometimes comic portrayal about the goings on inside an Oregon Mental Institute, with Jack Nicholson leading the star-studded cast to greatness as Randall P McMurphy, the one who flew over the cuckoo nest, and set the whole strict system on fire. Louise Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched. A cold, stark authoritarian keen to preserve the routines and discipline amongst the patients. But... Then Randall turns up, in his rambunctious but apparently sane manner, and the sparks fly. Nurse Ratched tries her best to subdue him into the peaceful, sedated and rather boring existence of the institute, but evidently appears to fail as Randall has plans of his own. Randall is not going to be pushed around by this woman. And he makes a stand, urging the others to take the stand as well, and break the routine, that probably sent them mad in the first place. Nicholson is fantastic and he thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar, and Fletcher deserved her actress' equivalent Oscar too. They react and ignite each others actions so well that they couldn't claim anything less for their very realistic acting talents. Young Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd and even Scatman Crothers turn in good performance that are perceived as quite comical, but I'm not sure if they are meant to be really (I guess it is easy to laugh at the insane because of the general odd things they do, such as when DeVito eats the dice out of the Monopoly game.) Forman directs well, and the mood is exceptional. An aura of enigma surrounds the whole film, because watching it, no matter how many times often proves to be a quite joyful, yet confusing affair. I swear I cannot figure out these characters, they are too profoundly presented.

There are some wonderfully funny scenes and some really sad ones. The whole is a roller-coaster of emotions but with the one umbrella like feeling pervading the film which is one of no hope.

But, before you knew it, we were suddenly on a fantasy journey as McMurphy watches his phantom baseball games, gets the better of the horrid Nurse Ratched, commandeers that bus for that thrilling boat ride, teaches the Chief to play basketball with hysterically funny results (that scene of Will Sampson bounding down the court so absurdly gracefully created the first big belly laughs in the theater), and we were SO taken with McMurphy and his wonderful wisdom. Oh, but then that dramatically riveting ending, with Nurse Ratched's cruelty and then Billy Bibbit's harrowing suicide--we were now breathless with despair. The way Milos Forman so completely switched emotional gears was devastating. The bizarre made the fun all the more appreciated--the fun made the searing drama all the more painful. But then the final scene of sacrifice and resurrection with the Chief's heartbreaking embrace of the defeated McMurphy, and his escape to a magical freedom made our hearts break, and for more than a few, tears flowed freely. What an amazing artistic achievement. Certainly deserving of its awards, accolades, fame and its place in the pantheon of great cinematic achievements. I enjoy Ebert's criticisms, and usually find his reviews right on the money--but I sure disagree with his take on this film. In commenting on films like the great ""Field of Dreams"", he talks about how the magic and non-realism contributes to its artistry and cinematic magic. But with ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", he complains about the moments where drama and unreality interfere with the realism. That's missing the point of the film. The film is about human emotion and the great questions of life--of right and wrong--and the director and actors use a surrealistic world and atmosphere (dreams and day to day reality intertwined) to comment on feelings and emotions so complex, so unreal--so beyond our abilities to understand and comprehend. Magic is what this film is about.One last thing--I have long felt that this film has an additional element--that it can be viewed as a symbol of the Christ story in Christianity--where McMurphy represents the Christ figure. I certainly don't mean to be blasphemous about this. But--there is McMurphy and his disciples in the Institution. He teaches them--he creates magic for them. No--he doesn't turn water into wine, or one loaf into a hundred--but he has them watching TV when there is no picture on the tube! He takes them on a fishing excursion, and low and behold, they catch fish! He doesn't bring a dead man back to life--but he teaches Billy Bibbit to speak without stuttering. He could have escaped the institution, but he remains behind with his disciples. Note the extended (almost uncomfortably long) scene of McMurphy's face, as he fights with his demons in silence before he remains behind in the institution. There is no ""last supper"". But...well....there's a ""last bacchanal""! As Judas betrays Christ, there we have Billy Bibbitt wrenchingly betraying McMurphy. At the coda of the film, we actually feel uplift, seeing how McMurphy's spirit lives on with the Chief running out into the world, probably taking that message of decency and righteousness and the possibilities of life with him! I think this is more than coincidence in the construction of the play and the movie. I compare it to Cool Hand Luke. Same symbolic idea. I'm sure!!!However you view the film and its extraordinary impact, you will be mesmerized, entertained and deeply affected. Its cinematic art of the highest order!",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
289,Gatorman9,Deserves all its accolades in full,8,31 October 2012,"The first thing to say about this movie, perhaps, is ""beware of the other reviews!"" (lol) Actually, as is common with reviews on this website, many of the otherwise well-written reviews of this movie found here contain factual errors that are not necessarily insignificant to understanding both the plot and theme. (In that regard, this comment pertains only to the movie, not the book.)That said, this is yet another film like COOL HAND Luke or MISTER ROBERTS that deals with the theme of a small group of men under the thumb of a petty but truly malevolent tyrant, in this case the now-notorious Nurse Ratched. Jack Nicholson is the agent provocateur classic to this genre who challenges not only the authority but the actual control the tyrant has been able to exercise up to the point of his entry into the setting, and of course that cannot be tolerated. Given that in this vehicle this kind of action is taking place in a mental hospital rather than a prison or naval vessel, it also raises the question as to what ought to be considered sanity for confinement purposes, at least in a very abstract or philosophical sense. For this is one of those movies that is not at all realistic, really, but a morality play. Thus, in spite of the look of the thing and the inclusion of electroshock ""therapy"" and the lobotomy, real mental illness is not realistically depicted, nor is there any reason to. That's really not the point.Probably the best reason to see this, then, is to see Jack Nicholson as one of the ultimate movie wise-guy personas of all time. One can't help but wonder what what James Cagney or even Humphrey Bogart would have had to say about this performance; I don't feel that either of those greats (or so many more, even including Paul Newman or Sean Connery) ever did anything so compelling. As the anti-authoritarian foil to the villain's oppression, he is about beyond compare. Add to that Louise Fletcher's cold-blooded, pathologically manipulative control freak (the one who really needs to be institutionalized to stop her from hurting people) and a top-notch supporting cast who later became quite famous in other vehicles including Danny DeVito (with HAIR!), Christopher Lloyd, and Scatman Crothers and this picture walks off with the Triple Crown of the Academy Awards. Worth every bit of the praise its generally given, it is must-see cinema for the true movie connoisseur.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
290,citizenchris,one of the most remarkable cinematic commentaries on the modern human condition,9,24 September 2008,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest 9-24-08To my way of thinking One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is perhaps one of the most remarkable cinematic commentaries on the modern human condition that I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Whats even more remarkable is that it manages to do so with out seeming overly didactic or righteous. The tale can at times seem ambiguous, leaving one feeling as sterile as the institutional surroundings of its characters and it is all the more better for it. Nurse Mildred Ratched who is played with brilliant precision by Louise Fletcher is perhaps the best example of the films sometimes ambiguous nature. Knee jerk reactionaries might label her as antagonist or even evil but she clearly isn't. She is simply doing her job, and one could even argue that she really is concerned with helping Randall and company. Remember that many of the characters are in the hospital voluntarily. I would posit that the only real villain of the film are the flaws within each of these men that causes them to think that hiding in this hospital is the solution. I would also posit that this is Chief Bromden's story and not Randall's. As he is the only character to experience any real ""arc"".",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
291,Clintekabor,I knew you wouldn't leave without me,9,16 May 2020,"A spirited film which is equally uplifting and depressing. I think it has aged well through the years as it still shows us the mistakes and flawed systems in our past.Jack Nicholson in my opinion is one of the greatest actors of all time and shows us such raw emotion and phyiscal presence that you never know if he is playing a character on screen or just being himself. He shoulders the film (Like the Shining) but again not without the help of a superb support cast. Most of whom went on to become some of the best entertainers of the film industry in their own right such as Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif, Louise Fletcher, Scatman Crothers and Will Sampson.There are moments that make you feel good while you see the inmates starting to stand up for each other and strengthen their friendships. The companionship between McMurphy and Bromden is a major driver in the film which starts with the Basketball scene which was an emotional piece of cinema. It had all the inmates and orderlies bonding together and just having a good time and you start to the see the inmates get a new lease of happiness in their lives. All lead by the spontaneous and charismatic Randle McMurphy.While Randle has done some horrible things in the past to be admitted to the asylum including five assaults and the statutory rape on an underage girl. This film still makes his character fun and likeable and that is because he is a free spirit and not a person who is a danger to himself or others, but someone who just truly enjoys life's simple pleasures such as watching the world series, heavy drinking and sex.Louise Fletcher as Nurse ratched is brutally cold, manipulative and intelligent. While she does stand up for herself she also bullies, intimidates and uses the patients past and fears against them.The film is one that I highly recommend. It delves into the human mind and the will of freedom, the storytelling is just as good and is capped off in the ending with one of the most memorable scenes in movie history involving Will Sampson and Jack Nicholson.9/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Her eyes scared me more than reassured me there was safety. This does not make the ward seem like a safe place to me. So, the red flag is being raised a certain level.
Now, for Randle McMurphy. He knows he is contemptible but continues on to use people for his amusement. So, he is considered an antihero of this film instead of one that tries to ""fight the system"" of the ward effectively to me. He is no Martin Luther King, Jr. in my eyes.
Overall, I found myself resiliently liking this film because of how Jack Nicholson can pull off his jerk attitude but in an impressive way. Of how some of the patients in the ward were there via consent. Of how those same patients could have some party fun, though it is probably not acceptable in ward situations in modern time or other times. And of how Chief was the true hero of this film. Chief saved people from McMurphy and McMurphy from his vegetable hell from the lobotomy. People don't give the Chief character enough credit to me.
If you want me to be completely honest, I feel the lobotomy that was done to McMurphy was a tasteless move. You can't stop a natural sociopath from being a natural sociopath unless you turn them into a vegetable.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

I kinda find it quit boring most of the time, and I can't help it if the movie sucks on many ways .. I don't care that the movie based on a famous novel that I didn't read .. because I'm watching a movie and my eyes only believe what they see and I'm afraid I didn't see that much to amaze me besides, I've read some reviews and it sounds the movie wasn't faithful to the novel and was a very bad adaptation ..

300,puttputtk,is and always will be one of the best films ever,10,24 June 2010,"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest (1975)Truly one of the greatest films ever made. Jack Nicholson is put into a mental institute when he pretends to be insane to get out of going to prison. While there he uses the patients to help him pass the time. he plays cards and basketball and kind of tries helps them more than the nursing staff does. While hes there we wonder ""is he really crazy?"" or would we all act like that in his situation?Nicholson seemingly wants to be a hero to these people, he wants them to like him so that he can change things, however making ""crazy"" people change their routine isn't easy. Really I don't feel like he really ever was a hero to anyone he just got desperate and more and more depressing. The more he tried to help his fellow patients the more he was driven mad. One issue I have with the film, well not really with the film but the way people have received it is how Nurse Ratched is played off as the bad guy. In my opinion she did her job and in no way was overly strict or mean or anything like that at all. She seemed to do her best to keep order and did it the way it should be done. Really Nicholson's character is the bad guy in my opinion. He tried to throw everything off and in a way made the patients worse, by throwing off their routine Jack Nicholson's performance is, in my opinion, his best ever. It was a role I don't think anyone else could do as good and a role I can't see him ever being able to top. As the say, he was born to play it. Danny Devito also did a great job, though a very small role I think he did fantastic, as well did most of the patients, and Louise Fletcher in the role of the Nurse Ratched This film really did deserve the 5 Oscars it got that year. Personally I also would have given it cinematography over Barry Lyndon. Forman got seemingly everything out of all the actors and had everything go right. It was some of the best directing in film history. The film is at times funny, at times sad, at times tense, it has everything that makes up a good drama.

Although I was young, I remembered enough of the movie to not want to re-watch it, at least until recently.Well it came on a commercial-free cable channel, and I decided to DVR it. And wow, I was blown away when I watched it. The acting is amazing. I mean, TRULY amazing. The story immediately pulled me in, and each scene is sharp and riveting.

308,mistymountain,Well-deserved Oscar film for 1975,10,26 July 2010,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is truly one of Jack Nicholson's films yet to date. Nicholson gives a truly award-winning performance as convict R.P. McMurphy who fakes insanity to get out of a prison work program. At the start of the film, he is sent to the mental institute in Oregon. He starts to get to know some of the residents on the ward, and the staff including a no-nonsense nurse well played by Louise Fletcher who won an award for best actress. Brad Dourif gave an excellent performance as Billy Bibbit and Will Sampson was as equally impressive as the tall Native American resident, Chief. Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito should also be mentioned for their acting contributions for their respective roles as Taber and Martini, and this was before they would gain fame a couple of years later in the hit TV show, ""Taxi"". And of course, Scatman Crothers' performance as Turkel, the night orderly is definitely not to be missed.McMurphy's character and attitude slowly begin to change in the institute when he realizes that most of the residents on the ward are there voluntarily. His breaking point is when he's about to escape from the hospital, he stays to let Billy have a night of passion with the former's floozy girlfriend, Candy, well played by Marya Smalls.

312,matthewnoorman,A masterpiece,10,8 October 2020,"Lets just start with the obvious. Jacks performance is legandary and is probably in the top 50 best actor performances of all time. Nurse Rachet was played absolutely perfectly. This film was bounced around a lot and at one point was not going to be made until Michael Douglas got the rights from his father. This was a passion piece for him and the director which is shown on screen. Comparing it to the book (which is one of my favorite reads) is as perfect as it can get. They changed very little and what they did leave out was to help the pacing of the film. But they did film everything in the book from the shower scene to, chief getting shaved. They just left it out what would of slowed down or effected the pace of the film or what wasnt extremely necessary to the story.The major difference was the story not being told from the chefs perspective. Which you cant blame them, the movie is better off being told the way it is. It would also give away that the chef can talk for those who havent read the book and want to be suprised.The movie was filmed inside a real mental hospital which the actors stayed in and based their characters of real patients. Thats why all of them are so convincing in their performances.This is a masterpiece of storytelling the perfect example of making a movie based on another medium. As perfect as a film as there ever was.The story is intriguing, the story of the book is the story of the film, the message is the same. Perfect film about standing up to authority, about hope, transformation and never giving up on yourself. RP McCmurphy made these patients feel good about themselves, he woke them up, showed them they have a purpose, told them they aren't worthless. He showed them its okay to stand up for yourself, Think for yourself and question authority. Be who you are, never conform to societies expectations. If we did more uplifting and less judging and stereotyping of each other this world would be better off.I also believe the ending of the film was because the chef wanted to preserve who Mac was and what he represented, the chef didn't want the patients to see their hero as broken, beat and left helpless at the hands of their oppressor. It was also out of empathy and understanding Mac is the type of person who would rather die if he cant be his own.Watch this film, interpret understand the message and never forget it.Thanks for reading this, I hope this movie moves you like it moves me.

313,johnmichael-2,The First Gross Classic Miscast of Jack Nicholson,6,28 November 2006,"*CAUTION: CONTAINS SPOILERS* First off, this movie had some very good aspects to it. Milos Forman's direction was skilfully done, though a notch or two below his later achievement ""Amadeus"". Many of the scenes were quite moving, and the characters were fleshed out very well.Except for McMurphy (played by Jack Nicholson). Sadly, this character was what the whole movie relied on, and it was what brought it down. Even those of you who haven't read to book will be disappointed by how selfish his character seems. All the bad things that happen to the patients (and to Mr. Tuttle the black worker) seem to be the result of his whims.To those of you who read the book: you'll be absolutely infuriated. McMurphy, in the book, is selfLESS, and while he may seem carefree and whimsical on the outside, you can actually tell in Ken Kesey's writing that he is really trying to help the patients in this insane asylum to find their true strengths. You cannot see this in the movie at all. Only the Chief seems able to leave the asylum in the end, and Billy's death seems entirely McMurphy's fault, when in the book it was clearly Nurse Ratched's.At first I didn't know who to blame for this gross misinterpretation of McMurphy's character, whether it was Forman in his direction, Goldman and Hauben in their screen writing, or Nicholson in his acting. However, after watching ""The Shining"", directed by my all-time favorite, Kubrick, I can now safely say that everything is Nicholson's fault. He ruins characters. In this movie and ""The Shining"" he portrayed all the crazy in the characters, and then some, but he failed to show any of the humanity that made us love them in the books. He has ruined this movie for lovers of Ken Kesey's classic, and possibly even for those who haven't read the book beforehand.Otherwise, the movie had a few awkward scenes, but was overall well-made. However, if you truly want to enjoy ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" read the novel. It creates a much stronger mix of emotions (from the hilarious to the sad to the subliminally disturbing, all at the same time) than the movie, and the characters' motives seem much more purely driven.

This Film helped to show me how laughing at my illness actually makes me improve mentally. This Film can change lives, and for that it deserves all the praise it can receive .Besides the great representation or mental illness, One flew over contains great acting possibly some of the best ever. Jack Nicholsons performance won best actor for, and rightfully so, is impeccable and is his second best performance of his career( behind The Shining). Jack Nicholsons one of the greatest actors ever, and this is one of his best performances.One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest is a great film, but it's not for all ages. Teenagers 14+ should like this film, but it's not suitable for younger children. Great Film-10/10.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
315,Paul-103,"Powerful, funny, dramatic, inspiring; what more can I say",9,6 April 1999,"Just saw this movie again after having not seen it for years.  It's a great reminder of how lucky I've been to see Jack Nicholson act in movies.  He embodied his character completely with an incredible performance.  I think I actually had to wipe the frost off of my TV screen when Louise Fletcher appeared, her performance of the freezing cold Nurse Ratched was also memorable.  Supporting cast was also excellent, especially Sydney Lassick as the overly neurotic Cheswick.  Interesting early performances by Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd.  A definite MUST SEE.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
316,Alex_Lo,The Perfect Underdog Story,10,6 February 2021,"The finest hour of Jack Nicholson! Wow, what a performance! Nicholson puts so many nuances of his character into every shot, into every scene, the Oscar for a leading actor was never so well deserved. For this alone, the film deserves 5 stars. But the film also convinces as a milieu study, which never degrades the patients and skillfully combines all nuances from funny to tragic. You should actually be able to award 10 stars for it.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
317,politfilm,Mental asylum as metaphor of contemporary society,10,25 October 2018,"Murphy, a resourceful convict, pleads insanity in order to avoid heavy physical work and spend the rest of his sentence in a ""friendly environment."" However, when he is committed to the a mental institution he finds himself in a situation in which sadistic medical personnel abuses and humiliates patients, systematically destroying their self-confidence and self-esteem. When Murphy opposes the authority of the head nurse and other staff, an already charged atmosphere brings tensions to a boiling point, eventually resolving Murphy's resistance by electroshocks and lobotomy.This asylum is an exceptional metaphor of contemporary society. It raises some very serious questions, such as the normalization of the disbalance of power, the political (mis)use of normality and mental illness, the role of repressive mental institutions in maintaining stability of the system, as well as question of obedience to authority and brutal methods that authority uses to preserves its hegemony.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest quickly gained status of a cult movie and became a must-see for all rebellious ones who felt resistance and the thirst for change, as well as the need to fundamentally re-examine the ideological basis of the world we live in. The movie ranked in the top fifty of the American Film Institute's list and is generally regarded as one of the best films ever made.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
318,sheepmonk2000,A Very Good Film.,8,30 May 2011,"This is a great film about how one man disrupted the order of things within a (mental) institution to the point whereby he was punished. It's a sad film by the end, but otherwise it's quite an entertaining movie with lots of heart and lots of laughs. At the centre of all this is Jack Nicholson, who delivers yet another terrific performance as R.P McMurphy - his whole attitude is off the rails and I love it. On the opposite side of the fence is Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher. A worthy opponent to McMurphy, Nurse Ratched is cold, calculated and basically an all round first class b*tch.To conclude, the writing/screenplay is definitely one of the best ever written and why the film doesn't really go into the reasons why its patients are there in the first place, it does showcase the many wild and wonderful situations patients can find themselves in once there (especially with a character like McMurphy around). Terrific. 8/10 (4*)",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
319,compi24,"Review of ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest""",10,16 June 2011,"In Milos Forman's 1975 Best Picture Winning adaption of the classic Ken Kesey novel, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", he doesn't just create an overwhelmingly inspiring and entertaining flick, but he creates one of the greatest movies of all time. I've said it before and I'll say it again; Jack Nicholson's Academy Award Winning turn as R.P. McMurphy is one of my all-time favorite film characters, and he ultimately makes this movie that much more entertaining. Everyone else did an incredible job in their respective roles, including Louise Fletcher's Academy Award Winning portrayal of the villainous Nurse Ratched, a young Danny DeVito's depiction of Martini, and a young Christopher Lloyd's illustration of Taber. Now, I know that some people claim that movie bastardizes the book because it's not told from the perspective of Chief. However, the movie still effectively presents the themes that are communicated in the novel, and it still makes a meaningful attempt at trying to portray all the events in the novel correctly. ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" was a movie that was ahead of it's time. If it were released now, in 2011, I wholeheartedly believe that it would be a success - bigger than it was in 1975. It makes you laugh your ass off, it makes you feel like crap, and it makes you cheer in triumphant glory. . .I'm not frickin' kidding you. At the summit of ""badass film mountain"".

320,trminator-35198,A pleasant surprise,7,20 August 2020,If you would have told me that there was a drama about a psych ward that was moving I would have laughed. But speaking from a place of having been to a psych ward this movie was fairly accurate and even had some loveable characters. Nicholson is amazing everytime he is one screen.,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
321,dashtag1234,Milos Forman's Weaker Film,8,23 December 2020,"Milos Forman's better film is Amadeus. But Cuckoo's Nest still has some great acting and drama. It's a good movie, a dark one, and complex. You're not sure who's the real villain or who is the real good guy. It has its nice moments but overall it didn't blow me away. In the end, it felt like the movie flipped the script too quickly and changed the story just to make it meaningful. The third act is also a little muddled.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
322,yellowtail_tuna,Excellent characters and acting,10,12 August 2020,"Mac is sent to the mental hospital after he committed some violent crimes. In the hospital, patients are obedient and allow themselves to be controlled by the nurse Ratched. The conflict between freedom vs control is represented by the two.Aside from violence, Mac is just a nice guy. He cannot understand why the patients don't enjoy their lives. So he encourages them to have fun. Jack Nicholson plays the role with his impulsive body movement and his signature naughty smile.On the other hand, Ratched has a formidable appearance with a tall body and a weird hairstyle like a crown. She shows an obvious desire to rule, not just obligation.Another key character is Chief. You will somehow notice from the earlier that he hides intelligence, by seeing his calm eyes and delicate expressions. Unlike whimsical Mac, Chief's presence is growing throughout the film like subconscious determination.I think the best part of this film is the acting of every other patient. Cheswick, Martini, Harding, and Taber, I can't forget everyone's face. As those who have mental disorders, they look weird at first. But actually, they are just like us, only lacking skills to hide emotions, which we are demanded from society. In their peculiar body motions and expressions, we see their raw emotions and we love them.The best example is Billy, played by Brad Dourif. His stutter is somehow even pleasant to hear. He looks up and down frequently, showing that he goes back and forth between courage and fear. He is too innocent to realize he is a victim of oppression, if not abuse. And so are many other patients.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Autocracy runs wild, freedom and personality are extremely suppressed and deprived. It is a modeled general autocracy. It uses the sounding banner to deceive and deceive people, depriving people of their personality. A lunatic is a relative definition that requires a certain evaluation standard.

325,judemcrobbie,Undecided on it,8,27 January 2021,"I like this movie don't get me wrong, but I don't think it sits with some of the greats like compared to.
The character development is brilliant, pretty much every character has somewhat of an arc.
R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) seems to have many mini-arcs embedded within one large one going from being in this mental hospital for a laugh and scamming these patients, to actually caring for the other patients and probably needing to be there.
Furthermore, Jack Nicholson is the perfect casting for this role. His ability to show a psychologically unstable man is unparalleled, for any actor ever.
My problems with the movie stem from the understanding of the characters from the writers and directors. A lot of decisions characters make feel forced and needed to move the plot rather than what a character would do.
I understand the director might have done this to show the psychology of the patients however I feel it doesn't pay off here like it does in other movies about mentally ill people, mainly Forest Gump.
Also I did feel at times too many scenes were in there and felt unnecessary, which lost the immersion of the movie.7-8/10 can't decideP.S. Danny DeVito is king",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
326,dartleyk,brilliant and difficult,9,30 October 2012,"an iconoclastic book crafted into a brilliant but difficult movie; obvious cudos to nicholson (back when he was acting), screenplay, direction; shooting is average; oddly, was recently shown (nov '12) on tcm as part of their series on handicapped, disability in film; the strange take being that films showing demented people (or crippled people, or otherwise disabled people) are somehow off, not true, not up to par; the PC culture reigns supreme- even, according to tcm, for movies set in the 17th century, like bedlam; as though best years of our lives should not have shown homer with no hands- even though the book it's from showed him with a horrible series of much more disturbing problems; so if you approach the movie with that PC view in mind it's so flawed; on the other hand it's a tight look at the individual versus the system, the loner versus the crowd, what you think you should do even when everyone says you should not; the late 60's-early 70's message, unfortunately, is that you lose- as though it presages the coming of the nanny state, the transposing of jfk's what you can do for your country to obama's what can your country do for you;though there are many movies about asylums and dementia, this one stays almost till the end on the edge of sane or not; that's what makes it interesting",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
327,HSauer,Kesey lite,9,2 February 2000,"I love this movie.  It is direct, powerful, funny and sad and uplifting, and, I think, perfectly proportioned.  Nevertheless, I can understand why Kesey allegedly won't watch the movie.  The man imagined the whole story and wrote the book, and he told the story the way he believed it should be told. In his tale, a shock-shopworn lunatic lives with McMurphy in the hospital and, through his influence, learns the meaning of freedom.  Or something like that.  Kesey's novel is written in first-person by the lunatic, Chief Bromden - the deaf, dumb, crazy Indian.  In the book, Bromden is observant, imaginative, smart, and at least a little daffy, especially in the first half.  Readers enjoy the progress of Bromden toward functional sanity and appreciate more fully how McMurphy's example of ""free living"" affected the entire ward.  The movie works much better than it should, because it doesn't even try to capture the flavor of the book.  It retells the key events of Kesey's novel, as though the book were nothing but a plot with dialogue. Fortunately the plot is strong enough to survive simplification, compression, and pragmatic alterations (e.g. keeping a character who commits suicide midway through the book alive all through the film, apparently to keep the tragedies to a bare dramatic minimum).  The ending of the film, with Jack Nizsche's uplifting ""Native American"" theme, is a knockout.  If there is anyone who has neither seen this film nor read the book, I'd recommend seeing the film before plunging into the book.  That way, both can be enjoyed to the fullest extent.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

329,MrWhite2,One of Jack Nicholson's best movies!,10,14 February 2003,"This is such an outstanding film. I think it is safe to say that this is a masterpiece. The highlights of the film are Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson's acting. The acting is so good it won them both Oscars. The story is about a man (Jack Nicholson) who gets commited to a mental hospital after commiting a crime, and convincing a jury he is crazy. At the hospital he meets the nasty scary head nurse, Nurse Ratchett, or as he likes to say, ""Nurse Rats--t"". She is really nasty to him and the other patients there, including a suicidal young man (Brad Dourif), a big Native American, and much others. The film scored many Academy Awards including Best Actor - Jack Nicholson, Best Actress - Louise Fletcher, Best Picture and a nominee for Best Supporting Actor - Brad Dourif. This film is extraordinary at the least, and should be recommended to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. This is the film featuring the first great Jack Nicholson performance, which is followed by many others such as About Schmidt, As Good As It Gets and The Shining. Rent this movie, today!

331,chimera3,Paging Nurse Ratched,10,6 October 2017,"My brother had seen this movie and was talking about it as if I knew what he was talking about, which I did not. He was quite surprised that I had not seen it beforehand and practically told me to check it out for myself. Having said that, I found this on a movie channel on TV and set up to record on the DVR. When I sat down to watch, I was immediately hooked from minute one.There was no better person to play Randle McMurphy than Jack Nicholson. He was truly born for this role and anything else to follow it. Look up ""crazy"" in the dictionary and you will certainly find his picture. Along with Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif (Billy Bibbit, of course), and Christopher Lloyd, there is nothing that you can find wrong with this movie.Perhaps the real villain of this movie is the infamous Nurse Ratched, practically the devil in a nurse's uniform. She does her best to block the guys at every turn and does not care how she looks or sounds when she does it. Having seen this timeless classic, I believe that ""Nurse Ratched"" should have been a catchphrase for diabolical nurses who take their job way too seriously. It was actually before I saw this that I read the book of it by Ken Kesey. It's not very long and you can get through it in one sitting. To put it mildly, the movie is very faithful to the book and I highly recommend both of them. When this movie came up for the Academy Awards back in the day, it would have been shocking if it didn't win any of the awards that it was nominated for. It truly is that good. Like with so many other timeless classics, it would be sacrilegious if this gem was ever remade. It wouldn't surprise me if it ever was but I would become very angry.

335,newfiesailor,Triumph of the Human Spirit!,10,21 April 2006,"I have been watching through a lot of the sixties and seventies movies recently and most do not stand the test of time. They have dated badly, the language is stilted and the camera work seems shoddy compared to today's standards. A select few have subject matter that carries over and still resonates to today's moviegoers. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of these films.Why this movie works: We do not feel pity for the patients at the start. Instead, we identify with them. They are ordinary people, all original yet still very likable despite their various problems. The first group session could be a family gathering or a supper table discussion. We immediately bond with them. The introduction to the characters this way is very clever because it subtly reveals their character flaws without being blatantly obvious.Enter Jack Nicholson, the charismatic and strong Randle Patrick Murphy. Murphy reaches out to every one of the patients in his own way and ends up changing their lives by breathing life into their solitary and lonely existence. How? He makes them laugh and shows them a good time. He treats them like human beings, not something to be shunned or cast down. Is he crazy? Who is to judge who is crazy or not? We all take our different paths and that is what this film reveals. It is a character study into every personality from Nurse Ratched to Turkle and how they intermingle with each other. Whether Murphy is crazy or not, he is a leader. I think only Jack Nicholson could have carried off being crazy and charismatic in this role.I found myself smiling and hurting with these guys throughout the whole movie. The fishing trip, the Christmas party, the fights, awaiting their punishments. The movie quietly hits you on an emotional level until you are wrapped up into it. This is in large part do to the acting.The acting in this movie is phenomenal. From the quiet, demure Martini, the noble and thoughtful Chief, the loud, raucous Murphy and the manipulative, controlling Ratched. Never have I saw such varied and powerful performances by so many talented actors.Truly a great and original film.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Definitely a special combo of brilliant acting, anti-establishment vigor and messages of living life and standing up to oppression.I don't see this as a movie about mental health so much as the human spirit. Nurse Ratched is the epitome of freakish control, obeying rules no matter how inappropriate and showing an inability to see things from other people's perspectives. She truly is a scary villain... which makes McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) such a great hero.Yes, McMurphy has problems and a criminal past, but we cheer for his spirit to break free from the frightening halls of Nurse Ratched's mental ward. That's why we forgive his breaking rules, and boisterous persona... because it's hard to sit back and watch the human spirit trampled so thoroughly as it is inside that mental hospital.I really liked the movie, but it seems ranked a little too highly overall. Ranked #9 of all times at IMDb at the time of this writing... it just seems a tad over promoted. Perhaps nostalgia helps, of which I have none built up yet. It may also be that repeat viewings improve upon the feelings explored. But no doubt it's place on the MUST WATCH list is well warranted.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

People saying that he was great in 'As good as it gets' and 'Batman' but nothing could ever push the part he played in 'One flew over the cuckoos nest'. This is when i decided to watch it!!!Straight from the off we could see that there was so much talent and energy in the role that Nicholson potrays as mental patient MacMurphy who finds himself being monitored by the institution that he has been sent to in order to find out if he really is mental???At the academy awards of 1975 this swept the board including Nicholson taking Best Actor and Louise Fletcher taking a well deserved Best Actress. But i thought that the incredibly talented Brad Douriff who made his debut with this film as Billy, was very unlucky to pick up best supporting actor in which he was nominated for.  Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Will Sampson were all brilliant as the inmates of the hospital and showed that its all about the overall cast and not just one actor. 
The film itself is incredible, nothing like i've ever seen before and puts very stupid versions like 28 days way out of context!  You could cut the tension with a knife in every encounter between Macmurphy and nurse Ratched, it literally was end of your seat stuff.  Why i havn't watched this film sooner is beyond me, so please anyone out there reading these comments that hasn't seen this film, pick it up from your local video store A.S.A.P...........10/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
352,michaelheiser-25099,Good Nicholson Film,6,11 November 2021,"Good Nicholson film. Not as good as 'A Few Good Men'. This is a great drama, that also has a lot of humor in it. DeVito's character is someone who brings a smile on your face. And when they go fishing on a boat after McMurphy (Nicholson) steals the bus. Many of the actors got actually seasick. The party scene, that brings a lot of trouble to Crother's character is a lot of laughs. And then the drama. The group session scenes are full of drama. Like when Bibbitt (Dourif) talks about his troubles. Or after the party, when he takes his own life because the nurse from hell threats to talk to his mother about him sleeping with that girl. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) is directed by the Czech born director Milos Forman. The movie came from the novel (1962) by Ken Kesey, which I haven't read. Then there was a play version, and finally the movie came. The casting is perfect. Jack Nicholson does the role of the lifetime in the lead. Louise Fletcher, a perfect choice to play nurse Mildred ""Big Nurse"" Ratched. She represents the evil in the movie, but she doesn't see she's doing anything wrong. Will Sampson is huge and really great as Chief Bromden. We can thank Mel Lambert, who plays Harbor Master, for finding Will. His father happened to be an Indian agent. Dean R. Brooks, who plays Dr. John Spivey, was at the time the actual head of the Oregon State Hospital. Harding is playd by the amazing William Redfield. A tragic thing about this actor. He was diagnosed with leukemia during shooting by Dr. Brooks. He told he'd have about 18 months to live, and about 18 months later he died. Yet he stayed in the picture until the very end. The marvelous Scatman Crothers portrays Turkle the janitor. He got the part with the help from his friend, Jack Nicholson. The music done by Jack Nitzche is really beautiful and haunting.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
353,beardedmovieguy,You would have to be crazy not to watch this movie.,10,11 March 2015,"The more I see older Jack Nicholson films, the more I understand why people think he is such a great actor. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is definitely one of those movies that would not be made the same if made today, and as far as I can tell, it is actually pretty accurate for the way mental hospitals worked at the time. The story of a sane man playing crazy and then trying to make the other patients sane while making the nurses crazy, it just has to be seen to be believed. The story is interesting and kinda heartbreaking in the end, (note to self, never fall asleep during an escape attempt, bad things will happen) and it has a great young cast that has gone on to do some great things with Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif all turning in terrific performances. And yeah, Nurse Ratched is just plain evil.

It sure isn't easy to act in the first place, now throw in acting like a mentally ill person? That is a whole new level of acting. This film keeps you gripped starting at about 30 minutes in.

It hit me really hard like nothing had hit me before. Now, I agree that movie is not as effective as the book but then it is not fair to compare a 300 page book to a 2 hour movie. The characters' inner feelings or inner thoughts for eg, that you can so very well describe in a book gets a little tricky to show in a film. But despite of the intrinsic limitation I think Mr. Forman did a very good job in adapting the book into a movie which is a great movie in every sense.The story on the surface is about an asylum, a control freak nurse and a rebellious new inmate who doesn't want to conform but below the surface it obviously is about any authoritarian society. Jack Nickolson got an Oscar for his portrayal of rebellious Mcmurphy, a role that was cut out for him.

We can also see the best of Hollywood movie making.As of 2021, Jack Nicholson has retired from acting. This is a must see in his body of work. He is amazing, and I believe his finest performance.

There is no development of her character. Then, there is Cindy, who is in the movie just to be the arm candy of McMurphy. I could handle this much sh*t, but then she slept with Billy just because McMurphy said so. Writers, please write believable characters.

I really liked how the sequence of events all led up to the startling conclusion. <<SPOILER WARNING>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>When I first became acquainted with this film by reading a 15-page summary of it on Mr. Hollywood or some other film site like that, I cried when I read about Randall's lobotomy.  I was really troubled that someone with so much vigor and passion was turned into a passive vegetable by the establishment. Not only that, but the reactions of the patients in my mind as I read horrified me.  As far as the Chief's murder of Randall is concerned, I am against euthanasia actively and it bothered me very much but I respect that it was put into the film and novel.  The Chief saw it as something that had to be done before he made his escape. <<<<<<<<<<<<<END SPOILER WARNING>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Anyways, I really enjoyed this film and all the performances elicited strong emotions.

It is an achievement that stands the test of time. It's not a secret why Milos Forman is highly regarded as true craftsman. He sets a perfect balance of comedy and drama. It can be uplifting in one moment, then turn downright depressing the next. There's nothing I could add but echo what's been said before. I think this film should not be missed. It took me a second rewatch a few years later to realize the importance of this film. Essentially, this is a film about freedom.

366,jmcody,Simply my favorite movie of all time,10,17 May 2000,"This is my favorite movie of all time. I'm not saying it is the greatest ever made- there are many more titles that could easily vie for that title. This movie isn't really a film in the sense that there isn't a particularly memorable piece of camera work or composition. However, director Forman knows what to do: he gets out of the way and lets his actors tell the captivating story of the individual courageously fighting for identity against ""the machine"".Cuckoo's Nest is an actor's movie. The ensemble work here by Nicholson, Fletcher, Lloyd, Redfield, Lasker,Sampson, Devito and the rest is amoung the finest ever captured. I can not find a false note in any of the performances. These actors fully inhabit the skins of these characters and therefore, create three dimensional people.The script is air tight as it oscillates between comedy and tragedy often not only in the same scene but in the same take. I know Kesey has disowned this film and I don't blame him considering the experience he had, however the film compliments his novel nicely. Many of my favorite lines in film history are in this movie. ""Least I tried, G*******t, least I did that!"" is a motto that has guided my life. When viewed with its near twin Cool Hand Luke (my third favorite film of all time), one can see the possibly dated, but no less intriguing subtext of the criminal/prisoner as savior. Many souls are saved as a direct result of McMurphy's (and Luke's) ultimate sacrifice.The film is entertaining, enlightening and reflective without the ever so slightest hint of pretension.

368,FedRev,An all-time classic about the subversion of authority,9,13 November 2014,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the most beloved classics of all-time and features Jack Nicholson as McMurphy, a man who's been ordered by a court to undergo psychiatric evaluation at a mental hospital. McMurphy doesn't show signs of mental illness, but he does have a strong anti-authoritarian impulse, and he establishes himself as a leader among the inmates shortly after his arrival. He's an obvious wild card in an otherwise stable population of patients who are tightly controlled by Nurse Ratched, played to chilling perfection by Louise Fletcher. Ratched employs a host of manipulative suppression techniques to keep the patients under her thumb, and McMurphy becomes her nemesis, attempting to subvert her authority wherever possible. The film, which swept the Academy Awards, on a surface level is about the personal struggle between the ideologies of the two major characters, but it can also be viewed as a metaphor for the culture wars of the 60s and 70s. The film also powerfully illuminates the oppression of the mentally ill under a system incapable of treating them with dignity, as they are stripped of their humanity and kept out of sight from society.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

In the opening scene, the patients seem extremely docile - obeying Nurse Ratched's cult like rigour (one patient even takes his medication like communion), though upon McMurphy's arrival, life on the ward perks up. With his rolled up sleeve encasing a pack of cigarettes, the dishevelled hair, the mischievous look in his eyes, McMurphy establishes himself as a rebel without a cause from the get go. He brings joy & laughter back into the lives of the patients, and inspires the men to gain autonomy for themselves and indeed hope for a life outside of the institution.
The group therapy scenes were excellent and really allowed time for you to 'get to know' each individual patient. Though Nicholson's character (McMurphy) is flawless, credit has to be given to the men behind Billy Bibbit, Chief & Martini. Their performances felt so believable - not once did I think oh, these are actors.
One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is a touching, and culturally significant drama which stands the test of time - offering an interesting insight into the relationship between authority and freedom.

It goes to show how good the film was, that almost every main actor in this film made a success in acting after taking role in this movie. Jack Nicholson was truly made for the part as RP McMurphy, as nobody else could have played the part more convincing and dramatic as he did. To perform a film set in a mental Institution takes an incredible amount of patience from both the directors/actors to learn how to act mental, as Danny Devito(Martini) and Christopher Lloyd(Taber) were especially remarkable at this, as they knew how to put on such convincing mental facial reactions (ie.when C.Lloyd was screaming/laughing when Will Sampson(The Chief) escaped from the mental Institution and when D.Devito(Martini) was playing Monopoly with Harding as he put his hotel piece on the board.This film in all aspects was funny, witty, heartfelt, dramatic and quite realistic, as all the way through the film you are either angry, laughing, crying, at something or other, that is going on in the film, whether its being angry with Nurse Ratchett(Louise Fletcher)over her legalism, or crying when Billy(Brad Dourif) harms himself at the end of the film or even laughing at the way RP McMurphy was acting, when he was listening/ observing Mr.Hardings and Mr.Tabers argument during Nurse Ratchetts therapy group. There is not a moment in this film, for which ones emotions aren't triggered, as this film is 'all go' and never drags-on. If you haven't seen this film and would like to, please watch it, for I can guarantee you that you won't be disappointed.

374,tylerkom,A deceptively entertaining film,6,12 September 2020,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of Hollywood's classic gems. It's an entertaining film, at times I wondered if I was watching a family film it was so wholesome. You could see the way McMurphy lights up the room. The acting was superb on Nicholson's part, although quite subdued by the rest of the cast. In fact, this film felt so damn wholesome that it got a bit boring for me. Not boring like ""get me out of this damn theater"" but boring as in ""this is a nice hallmark movie to enjoy with the family"". Of course, this is certainly an adult film but the point is that the tension was short lived and the good times kept rolling.At some level, the plot was slightly predictable, although I wouldn't judge the film so harshly on this as the reveals are done quite tastefully. Honestly there is not much bad I can say about this film. It is simply that for me, it did not do anything extraordinary. I kind of felt as if this was a hour and thirty minute exposition, leading to some kind of ""coming of age-overcome all"" hybrid.I suspect I don't really 'get' this film, the same way I don't really 'get' films that give me similar vibes like the breakfast club. However, this was a very decent film. It brought a smile to my face, gave me a few laughs, and had me cringing at some tough moments.

375,badar1981,Content over human attitude,8,5 March 2007,"After watching the movie I am neither sad nor glad but a strange sort of feeling is lingering in my mind. It is very hard to express that in words but the best close word for that is contentment over the human attitude. All the characters along with leads are perfectly accurate. The attitude of the nurse and those of its staff is real. Acting needs a special praise specially for the head nurse, just to highlight one point is when she was in meeting with the board over the RP's issue, how calm, subtle yet strong with her belief. And above the two characters, one of RP (Jack Nicholson) and other is of chief (Will Sampson) is what stands out. The chemistry between is so human that it attracts from the very moment. The way Will responded to Nicholson ideas is just stirring but at the same time amazing and captivating.But the end took the movie to different height altogether.

379,thedudeabides-2,Deserves all the praise it gets,10,31 July 2014,"It has been almost 40 years since One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest first entered cinemas but its impact has not diminished. Cuckoo's Nest is one of only three films to win the 'Big 5' at the Oscars (Best Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay and Film) and it is easy to see why. Jack Nicholson excels in the lead role as Randle P. McMurphy, a streetwise conman faking mental illness so he can spend his time in a hospital rather than a jail cell.Nicholson draws on all his talents as he does battle with the despicable Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, who seems to revel in the torment she inflicts on her patients. The conflict between these two characters is the driving force in the film, as Ratched strives to maintain order in the face of Nicholson's gleeful anarchy. Perhaps the most surprising thing about Cuckoo's Nest is how funny it is. There is always a danger, when making a film about mental illness, that the subject matter becomes too dark and depressing. Cuckoo's Nest is able to avoid this by populating the hospital with a number of memorable, and funny, characters. Rather than laughing at the patients and their illnesses, the movie explores their idiosyncrasies and, with stellar support from the likes of Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd, never threatens to mock the characters.Director Milos Forman handles the pacing perfectly, with the movie flitting between comedy and drama with ease and never once feeling like it is overstaying its welcome. For a film almost exclusively set in one location, it moves along at a rollicking pace, with McMurphy pushing Ratched closer and closer to her limit, until we reach the absolute gut punch of an ending. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is an absolute classic – one of those instances where everything just seems to work together to create something truly special. It contains, arguably, Jack Nicholson's greatest performance, a cracking script handled perfectly by a talented director and one of the most iconic endings in Hollywood history.

They believe he's not crazy at all, that he's just doing all this to get out of working a job. But only watching the movie can tell you what happens. All I can say is that it was crazy. As far as technical work goes, the movie had very omniscient and interesting photography. The movie also had a few good subjective shots. But what really made this movie was how round Jack Nicholson's character was. This movie was a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror movie combined. The story progression on top of Nicholson's character just made a crazy dramatic thriller. Also every nurse in the movie was so cold and eerie, especially nurse Ratchet, she was so cold and had such an eerie personality, it just helped build the overall uneasiness of the movie.

This is not only a great drama but also a masterful satire of the way mentally challenged sometimes get treated at the mental hospitals. It's impossible not to like Jack Nicholsons character just as much as it's an impossibility not to hate Jessica Fletcher's role as nurse Ratched. She is superb as one of the meanest b*tches in film history.

383,JimSDCal,A great film about a fight for freedom,9,15 July 2007,"This film is one of Hollywood's great films about an individual's fight to find freedom in an oppressive environment. Randall MacMurphy (Jack Nicholson 1975's Best Actor) is a prison convict judged to possibly be mentally ill and sent for evaluation to a mental hospital in 1960s Oregon. In the hospital he is under the ""care"" of Nurse Ratchett (Louis Fletcher in an Oscar-winning role) who is cold and unsympathetic to MacMurphy and all the other inmates. She desires order and obedience from the men in her charge. This immediately sets MacMurphy and Ratchett at odds as MacMurphy is not about to be anyone's lackey.MacMurphy demonstrates his desire for freedom and individuality in many ways . He gets Ratchett to OK a vote to decide if the inmates will be able to alter their strict work schedule and watch the World Series. MacMurphy thinks he has won when all the cognizant inmates vote to watch the game. But Ratchett stifles Randall's bid when she insists on counting the catatonic members of ""the group"" as ""No"" votes so MacMurphy is frustrated in his effort.MacMurphy desires to prove to his minders that he is mentally ill and should not be sent back to prison, so he escapes from the hospital with Cheswick, Taygor, Harding, Martinia and others and absconds with a charter boat so the men can go fishing. This effort surely puts Randal in hot water with hospital officials, but it accomplishes MacMurphy's goal of being kept in the mental hospital. What he does not know and no one told him is as an involuntary committed man, MacMurphy, unlike most of the other men in the hospital, who are voluntarily in the hospital, MacMurphy can be held as long as the hospital officials desire.MacMurphy and Ratchett are at odds throughout this movie. This film shows the down-side of this country'r mental health system where under-paid and overly officious health workers like Ratchett can use their power to abuse those supposedly in their care. This is shown best in Ratchett's treatment of teenager Billy (Brad Dourff) whom Ratchett controls by threatening to tell his mother of Billy's encounter with a woman MacMurphy brings into the hospital, at night, for a party. Billy is terrified that his mother will find out that he was with a woman, and Ratchett knows this, but nevertheless makes the threat to him.There are vociferous critics int the United States of the psychiatric profession and of the use of medication to control the freedom of mental patients, the Church of Scientology being the most prominent. I don't agree with the critics' point of view, but this movie, in which several people are hurt in the oppressive mental hospital strengthens the case of those who dislike the mental health system in this country. This movie does a great job of showing MacMurphy's fight against oppression, to remain an individual in a totalitarian system, so I grade this film as earning 9 points out of 10. This film is deservedly among the top 100 ever according to the AFI and I encourage everyone, especially Jack Nicholson fans to watch it if they get the chance.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Jack Nicholson gave a great performance and it hit all the important scenes from the book but it just fell flat otherwise. Martini felt too annoying and while I get that's the idea it just irritates me. Bromden's escape felt unearned, he was a character, who if you didn't read the book wouldn't understand why he was in the hospital. My biggest problem is simply not enough changed throughout the movie. All the patients stayed, making it feel like none of them grew or changed. Ultimately just an overrated film that doesn't mean anything.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

It is a dreary movie that wrongly vilifies mental health workers who are dealing with people no one else can or will handle. I have an acquaintance who is just like Nicholson's character (pretty sure they aspired to be like him because they love this movie), therefore I had no sympathy and only frustration with his character. Nurse Ratched was not an awful person, in my opinion. She was merely trying to do her job.

386,harrishcraig,McMurphy Villain,10,22 September 2020,"Randal McMurphy is too often considered a tragedy of the nonconformist hero standing up against an unjust establishment. Taking a closer look at this character shows the exact opposite may be true.
1. The story suggests that McMurphy has been incarcerated at least five times, four for assault and battery, and at least once for statutory rape. While downplayed in the film, his sex crime was against a fifteen year old girl. His habitual and uncontrolled violence is displayed many times during the film both against orderlies and Nurse Ratched.
2. McMurphy is manipulative in such a way that is harmful to those around him. He takes advantage of his fellow patients by gambling, winning all of their cigarettes and much of their money. His escapade with the fishing boat endangered the patients lives - none of them should have been out unsupervised. However comically presented, at times no one is driving the boat and McMurphy simply desires to satisfy his sex drive after occupying the others with the fish.
3. McMurphy takes bets that he can get under nurse Ratchet's skin and disturb her and he intentionally causes chaos on the ward without consideration of the other patient's well being. He is further unable to recognize that his own well being is also jeopardized by his actions.
4. It is McMurphy's own actions that lead to Billy Bibbit's suicide. Unable to see this, McMurphy attempts to murder the very people who are trying to help him.
Ultimately and tragically, it is his self centeredness that leads to his lobotomy and his death.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
387,baz_trinity,"Amazing, humorous and shocking.",10,29 August 2006,"I watched this movie for the very first time yesterday and I have to say, it blew me away and is definitely one of my all-time favorites. This tells the story of Mcmurphy (Played by the incredible Jack Nicholson) who gets put into mental institution after a number of incidents. From there on in, you are captivated by the witty cast of the institution (Including Christopher Lloyd) who produce some hilarious and entertaining scenes in the ward. But the plot thickens and you begin to realize the shocking tales that occur and the story twists and turns. You are literally holding your breath from start to finish and it is also one of the most thought-provoking ends to a movie. The nurse Ratched, played by an excellent Louise Fletcher, is ice cold in her attitude and you really grow to hate her. In fact, every character in the movie is absorbed into your mind and you really get to know them. You feel for the characters like you would feel for people that aren't acting, and provokes the question, why are those that inhabit a mental institution so ignored and turned away from society? In a nutshell, this is an amazing, humorous and shocking piece of movie-making that everyone should watch, you won't be disappointed.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

389,wlmlbl,Best Movie Of It's Time,10,10 October 2002,"This probably the best movie that Jack Nicholson ever did. His performance outranks anything he has ever done. As Randle P. MacMurphy, he is a convict that just doesn't get along. It is decided to have him checked out at a mental hospital, which to him is a big joyride. He meets some patients there, and soon has them doing things for themselves. He is especially fond of the Chief, played by Will Sampson. The chief has the staff at the hospital beleiving that he is deaf and dumb, and he is neither. MacMurphy is the only one that knows this. He also develops a true hatred for Nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher). MacMurphy shows his dislike for her by constantly breaking the rules. He takes the patients on a bus ride, and then on a fishing trip. He also brings in some women and booze to have a party on the ward. He was already givin shock treatments for interfering in a fight on the ward, and after Nurse Ratched causes Billy to commit suicide, MacMurphy really loses it, and tries to choke Nurse Ratched. It is decided that MacMurphy is dangerous, and he is givin a lobotomy. The Chief, after seeing his friend a vegetable, decides that he does not want the other patients to see him in that condition, and smothers MacMurphy. After this, the Chief escapes from the hospital using the water cooler to break the window. This is in homage to MacMurphy, and is very moving.

390,g_ryder,Excellent satire on psychiatry – a 'goddamned marvel of modern science'.,10,26 August 2012,"The theme of this movie is centered on the question of what is insanity, and how people identified as insane should be treated. In all societies, an individual deviating beyond a certain point from the norms of that society is considered insane, but even that raises the question as to who in society decides this. In the post-modern world, this power is held by the psychiatrists who 'secularly' and 'scientifically' decide whether a person is sane or not. The sophisticated phrase 'behavior disorder' is used, instead of 'insanity' – and the treatment is very simple – control of behavior by 'commitment to institution' and forcible administration of tranquilizers. More often than not, the end result is opposite; instead of being cured, the patients become worse and at best kept 'stable' on drugs. The basic plot of the movie revolves around this and the blurring lines between sanity and insanity.""In-sanity is better than out-sanity"".(John C. Lilly) McMurphy fakes insanity so that he can avoid the work at the regular prison and take it easy at the institution where he is going to be evaluated, but given his nature - being too cockeyed and overconfident, doesn't know he is landing himself into a trap. Here he meets all kinds of colorful characters – both as fellow inmates as well as the ward nurse who is the most remarkable character because she is so centered on the 'normal' that she is hardly human – more like a cold, ruthless machine, and yet outwardly cordial, a model of 'out-sanity'. It is her cold smile and outwardly pleasant, but relentless by-the-book behavior that provokes McMurphy. This is what sets him on a collision course with nurse Ratched (sounds more like 'wretched') and which will also lead sadly to his own demise.The other main character is Chief Bromden who is noticeable by his size only and hardly seems to be present because he says nothing and does nothing. It seems as if he is an invisible observer. McMurphy is intrigued by him and tries to draw him out, finally he succeeds and finds that Bromden can hear and talk as well, but has been faking it all along. They become friends because both of them realize they are of one kind – those who want to live as they like and who are basically misfits in civilized culture in which there are in-numerable constraints to behavior. When prompted by McMurphy to escape with him, Bromden doesn't want to because he fears he will be 'consumed' by the outside world like his father. ""He did as he pleased. That's why everybody worked on him. I'm not saying they killed him, they just worked on him. The way they are working on you.""When the final confrontation takes place and McMurphy has been turned into a zombie by the authorities because of his violent attack on Ratched; that is when Bromden flips. He finds that the only friend he ever had is 'gone' and that now even the outside world looks like a better proposition than the ward - he finds it better to put McMurphy out of a vegetative and meaningless life and he himself takes flight.. ""In a world where many people have learned to accept a kind of Grey nothingness, to strike an unreal series of poses in order to be considered normal...it's difficult to say who is engaged in the greater conspiracy--the criminal, the soldier(warrior), or us.""

405,Hwos,Great Film,9,10 December 2011,"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest was one of the best, if not most depressing films I have ever seen. Jack Nicholson is superb as McMurphy, a charismatic man that fakes mental illness to get out of jail, and instead ends up in a mental hospital. The head nurse in the hospital, Nurse Ratched, played wonderfully by Louise Fletcher is a hard, vindictive woman that is McMurphy's constant antagonist. Nicholson and Fletcher won the Oscar's for best actor and actress for this film, which also claimed Best Picture, and Best Director. The supporting cast was equally strong, especially Danny DeVito, Christopher LLoyd, and Will Sampson as Chief. McMurphy's different views and easy way begin to help the other patients progress. McMurphy grows more and more frustrated with Ratched's strict ways and defies her more and more until things come to a head and Nurse Ratched wins out. She has him lobotomized and turned into a vegetable. Chief mercifully kills his friend and escapes the hospital. The film is a sad, but important look into mental illness, the difficulties in treating it, and the failures of the system we had in place at the time.

He befriended all of the patients and saw them as people not patients. He formed a clan with them. He helped shine the light on how tragic and terrifying the staff of hospitals and such places can truly be. Although she was such a horrifying character, Nurse Ratched, was very well played. You couldn't help but just hate her!! I liked that this movie showed that any sort of patient is still a person.

I think what's most tragic about Cuckoo's Nest is that people will watch it and won't realize that, in real life, institutions like mental wards really are evil. Nurse Ratched represents authoritative manipulation and corrupt subjugation as a whole. Jack Nicholson was perfect in his role as McMurphy. Wild, free, eccentric...Jack very much is the character. Deep, penetrating writing. And the portrayal of the patients is brilliant too. As well as the acting. I love the scene where they take the boat and Jack introduces the other patients as doctors, and then they make these convincing doctor faces and gestures. The ward patients and the ward doctors are largely what they are because they're playing a role that others suggest they play. To me, that scene conveyed that idea.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Nicholson's role as a patient pretending to be mentally ill seems perfect for him, and he plays the part with humor, violence, and tenderness when appropriate. His antics in the institution inspire real growth and therapy for the other patients, as opposed to the iron fisted order imposed by the loathsome Nurse Ratched, who's name i found particularly appropriate as she was always manipulating the patients. I found her strangulation to be particularly satisfying, no doubt a product of the great performances and writing of the film. Aesthetically not too much caught my eyes from an artistic point of view, although certain scenes, like the fishing scene and the closing scene with the chief walking over the hills as a silhouette, were done with profound meaning.

Now I am glad that I watched it.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a crazy movie that is also very enjoyable. At first you thought things may go wrong because the main character wanted to get out of work detail at the prison by being considered 'crazy' and in the end it did, but the story before the ending events was heartwarming. Jack Nicholson's character saw all the other patients as people and accepted them for who they were.

It's probably the earliest film I've seen either of them in and it was really interesting to see them in something that came out before they became well known.I have to say that in my opinion Louise Fletcher gave one of the most fantastic performances in the film. She did an absolutely excellent job making you hate her. I've never loathed a character in a movie so much. Towards the end you really just want her to die, honestly. The film is deeply impacting. Sometimes it's totally depressing, and at other times it's really exciting and uplifting. I had a strong emotional response to the movie and I think it's probably one of my favorite films.

Everything on the screen seemed real, and makes you feel as if you're there in the mental institution. There is a real truth to the story, that makes the whole film believable, and since most of society doesn't know what it's like to be in that kind of setting, our attention is gained by experiencing something new. Jack Nicholson does a phenomenal job, expressing his anger towards Nurse Ratchet, as well as his passion for the other patients; helping them to improve themselves. The film brings out emotions in the viewer, sometimes you want to cry out of sympathy for the patients, other times you feel the anger McMurhphy has, you feel the frustration of the patients, and some fear towards the more ""crazy"" patients. The film also has an important social message. It proves that not everyone is society is viewed for their true potential. It is hard not to judge someone by what we see, before we know them. Overall, a great film, but also heartbreaking.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
412,ben_jm89,Review for History of Cinema,9,13 May 2011,"i highly enjoyed watching this movie. Jack Nicholson played his character superbly. \I am still uncertain if i think R.P. McMurphy was actually crazy or not. I kind of think he really was faking it the whole time because life was easier in a mental hospital and so was a chance at escape, which he tried a few times. I think the point of the movie is to show that mental patients are not totally incompetent and do not need to be forced into a strict routine. You see in the movie that with a little change in routine, a little excitement, even the patients that are most out of it become more alive and personable. still, it is also shown that too much freedom turns to chaos.This was a great movie with great acting and a powerful message.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

I thought that he really played the character well and how the director imagined the part to be done. I think this movie brings up interesting points regarding Mental illness and what it actually is. Just because someone is mentally ill does that mean that they can't function in society and be locked up. I think that this movie did a good job on tackling some of the stereotypes and misconceptions about mental illness all the while taking us through an interesting story with great acting. This is one of the more interesting social commentary films that I have seen.,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

417,NineFelines,Unfortunate Insanity,6,30 April 2012,"I found this movie difficult to watch, not because of the subject matter, but because it initially seemed as unsure of its destination as I was. It is entirely understandable that a movie about a mental institution would provide an insight into the daily routine of the inhabitants which is most likely quite dull and, well, routine. It is also necessary to provide for character development, but too much monotony and introduction is just difficult to watch. This is not to say that any of the actors were negligent in their craft. Everyone was very believable in their respective roles, so much so that it took me a while to recognize Danny DeVito. Jack Nicholson was his usually boisterous and slightly insane self and Louise Fletcher was a superb Nurse Ratched. The technical aspects of the movie were sufficient and fluid, but did not draw attention to themselves with any particularly notable exhibition of flair.The second half did pick up a bit and the ending misses making the movie more than just worth watching by only a tiny fraction.

418,d-burgess3,what great acting,9,25 April 2012,"I choose this movie only because I know jack Nicolson sometimes have pretty boundless movies, my all favorite by him is The Shining. However I consider this movie to be on the same level at that movie because this had such great acting. I think his roles as the insane/disorderly one are entertaining to watch. After watching easy rider I was quite hesitant to even look at the other movies I was assigned, but I have to do them anyway. This movie really made me want to cry, I'm going to be quick and brief about this movie. It had great climax, lovely well rounded characters and a marvelous ending. I would watch this movie over and over and over again. I really enjoyed this movie and was very content into watching it. Also when I was watching the scene when the guy wanted his cigarettes back I became tense and emotional. That's when I knew this movie took a moral toll on me. Best intrigued movie ever.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
419,alexmatte,A rare moment in cinema when everything goes well and every imaginable talent improbably comes together in unison to create a masterpiece,10,11 December 2017,"A long-established legend such as this movie deservedly is needs no more reviews. Watching it again recently after many years, however, prompts me to add it to my reviews here.Many Oscars seem to have been randomly awarded even in much more gilded ages of cinema than the last thirty years. How The Third Man could possibly have only won a single Oscar (deservedly, in 1951, for Robert Krasker's cinematography) has to remain an eternal mystery and embarrassment to the ""Academy"" - at least Cannes got it right there for that film in 1949. OFOTCNest is a prominent exception, fully deserving to sweep the major Oscars, in 1976 - or in ANY year, even more deservedly than It Happened One Night, in 1935... and certainly more so than the fairly mediocre but amazingly-awarded Silence of the Lambs, in 1992.As with all the greatest films, OFOTCNest is distinguished by an unforgettable (though not very prominent, eerily piping in at the beginning and end of the film) musical score, by exceptional casting and acting performances, and - what's markedly lacking in most films - an unforgettable ending. And the story of its making, involving the full cooperation of an enlightened real-life psychiatric institution and its clinical director, is awesome too.The performances of some of the actual inmates and of a brilliantly disturbed Danny DeVito are standouts, just as Nicholson's and Fletcher's are legendary and defining, and the artistic vision that was required in obtaining such excellence from the entire cast says plenty about the genius of director Milos Forman.Brilliant as Michael Douglas is as an actor, I doubt anybody could point to a greater achievement than his as a producer of this risky project. Who wouldn't feel eternally successful in their life simply in total to have had such a role in the making of this masterpiece?Of course, the world only swings between extremes. The archaic national mental health policy of inhuman institutionalization that this movie scathingly criticizes was - largely as a result of this very film - soon after terminated, merely releasing inmates onto the streets and condemning them to sleep under bridges.Like The Third Man, this is a rare moment in the complicated art of cinema in which everything goes right, and every imaginable talent improbably comes together in unison to create an undying masterpiece.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
420,Spider-52,"Without exception, the finest motion picture ever made.",10,12 August 1999,"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Jack Nicholson's performance is a searing tour de force that I consider to be the finest movie performance of all time.  Every supporting role is superb, most notably Louise Fletcher and a small but solid performance from Brad Dourif.Milos Forman's direction has a sort of gritty, documentary-style texture to it that gives the film just that little extra effectiveness.  The writing and dialog are perhaps the greatest in any film, with Nicholson delivering the film's most memorable lines (and there are many).  Every single scene is incredible in its own right, from McMurphy's re-enactment of the World Series to a joy ride on a fishing boat.  The final 30 minutes or so are absolutely staggering in their emotional intensity.If you have not yet seen this film, stop reading now and literally run to your local video store to rent it.  It is the most powerful, emotional, and involving movie ever put on film. See it, for it is without exception the finest motion picture ever made.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
421,Science_Fantasy_Guy,Flawless as an example of cinematic craft; unparalleled as an examination of corruption and how the mind works.,10,24 January 2010,"Released in 1975, Milos Forman's staggering film of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (adapted from Ken Kesey's equally brilliant semi-autobiographical 1962 novel) remains arguably the most relevant, accurate and powerful cinematic analysis of mental illness and corruption of power ever. It became just the second film ever to win the five major Academy Awards and was shown in Swedish cinemas for 12 years, which remains a national record in Sweden. Yet at the time the critical reception of the movie was still rather uneven (though deservedly that's improved over time), and Kesey vehemently refused to watch it as the story wasn't told from the point of view of Chief Bromden like it is in the novel.But what a film it is. After fighting for more than a decade to get the film made, producers Saul Zaentz and Michael Douglas (largely influenced by his father Kirk, who first acquired the film rights) had developed a strong affection for the story and once they had the financing they hired Czech director Milos Forman, the only director they encountered who shared their affection for Kesey's story. It isn't hard to see why, and as Forman spent the majority of his formative years and the early part of his career living under a totalitarian regime in Czechoslovakia after losing his parents in Auschwitz and Buchenwald as a child, Forman proved to be the perfect director to bring to the screen this story of silenced and very often misunderstood people existing in such circumstances who are slowly inspired to take a stand. Forman's direction is a thing of sheer mastery: tender yet honest in the sequences involving McMurphy's (Jack Nicholson) relationship with his fellow patients, raw in the sequences revolving around Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a usually calm but unknowingly corrupt and dictatorial woman who thinks she's doing what's in her patients' best interests and how she runs the ward and treats her patients, unflinching but sympathetic in its depiction of the ravages mental illnesses inflict on those who suffer from them, and all those qualities in the emotionally draining yet tremendously inspiring climax. Forman simply outdid himself here.But of course, every director is only as good (or bad) as the cast and crew they have to work with, and Forman's is flawless. Starting with the cast, he garners three of the most perfect displays of acting in cinematic history. McMurphy was the role Nicholson was born to play, and while he's a force of nature in the scenes involving McMurphy squaring off with Nurse Ratched, his more subtle scenes where he depicts the changes in him caused by the institution and his fellow patients in whom he provoked a change first are the ones that truly assure him a place among the true all-time legends (and the fact that he and Forman had a fiery relationship just makes his turn even more unbelievable). He's never been better before or since, and as brilliant as Al Pacino is in Dog Day Afternoon I'm firmly in Team McMurphy. Fletcher is every bit as good as the sadistic Nurse Ratched who tries to clip the free-spirited McMurphy's wings – it's an incredibly controlled performance, because while a lesser actress would have played her like an overbearing battleaxe, Fletcher is chilling because of her sincerity. Yet even despite how truly frightening Fletcher is she also manages to make the viewer feel a small amount of sympathy for Nurse Ratched by simultaneously playing her as a woman who's really just trying to do her job even though she's oblivious to the negative impact she's had on those in her care. Also, Brad Dourif pulls off one of the most astounding supporting turns in movie history as Billy Bibbitt, a stuttering (and thus exploited) teenager who proves to be the catalyst for Nurse Ratched's downfall at the hands of McMurphy, and William Redfield (who sadly died shortly after the movie was released) and Sydney Lassick are also superb as the schizophrenic Harding and bipolar Cheswick.Bo Goldman and Laurence Hauben's screenplay is one of the few that, I think it can be said, against which most others are measured. With great eloquence, insight, power and intelligence (and no cheese or sentimentality) they collectively crafted a screenplay that never waters down the ugly things that are mental illnesses, gives the viewer/reader a greater understanding of the effects (both negative and also positive) they have on those who suffer from them and also what causes corruption, it celebrates the rebels of the world who fight the establishment for the greater good as well as themselves, and perhaps most importantly it shows the mentally ill not as not as complete caricatures (because often such depictions of the mentally ill are, it must be said, accurate ones), but as people who can achieve anything (even if they need a little guidance).Two other enormous bright spots are Jack Nitzsche's amazing score which is somehow mesmerizing in its musical simplicity (and it surely would've scooped the movie's sixth Oscar had Jaws come out in any other year) and Haskell Wexler's beautifully evocative cinematography.Countless similar films before and since have explored rebellion against corrupt authority figures and the inner workings of the human mind what makes us all tick, but One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest will forever be the cinematic depiction of life in a ""loony bin"" (as McMurphy puts it) to end them all. After more than thirty years it remains an absolutely flawless, definitive, knockout masterpiece, and one of the five most deserving Best Picture Oscar winners of all. And is that the greatest climax of a Best Picture winner ever or is that the greatest climax of a Best Picture winner ever?",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
422,JamesDean1955,Jack Nicholson makes Hollywood well aware of his presence,10,15 December 2010,"This film I found to be very entertaining, as well as interesting in its ending. Jack Nicholson makes his presence and unique style well known with the debut of this film. He plays a character that plays a character which takes true talent on behalf of the actor. He pretends to be crazy to get out of working, and ends up in an institute where things just get more crazy. His ability to capture the attention of the audience is very prevalent. He brings a certain charisma to the screen, one that makes you truly identify with his character. The cinematography in the film is also great, a lot of the shots are actually taken in an old broken down mental institution, which give the film more verisimilitude. Certain camera angles that play off Nicholsons character are also very good, they give you a solid perspective of what he is actually seeing while being in a looney bin. The ending I think carries a certain message along with it, it leaves the viewer very uneasy as the credits role. I think that it was artfully constructed to invite the viewer to think beyond Nicholsons humor in the movie and investigate a moral issue.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

This is probably the greatest character film ever made, every actor in this put in a brilliant performance from Jack Nicholson (R.P McMurphy) to Louise Fletcher (Nurse Ratched) and from Danny DeVito (Martini) to Brad Dourif (Billy Bibbit). It was the ground breaking film for a lot involved a lot becoming household names, although some becoming tight cast as well. When McMurphy arrives at the mental institution as a convict pleading insanity he brings with him life/chaos into an environment of peace/control. Himself and Nurse Ratched soon are at loggerheads over her control which she is willing to achieve through manipulation at its worst just to have a peaceful ward, versus his other extreme of chaos bringing life into the ward whether it be harmful or not to the patients. Throughout the film we really don't know if McMurphy is faking being insane or is he the real deal which adds to the brilliance of this film. It is a tear jerker for those inclined and you have to be in the mood to sit down and watch this story unravel pure brilliance.

R.P. McMurphey is put in a mental hospital, where he must rebel against the evil establishment. A classic story of will versus the meanies.

I think that's what lends the film it's whole flavor, but if you be looking in the genre, this is satisfying in a different (more life-affirming way). I wouldn't call it a personal favorite, but I would call it superb work.It's also anti-psychiatry, like myself, and I gotta give it that. Comparing other mental hospital films to this is unfair, however. Besides the setting, I cannot recall a single mental hospital film out there with the guts to be like this film. This film totally is a different animal from something like say ""Girl, Interrupted"" or ""The Snake Pit"" or many other films which have bits like that.

He makes friends with lunatics and starts his own circle of admiration within the hospital, much to the dismay of Nurse Ratched, the central authority figure in the story and one of the greatest movie villains ever.The movie exists to show not only how corrupt and poorly-constructed society's approach to the ""mentally unstable"" is, but it creates characters that we have all met in life and shows how the McMurphy-like figure that we all wish we had fights for freedom of choice and basic human rights. In addition to the movie's great spirit, the acting is fantastic. Jack Nicholson is at his best and Danny DeVito can be seen in his very first acting role ( which he absolutely triumphs in ). And of course, there's the unforgettable Chief Bromden. The directing by Milos Forman is very well-done, as the camera-work is excellent and follows the pace of the movie perfectly in how it is used.

438,colebt33-780-179547,Absolutely groundbreaking,10,17 September 2010,"Considering it's one of the only three movies that has succeeded in taking home all five of the most significant Academy Awards your expected to get something good, fortunately there are no disappointments when watching this movie. 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is a wonderful, powerful piece of cinema that after 35 years of sitting in video store selves still manages to set the standards for all other movies.Cuckoo's Nest tells the story of a fierce rivalry that takes place inside a mental institution that will ultimately change how the patients view the world as well as themselves. Randle McMurphy, played by the iconic Jack Nicholson, is an incredibly high spirited former prison inmate who has been sent to the mental hospital for examination due to suspicion of being psychotically ill. After noticing that the patients don't seem to have any sense of life enjoyment he attempts to raise their spirits and lighten up the tone deaf building by introducing new games, new places, and new perspectives. However this does not compute with Ms Ratched, the head nurse of the institution, and of one the greatest movie villains of all time.Played by the talented Louise Fletcher, Ms Ratched is the authority of the institution, she runs the house and she calls the shots, and while she doesn't really show it, she enjoys being queen. That's why only when Randle McMurphy came along and started to mess with her schedule did things really begin to heat up.At the very start of the movie when you are given a brief look into what the institution is like (the bleak colour, the haunting music, and the sound of the words over the monitor ""medication time""), when Ms Ratched walks down the hall way, with every person she passes saying ""good morning Ms Ratched"", you can tell that this is her sanctuary and that she likes it. So when Randle McMuprhy stepped out of the car and expressed his loud, excitingly enthusiastic attitude for the first time, great interest arose into how this very disruptive man was going to react to the institution and Ms Ratched's policies about routine and schedule, obviously not yell.The whole foundation of this movie is based on the negative energy portrayed between these two very different figures. It creates pretty much all of the drama and beauty of the film. Some of the most powerful moments found in this movie were the example of the fierce difference in opinion between Ms Ratchet and McMurphy. Take for example when McMurphy requested changing the schedule to watch the ""World Series"" and Ms Ratched refused. He angrily sat down on the couch in front of the TV, and started to mime a commentary on an imaginary baseball game. All of the patients then sat down with him and also began to chime in, screaming and chanting as if they were watching the real thing. That was one of my most favourite scenes out of the whole movie.The role of Randle McMurphy is a career defining part for Jack Nicholson. Over the years I have seen him play many great characters in many great movies. Detective Gittes in ""Chinatown"", Jack Torrance in ""The Shining"", Melvin Udall in ""As Good as it Gets"" are all great examples of Nicholson's amazing acting talent. However his portrayal of the high spirited simpleton trying to get a group of given up patients to embrace life is a heart-warming performance unlike any other. His character is so lovable that when you get to the part of where ""they""(the crew at the institution) have finally taken down McMurphy, you can't help but feel for him.It's hard not to give focus to the lead performances, because let's face it, who really cares about those faceless extra's in the background. But the supporting roles in this movie are undeniable. Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and Brad Dourif are all absolutely breathtaking. If it were up to me, I would give each and every one of them an Academy Award.Milo's Forman has given us a truly spectacular film.

There is no exaggeration that One flew over cuckoo nest is one of the best movie Hollywood ever produced. As Kirk Douglas read the story and wasted no time in buying it He was so exhilarated from the story that he produced a play of One flew over cuckoo nest, but it didn't get that appreciation but it was his young son who fulfilled his dream of turning this story into movie after 9years .The stage was set and the project was given to not so famous Czech native director Milos Forman. The role of semi psychotic outspoken agitating Randle P Mcmurphy was given to Jack Nicholson. Personally I think no one could perform that role so perfectly than Jack had done. He was marvelous and outstanding and very much convincing .All the cast consisted of reputed actors as Danny Devito, Brad Dourif and Christopher Lloyds (debutant) as Jack's psychotic mates Nurse Ratched is considered most coldly monstrous villains in film history. Louise Fletcher intelligently acted as a soft spoken villainous nurse Ratched .No doubt that the movie kept you stimulating throughout and it's hard to forget the impression that it makes on your minds for a long time. One of its kind and must see movie. Won five major category Oscars including best picture, best actor, best actress, best director and best adopted screenplay.

I think the movie also trivializes the severity of mental illness that leads the people to be institutionalized in the first place as well. I think Ratched is a rather unfair stereotype of the seemingly joyless, sensible shoes, marmish, rigid, head nurse who is portrayed to be a straight up villain on a petty power trip. Chaos = good, order = bad: this is all just sloppy anti-establishment fluff.And the idea that the institutionalized mentally ill just need a field trip, booze, and hookers to enrich their lives is insulting.Then the final plot point where Randle gets lobotomized for daring to bring booze and girls in and defy Nurse Ratched, defies all credibility.I think the movie does a real disservice to the mentally ill as well as the psychiatric field in general.

This movie showed what a mental institute is about and it shows you the real thing but with Jack Nicholson it makes it interesting to what.

I believe the technical term for this sort of movie is 'crowd pleaser', and it's easy to see why it won so many Oscars. There's redemption, there's hardships to overcome, there's comradery. The predictability and dumbing down is rising to levels that makes the food inside me almost rise too.Case in point: the Chief. Will Sampson played deaf and dumb convincingly, until Murphy found out that he wasn't deaf and dumb at all. From that point on the Chief had metamorphosed into somebody who could hear, and the movie viewers were implicitly invited to pretend like the nursing staff hadn't noticed. Every time something was said, you could see the Chief react. But only for the viewers' sakes, of course. Wouldn't want them to not understand what had happened.

There's been some great ones and then some brilliant ones, but no film really 'did' it for me. I have my favorites like 'Forrest Gump' and 'The Shawashank Redemption', but again, that's not a lot. Cuckoo just did it for me.It's been about 30 years (if not exact) to when this masterpiece came out. As a mainstream success, it won many awards, including 5 Oscars. One of those 5, was for Best Picture. That was why I decided to see this film. It came on this website as a high-rated classic. To that point, I was not surprised at how much this film affected me.'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is an unforgettable classic that affected me lots. It contains fascinating performances, an excellent screenplay, and great direction, not to mention a joyous soundtrack.The performances in this film are so worth the watch. Jack Nicholson gives his career-best performance as 'McMurphy'. He delivers his soul towards his masterful performance and demonstrates an advanced understanding towards this film. His other films don't reach the heights of this one. Loise Fletcher, on the other hand, gives a brilliant performance as the 'nurse'. She lawfully is completely different, self disciplined and serious. Both these performances cause a dramatic on- screen battle. For me, its Jack Nicholson who wins.An excellent screenplay is orchestrated throughout this film. Michael Douglas hasn't ever done such a wonderful job. This film, however, is disheartening at times, but also heartwarming, forming a nice combination. When a film deals with a serious subject matter, but has a hilarious tone to it, not to make it depressing.Lastly, the soundtrack of this film is highly praise. The joyous moments of this film flow very well this soundtrack. Unbelievable, indeed...Overall, this film is certainly worth the watch.

Nurse Ratched also does a wonderful job despite being a bigot. There are many scenes involving loyalty, humor, wit, and drama. It is a well-rounded film as a result.

I suppose it was alright, but with all the praise it has received (including being so high on IMDB's list), I expected more than I got.The main problem I had with the movie was that I didn't care for the characters at all. Sure, there were some scenes that were interesting and provided a nice glimpse into one character or the other, but, for the most part, I couldn't find a way to sympathize with any of them. Jack Nicholson did alright in this film, but, at times, I actually disliked his character and what he was doing. As for the other people in the ward, they did a good job, but, again, I just didn't sympathize with them. Louise Fletcher, however, did a superb job as Nurse Ratchet; her icy demeanor was perfect. Again, though, I just didn't, well... dislike her. I didn't find the plot, flow, or atmosphere to be strong enough to make up for the apathy I felt towards the characters (and one would guess that, in a movie such as this, it's critical to one's enjoyment that they care about the characters). While there were some great scenes in the movie, those scenes just weren't enough for me to really like the movie.

Everyone knows about Nicholson's charismatic turn as McMurphy, the supposedly sanest person in the asylum but there's so much more here if one digs beneath the surface and straight into the secondary characters. Where Brad Dourif excels as the impossibly sensitive and introverted youth unable to take a stand on anything. Besides him we get all sorts of disturbed conditions ranging from people who frequent the asylum as refuge from their lives to others who are utterly unable to deal with the world in the most basic of ways. So while taking this as the saga of one man while he struggles to remain sane is affecting enough, couple it with the myriad shades of humanity that surround and interact with him and the end result is a thoroughly envolving experience.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
464,eliaaminii,Perfection DOES exist...,10,10 December 2020,"Based on the novel Ken Kesey, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest centers around a criminal named McMurphy who, in an attempt to escape spending more time at prison, pleads insanity for his crimes and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution.
First off, the plot is extraordinary. Personally speaking, I hadn't seen this kind of movie to offer the same joy and meaning through its phenomenal storyline before. Here the story should not be valued only at face value. Though the story is portraying a crazy guy rebelling against some crazier nurses, getting deeper into the plot, it somehow offers a model of our society. There are symbols everywhere; for example, McMurphy is kind of a guy who enters a group of people and changes their perspective about their surrounding. Or the nurse behaves on behalf of cold leaders or simply bosses as their thorough concentration is sticking to some stupid schedule while taking others emotional needs for granted. McMurphy depicts a personality who is ready to sacrifice himself for his beloved ones, and his great goal it is to make them wake up from the lies they are living in. That being said, no need to mention that Chief is symbolized as the majority of people in a society who, in spite of the strength they have, stay quiet and pretend to be deaf and idiot. Unbelievably beautiful it is to see how McMurhpy is trying his best to make this fooled people happy, both mentally and physically.
Without any doubt, the cast is perfection, especially Jack Nicholson, whose phenomenal performance pushes the envelope. However, I'm of the opinion that it wasn't his best performance ever as his job in Shining was mind-blowing. And about his character, McMurphy, the insanity portrayed in his character is mild enough not to be necessary for him to be in that place, nevertheless that's not a justification to consider him completely healthy and I think it was one of the points, that alongside the well executed performance of Nicholson, divides opinions. Plus, the other cast team performed a really good job as well. To be honest, once I though they had indeed hired some patients as the performance they offered were extremely realistic.
The highlight of this movie was its appalling tragedy. Let's face the fact; we all somehow expected something sad to happen to our protagonist. The wild and aggressive looks of the nurse Ratched and the warren were all whispering about getting closer to their last resort. However, having been a terrible tragedy, then there are people inspired by characteristics of our hero and ready to set themselves free from the cage the institution has made for them.
It's never enough talking about this masterpiece and all the words have already been said before. To simply put, an incredible picture certainly it is and hardly you can find one single error. A must see for everyone.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
465,jminer,A good film but lacks the paranoid dimension of the novel,9,18 April 2001,"Ken Kesey's novel is narrated by Chief Bromden, who reminisces lyrically about the Columbia River country where he grew up.  He also has insights into what is going on in the hospital, such as microphones in the broom handles, and machinery within the walls. But, then, he is a patient in a mental hospital. So that's our narrator, a paranoid schizophrenic. One of the features of film is that the camera is objective.  A few directors have tried to create a subjective camera, most obviously by giving it the point of view of the main character or even the narrator.  I seem to remember an Alan Ladd vehicle, The Lady in the Lake I think it was.  But audiences generally trust the camera's objectivity. So instead of getting this story from a paranoid schizophrenic mental patient, the film gives it to us as objective truth. That the central message of freedom comes across is a tribute to Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher in particular. But there is a dimension missing, and to my mind it is Kesey's implication that America is a madhouse, and the only sane people might be those considered by the society to be mad.  Maybe others see that implication but, having read the book before the film was released, I find the certainty of the narration undermines that dimension.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Being an anti-establishment type, he continuously butts heads with Nurse Ratchet, and the struggle for the autonomy of the patients escalates.The film is shot in a clear, straightforward, and compelling manner, eschewing complicated cinematography for clarity and simplicity.

The simplicity this film exhibits is amazing for such a complex plot.Randall Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is a troubled criminal sent from a work farm with a history of assault and statutory rape. Half the time he is there, McMurphy is out making friends with the other patients. The other half, he bides his time plotting against the oppressive Miss Ratched.Miss Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) shows no sign of villainy on the surface, but in her eyes, you see the fire which makes her tick. Running a strict routine, she exhibits many of the same characteristics as Angela Lansbury's performance as Eleanor Iselin in ""The Manchurian Candidate""- kind on the surface, evil in the mind-and makes you unsure whether or not to sympathize with her when McMurphy attempts to strangle her, or to watch her with disgust as she leads Billy Bibbet to his suicide.Mental patients in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" are people too; their minds still work, they can participate in group therapy without looking like an idiot; they have the same cognitive abilities as anyone else. These are accurate depictions of people in a metal hospital through the performances of Nicholson, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Vincent Schiavelli.This film is a masterpiece mainly because of the performance of Louise Fletcher as Miss Ratched. If you are astounded by this performance, then please check out Angela Lansbury's in ""The Manchurian Candidate.""",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Allow them to conform with their fellow ""nonconformists""The movie is terribly perfect.  Acting and characters are awesome.  Nicholson truly at his best, no question there.  And Fletcher plays her role flawlessly.  She's supposed to be a boring, impassive nurse -- duh!  The supporting cast is just as deserving of kudos.  Based on a GREAT and classic book, probably one of the few movies that does any justice, along with To Kill A Mockingbird and the Grapes of Wrath.This movies combines humor with poignancy and emotion.

476,kraljevic411,Sad True,9,12 October 2016,"First I'd like to say how unbelievable it is finding out the concept of mental facilities. No matter this movie was filmed over 40 years ago, I still think it's mostly applicable to methods that are being used in modern age as well. I suggest it's much easier to give a patient ""a happy pill"" to do all the work. I find it very disturbing, especially a part where they put electricity through your brain. Like that can do any good for a patient. In my opinion, those people weren't patients at all when they first arrived. I think it's applicable to present situation when people are sent to these madhouses. They arrive mostly like Mac did. I definitely wouldn't call him crazy. Those people just need someone to talk with, someone who can understand their feelings and help them solve any sorts of problems in a healthy way. But it's much easier to make a plant out of a human and announce he is insane, isn't it? I felt throughout the whole movie like they didn't even want their patients to recover from their, so called, madness. You convince yourself in that kind of environment that you actually are crazy, especially when you follow their rules and schedules. The littlest confrontations and changes of rules shock the whole system. That's exactly what Mac has done. Anyway, I didn't even feel like I was watching a 40-year-old movie because of its timeless thematic. Well, I only realized it because Jack Nicholson is not so young anymore.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
477,rich920215,Jack Nicholson destroyed this movie,2,28 December 2006,"In the book, McMurphy was a lovable rogue, Falstaffian in character. Jack Nicholson turned McMurphy into a stupid jerk a**hole, not the least bit likable. Besides which, McMurphy was a big hulk of a guy and Jack Nicholson is a tiny little wimp guy not the least bit like McMurphy. In the book McMurphy fought Nurse Ratchet because he had the best interests of the inmates at heart and she was a sadistic monster and deserved a comeuppance. In the movie he fought her just because he was a jerk. She came across much more like a decent nurse looking out for the inmates, undeserving of McMurphy's torments. Nicholson's McMurphy could never have torn up the sink and thrown it out the window, he's just too small for that. The book's McMurphy was big enough to make such an act believable. I was so disappointed by this movie I quit seeing Jack Nicholson movies for several years. As I thought about all the Jack Nicholson movies I'd seen over the years, starting with Easy Rider, I realized that in every movie his character was an a**hole. That made me think maybe Jack Nicholson is really an a**hole. Then he shined like a star in About Schmidt. I loved that one. So I will now go see Jack Nicholson movies again. I guess age has improved him. Separate from Nicholson's McMurphy ruinations, I really missed the part where the chief's hand grew gigantic in anticipation of using it as a monster weapon as he contemplated some taunts. The book made that a great scene. The movie just ignored it. Too bad, it would have been good. Not that I can tell you how to film such a mental struggle in the chief's head but I'm sure some creative Hollywood type could figure out a good way to do it.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

This film is the representative of American social and political films in the 1970s. Director milos forman excelled not only in his portrayal of the romance of the original, but also in his delivery of a rebellious theme in classic Hollywood language.

481,SenoritaTorres,Jack's well-deserved Oscar-winning role is top drawer in my book!,10,17 November 2006,"Is it any wonder that this film won Jack Nicholson his first Oscar? What a performance, I couldn't rave about it enough.The main thing I loved about this movie was how it was actually filmed in a mental institution, with actual mental patients. I thought this really reflected on the actors' performances, and gave it that extra element of realism.Nicholson's McMurphy is quite possibly one of the most interesting characters I've ever watched in a film. He has wit, charisma and no doubt charm but you can also sense real emotion there. He's not afraid to speak his mind and you can almost sense his desperation to be liked by his fellow patients. He's somewhat a force of nature and he likes to think he's being influential to the others.Louise Fletcher was a fantastic contrast to Jack, playing the disdainful Miss Ratched effortlessly. You could really sense the hostility between her and Nicholson. Nurse Ratched has been respected and feared in the hospital for a long while-that is obvious-and when McMurphy comes into the ward and disrupts her regime it knocks her off balance and causes her to resent him. However, she doesn't outwardly show her hatred of him through words, she shows it through her actions. What I admired about Fletcher's performance was how she always managed to sustain that cool, icy exterior throughout, and it made you never really know what she was thinking. Then her Nurse Ratched would do, or say something, or have a reaction to something that completely shocks you. It truly says something about Fletcher's acting ability when she makes you hate this woman so much for the way in which she treats the patients (and the scary thing is, she thinks she's doing them good) and yet still want to understand her motivation and why she does what she does. The horrific way in which she taunts Billy after she finds him with Candy is devastating, and you can't take your eyes off the screen. Nicholson's reactions to her quiet taunts and his expression towards Billy, a mixture of confusion and pity, makes one of the best scenes of the film.One of the key elements of 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is that it is supposed to imply that McMurphy represents freedom in the inmates' eyes. They may not be committed to the ward, most of them, but they still feel like they cannot escape this dull, dreary routine of group discussions and card games. McMurphy brings life into the ward, he makes the patients see that they're not crazy, that they do belong in the outside world, that they're just like everybody else outside on the street. The scene in which Nicholson tries to reach out to the inmates and explain this to them brings tears to the eyes and makes you laugh at the same time-very rare in a movie, but in turn makes powerful drama.There are so many moments, and so many quotes, I love in this movie, particularly the whole World Series sequence. There's just so much energy in the character of McMurphy, you can't help but be transfixed. The only drawback being after I watched the film I found it hard to shut off from some of the more emotional scenes, however, I still find it one of the most effective and touching films I have seen.The fantastic Milos Forman, Michael Douglas and of course Nicholson and Fletcher well deserved their Oscars. Best Picture of 1975? I would say so!",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
482,samsq22,Nicholson makes the movie,8,11 May 2012,"This American Drama is definitely another history maker. It takes an unbelievable topic and turns it into a gripping story. A criminal who is sentenced to time in jail convinces everyone that he is indeed insane and therefore sent to a mental institution. He thinks it will be all comfy and cozy but he sure is in for a ""surprise. What's not interesting about that?! It causes the audience to love it even when it's wrong. It is outrageous but it works, mostly because of Jack Nicholson's wit. Nicholson's part really makes the movie, and although I haven't seen an overload of his movies, I think this is the best part he has played. The movie ends with a ""downer"" but it works and life goes on.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
483,iam_moriya,"One flew east, one flew west....",10,18 August 2005,"""One flew over the Cuckoo's nest"" is, with no doubt, one of the best movies out there. It is the peak of the New Hollywood era, with The Godfather as it's only equal. At least, thats my humble opinion.The story is about Randall Patrick McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson in one of the best performances of all time. He is a smalltime criminal who is sent to a mental institution. While there he soon turns the place upside down. You see, McMurphy is a free spirit and soon becomes a bitter rival of Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher. The big nurse is nothing short of a tyrant corrupted by power. She rules her patients with an iron hand, that is until Randall enters the place.Both Fletcher and Nicholson got awarded for their roles but in my opinion all the actors are magnificent, even if those two are the ones who shine the brightest.But this movie is not only great because of it's actors. It is a great story worthy of being told about human rights, the importance of freedom and how power corrupts. But that is only the way I see it, you may have a different view. Any way, there is no reason for you not to see this movie. It is a great cinematic tale. And the fact that it has one of the greatest endings scenes of all time doesn't hurt either.""But at least I tried, God dammit. At least I did that"" - McMurphy",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

485,coolfasho-1,Epic and Beautiful,10,24 May 2007,"There is nothing that I can say or add that will testify to the greatness of this cinematic masterpiece. Many of the viewers here, considerably older and more familiar with writing critical reviews have already decked this work of art with all the glistening lace of high-brow comments it deserves. Still my concise and modestly candid opinion can nudge itself comfortably in the microcosm of viewer appreciation. I can start by saying that I saw this film two years ago and although I haven't seen it since, the theme and acting is so livid and memorable that it's as if I saw it yesterday. Ken Kessey's novel provides the essence of the story which is beautifully woven and crafted into first person through the perspective of Chief Bromden. Fans of the novel are not only delighted by the crisp, descriptive rendering of Chief's character but also of the characters of the patients of the ward of whom protagonist Randall Patrick McMurphy consists. He at once rejects the policies of the ward which are distinctly aimed at subjecting the patients to a systematic, vegetative mode of life from which there is no escaping. There were scenes in the film when tears welled from my eyes mainly when the other patients acknowledged that they were free to leave the ward at any time, but were afraid. The famous 'you should be bird-doggin' chicks and bangin' beaver' quote from McMurphy after he is stunned by patients' divulgence made me smile at its humor but sympathetic towards his situation.The ward staff are also beautifully rendered and at once realistically strict and unflinching in their tempers. The chief of staff, Nurse Ratched is the most implacable of the ward employees as she does her best to suppress the freedoms of the patients to as great an extent as possible. McMurphy rivals her, or as the book indicates, is at war in a battle field over her strictures and insinuations. The climax of their dispute seems to end when McMurphy is strangling the life out of her with his hands like vice grips delving her throat until the blood flows to her face and cheeks. At this juncture, there seemed a remote chance that McMurphy had won the battle, but here, Ken Kessey shows Nurse Ratched's despotic wield of authority. Although it seems destined, the death of McMurphy's mind through lobotomy and then his physical death at the hands of the chief conclude the film on an idyllically sad note.Randall Patrick McMurphy's fictitious existence is just a small example of the mavericks in society who have risen up against powers which threatened to be far greater than their own. They have stood at the doorstep of impossibility and shattered it through courage and forbearance.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
486,leviathinin,mmmm...Yummy,10,10 June 2000,"I saw this film recently...and what superb excellence. I am convinced now that Jack Nicholson (next to Dustin Hoffman) is the finest actor pulled out of America ever. He remarkably adopts the role of Randal.P. McMurphy ( a con who had the idea that spending time in a mental institution would be easier that fufilling his custodial sentence) The Irony is that McMurphy started off sane when he entered the institution and ended up being labotomised If you use you eyes you spot other famous thespians in that film like Louise Fletcher as the soft spoken but cruel Nurse Ratchit, Danny Devito, Brad Dourif and Christopher Lloyd also make noticable appearances as some of the inmates.

The story is very very dark, but the movie has its funny parts. Some scenes actually had me laughing pretty hard. I don't think mental illness is a laughing matter what so ever but there were a few pretty funny scenes. This movie won best actor, best actress, best director, and best picture. I have not seen many movies from 1975, but i can definitely see why this movie walked away from the academy awards that year like a champ. Everything about the film just wowed me. Especially the acting. The patients were great supporting actors and they were so good at making me believe they were mentally ill. it has both Christopher Lloyd and a much younger looking Danny Devito. I didn't even recognize Devito at first. Lloyd was hilarious. To me i found this movie kind of scary. To me, movies like this are more scary to me than a modern horror movie. Let me just say that this is a perfect example why i do not like hospitals. It does not take place in a hospital, it takes place in a looney bin but i see hospitals as the same way when I'm staying in them, this institution in the movie though is so messed up it makes me cringe in certain scenes. Those scenes terrify me. The movie was great and I highly recommend it to everyone. I do not see how someone could not like this movie.

491,joey1117,Wow... what a film,10,10 December 2006,"One flew Over the Coo- Koo's Nest is the powerful story of one man, who gets thrown into a mental hospital and makes a difference n the patients lives. This person is Randle McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson. Randle, who is an ex-convict being put in a mental hospital, tries to just be himself in the place and tries to break out. He has some smart remarks made to the nurse of the place, Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) who is a cold nurse. A nurse who is not tempted into doing anything and I mean anything, unless it's ""her way."" The nurse's character is still considered one of the coldest characters in movie history.The movie has a lot of action and always keeps you entertained. It has a lot of interaction between the characters, which is good, because you get to know them well. You see the change undergoing between the patients there after they meet Randle, and start rebelling against Nurse Mildred Ratched. It shows how they like to disagree with Nurse Mildred. One of the biggest characters to change was the character Chief. He went form doing almost nothing to moving around and even speaking but only speaking to Jack Nicholson's character Randle McMurphy.The director of the movie, Milos Forman, had different actors in mind for certain parts of the film, made the right decision in the actors that he chose. The cast is very well casted, and most of them went on to so other movies, Including Danny Devito, who got his start in this film. Devito would later star in the hit TV series Taxi. Christopher Lloyd, who also appears in the movie, also starred in this series with Devito.Though based on the book, the movie almost butchers it, according to the books author, Ken Kesey. He was saying that he would never watch the movie in its entirety. This is surprising due to the fact that the movie launched may careers and won 5 Oscars and was the seco9nd movie to win all of the main categories. The film in addition won 6 golden globes, in many of the categories it won Oscars for. The films success makes it one of the greatest films made, even by today's standards. It even ranks #12 on IMDb.com's top 250 films. The movie is very, very powerful.The ending has big twist and you probably wont believe it to be true, but its really the ending that makes the movie what it is today. Without the way it ends, The movie would be next to nothing as a movie, and probably a waste of time for you to see. But that is why Milos foreman is a good director, and Jack Nicolson a good actor.One flew Over the CooKoo's Nest is one of those rare movie that you watch and instantly fall in love with this one. It is a powerful and moving film that will forever capture you heart and really change you. It makes you see what's on the inside. This movie introduces a lot of talent, like Jack Nicholson, Danny Devito, and Christopher Lloyd. It's surprising how a movie like this isn't #1, but it good for where it's at.

In spite of his violent tendencies, his laziness and his cunning, he had a burning heart, otherwise he would not have twice delayed his escape from the gateway, leading to his tragic end.

That's when McMurphy violently attacks and starts strangling Nurse Ratchet believing she was responsible for Billys tragic death. Later, you find Nurse Ratchet with a thing around her neck. And you find out that they've taken a piece out of McMurphys body and made him, to put it simple, mindless. So Chief suffocates him with a pillow, knowing now that he can't escape with him.

495,GloreMag,Simply Extraordinary,10,7 February 2010,"Absolutely inspired motion picture. This masterpiece courtesy of Milos Forman, who would later go on to sweep the Oscars with his powerful biopic Amadeus (Mozart), came a year after Jack Nicholsen impressed critics and fans alike in Roman Polanski's Chinatown. For me, Chinatown was heavy, compelling but still lacking in something I can't quite figure out. Maybe it's the fact that I don't particularly respect Polanski as a person nor admire him as a skilled director (I though that The Pianist was probably the most excruciatingly depressing 2 hours of my life). On the contrary, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is an extraordinary feat by Forman, Nicholsen and the whole production team.The film centres on Randle McMurphy, played so well by Nicholsen that it's almost outrageous, who is sentenced to a mental institution with the powerfully ironic fact that he quite simply isn't insane at all. McMurphy is brash, revolutionary and ill-attentive towards the power-hungry and autocratically-driven Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) who appears to shake the patients, who voluntarily admit themselves into the ward with the exception of few, into spineless freaks. However, McMurphy teaches the group of inmates how to rebel and eventually grows quite close to The Chief, who is believed to be unable to speak.Flawlessly provoking the debate whether or not McMurphy is insane or not, Forman engages the audience into observing all of the seemingly insane activities and adventures that he embarks in including escaping from the institution, stealing a bus full of patients and stealing a boat which certainly captured my imagination.Fletcher is excellent in her role of Nurse Ratched (interesting name) where she employs a somewhat dictatorship that crumbles the souls of the patients into a cowardly and pathetic group of men. Her conflict with McMurphy, which bubbles exquisitely throughout the show, is very compelling and equally frustrating as due to the fact that McMurphy suffers a lobotomy, leaving him vegetable-like, therefore leaving the idea that Ratched has emerged victorious in her battle for power with McMurphy. Meh, I don't believe that to be the case, McMurphy still leads an unchangeable impact on the patients and inspires his good friend Chief to escape at the end of the film. A mouthwatering blend of supreme acting ability, a script that flowed effortlessly and admirable efforts in editing and cinematography help one not be at all surprised that this masterpiece swept the Grand Slam at the Oscars (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Screenplay original or adapted.This for me is also Nicholsen's finest hour as although he has impressed me in pretty much everything I have seen him in, this trumps all of his other efforts. Such presence, charisma and energy on screen is dynamite and helps one understand why he is one of the most influential and popular personalities in cinema history.10/10.

499,tony-walton,Bleakest movie - ever,9,21 April 2003,"I watched ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" many years ago but only just re-watched it today on DVD. I've now seen it twice today, once with standard soundtrack and again with the soundtrack consisting of commentary from the director and producers. Frankly I'm disgusted at myself for not seeing this movie more often - this is one of the best pictures of all time, in my opinion. Nicholson has never made a better picture (though I do think that he's made a good living playing McMurphy ever since) and Fletcher epitomises the kind of eveil that goes un-noticed because it's there 'for your own good'. The film is ultimately bleak, though, in its statement that spontenaity and personaity will be punished by destruction - either physical (like Bobby) or by forced conformance (like McMurphy).Forman surely has taken this from his experience behind the Iron Curtain.9/10 - not 10 because of its hopelessness.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

501,abirdnamedloveydovey,disappointing,5,12 August 2021,"As a teenager, i remember thinking this movie was pretty good. Recently i had the pleasure of seeing 'it happened one night' and 'the silence of the lambs', thought i'd make it a trifecta and revisit 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest'. The real tragedy of this film is how the women are portrayed as cruel, overbearing, uneducated, having no voice. That was hard to take. Mcmurphy's crime, statutory rape, is dismissed as if it were nothing. I give this movie 5 stars for great acting. (never saw the sunshine boys, george burns must've been incredible.)
side note, imdb needs to change it's rating system. If 10 movies get a 8.6, for example, all 10 should be at the same position.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
502,mitch_e33,Underwhelming...,6,26 June 2011,"'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' (1975), based on the novel by Ken Kesey and directed by Milos Forman, centers around R.P McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) a prisoner serving time for the statutory rape of a 15 year old, among other things. In an attempt to escape from the work yards in the penitentiary, McMurphy fakes a mental illness, leading to him being admitted into a mental hospital. There, he befriends many of the other patients in the ward and attempts to break them out of the strict and monotonous routine set by Head Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).OK, first of all, it has to be said, I had quite high expectations for this movie. It came highly recommend by both my parents, is number 8 on IMDb's Top 250 list, and won the grand slam at the 1975 Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor and Actress). However, I was left extremely disappointed with this film.While the first 20 minutes seem promising, showcasing Nicholsons immense talent, the film drags for the next hour, trying to convince you to love McMurphy and loathe Nurse Ratchet, unsuccessfully, I will add. Which brings me to my first and largest problem with this film. On the back of my DVD case it states that ""Nurse Ratchet is among the coldly monstrous villains in film history"". Based upon that assessment, I expected numerous unnecessary, unethical punishments, and a complete lack of care for her patients. Well I did not receive that, no instead we got a firm, cold, woman that takes charge of her ward, filled with mentally unstable and perhaps dangerous people, with an iron fist, being nothing but a true reflection of the mental health system at the time. That being said, I am not in anyway completely condoning her behavior. She is far too cold to be an effective nurse and her use of manipulation would not be accepted in today's society. However to asses her as being the one of most wicked, evil, heartless is completely and utter over exaggeration and unfortunately paints the film in a 'State vs Rebel' way.Which leads also to my other major problem with this film. McMurphy, is not likable. At least not to me. He is an arrogant, self-centered 'rebel', who has made the rather laughable decision to get himself committed to this mental hospital as he is tired of the prison work yard. But no, we are supposed to cheer him on in his attempts to rid the ward of rules and boundaries, in other words, 'fight the system'. Perhaps it was 'in' to rebel against the state in the 70's? To me this film reeked of this ideology, spoiling much of it.There are certainly positives to 'One Flew Over' and I can understand on one level why is rated so highly by many critics and audiences. It is well directed, the acting by the two leads, regardless of my objection of the use of their characters, is extremely well done but I do not believe it to be Nicholsons best work, as many praise it to be. There are genuine funny moments to be had and a certain scene revolving around cigarettes is the perfect example of acting at its best. The last 20 minutes is also very well executed and left me somewhat vindicated.Overall however, the particular framing of the 2 leads left me simply annoyed with this film and as such, I was left underwhelmed.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
503,jdganner,A Crazily Good Film (Pun Intended),8,2 February 2008,"One of the coolest films made, I've watched it a fair few times since i was a kid, and have never been bored when re-watching it. It goes to show how good the film was that lots of main actors in it made a success in acting after taking role in this movie, which reminds me about good old cheswick, he made the cuckoo's nest for me i think. Martini was also a great character, I've loved every movie I've seen starring Devito.Jack Nicholson was made for the part as McMurphy, nobody else could have played the part more convincing than he did. To act a film set in a nut house takes an incredible amount of patience from both the directors/actors to learn how to act mental.This film in all aspects was funny, witty, heartfelt, dramatic and quite realistic as all the way through the film you are either mad, laughing, or have a lump in you're throat at something or other.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
504,Get_your_azz_to_Mars,When Jack could act,10,7 May 2014,"It's been about 15 years since I last saw 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and it still retains the power it did the first time I saw it. Few films, even during a Renaissance of American films in the 70s, ever created such rich characters full of vitality and insight. A story about repression, repression of the rebel, repression of belief, and repression of the soul and mind; Milos Forman's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' will make you laugh, will make you ponder, and will leave you with a sense of melancholy. Most of all though, it will make you want to resist - resist anything that represses or stifles the outcasts, the weird geniuses, the 'losers', the Other...even if you ultimately fail in such resistance. The mere act of resisting is a victory - as it was for Randle McMurphy.So much has been written about this landmark film from the incredible performances, the great music, the superb writing, Forman's top-notch direction, that I can't really write anything to build upon what better reviewers have long ago written about this masterpiece. Suffice to say, 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' is an essential film for everyone, for everyone who believes in the power of the individual and belief in a just and fair society.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
505,psikill,One of the three films who won the main 5 Oscars,10,25 June 2003,"In spite of being old, this film will surely capture your attention from the beginning. Situated in a mental institution, a new patient is brought in, R.P.McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who will change things around there. Mrs. Ratched (Louise Flecther) is the sadistic and cold nurse, who takes care of the patients. The clash between the two will promptly start. Directed by Milos Forman (Man on the Moon, Amadeus), the film also stars William Redfield as the interesting Mr Harding, Danny DeVito as Martini and Christopher Lloyd as the angry patient Taber.**##LITTLE SPOYLER DOWN HERE##** Jack Nicholson gives his best in this movie, specially in the scene where he plays cards with other patients, or when he pretends to be watching a baseball match. There is a funny part where Danny DeVito is literally dancing in the basketball court. The ending of the film is truly a classic and dramatic (a little bit shocking too), but a great ending for a great movie. **##END OF SPOILER##**Stunning performances from both Jack Nicholson (The Shining, Chinatown) and Louise Fletcher (The Exorcist II), allows this movie to be a classic. Along with ""It Happened one night"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" this movie received the main 5 Oscars: Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Director, Best Picture and Best Screenplay.

506,dave118118,Timeless,10,3 April 2013,"A stunning story which hits a wide range of emotions. The film really captures the different feelings we would all get if we had to visit one of those places. Very disturbing at times but also done very tastefully. From the moment McMurphy (Nicholson) enters the ward it is clear the type of influence he is going to have on his fellow 'nuts'. At first he seems to mock them but he quickly learns to love them and brings happiness and hope to their lives. The entire cast give perfect performances. It's great to see actors like De Vito and Lloyd performing so brilliantly so early on in their careers. They've all really thought about their characters various traits and acted them out consistently. Brad Dourif (nominated for an Oscar) steals the show towards the end although Nicholson is more than worthy of the Oscar. I've always said The Shining was his best performance but this is easily on par, probably even better. His relationship with 'the chief' becomes a heartwarming part of the story. Nurse Ratched's (Fletcher) authoritative presence always makes you root for the 'nuts'. The way she treats the patients doesn't always seem fair and he role as the 'baddie' becomes clear when she asks to keep McMurphy on the ward. This film swept the Oscars and rightly so. A stone cold classic.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
507,diuscorvus,archetypal,9,20 April 2010,"The opening shot establishes how Forman understands this story. We see sunrise, the natural world, a car drawing in and bringing a man into the story and the ward. This isn't a story about the plunges in and out of madness a la more recent treatments of the mind; madness here should be understood not in the biological sense; the madness that matters is the lack of human spirit. McMurphy is the human spirit, the vitalizing force, the Christ figure who exists so that we may all go on. This is an archetypal story, and notable cinematic treatments in this mold include ""Cool Hand Luke"" and the well-loved ""Shawshank Redemption."" It's interesting to note that King's treatment of Shawshank was very similar to Kesey's novelistic treatment of Cuckoo -- the narration occurs from the POV of the non-Christ figure. Where Forman encounters difficulty, in my opinion, is the transition of the narrative angle from McMurphy, who dominates the film, to Chief, who is his spiritual heir. However, the lack of a clear frame also gives Cuckoo its power: the pieces are clearly laid before us without the safety of the frame. Heart of Darkness comes to mind as a piece that does well in blurring the narrative frame; Keats's La Belle Dame Sans Merci in poetry. This is one of the reasons why Cuckoo is stronger than Shawshank as a film. Also, it is a tragedy.Cuckoo is a tragedy because Billy's death in the end is the result of least utility, just as R&J's deaths were and the double suicide of Antigone and Creon's son. McMurphy's demise is not so tragic -- he is the Christ-figure. Cuckoo is also a tragedy because Billy's death occurs from human hubris: if Ratched had stepped down, if McMurphy had not been so insistent on his domination of men -- a domination we agree with, but a domination nonetheless.Again, Forman is less concerned about madness than about the usage of madness here as an allegory for human lethargy. And the movie shouldn't be overly contextualized in either the sensationalist reading of state mental institutions that was popular in the 60s and 70s, nor as completely as a power play between Ratched and McMurphy. This is an allegorical, archetypal story, and it is both fitting and ironic that it is the most shamanistic character in the film who inherits the earth from McMurphy.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
508,ladyrigby,The Battle of Free Will vs Complete Submission...,10,30 September 2000,"I saw this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and I was amazed at how true the portrayal of the mental health system is in this movie. The way that the head nurse belittles and degrades the patients and turns their minds to pudding is absolutely astonishing. Jack Nicholson does an excellent job of portraying a free-thinking man who refuses to bow down to the system and the nurse, especially. The scenes where they go head-to-head, trying to one-up each other are just amazing. She wants to be able to dominate him and his mind, but he doesn't want to give that up. He sees her as a threat to his free will and she sees him as a threat to the entire system. It's just amazing to see the conflict between the two sides.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
509,chadly86,A masterpiece,10,19 July 2001,"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is my all-time favorite film.  This movie excels on so many levels:  acting, cinematography, storyline, directing, music, and intelligence.  Added together, this is one of the most amazing movies to ever hit the big screen.Jack Nicholson is amazing as McMurphy, who's ""crazy to be in a loony bin like this.""  That loony bin is where the story is told; it is one of isolation, of human fears, of human mind, and of human triumph.  Nicholson has had many great performances, such as Chinatown and The Shining, but this is the movie that made his mark.  He is very convincing as a maybe-crazy, maybe-sane man.Then there is Louise Fletcher as the calm and very consistent Nurse Ratched. Her performance was simply brilliant.  Supporting performances from Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Douriff are also terrific.The storyline is one of thought provocation.  After watching this film, one should (and hopefully will) wonder who was crazy and who was not.  Many of the people were simply scared of society, others couldn't handle their fears, some were legitimately ""out there,"" but who exactly knows?  That is the beauty of this film.  It asks many questions:  What makes one ""crazy""? How has society defined it?  How do we react to it?  What can we do about it?One Flew also contains the best climax to ever be shown on screen.  It is probably the most powerful moment to ever be viewed.  The ending is also tremendous and tremendously performed.Cinematography was excellent and added to the feeling of isolation.  The music was terrific; I recommend owning the soundtrack.  Milos Forman did a tremendous job in bringing everything together to make this film a simple masterpiece.Many people wonder what class this film belongs to:  comedy, drama, or comedy-drama.  This is a question mark because there are elements of both comedy and drama, but it can be viewed, I think, in all three ways/styles. I can definitely say, though, that this film is a classic.Rating:  10/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Every single soul that has worked in this movie has given text book performance. Something that should be documented and be used to teach at acting schools to new generation what acting is all about.. Such is the beauty of performance that the head nurse would make you hate her, the patients would make you sympathize with them and you would be surprised every now and then with the director adding new twists to the act. The direction is superb and that you would be able to judge with the fact that he is able to confine you to just one room in the entire movie and create something new in every scene within that one room.

512,LenaAndBarry,Amazing!,8,13 March 2016,"From the moment R.P McMurphy is admitted into the mental institution, he's instantaneously likable. He's daring, thoughtful, witty, and affable; He's the type of guy that can become friends with anyone, and Jack Nicholson plays him Perfectly!I have 0 complaints with the acting department on this film. The patients were all great, and while they weren't really developed (with the exception of a few), they (most of them) felt like their own thing and were interesting (particularly their reasons for being in the institution), rather than just copies of each other or stereotypical crazy people. Louise Fletcher was also phenomenal at being hateable. Her character is such an evil, threatening, controlling killjoy, and it's actually frightening for a person like that to have such excessive authority over people.One thing I really loved about this film were the relationships. The relationship between the patients was immensely charming. --This is not really a flaw, but I wish there was more on-screen time between them. I can honestly watch them together for hours.-- The brotherly relationship between McMurphy and Chief is just wonderful, and, of course, the relationship between R.P and Nurse Ratched is just fantastic to watch; From their immediate annoyances with each other to their nail-biting climax. Apart from their confrontations they're also able to build their relationship just with stares.On top of that, the film was successful at playing with my emotions Masterfully! It went from Joyous and Hilarious scenes where I felt like cheering and I laughed aloud, to chilling scenes where I was just appalled. Even up to the bittersweet ending where I, unashamedly, cried both tears of sadness and joy within minutes, and my god that ending theme is so damn inspirational.There were however a couple of moments I didn't like. One minor thing was in a scene where McMurphy does something bold, AND HE DOESN'T GET INJURED AT ALL. I just thought it was stupid. Also, near the end of the movie there's something that McMurphy doesn't do that just annoys the hell out of me.Aside from that, I genuinely loved this film. It's beautiful, inspiring, and really took me on an emotional roller-coaster. It's also possibly the best anti establishment film I've seen.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
513,Melanie82-1,Brilliant,9,10 September 2009,"This is an old one but it is still one of Jack Nicholson's best. It is the story of a convict who thinks he might be able to take it easy and get off of work details if he gets himself committed to a psychiatric facility. That part of his scheme works but he does not count on how structured life can be in a psych ward. Throughout the film, Nicholson tries to get the system to bend to his will and his wishes. In doing so, he has a few small victories but usually winds up having problems associated with those victories. Some of those problems can be tragic. One of the most fascinating aspects to this film is watching how Nicholson's character shapes and changes the characters of the other inmates. Again, sometimes this is for the better and sometimes it is for the worse. At the end, when we see how the admittedly unlikable character of Nicholson winds up, we also see a small victory that seems to make much of what went before worthwhile.

The problems that the inmates of asylum face, living in the institution, not understanding what is happening around, and living in a world of there own. Making the asylum a reality. The bus trip scenes highlight the kind of disconnect these people have from the outer world and how there world is so restricted to there own set of walls.Jack Nicholson as a rebel looks exceptional and the climax absolutely stuns you.

Is there anyone else out there who agrees, at least in part, with the heading?  Firstly, movie is very hypocritical in its treatment of the patients by wanting us to feel compassion (fair enough) while making fun of their afflictions. There is the lead actor. Nicholson's performance is fine, if he's playing Jack Nicholson but what's all this anti-hero talk. McMurphy comes across as a completely selfish and self-eserving figure, without much humanity or compassion for others. Louis Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched in a somnambulistic state, dreary monotone and is about as threatening as Audrey Hepburn. Milos Forman's direction is uneven and reflects the hypocrisy of the entire project.

His ward mates are the stammering nervous wreck Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif) who fears his mother, timid & childish Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassik, delusional Martini (Danny DeVito) ,paranoid Dale Harding (William Redfield), profane Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), Chief Bromden (Will Sampson) a gigantic deaf & mute native American.The institution is run by the domineering Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher).McMurphy discovers that the patients fear her & their fear of her is stronger than their will to get cured, her therapy sessions & schedule meant to keep the patients docile & under control than curing them. McMurphy quickly becomes the dominant & most troublesome patient in the ward by his complete disregard for authority & rules, challenging Ratched whenever possible.When she refuses to let him watch the world series, he defiantly stands in front of the switched off TV, shouting baseball commentary,causing other patients to disrupt the ward.He also teaches the patients basketball ,making the withdrawn Chief admire him. Once he steals the bus meant to take the patients on a tour, herds his fellow patients aboard, picks up his hooker girlfriend Candy (Marya Small) ,and on reaching the shore, takes them all fishing in a boat after tricking its captain.This is one of the only two outdoors scene in the entire film, and it makes the viewer feel the brief freedom that the patients enjoy in the open sea, away from the claustrophobic environment.This leads to stricter restrictions on him. He learns that the hospital can detain him indefinitely. All the other patients in the ward, except hard cases, are voluntarily committed. During one of the sessions, Cheswick,McMurphy & Chief fight with the guards and are hence sent for electro-therapy.McMurphy learns to his delight, that Chief has only been pretending to be deaf & mute all this time to avoid attention.That same night, he decides that he has had enough and decides to escape, as he cannot risk being sent back to prison. He asks Chief to come with him, but he declines, stating his fear of the world. He calls Candy and another girl, asking them to smuggle liquor with them. They sneak in, and McMurphy even ropes in the warden in the liquor party involving the patients, which quickly leads to the dismantling of the entire ward.McMurphy prepares to leave and sees that Billy is the most emotional to see him go. He decides to have Candy spend a night with Billy. McMurphy and the other patients then, unluckily for them, fall asleep due to combined effect of alcohol and medication.Nurse Ratched and the orderlies arrive in the morning to find the ward wrecked completely. All the patients are summoned. McMurphy and Chief are held back as they try to make a quick getaway. She is enraged to find a half dressed Billy with Candy, who for the first time faces her confidently without stammering. Ratched ,using her usual weapon, threatens that she will tell his mother about it. Billy reverts to his old stammering and nervous self and is locked up in a room. Unable to control his nervous breakdown, he kills himself. McMurphy is devastated and viciously attacks Nurse Ratched. He nearly strangles her to death before being knocked down by the orderlies and taken away.The scene moves many days ahead. All kinds of rumours are flying around about McMurphy, ranging from he has been subdued like a lamb to he has escaped. The Chief listens curiously. Nurse Ratched is shown smiling weakly, a shadow of her former self.Late that night as others sleep, McMurphy is brought in and laid on his bed. Chief rushes over to him and whispers that they escape right away. Getting no response, Chief tries reviving him and is horrified to see that he has been lobotomized .Chief decides that he cannot leave his friend in such a pitiful existence,as a symbol of Ratched's victory. He suffocates McMurphy to death before the others wake up. He then smashes the window of the ward by a heavy slab and escapes just as dawn breaks.Jack Nicholson as Randle McMurphy is the soul of this film, and he plays the anti authoritarian, rebellious, crazy and unpredictable character to perfection. His performance is a lesson for any aspiring actor and a treat for any admirer of cinema.Louise Fletcher brilliantly plays one of most coldest villains ever.Of the supporting cast, Brad Dourif as Billy Bibbit is the best.Small but significant performances are given by Christopher Lloyd , William Redding . Will Samspson as Chief Bromden is impressive.Milos Foreman adapts the novel with a few minor changes (in the novel, Chief Bromden is the narrator and all the other inmates escape in the end).The story uses the context of a mental institution to portray the never ending & largely hopeless struggle of the individual against the establishment, resulting in the certain destruction of the individual / section fighting it, but it has to be carried on for the hope of change. The film ends in McMurphy's defeat &destruction, but he also ends up shrinking Ratched into a mere mortal from someone who looks invincible. Out of the two people whose life he changes, Billy meets a sad end, but Chief Bromden lives upto the hope sowed in him by the doomed McMurphy, thereby signifying a little change that has been achieved.The closed settings depicting the mental ward and the robotic movements & compliance of the patients to the numbing schedule depicting safe but hated slavery of the individual is a contrast to the final scene of the film which shows the dawn breaking through the smashed window from which Chief Bromden escapes to an uncertain but welcome future.Which one would you choose?",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

I also liked the plot outline...that the nurse is more dangerous than the patients. Nurse Ratched was probably trying to do the best of the patients, but she was only making it worse. This is one of my favorite movies. It was very deep and moving.

532,silk63826,Brilliantly acted,10,2 April 2005,"Milos Foreman's ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, based on the novel by Ken Kesey and the play by Dale Wasserman, presents a biting and ultimately tragic satire about mental institutions and the human spirit. A disturbing, witty, and electrifying drama, the film won the 1975 Academy Award for Best Picture. R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a misbehaved con who shirks authority, finds himself in an asylum after faking insanity to get out of work detail in prison. The vivacious troublemaker soon finds himself in a worse kind of prison--one presided over by the repressed, terrifyingly quiet Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), whose set of rules and regulations are meant to suppress patients' psychotic outbursts, and their spirits. It's not long before McMurphy is reaching out to his new inmates, trying desperately to bring life to an otherwise dead atmosphere. To Ratched, however, Nicholson's free spirit is as dangerous as a schizophrenic impulse. ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is brilliantly acted by an ensemble that includes Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd, Vincent Schiavelli, and Danny DeVito.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
533,edroberts417,Meet the Gang,9,11 October 2013,"One of the more difficult things to get right in a movie is full and rich character development. Unlike books, movies are shorter, the plot comes faster and the elements are more immediate. A film maker has only a short time to get the characters right before the audience wants to get the plot going--about twenty minutes, certainly no more than thirty. Many films get by with only two or three fully fleshed out character and the others done in broad strokes, using the shorthand of either stock or, in some cases, downright cliché players.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is one of the great exceptions. One of the standout brilliant scenes, in this film of many, takes place in the first few minutes when McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is forced to sit in a group session with all the other residents of the ward. This is where the cast of characters are introduced to the audience. With Nurse Rached (Louise Fletcher) as mediator, the personalities and quirks of all ""the crazies,"" as McMurphy refers to them, come to the surface in efficient, yet subtle, fashion. Not only are the characters fully drawn, but the relationships between them are apparent.Part of this is due to Forman's ingenious camera work. By, for the most part, avoiding long shots, which tend to lend a ""third person"" quality to the narrative, and placing the camera inside the circle of chairs, the audience is drawn into the action and placed in a ""second person"" position and, at one point or another, occupying the place of every one of the characters. In this way, the ""second person"" viewer not only sees and experiences the interrelationships of the ward, but is also called upon to form his own relationship with each character--like them or not. The audience ""investment"" in the narrative is established and from there the plot takes off.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
534,harveybdickens,One of my favorite movies of all time,10,29 January 2016,"It is hard to believe that the author of the book this movie is based on didn't like it. It is simply one of those classic movies.First of all this is a very realistic film. Even more realistic than Goodfellas (1990), and that is also hard to believe because of how melodramatic it is. While Goodfellas didn't have that many intense, or dramatic moments (likely because it was narrated over so often), this movie had more than a few tense and dramatic moments, yet it was still more realistic. Why? Because of the setting: A mental institution.Randle Mc Murphy is sent to a mental institution, because of his apparent mental disability (which is really a lie so he can get out of jail.) After spending time in the institution, he bonds with the other inmates, who actually are disabled, apart from one, The Chief, whom Randle makes a special bond with. During his time there, he manages to get them out of the institution, for a few hours, on a fishing trip. He throws a nigh time party, in which they all get drunk. And he rallies the patients to become rebellious and rise against the staff, and one nurse particularly. While Randle represents chaos in this film, Nurse Mildred Ratched represents order. Very strict order at that.What is described here is just the tip of the iceberg of this film. Despite it's severely depressing tone, the plot draws you in, and makes your root for Randle and The Chief. This is one of those few films that I would call, very intense, and very realistic, as many realistic films, contain a lot of slow paced conversations, where as in this there's tension most of the time. For that reason it's one of my favorites and for that reason I give it a 10/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

I have always felt that a movie should have a real powerful ending, and this has got it. Best Ending for a movie by far and the way Milos Forman directs the people shows that he either knows the way people act (or the writer of the book does), or it's a true story which I have often wondered. In fact if anyone knows if it is a true story or not, if they would email me telling me if it is or not I would thank them.

He was trying to avoid jail for statutory rape by pretending to be mentally ill,and he totally disrupted the hospital and was the one responsible for the death of the young inmate. When I watch a movie, I want the leading characters, no matter how evil, to at least have some redeeming qualities, the lead in this movie had none.

541,FernandoRainer,A film that makes an audience give in to choosing a side concept that would not be conventional in view of what has been common for our entity since our beginnings.,8,20 September 2020,"Who would stop at a mental hospital to avoid the penalty of imprisonment? This change in direction of the story alters the lives of the characters and has a great impact on the film, making a memorable narrative among one of the best.
In this film the intriguing relationship between a violent criminal with a depressive stutterer, with a nervous man, with a lovely crazy man and with a great dumb and shrewd man, makes us question whether the people inside could survive in the real world, making the idea of a perfect world possibly in a reflection of the hospital where there is madness and chaos.
As the film progresses, some patients learn to have self-control of their problems defined as diseases and delay by specialists. The stranger in the nest allows patients to have a new perspective and experience of the outside world, different from the experiences they have obtained since their birth accompanied by traumas and colds, which counters the professional thinking that is gradually seen by the public as stagnant.
One of the best aspects of this film is the accuracy of the time period. At each cut we observe different types of therapy and medicines being tested on patients to make them more acceptable to society, but a problem always happens next, unlike the cuts where we see their socialization with the stranger in the nest, who then it always generates satisfying laughter, bringing more questions that follow with the tenuous line of thought in relation to the idea of perfect society and insane people not acceptable.
Regardless of whether the characters are sick or not and with the final events that are worrying and that makes us unsure about the authenticity of the arbitrary proposal of the story, the film in which it brings great uncertainties puts us in front of a new conception, which is something that exists in a few films, making it a wonderful and exceptional work, which makes the public give in to choosing a side concept that would not be the conventional one in view of what is common for our entity since our beginnings.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

547,SakowskyBrothers,The chief of the tribe,9,30 August 2007,"This movie is one of the most remarkable movies to ever be made. Spectacular performances by Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Danny DeVito, and basically just every single person in the cast. This was probably the greatest cast for a movie ever assembled in terms of work the actors needed to perform in order to make the movie truly believable. The difficulty of creating such a variant cast gave the movie its perfection.The last ten minutes of the film were true triumph. I won't go so far to say that it was the best ending of all time but it sure did have a very nice finishing touch. The movie assembled a good view of the 1950s medical scene with a twist of character and plot to give it Hollywood appeal.Lobotomy was a very serious procedure which had became barbaric later after the introduction of Thorazine in the late 50s. The procedure itself had attained a poor reputation and eventually had ceased by the early 70s basically during the same time as the release of this movie in 1975. This movie didn't necessarily push the abandoning of the procedure but rather sported as a great piece of cinema and history of the medical society.Enough of the history facts though, I must get back to saying how spectacular the acting was. Jack Nicholsons best performance ever to say the least puts the butter back in the popcorn only to shine strong with the power the film has conveyed. Not only was it Jack Nicholsons best it was also Milos Forman best directorial performance who's known for other well known movies like Man on the Moon, Amadeus, The People vs Larry Flynt.In end this film has become the chief in our little tribe of a landmark films and nothing more can be said other then it was a unforgettable classic.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
548,arodmitton,Excellent!,9,28 March 2012,"Based off a novel of the same name, One flew over the cuckoo's nest provides an interesting look at the lives of a group people living in an insane asylum. Life in the asylum changes when Randle McMurray, a memorable performance from Jack Nicholson, arrives and turns the place on its ear. The central piece to this story is the performance of Jack Nicholson. It is almost easy to forget that Nicholson was such a great actor in his prime. Some actors, unfortunately, sometimes become caricatures of themselves as they age under the Hollywood spotlight, with Nicholson falling into this category at times. This film, however, highlights the wonderful acting ability that Nicholson possesses. Playing the charmingly deranged Randle McMurray, Nicholson gives the character a level of likability that makes us forget, at times, that his character is actually a criminal guilty of violent crimes, which ended up earning Nicholson an Oscar win for Best Actor.Director Milos Forman stated that he wanted to use unknown actors in the parts of the asylum inmates, with the exception of McMurray, who he wanted to use someone with some star power. His reasoning being that it would make the film more believable as the inmates started rallying around McMurray. While much of the cast may have been unknown at the time, some well-known names emerged from this film such as Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, Vincent Schiavelli, Michael Berryman, and a superb performance from Brad Dourif as the troubled Billy Bibbit. Louise Fletcher also turns in great performance as the disciplinarian Nurse Ratched.With a run time of over two hours, Forman did a great job of never letting the film sag or bog-down due to its length. He did a great job of keeping the audience engrossed in the movie throughout its entirety. There are several memorable scenes throughout, such as when McMurray is ""calling"" the baseball game when Nurse Ratched forbids them from watching it. A fantastically crafted movie, is one of the few to sweep the major categories at the Academy Awards, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Screenplay, and on top of that, had several other nominations. After viewing this film for the first time, I can understand how this has stood the test of time and is still a relevant film today.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

550,kimmed51-45-875436,rebellion as individualism,8,4 July 2011,This movie was based on the 1960s misconception that conformity is at best weakness and at worst insanity and rebellion is true freedom. Problem is you can't rebel against the devil. At least ten percent of an entire generation destroyed themselves with drugs sex and rock and roll as alternative to being straight (a hypocrite) a condition many of that generation considered the worse form of evil. Truth is the entire 60's generation was exploited by sleazy people who knew how to market it and had no altruistic motivations at all.As for authority - it often wants you to rebel so they can put you in jail or mental institutions. There would be no police without criminals. All the Jack Nicholson character had to do was play along a few weeks and he would have been let out. He couldn't stop his behavior thus wasn't free. Although he was a good influence for the other inmates he got himself killed. If you rebel the system has you where they want you.,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
551,sdrake2-53-373531,"In My Opinion, The Best Film Ever Made.",10,2 June 2011,"I can't really explain how good this film is in words. I mean, this film is more than just good, it's superior. Films like his rarely come along where all aspects about it is top notch. I personally see this as my favorite film of all time. But, what other people may ask is: what makes this film so good? Well, I believe the best quality about this film is the acting. Seeing as I am an actor, i am very keen to judge movies. But, once Jack Nicholson comes on as R. P. McMurphy, I knew I was in for a treat. What was so engrossing and special about his performance is the fact that he makes it so...him. It was naturally played as if Jack was really McMurphy. That is what is so great about Nicholson. he can bring himself into a role and play the character while being himself at the same time. probably the most rewarding scene that Nicholson gives in his tour de force performance is when the ward is voting for changing ward policy and watching the world series. 9 people on the ward vote while another 9 don't vote because their mental capacity isn't the same as those who did vote. but, Nurse Ratched sees fit for a majority and McMurphy goes ballistic to get another vote from the chronics. he eventually gets the deaf and dumb Indian Chief Bromden to raise his hand but evil Ratched closes the vote before Bromden votes. McMurphy then goes nuts on Ratched. The is moment is so rewarding to watch. This moment was so climatic, you could feel the chill of anxiety from the situation running down your spine. Nicholson is at his best with this role.The surprise token for me in this film was Louise Flecther as Nurse Ratched. I had never heard of her before, but when I saw her play the role, I wondered why she wasn't as famous as other actresses are. i mean, Fletcher is astounding in her character. her villainy is so cold, she doesn't even have to have a menacing laugh or a mustache. She just has the aura of evilness. She treats the mental ward patients with disrespect by punishing them when they didn't really do anything and taking away the wards possessions in order for her to feel in charge. Perhaps the coldest scene she does is when she interrogates Billy Bibbitt after he has an escapade with a woman during a secret party held by McMurphy while Ratched was gone. She threatens to tell his mother and makes Billy so angry and depressed that he commits suicide. And she does all of this with a stern voice and a neutral expression on her face.Milos Forman gives this film the quality it has with his ""personal"" direction. He likes to embody the character's emotions by closing in on them. His best scene is when he does a close up on McMurphy for a long time, capturing him falling asleep. There is no one talking, just McMurphy dozing off. He makes it breathe with reality.I could go on and on describing on how good this film is. there is so much to say. i almost forgot to mention how good the screenwriters(Bo Goldman and Lawrence Hauben) adapted this from the book. They really showed respect for how well Ken Kesey did on this work.

It also was interesting how the one the guy in the movie that always said hit me while playing a game of black jack could win so many cigs just by saying hit me and when he learn blackjack even more he got better and better.

556,francodelrosario,"Undeniably Uplifting, Potent and Beautifully Lyrical A Genuine All-American Masterpiece",9,8 April 2006,"No group of Hollywood filmmakers and actors could come across such a dark satirical portrait on mental illness, rebellion and organizational authority and make it a revolutionary landmark film like ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. Based on the 1962 bestseller by Ken Kessey, Milos Forman breaks new grounds in the art of film-making. He flawlessly blends astute cinematography, an outstanding adapted screenplay, rhythmical pacing and remarkably first-rate performances by two stellar leads and an authentic ensemble cast.When anarchistic petty crook Randall Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is taken to a mental institution to be evaluated, he instantly develops silent yet tenacious animosity toward deceitful, stubborn Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher). As a sign of the rebellious, flamboyant, defiant individual he always has been, he acquaints his fellow mental patients with actual life outside their wards.Jack Nicholson's tour de force is here in his Oscar-winning role as R. P. McMurphy, the audacious rebel who liberates the group of impressionable mental patients from living in solitude. Among this group of inmates includes ""deaf and dumb"" noble Native American Chief (Will Sampson) who becomes McMurphy's loyal accomplice. McMurphy understands what the patients lust for and he encourages them in the best way he knows how: baseball, fishing and a night of debauchery. He wreaks even more disorder to a carefully laid system for his and the patients' benefit much to the dismay and chagrin of Miss Ratched.Louise Fletcher also receives a well-deserved Academy award as the very manipulative Nurse Ratched. Many argue that her performance was bland but she blew me away conveying one of the most despicable women in the history of film. Her neurotic feelings of repressed sexuality are cleverly masked by cool, authoritative facade and icy stares. She is entirely apathetic and insusceptible to the needs of others and her biggest concern is making herself the psychosomatic leader of the ward. Her reluctance for McMurphy to outdo her escalates to a heart-stopping climax.Each member of the supporting cast gives incredibly genuine interpretations to their character. It is amazing how every one of those chaotic (proven by their regular hectic group therapy sessions) patients have their own story to tell behind their convalescence. The patients are motivated by McMurphy, even if they aren't completely aware of their actions by the exposition of propaganda Randall takes. In a way, they become cured through Randall's behavior.With a phenomenal unofficial screenplay by Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman and poetic momentum and character development, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST still upholds its title as one of the most potent pieces of the big screen of the 20th century.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

The only thing you can do is `rip that ******* thing' from the bathroom and run away from that kind of closed life circle.Not one performance is overdone, not one line overwritten, not one moment unimportant, not one second of the movie flawed. It's a coherent brilliance of craftsmanship and a quite greatness of humility and dignity. The movie's anti-establishement intonation is already a thing of epochal diameter and it will stay that way for ever. The strenght of its unidealistic undercurrent is what makes all of us alive, even though no one is allowed to admit it. What is fascinating in this movie is that the people who made it know it.
Thinking back to the film  I'm often thinking: `What if every human being in the world would allow himself to `rip that ******* thing' just one single time in his life?' Now, that was a scary thought.10/10. Best motion picture of 1970s.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

I have never seen in my life a performance that is so truthfull and engaging. Looking back at personal experiences with ""mentally disturbed"" individuals I see a Cheswick in many of them.

Then take the slick, pompous jerks on the streets and how they gave up caring about anybody but themselves long ago. Who would you rather be your buddy?

Now I'm 46 and I still love this movie. The play of course is magnificent and it's very rare case when beautiful material was so elegantly used as art of cinema. Everything is so well done, I have hard time to reveal a tiny drawbacks even after watching it so many times. Characters are so sharp, such an ensemble of Dante's world, and such a brilliant collections of stars - never before or after I had and impression - this was right team to play superb play.

Significant story inconsistencies and a good deal of ill-logic as to what the patients/inmates are able to get away with - all to further the story, but it's forced and comes across as not credible. Didn't they have alarms on windows and doors in the 60s at such institutions? The Nicholson character being able to get over barbed wire with no injuries - not reasonable. Seems likely. Well over the top performances, especially by Jack N; not unusual. Why he got so much acclaim for overacting is hard for me to figure. Some of his roles are excellently done, but many, like this one, are just him showing off - in my opinion. In summary, an overlong, often dull and obvious story.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
564,MattTK3,An Emotionally Powerful Film,10,15 July 2003,***Spoiler Ahead***  This movie evoked more emotion out of me than almost any other movie.  I nearly cried at the end and left feeling furious at that cold-hearted nurse.  Jack Nicholson played his role to a T and we can see how much a strong actor can bring to a difficult role (Just imagine if it were James Caan like it was supposed to be).  I had not read the book before viewing the film and the book is more ambiguous than the film in that it makes it more difficult to determine whether Randle is crazy or not.  The cruelty of nurse Ratched (or Wretched as I like to call her) makes her one of the most sinister villains I've ever seen in a film.  You can sense her utter hatred of Randle and and she is exceptionally well-portrayed by Louise Fletcher.  If only more movies could evoke this much emotion from an audience as this one did from me.

This movie excels on so many levels: acting, cinematography, storyline, directing, music, and intelligence. Added together, this is one of the most amazing movies to ever hit the big screen.Jack Nicholson is amazing as McMurphy, who's ""crazy to be in a loony bin like this."" That loony bin is where the story is told; it is one of isolation, of human fears, of human mind, and of human triumph.

My friend said that his teacher told him facts like 12 people on the bus is like the 12 apostles and that McMurphy pretending to have a lobotomy but snapping out of it is like Jesus coming being resurrected. My thoughts on the movie: It is a great movie, let me restate as in top 25 movies ever made material, nevertheless my only problem was the choice to focus the screenplay about McMurphy instead of chief, the main character of the book.Suggestion Read the Book and See the movie then decide which you like better for yourself.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

It is a film that will live on forever as its themes are universal and unending. Most of all the film will continue to live on on the back of the flabbergasting performances by the actors and particularly the amazing and superb Jack Nicholson.If you haven't seen this movie, watch it and from then on life is just slightly different.

573,lanewright,Read the book instead,3,2 May 2000,"Despite the fact that the movie version of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" has been critically acclaimed, and despite some memorable performances, especially by Nicholson, Fletcher, and Dourif, I consider this film to be in the end a failure.  It totally fails to convey the message and meaning of the novel.  I found the end of the film to be depressing, while the end of the novel is anything but.  I can understand the filmmakers not wanting to make a film heavy with voice-overs, but without the narrative voice found in the novel, the story is a hopeless and despairing one, which was surely not Kesey's intent.  I saw the film before I read the book, and after seeing the film I avoided the novel because I didn't want to be depressed again; after reading the novel I almost wished I hadn't seen the travesty of a fine novel that is the movie version of ""Cuckoo's Nest.""",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
574,metrevej,shining,10,27 August 2001,"To say that the film is a masterpiece means almost nothing, especially in today's deteriorated understanding of what masterpiece is. The film is a pinnacle of the world cinematography. It has everything that the real masterpiece has to have: superb direction and screenplay, casting, music, plot, and a theme that deals with timeless concept. What brings the film to the highest points is its power, by which the supreme humanistic ideals as freedom and democracy are, together with everyday-life-related human foibles, are kindly presented for our consideration.The film makes us focus on valuable humanistic categories, without which a man is not a man, meanwhile admitting that no one's perfect, that less-important shortcomings of a man may be acceptable in our not idealized life.The film has advantages compared with the original story, which is brilliant itself. Eliminating the Chief's narrative style, the film becomes more objective and realistic for perception: you get in a first-line contact with McMurphy and others. Nurse Ratched is nice-looking rather than almost a monster, as described so in the book. Moreover so, the film shows that Nurse Ratched honestly and altruistically serves the patients' life and health, although, as in the story, forgetting about freedom. Therefore, by widening the scope of Ratched's character and making it more common, the McMurphy-Ratched conflict becomes more powerful and substantiated.There are a few scenes in the film, especially the final one, which I think are among the best scenes in a movie history.It is a real art: elevated, transparent, at the same time loaded with ideas, and triggering thoughts, an ability of which is as important for the mankind as the principles of democracy and freedom.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Kirk Douglas had played this character on stage for years and, although upset, agreed when his son Michael cast Nicholson in the movie.  I actually think Kirk would have turned in a great performance too, perhaps not as good as Jacks'.  The film itself (although I haven't seen it for ages) outlines the struggle for freedom against the oppression of those in power.  You have to admire Mac's stubbornness in upholding his belief in right and wrong.  Surely it is Mac that is more suited as a therapist, and Nurse Ratchet that is in need.

578,drake blueskull,Truly interesting and thought provoking.,9,7 April 2002,"What exactly is madness? A state of mind that is anything but normal? An understated vice that resides in most of us? A consequence derived from adversity, pain or deprival? The victory of this film exists in stating that whatever madness might be, it does not justify the treatment meted out to people who are deemed mad, unfit and dangerous by the society. For, these people are perhaps as imperfect as the very rigid framework on which our society functions. Driving these heavy points home is perhaps one of the best films of our times.Jack Nicholson essays the role of Randle McMurphy, a man whose utter lack of resentment (or whatever appeared of it)and liveliness, while he's held as a convict for the assault of a woman, is mistaken for madness by the law. He's consigned to a mental asylum for treatment. For no other reason apart from his being sent to the asylum, he's branded a lunatic just like every other patient, by the doctors and the warden alike. The asylum, with its lifeless atmosphere disappoints an unassuming Randle and with his endeavors, characteristic of a person who wants to make the most of life, he brings himself closer to the patients & injects enthusiasm into the otherwise moribund life they lead. As was expected his manners are not to the least appreciated by Nurse Mildred (Louise Fletcher)and Randle soon realises that the patients are victims of a prejudice that surpasses the actual gravity of their conditions. So much so that the dignity accorded to the people in the asylum is not of patients but that of criminals.With his uninvited but justified rebellion, Randle helps the patients acquire some self-respect. His peers in the asylum slowly start coming out of the aftermath of the hopeless treatment that had them convinced that they are nothing but a burden on society. He makes them conscious of the individuality which they never thought they possesed.The irony in the film is that where the doctors failed, Randle succeeds in repairing their souls to a great extent and perhaps in the process saving them from going deeper into the predicament society had created for them. In fact one of the memorable moments in the film is when Randle forces a fellow inmate, who had hitherto acted dumb, to talk. Even as Randle fails to escape from the asylum, something he had decided upon doing, the film still savours to the ideal of liberation by showing that due to Randle at least one inmate realises the futility of being in the asylum and finally escapes.
'One flew over the cuckoo's nest' is perhaps the best satire i've ever seen. Along with Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Danny DeVito and all the other actors acting as inmates dish out laudable performances. The narrative of the film is superb and its depressing portrayal of social stereotypes ends with an inexplicably ambiguous but definite message of hope. It is a must watch for all Jack Nicholson fans and for all those who have no qualms about witnessing the painful impact of society's prejudice.9/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

580,wwwrobbieb,"FANTASTIC, OUTSTANDING,BRILLIANT!No words can describe this masterpiece",10,23 December 2010,This is one them films that even without a repeated viewing is still a masterpiece.First off Jack Nicholson is just absolutely superb at the main character. He is just amazing when it comes to playing insane and mentally cryptic characters (refer to Tim Burtons Batman and The Shining) The basic plot is that Randall.P.McMurphy is sent to a mental institution after several charges from the police. He doesn't want to work at all and he is just lazy so he decides to fake being mentally ill so he can get out of work.But when Randall meets the inmates he immediately connects with them despite the fact that he isn't even mentally ill. Because of him they all form a union inside the asylum against the horrible evil witch called Miss Ratchet. Miss Ratchet is played by Louise Fletcher who is brilliant and evil as she has a simple dry nature.All of the actors that play the inmates are amazing; Its like watching real people behave in a asylum. Not to mention the inmates kind of represent a society and the nurses and doctors are representing the authority of this society.They all do some crazy things together like going fishing. Randall befriends Chief who is deaf and dumb but Randall teaches him many things like shooting hoops in basketball.This film is amazing and has the one of the most perfect endings in the history of drama films.WELL WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!

581,hugibert_aldred,"Occasionally Heart Warming, Sometimes Terrifying, Often Funny, Always Brilliant!",9,3 January 2007,"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is for me Jack Nicholson's best performance of his career - and we if we look at Nicholson's phenomenal career, that is certainly saying something. Nicholson's turn as R.P.McMurphy is one of the all time great cinematic performances. There are so many different elements to his character it is amazing that Nicholson actually manages to pull it off. He is funny, edgy, angry, dry and almost any other personality description you can think of. His entrance to the film when he kisses the guard on the cheek remains for me one of the great film entrances, and always has me laughing!However, the supporting cast should not be forgotten. Fletcher, DeVito, Lloyd, Dourif, Redfield and first time actor Will Samspon all give great performances as the supporting cast - blending insanity, confusion and friendship into the film very well! But this is Nicholson's movie, and he steals the show!There are scenes such as the boat trip which are incredibly well done - and a credit to the director Milos Forman. That scene, as well as others left me with a broad grin spread across my face.However, be warned, this not movie is not all light hearted. There are some very powerful scenes, such as the final showdown between Nurse Ratched and McMurphy, which even now having seen the film several times, I find hard to watch. Without spoiling the ending, there are other upsetting scenes in this film - and anyone who finds themselves upset or feeling sorry for mentally handicapped people should approach this film with caution, as not everyone in this film is an actor.Nonetheless, this film is truly a masterpiece, though I would suggest it is not to everyones liking, it is certainly a film that everyone should make the effort to see! 9/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

It saddens me that some people have been so obtuse as to score a 1 simply because it doesn't ""stick to the book"". This site is about 'films' and really the whole army can't be out of step (witness the overall 8.8 score despite its detractors). Treatment of mental health has moved on a lot since this film was made, but this film brought to light the type of horrors that were happening in the 70's. An absolute classic, combining humour, pathos and hope.Jack Nicholson's name became synonymous with the film and, with the exception of ""The Shining"", it is probably the film for which he is best known.

Being a majority of movies being older than I am, I have quite a few to watch. In ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", Jack Nicholson plays one of his best performances in the character RP Mcmurphy, a man that is admitted in a psychiatric asylum for being nonworking towards his prison duties. He plays a rather very believable character. Getting to the story, Mcmurphy thinks the patients have no control over themselves actually working towards leaving the place because of the head nurse. Mcmurphy notices this and wants to show them whats beyond the white walls of this psychiatric asylum. I don't want to give away more of the story so i'll stop there. Overall I liked the movie, I like movies that have a meaning and reason that people should start doing. Like under estimating that the ""crazy people"" around us are not capable of our regular human activities and should be kept away of the public. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Mcmurphy and how he thought differently was a major satisfaction and showed me that there should be more people like him out their. The only thing that couldn't leave my mind was how disappointing the ending was for ME. I don't approve of what they end up doing the people in mental hospitals.

Everyone comes to this world with great message, with task. And of course sometimes it looks like someone is at the wrong time and place, and that freedom for everyone will be the same. However it is not so, for example, my freedom is to do that what I like, others freedom will be being in hospital and be in frames which offers hospital, because the whole world may be chaotic and for someone the worst place ever.Though this movie is great, and it makes you think about some kind of political movements right now, about inequality in public and 100 other questions, I suppose that book is little bit better. 9/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

588,jakelong311,Great Film from the 70's,8,10 April 2019,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a great look back at the decade of the 1970's. It brings back many memories for some, I'm sure, and it has that old grainy look to it that is very fitting for that time period. It has music to match that feeling too. It is just the kind of movie that could be very nostalgic. But it feels a bit dated for those same reasons, so it is not as good as it could otherwise be. And I have to say it is also a bit sexist. Some of the things that happened in this movie were justified, but there are things that they could not get away with in a movie today.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
589,Biatchmefoot,Classic that is still very powerful,10,17 May 2018,"Directed by Milos Forman and is about Randall Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) who gets transferred to a mental institution, the mental institution is ran by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) who oppresses her patients and so the high spirited Randall is forced to stay in a very closed-minded hospital. Jack Nicholson gives an outstanding and charismatic performance as R.P. McMurphy and really sells the role extremely well but most of all I cared about his character despite his flaws and Louise Fletcher does a terrific job as Nurse Ratched and so does everyone else in the film. Mental illness is shown in a very realistic way and the movie itself feels so real, the lighting in this movie feels so natural and it adds the the authenticity to the film, the interactions with the patients are very convincing and a lot of that has to do with the directing of Milos Forman and the performances. For me personally there was not one moment where I felt like the movie dragged and I found the movie very compelling. ""Power"" is a pretty big subject in the film, Nurse Ratched is very power hungry, Randall views the patients as powerless, Randall powers over the authority or even at the more subtle moments when Randall was fighting one of the guards Chief viewed him as powerless so that's why chief came in and tried to help him, it is something that occurs a lot. From the beginning shot it shows nature with Native American like music playing, in my opinion the music symbolizes the patients with what sounds like someone crying. At the end of the film the music plays again also showing another shot of nature but in a less crying and in a more uplifting tone to show that the patients are not suffering as much now that Chief has broken the window and escaped free. The classical style music the nurses play I think symbolizes power as it powers over the patients which forces them to shout. R.P. McMurphy gives the patients joy and self-esteem as the film progresses and he cares for the people around him for example when Billie committed suicide he could have just left and went off to Canada but he decided to stay and choke Nurse Ratched or even before that when he decides not leave leave at the end of the party because he knew the place would be back to the same if he just left. Nurse Ratched is a villain who believes what she is doing is right but in the same time the film does a great job in making you hate her as she tries to strip away the manhood and distinctivness of the patients. I loved Chief's character development throughout the film, at first he starts out as someone who decides to not speak and pretends to be deaf because he does not want to interact with anyone and he still did (except in front of Randall McMurphy) for most of the movie but as the movie goes on he gains courage from Randall and he gains the courage to escape and utilize his strength which was his strong muscles, the first time he utilizes one of his strengths (which was his height) was in the basketball game. The scene where the supervisor comes in and the patients and Turkle hide is an extremely funny scene but I also felt anxious in the same time thinking if they were to get caught. Let's also not forget the fishing scene where it shows them finally getting to live freely and handle their own and not be in the institute. One of the themes many people may get from this film is societies approach to people with mental illness and you certainly can look at it that way but the even bigger picture is rebelling against the opressor as shown in the movie McMurphy refuses to submit to the institution and he decides to stand his ground to a system that is not doing what is right. This is a film I highly recommend, the film is great in both emotionally and aesthetically and if you haven't checked it out you should.(btw I haven't read the book)",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

591,jackalchow,2 kinds of madness,8,22 July 2007,"The film tried to present the madness in 2 ways: one of them is in a common view, which is sent to the madhouse, due to their mentally disable; while the other is that like the character of Mc Murphy (acted by Jack Nicholson), who got passed in the mental test, but having some extreme and abnormal behavior.Those two manners, also to be discriminated by the society, needed to have a mutual support to each other. Their group power tried to challenge the absolute authority (the celebrities include the chief of nurse, and the doctor of the madhouse). The patients are like to be jailed, without any right that normal guy should have: no sex, no option for taking medicine, and no chance to watch the ball game due to the fixed rule of the house. They are just children to be taught, any action which is treated as an abnormal (in the view of madhouse operators) will be punished. Is it really being an ideal place for them to recover? Or even be suppressed?The story tend to let us get the deny answer of this. Self-treatment is better and so Mc Murphy introduced all of the patients to the fish boat owner as Dr. A, Dr. B..when they were escape for their vacation. Besides that scene, another points for supporting mutual healing or self-healing could also been found by Mc Murphy speech to the chief (ask him try to play basketball. Of course, it was a surprise that the chief had no mental disability when the movie was going on) Such encouragement had 2 purposes: 1st point was to show the magic held by another mad man, who could heal the self-closing chief, as all of the doctors in the house have already given up to do so; 2nd thing was more important, it was the clue to guide the ending of the story.The story completed in the way that changing impossible to possible. Mc Murphy was the leader to emphasize the spirit of trying. He knew the washing tray was heavy enough for him, but still tried to move it. Also, he usually persuaded the patient to escape; it actually means the continuous spirit for fight to the destiny, the power and the guys who discriminate them. No one can tight them, as ling as they were willing to turn them down. The chief had done it and escaped away. Is his freedom good for him? Not really, he may fail to adapt the environment and got dead. But who know else? At least he got a new live rather than a ridiculous survive in the routine jail house, even it is more dynamic.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Playing a convict who is not necessarily crazy, but does seem to be a challenge, but he pulls it off with such perfection that I dare you to find a flaw. The accompanying cast provides an interesting and colorful backdrop to his crazy shenanigans, but be on the lookout for the performance of Oscar Winner Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, she is one evil nurse, she inhabits her role with such a powerful presence, that if she were really a nurse, most patients would pretend health just to be free. They really are memorable performances, capped off with Milos Forman's Best Work in my opinion, you really have a Grade A Movie.A Word of Advice, if you have some petty grudge against any of the actors involved, leave it at the front Desk, and come inside the Ward, you will be pleasantly surprised",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Well first I have to say that the direction of this movie is excellent, and has no equal, it is what I consider a Stanley Kubrick movie, from its views and ideas. Well lets get to it, Mac Murphy is a rapist, a man who doesn't like rules, and doesn't like the authorities faces, and will do anything to be a fascist towards them. Yet he is claiming he is crazy and runs away from the society of corruption that he built, by manipulation. And gets stuck with a middle age nazi like women, whom, if you have read the book, has control over any one and will beat any one if she wants to. There is the idea of who is the good guy and whom is the bad, who is crazy, and whom is not, who is the real fascist, well I'll tell it to you, Mac Murphy and ratchet, they both represent the hate and the corruption in the world today, it's existence and life. When Mac Murphy tried to pick that sink he was unable, he couldn't reach freedom, and enlightenment, but the death and dumb Indian did, if you read the book, the world was spoken from his eyes, he manipulated everyone, he is the bad guy, so is everyone, the whore, the dead kid, the black boys, mc Murphy and ratchet, teachings of anti everything.  And yet there is levels again like fascism, Mac Murphy turned out to be a vegetable, by the strict orders of ratchet, him going against societies illnesses, and then crushed, I disagree with the minority that believe this movie is crap, cause craziness, is a representation of corruption, and it was not Billy whom was corrupt, it was miss ratchet and every son of a bitch who walks on the streets, it isn't the crazy people whom are crazy but the sane people whom are.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

The book was written in 1962 which was when Kennedy was President.  The movie was made in 1975, only due to problems with copyright approval.The film is a fascinating character study and a definite MUST see. Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson deliver Oscar winning performances.  And the movie also won best picture.  Fletcher's Nurse Rachet is one of the most hated villains in movie history.  In fact, her Academy Award winning speech began with the words, ""Thank you for hating me So much.""  And as the director Milos Foreman once said, ""Jack Nicholson was sent from heaven.

598,filmviewer64,"An ultimately powerful, tragic, and terrific movie.",10,14 August 2007,"I will not hesitate in saying that ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is one of the most powerful and emotionally provoking movies in existence. It is something that truly cannot be ignored. While I will am sure that I have not even come close to seeing all of the great movies in existence, as of right now ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is indeed one of the most entertaining, moving, and brilliant movies that I have ever seen.In the beginning of this movie we are given an outside view of the mental hospital that will serve as the main setting of the movie. After the introductory credits we are give a look inside the hospital, and we are then introduced to a whole new community, the patients in the ward. Soon after we are given an introduction to the character that will truly start off the entire movie, Randall Patrick McMurphy.Jack Nicholsons performance as McMurphy is without a doubt not only one of Nicholsons greatest performances, but one of the greatest performances of all time. McMurphy is a fairly sane criminal in the movie who is jailed for charges of assault and statutory rape. Pleading insanity, McMurphy hopes to serve out his jail sentence with comfort inside of a mental ward. What Nicholson brings to McMurphy is the ultimate anti-authority character, with a sly pranksters sense and someone who will try to change the environment around him, probably by causing trouble. What is McMurphy trying to change and rebel against? It all lies within the mental hospital.Inside the mental hospital resides a slew of mental patients, headed by the ever-controlling Nurse Ratched. Here lies even more great performances, particularly the one of Nurse Ratched, who is played by Louise Fletcher. She is a woman who enjoys being in control, mainly because she believes that what she does is what is best for her patients. Mentioning the patients, they are among the most memorable characters in cinema history. Whether it be the stuttering Billy Bibbit(portrayed by Brad Dourif) or the seemingly intelligent Harding (played by William Redfield), each of the patients that the movie focuses on are wonderfully crafted by the actors who portray them.Among these patients McMurphy tries to stir a rebellion against the dominating Nurse Ratched, though that is where I will stop in my description of the movie. I will say, though, that this movie shows just how important acting is in the movie, and this movie features some of the best.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is one of the most compelling, shocking, and perhaps tragic movies that I have ever seen, and, to top it off, one of the greatest.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

But back to One Flew, it is an amazing piece of film with some of the best acting I have ever seen, Jack Nicholson's character is the typical antihero everyone loves, just when you think he has learned his lesson....well I won't ruin it.

601,msegvic,Must see,10,22 July 2003,"The ultimate legend of all movies. The movie that changed everything. Jack Nicholson appears after his first big role in ""Chinatown"" and shines. Milos Forman`s creation has to be praised- a mixture of drama and comedy fulfilled with deep emotions. Forman presents a whole new world, a world behind ""the Wall"". There is one enthusiastic person who tries to destroy, or better, avoid this barrier, but finally fails. Like the political scene in the middle 70`s in Europe, two different worlds separated, causing so much pain and trouble for a ordinary person. Inside ""the Wall"" the regime dictates and jepardizes the basic thoughts of democracy and freedom. Formans great talent to find a balanced story, which enters deeply inside of you; and a remarkable cast of Nicholson, Fletcher, DeVito and Redfield all together make a winning formula.This film is the real prototype of all the modern movies made after it, from the ""Rain Man"", the ""Deer Hunter"" to the modern ""Girl. Interrupted"".Forman and Kubrick led us into a new era of film, as the real leaders of modern Cinema.This is the one of ten or tweenty movies you MUST SEE. 10 of 10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
602,ahab19,Sanity is a matter of perception.,10,5 March 2012,"One of the universal characteristics about works of fiction is the audiences ability to relate to the characters. It is the common traits that we share with them that brings them to life. We can easily identify with a characters triumphs, their intentions, their failures and their frustrations. Many of these traits are easy to identify. They are either black or white, good or bad. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest goes into more of a gray area, giving us one of the all time great unanswered questions- What is crazy? When the film begins we are introduced to the hospital, set in 1963. The ward is run by Nurse Ratched (Lousie Fletcher), a woman with a sweet yet stern and cold face. When we are introduced to the patients we as the audience automatically assume we are crazy. Some of the patients outright exhibit deranged behavior. Others seem eccentric and a few seem downright ""normal"" but we assume they are there for a reason.We are then introduced to the films main character, RP McMurphy (Jack Nicholson). Despite his claims that he is crazy, it is made clear to the audience that McMurphy is not crazy but attempting to avoid jail time for criminal behavior. Nicholson's portrayal of McMurphy is nothing short of masterful with his over the top explosiveness and outbursts to his subtle reactions of his observation of the hospital.McMurphy's persona at once makes him a hero to the inmates and an enemy to Nurse Ratched. Almost instantly a war has begun between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched and neither side will back down. Fletcher's portrayal of Nurse Ratched is the personification of order. The sweetness that she portrays is phony and unsettling. The coldness and cruelness laying just below her surface becomes more and more apparent as we can see that she will go to any length to have control and show no mercy.We also get to know the characters better it is revealed that many of them are not insane at all but rather socially inept and loners. The revelation to McMurphy that these inmates are there voluntarily is almost an unbearable shock. These men are not there because they are evil or dangerous. They are there because they can not function within our society.McMurphy leaves his impression on all of the inmates, but the one he reaches through the most to is a gigantic mute Native American character simply referred to as the Chief. The Chief silently observes all activity in the ward while showing no emotion. It is his interaction with McMurphy that brings him to life and brings him to start speaking again.The heart of this film is not about mental illness. Despite taking place in a mental ward and there being mentally ill characters in the background, this is a film about human spirit. Spirit is what McMurphy has in abundance, what the inmates in his circle are critically lacking and what Nurse Ratched and the institution labels as insanity.And yet the war inevitably comes to its conclusion. SPOILER ALERT- Nurse Ratched's determination to have control and complete lack of mercy takes its toll on one of the most innocent inmates and drives him to take his life. The tragedy of his death unleashes the pent up rage that has built up in McMurphy and he unleashes it on full force on Nurse Ratched.The end result is a tragedy. The hospital lobotomizes McMurphy. He is now a vegetable and will be for the rest of his life. The Chief is horrified when he discovers his beloved friends fate and immediately smothers him with a pillow, doing him the favor of a quick death instead of spending the rest of his life immobile.Earlier in the film McMurphy had tried to lift a heavy marble water fountain out of the ground. When he failed he was mocked and he replied to the rest of them that at least he tried. Upon Mcmurphy's death the Chief does what had been laughed at as impossible- he rips the water fountain out of the ground and throws it through the window. The closing shot is of the Chief running away from the hospital....free from the hospital and free in his soul. He no longer needs the hospital. He was won the war that McMurphy started.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Not only is the directing of Milos Forman among the best achievements in film history, nearly all of the actors are at their best and helped in making this movie an excellent display of dedication to the role. I must admit that I didn't recognize Danny DeVito because he played so differently than in most of his later films which were mainly comedies, and although I wouldn't say those later films were not good either, his best role in my opinion was the one of Martini in this film. About the talent and dedication of Jack Nicholson a lot of people have said enough and I can only repeat what has been said before. But again, in this movie he kind of outperformed himself compared to most of his other films. Louise Fletcher has played another brilliant part, making an excellent opponent for the tragic hero played by Nicholson. And finally, Will Sampson, who died much too early, has given this film an important twist, without which it simply couldn't have been complete. But every supporting actor played absolutely perfect either, there is no weak acting or other flaw in this movie.

620,pumishmumi,If you like movies that make you think...,8,30 December 2011,"This is your gift from God, thinkers.This movie takes on the challenge of bringing the life of the mentally unstable to a full view for everyone to see. Everything goes on as normal (as the movie portrays it): Nurse Ratchet and crew monopolize the mentally ill in this 'institution' until a certain Mr. McMurphy comes in, rebellious, lazy, but also smart enough to get around, and almost sees the place as an easy target.I'm going to skip to the end for a second because that's where all the uncertainty comes up. McMurphy sees one of his new friends dead (did he kill himself? That question may have just come from me not paying attention) and he turns on Nurse Ratchet, trying to choke her. After all the trouble he has caused, this is the final straw. They do 'something' to morph McMurphy into what they wanted, so now he is more ill than the rest of the mental patients. Right at this moment, I stopped the movie. I had already seen the very end where the Chief kills him and runs off on a different occasion. So many questions popped into my head.I don't want to ask one without asking them all, and asking them all would break the 1,000 word limit, but watch the last half-hour, and really think about it. Who was the bad guy? McMurphy or Ratchet? That's question 1 of over 50 I thought of when I saw that part.Be ready when you watch this movie.

From Beginning to end this film made me laugh and really touched me inside. Jack Nicholson's performance in this film is better then any other film he has starred in ( including 'The Shining').This film also won five academy awards, including: Best Actor ( Nicholson ), best actress ( Louise Fletcher ), Best picture, Best Director ( Milos Foreman ), and best adapted Screenplay.This film is so good that I have placed it in my top three favourite films, and I recommend everyone should watch this superb Drama.Overall ***** out of *****",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

It was well scripted, well acted, well directed, and there are few, if any, flaws.  The only problem I have with this film is how depressing it is.  I was shell shocked after I had watched it.  I didn't know what to think.  The first part of the movie was a comedy through and through.  I watched it the entire time with almost an air of smugness.  The first part was nothing compared to the second though.  The end is what makes this a brilliant and thought provoking film. My smugness disappeared  in the last twenty minutes.  Though the ending is ultimately uplifting with the fate of Chief, the events surrounding it are horrifying and depressing.  I wholeheartedly recommend this movie, but I also recommend that you prepare yourself for something other than a comedy.PS.  Does anyone know why Louise Fletcher won best actress?

The acting is so convincing that if you didn't know otherwise you'd swear it was real. The script and ad-lib are fantastic. It's intriguing, humorous, emotionally charged, heartbreaking and politically biting all at the same time.Foreman, Douglas, Nicholson, DeVito, Lloyd and co will never (ever) top this or even get near it if they live to be a hundred.I hold this movie responsible for my failure to pass the Biology, Chemistry and Physics exams of my final year of School. The night before the papers, I was so engrossed in this movie I stayed awake until 2am and could not get back to sleep after.I know Jack Nicholson could play the standard non-conformist in his sleep but ""One Flew Over The Cookoo's Nest"" is the closest Hollywood has come to genius. It should be shown to anyone having a hard time fitting in, feeling a bit different, getting force-fed useless crap from teachers, bored in a tedious working environment, dominated by parents or pushed around by work management.

As well as this the is a theme of cycles and routine. There are scenes in which characters are overly joyed when they break consistency and routine such as when they are pretend to watch television and the ""Christmas Party"". The film touches on aspects of relationships and sex in particular with Billy, a man who has not been with a women and seems to be scared of authoritative women such as Nurse Ratched and his mother; after sleeping with Candy he and being caught he is scared of what his mother might do when she finds out and then ends up committing suicide (thus showing Billy never truly being free even after sleeping with a women)As well as this, the protagonist Randle McMurphy (Mac), is a man who likes to bet a lot as well as eager to make relationships with people, many times for his own benefit. Many times he is attempted to be subdued by various methods to make him less ""dangerous"" with only the final attempt working with the removal of part of his brain. His death at the end is somewhat of a mercy killing by The Chief; this was perhaps done in order to preserve the memory of Mac and the 'run to freedom' at the end of the film is the fulfilment of Mac's wishes in order to be free and break the constant cycle; Mac is also able to do by breaking the bonds that shackle him to the Earth and to be free in death.9/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

I had to read reviews and articles on the movie to understand that the author was talking about life in general. Its not about the mental asylum only. It was fun to watch Danny DeVito play one of his first roles. Pace of the movie is excellent. Liked excellent portrayal of Nurse Ratched. Some excellent camera angle work can be appreciated.

The screenplay is brilliant. The writers took a really good novel and molded it into a perfect movie. I know all the wanna be critics that come here are gonna say how the book did this better and showed all these deep, hidden themes better and how the movie isn't as good and BLAH BLAH BLAH...that stuff is just so clichéd. I'm tired of hearing it. There's nobody in the world that could have done a better job than Foreman. The cast in this is perfect...and let me just say that I actually read the book first before seeing the movie thinking that if I saw the movie first my experience reading the book would be ruined, but the actors in the movie completely demolished the characters I had in my head; Jack Nicholson, Louis Fletcher, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd...all perfect. All of them. Also, wasn't it great how the movie kept Cheswick around. God I love that guy. I think the biggest improvement that the movie had over the book was the ending. Kesey's ending lacked emotion, sensitivity, feeling...it just didn't have the impact on me that Foreman's ending did. I mean, wasn't that soundscore in the end of the movie simply amazing, I get goosebumps every time I see it. Books don't have music like that. They are, afterall, just words.I have great respect for books and novels. Harper Lee's To Kil A Mockingbird towers over the movie, but that just isn't the case here and some of you need to get over it.

628,sreeduttasamanta,A sane Madman,9,18 January 2017,"The first scene of the movie portrays the most dangerous prison, the mental institution with Miss Ratched as the strictest nurse who can go to any extent to ensure that everything goes according to the laws. But very soon, inside that covered cage comes a free bird who puts up a fight against the world and tries to bring back life from its grave only to make that institution a better and a fairer place. The movie named ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" displays us the fight between a sensible individual and the omnipotent government through the characters of McMurphy and Miss Ratched. McMurphy was sent inside the mental institution after he has pleaded guilty after committing a crime. He is placed under the care of Miss Ratched who only excels in hypotinizing free minds under her evil influence. However, McMurphy always puts up a tough fight against her and questions every rule set by her. But no matter how powerful the arms of the individual it is impossible to lift the immense weight of the myths, government and the nonsensical rules of the society. McMurphy, undeterred by the consequences, goes on fighting till his last breath. But the question is ""whether he will be praised as a hero by the people? Or will he be criticized as a man who was foolhardy enough to even have tried fighting the society?"" Sadly the answer is that society always wins crushing the people under its foot just like hundred grain of sands are washed under the wave of the sea. The same consequences await McMurphy when iron clubs and electric shocks knock out his life breath, squeeze out the spirit of fight out of him and make him as meek as a horse. However, Chief's breakout portrayed the eventual change which is inevitable and cannot be stopped even by the iron whip of the government. This movie with the use of metaphors is fraught with a very valuable lesson that fighting the all powerful is necessary and must be carried out even though the result is fatal.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

His character is amazing, because he is funny, but serious. I like that in films because it shows both sides to the person. The only problem with the film was how at the end he becomes a vegetable and is then smothered with a pillow by Chief (Will Sampson). Also i hate the nurse from it she is a right witch, and I'm glad Jack tries to strangle her. It is an amazing film though, so i suggest you watch it as it will blow your mind.

Four times total, each time more engrossing. What a perfect film: story from Ken Kesey, casting, acting, directing. What a powerful and symbolic performance from Will Sampson as Big Chief! And McMurphy: counterpoint between a living human being and the smothering, oppressive, deadening--and murderous--force of society. Scatman Crothers, Dourif, Nicholson are superb. An easy 10.

His McMurphy is quite simply the most believable and easiest to relate to character in the history of celluloid.  His love for the rest of the inmates is apparent all the way through, and he's backed up superbly by Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, Brad Dourif (whatever happened to him?) as Billy, and Will Sampson as the Chief.  Even Danny De Vito puts in his best ever performance.McMurphy's punishment is heart-breaking, as a vibrant, intelligent small-time crook is reduced to a vegetable for daring to speak the truth, while Billy's demise is all the more tragic as it is far less inevitable than McMurphy's.I can't believe that anyone reading this hasn't yet watched the film (if not - go and watch it NOW!) but just in case - stop reading now...All I wanted to say was the scene where the Chief smothers McMurphy and then pulls the water fountain out of it's fitting and throws is through the window to escape is probably the best scene in movie history, rivaled only by the very start of Star Wars when the Star Cruiser passes overhead.Saying that this film is a perfect ten is to do it an injustice.  I defy anyone to watch this film and not be deeply moved by it.

Nicholson is an actor you can't dislike, he brings life into that poor environment, but maybe he should have been more 'bad'.This isn't a perfect movie, the chief 'suddenly' begins to respond, its too easy to escape from this place, the fishing scene might be unnecessary and unrealistic, maybe was shot due to the nice views, but there are many nice scenes.

The movie is genuinely funny with real human humour played throughout. It shows the harsh time of a mechanically run mental hospital which is interrupted by the social reality of RP McMurphy. The movie leaves you pondering on one question, Is RP McMurphy crazy or normal? The harsh reality of it is, that we today can't clearly define between the both so can't make a real judgement. Nicholsons performance is undoubtedly the best of his career and deserves a standing ovation every time it is seen.

By today's standards it was M I L D. Based on the torturous history of institutions and Ratched's pop-culture reputation, I was expecting Annie Wilkes and not just a nurse with a stern look trying her best to do her job with bad hair.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
647,spam_me-386-849050,universal,10,18 November 2012,"This is the kind of movies with several levels. The first one is a story of a guy trying to escape prison until he realizes that the mental institution is worst, despite the impression it gives. A striking example is given when the nurse offers to make the patients vote on the proposition of Mc Murphy to watch baseball series on TV. First, she offers this because she knows she'll win over Mc Murphy, as the patients are too scared, too docile to publicly disagree with her. Then, she offers a second chance without mentioning that she wants the majority among people who can't vote. Finally, she argues that time was over when Mc Murphy succeeded in convincing a tenth patient. She impersonates the institution: leading you to think that they care while their only concern is to maintain their domination, their power whatsoever.Here appears the second level: a criticism of these mental institutions, answering with authority to people who simply lack the tools to behave like the majority of the population. The only violence the patients show is the one they infringe to themselves. Which leads the only two that see clearly to use it against others, but only for justice: McMurphy against the nurse who led Billy to commit suicide, and the ""Chef"" against McMurphy to save him from a life of physical and mental imprisonment. A third level deals with love, respect and attitude toward others in general. The main difference between McMurphy and everybody else, patients or institution, is that he treats everyone as equals, and this is what makes him the hero. His humanism is the core quality that will make him play cards with the ones that don't even understand the game (but who will say some of the most intelligent thing when asking how will they win back their money and cigarettes if the nurse keeps them ""for their own good""), speak to the deaf and dumb (who appears to actually fake it), and give an opportunity for love to the one who is supposed to not be able to stand for it. And when he fails, at least, as he says in the beginning, he tries. The humiliation of him not being able to lift the block in the bathroom becomes a message of hope addressed to all of them who knew it was impossible but did not realize that the defeat is in the way they think not the fact that they were right on this matter. This key moment is a first step toward the final happy ending for the Indian guy. For all this reasons, this movie really moves me. The actors are exceptional, the grey and cold atmosphere that contrasts with the mood of the hero and with the scene of party and happiness near Christmas or with the one on the boat is perfect for the movie. I simply was not convinced by part of the end, maybe because it went too fast. I don't know. I did not like the opening credits and the poster ether, which may be details but other movies showed that these could be art and I like when filmmaker are perfectionist. Overall, I rated the movie 10/10 not because it was perfect but for all the levels I saw in it. It, for sure, will make me think about it for long, and rise questions about life in general.

McMurphy was stunning, a not so sociable and unlikeable guy is administrated into a mental facility. As Nicholson's character meets and becomes sociable with the other patients, played by Danny DeVito, Sydney Lassick, Christopher Lloyd, Vincent Schiavelli, and Brad Dourif. All the patients are fantastic as they all have their quirks and problems, but the one that stands out is Will Sampson's performance as Chief a large def Native American who steels the show at one point. The main plot is for the patients to go up against the head nurse, Nurse Ractched played by Louise Fletcher. Who is the somewhat messed up person who is just messed up. She is menacing and awful to the patients, you end up really not liking her along with the patients. This film was released in 1975 and was directed by Milo's Forman and was based off the book by Ken Kesey.

650,michaeldwaynedias,"Yes, I gave one of the greatest films of all-time a 7",7,25 April 2019,"Let's start off with the positives: truly remarkable performances by every cast member, tastefully morbid comedy, heart-warming scenes that depict the human need for freedom and earthly indulgence - I don't need to go into too much detail since those of you who have already seen the movie already know why it is considered to be a cinematic masterpiece, and those of you who haven't probably already have some idea of what the hype is all about.Since this movie was released in 1975, it wouldn't be fair for me to judge it solely from the point of view of a millennial, since I believe that the rating of a movie is significantly contingent upon the time in which it was released. As such I will refrain from making any references to what a more modern audience looks for in a movie.McMurphy to me wasn't the hero everyone seems to extol him to be. He did want the best for his peers, yes, but at what cost? He took them sailing, allowing an inexperienced fellow patient to take control of the boat, without regard for everyone else's safety. He was instrumental in several riots and licentious acts within the institution. He was defiant, intractable and just plain obnoxious. I understand that many great films do feature lead characters with villainous qualities and that's okay, but the desired reaction - by the director, of the audience, to the said leads - is usually one of hatred. The movie presents itself in such a way as if we're supposed to regard McMurphy, a criminal, as the hero - and Nurse Ratched as the villain.Every plot synopsis and summary of this movie labels Nurse Ratched as the villain. Am I missing something? Was it simply because she was an ironfisted authoritarian who donned like one facial expression the whole movie? In my opinion, the same traits that point to her being the villain made her the perfect disciplinarian to the deranged and belligerent. Her style is a reminder that reformation and restoration needs tough love. I don't think she deserved to get strangled the way she did, but that was one of the great scenes in this movie.Overall, it was an entertaining movie with much to learn from.

One of the most important movies that you'll see in your life. Some pieces of art are so important and so true that they can not be measured. Giving it a ten is a terrible shame, it needs more because it is one of the three or four movies that can make any human being, as chief said, as big as a mountain. And that is a beautiful thing. However, this is IMDb and it has to be analyzed as a film, so let's do it. It has a script that is just PERFECT. Acting so good that you have to concentrate really hard to pull yourself out of the spell to remember that these are actors. Directing so good that made this movie one of the most important movies of the twentieth century. A piece of art so good that makes you a better human being.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

The story begins to twist and spin in the most unexpected direction when finally all hell breaks loose and the audience is lost in a twirl of dramatic awe.When R.P. McMurphy fakes insanity to avoid prison, he screws around and has fun with the big joke.  But then the tables turn as reality is exposed to our little goof off and he resorts to wildness.This is not only the story of total irony (enrolling into an insane assylum healthy but then slowly turning mad, and more I could say that would spoil the movie) but of passion, tragedy and the will to live without a loved one to know your flaws.An excellent, emotional classic.  10/10.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

I was shocked, and till now, more than 20 years, I still think that, except ""The Godfather Saga"", it's the best movie ever made. May be you will be surprised, but my opinion, is that this is the best ANTI-COMMUNIST movie. Simply it shows, what crimes can be done in the name of ""taking care of the well-being"" of your subjects. Looking at Mrs.Fletcher as head nurse, I was thinking of Ceausescu.

Indeed, throughout most of the film, there was a strong theme being presented, and the film was well-made. At the end however, I expected there to be a great conclusion or a big pay-off.  But really, it kind of turned out to be an ""Of Mice and Men"" kind of story where two guys dream of going far away and living good lives. This did not really fit in with the movie.  However, another part of the conclusion was good where the main idea of the movie was strongly portrayed. I won't say what it is because I don't want to give any thing away, but it involves someone other than the main character dying.  So, I would say that the movie is good, but not great.

Mr. Taber (Lloyd) drops a cigarette in his pants cuff unknowingly, and it sets the pants on fire. When he reacts to the burning and danger by jumping around and yelling, he is dragged off and tied down.

However, after reading the book, my opinion has definitely diminished a bit. The screenplay seems to consist simply of events of action only. The best parts of the book were the emotional rollercoasters the patients go through. Most of the best parts of the book were completely left out erasing much of the battle between Ratchet and McMurphy. I also missed the use of p.o.v through Chief Bromden's eyes.

Even Jack Nicholson's edgy free spirit routine didn't convince me much.The portrayal of Nurse Ratched in particular is extremely disappointing; giving the character some depth, any glimmering of conscience or conflicted motive, might have redeemed the film. As it is she's little better than an extremely well-performed Disney villain, malevolent and rigid to the end. I can check out The Little Mermaid if I want that.If you want to feel oppressed by inherently corrupt authority figures, here's your movie. If you expected something that presents you with a moral dilemma, you'll come away disappointed.

The film is a good film, a separate entity to the book. When a director adapts a book to the big screen, a better film is made when they're not working within the boundaries of someone elses perception, after all, whats the point of having a carbon copy of the book on screen?

This is understandable, as when you watch the film the only conclusion you can make is that the chief is putting McMurphy out of his misery. This is not the intention I perceived the book to mean, but this is a review of the film.In all, this is a rather empty film. There isn't a lot of subtle change in the characters, which is a shame, as the more obvious changes leave the audience feeling confused (due to the lack of noticeable time lapse). This film also leaves questions unanswered, such as McMurphy's initial bet that he could break the big nurse within a week, and the doctor's love of fishing. There was also too much concentration on the board group, who really didn't do anything, and not enough development put into the Chief, the narrator of the whole story (originally).The character of Billy was the only emotional input into the film and maybe Harding's anger. The directors choice of condensing the story so a number of major events happen at once was questionable, but it worked well overall.My advice is not to judge the story based on the film. It really doesn't do the book justice and I recommend it to everyone.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Obviously the 159000 plus members who collectively rated it 8.8! It's hard to imagine how the Academy could have given Awards ( the big five no less ) to this over-long piece of pretentious nonsense. Giving the Oscar to Louise Fletcher for her performance has to be the all-time joke of the movie business. That much more able actresses had turned the role down speaks for itself. With the current lack of financial wisdom in the US in 2008, however, the film obviously had some serious irony up its sleeve to be kept for 33 years down the track. Fortunately since 1975, most Award seasons have seen logic and reason return to The Academy.

In addition to the movie's great spirit, the acting is fantastic. Jack Nicholson is at his best and Danny DeVito can be seen in his very first acting role ( which he absolutely triumphs in ). And of course, there's the unforgettable Chief Bromden. The directing by Milos Forman is very well-done, as the camera-work is excellent and follows the pace of the movie perfectly in how it is used. What really impressed me was the editing, especially as far as the use of audio goes: some parts just made me go ""...wow."" My only complaint is that I believe the movie could've been slightly more effective if it were based more closely on the novel at certain points, but the modified point of view of the film does make a great point; anyone who has ever hated their job, been accused of something, had some person so self-righteous and convinced of their own authority and dependency on order get in your way, or attended the American public school system at any point in their life should be able to identify with this movie.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Where does the line get drawn? and If McMurphy is mad then what are you?'The issue if insanity is essential for all humans to explore as we may be closer than we think to it at any given point in our lives. Not just old age! But like all great films, Milos Forman skilfully teases us and does not give any concrete answers. Like life itself, all is ambiguous and incomplete and mysterious.The story is warm yet cold, funny yet tragic, beautiful yet ugly, entertaining yet important. How did they do it?

678,PaulSmuts,Jack Nicholson's best yet!,10,19 June 2014,"I cannot overrate this movie. I watched it last night so I'm writing this review with it still fresh in mind. I had high expectations knowing all the rewards that rained down on it, but the film and Jack Nicholson's performance in particular still managed to surprise me.R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation after given a short sentence on a prison farm for statutory rape charges. He tries to make the most of his suspected short stay in the hospital and challenges the head nurse (Louise Fletcher) at every chance he gets.Anthony Hopkins has done a great intelligent psychopath, but no one does crazy better than Nicholson. I loved his performance in ""The Shining"" and am ashamed to say I have yet to see ""As Good as it Gets"" (one of three movies he won best actor Oscars for). He delivered an average performance in ""The Departed"" and isn't getting any younger, but I do hope he gives us at least one more role that comes close to the show he put on in Cuckoo's Nest. Watching his interaction with the other patients made me believe on some occasions I was seeing a comedy, but the movie quickly reminds us it can be just as depressing as it is funny.It's hard to find fault with ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". Louise Fletcher did a great job as the leading actress and strong performances by all the supporting characters made the movie brilliant. Good screenplay, good directing and the music by Jack Nitzsche played nicely with the film.I've seen some hate about the ending, but in my opinion it couldn't have been better. McMurthy could have jump out of the window when he had the chance and I think most of us were rooting for him to do so, but what he does next shows the strong bond formed with his odd friends inside the hospital.The movie left me emotionally blank for a while and then I just felt sad. I'm not going to drop any major spoilers on this site as I know some of you still haven't seen it, but it's one of the few movies that have truly left me staring at the end credits in awe.Conclusion:It ranks as one of the best in my book alongside ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". See this movie with the highest expectations and chances are it will surpass them!250moviereviews.wordpress.com",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
679,Mladen007,Great experience woven of different kinds of feelings,10,19 April 2017,"Sharp and shortThe movie is a true masterpiece directed by Milo Forman followed by brilliant performance by Jack Nicholson. It is about criminal who pleads insanity to avoid conflict with authorities after getting into trouble. As the result, they put him in a mental institution along the other patients and oppressive nurse beautifully portrayed by Louise Fletcher. He starts rebellion against the staff, particularly against the nurse. This movie shows us on a unique way, which combines drama, thriller and a little bit of comedy, how social system can destroy an individual and the rebellion against the stuff actually represents rebellion against the system. Window breaking at the end is really impressive considering parallel with real life. The point is: bad system, sooner or later, has to fall, with casualties. One decisive man is all you need to rally up the mass and start a revolution. There are some breathtaking scenes like McMurphy's returning from the treatment, playing basketball with other patients or acting like there is a baseball game going on the TV. This situations provoke different kinds of feelings in viewers which provides unrepeatable experience watching the movie. Acting is also the thing we have to mention multiple times because Jack and Louise (and not only those two) showed their best performances and made this movie and their roles unforgettable. Among the other movies which have same or similar subjects as the main theme, we can surely say that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the best and it must be considered like one of the best movies ever, not only in this genre.Perfect!",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Everything is great in this movie, but it lacks one important element that always satisfies me when I watch any kind of movie.NB: Because English is not my native language, perhaps I didn't understand the main idea of the movie. If so, please correct me. Until now however my review is a bit objective.Jack Nicolson rocks as well as every other thing. The missing element is the lack of resolution.The movie goes well, it tells you what's the problem is about. However, it does not solve the problem! Which means that the message is incomplete. Every movie must offer the problem to find the solution for it, but in this movie Jack Nicolson had the problem being sick, and all the time I've been expecting how he's going to get cured there. Though, I was disappointed.Probably the movie was meant to be realistic and surprise you with un-expected endings, but it's not about that. I noticed the problem the message of the movie is trying to reveal, where is the solution? That Jack Nicolson died? Is that it? Because of this crucial missing element, I couldn't give this movie more than 7. Perhaps the message is: Life Is Tough, but we all know that don't we?

The cast is simply amazing, Lloyd, Sampson, DeVito and the touching character of Billy ....... and being honest, who didn't want Nicholson to get rid of that nurse at the end ?

695,macacobranco,The best film ever made.,10,30 January 2000,"Jack Nicholson plays what is possibly his career best in this cinematic gem. In his trademark role as an unpredictable and slightly manic outsider, he plays an offender (Randle McMurphy) committed to a mental asylum, where he attempts to brighten up the regimented and empty lives of the unfortunate patients.A powerful moral current runs through the film, and the viewer becomes very involved in sharing McMurphy's frustration at being oppressed by the system, with its allotted medication times and electrocution for those who step out of line. The result is a very moving story, where you enjoy the highs of McMurphy's efforts (fishing trip, the World Series, party), but are contrastively disturbed by the lows.The characterization is excellent, and portrayed very well by a strong cast including Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito. The script allows this diverse selection of individual talents to come across very well.If this film doesn't hit you emotionally, then you are a psychopath and should be locked up for intense sessions of therapy yourself. This flick is made of powerful stuff. Really.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

It just goes to show that sometimes being put away and medicated isn't the only cure for people who are deemed insane.  Sometimes all it takes is just a change of pace and a little touch of personality which Jack Nicholson provides plenty.  This has to be one of my all-time favorite movies!  I gave it a 10.

I suppose having previous exposure to Kesey's work before seeing the movie spoiled me. I was expecting to see a great book made into a great movie. The movie Murphy was a totally different person than the book Murphy. The book Murphy instilled in the other patient a new found sense of self. In the movie, Murphy replaces the staff as the authority figure. The patients did what Murphy said, much the same as they did with the hospital staff.

Being in the IMDb top 250, I felt I owed the film further viewing, but this was only to disappoint me again! Don't get me wrong - I can appreciate the perhaps cutting edge setting of the film, & the raw emotional issues it tackles (in a particularly quirky way!), but I felt the screenplay overall was somewhat lacking. On the plus side, Nicholson & Fletcher fully deserved their Best Actor & Best Actress academy awards, with superb support from fellow inmates (noting especially Lloyd & Dourif, in what I believe was Dourif's first film?).

This movie greatly captures the human spirit and accurately shows the inner workings of something I think all of us feel in our lives. Nicholson portrays the rebellious patient so perfectly and gives us something we can relate to in one way or another, especially in the way he deals with the corrupt nurses and the hospital. He refuses to give in to their mold and continues to do what he believes in and does not conform in any way. This movie makes you feel a wide range of emotions when the credits roll, making you reflect on your life and the way you deal with others and your own life decisions. A truly special movie that is perfect in every way.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
703,shockz9,Brilliant film but...,8,27 November 2007,"For me, this film is very tough to rate because the book is one of my all-time favourites. So let's be fair, Nicholson gives an excellent performance as McMurphy, his chemistry with the other actors is great and really gets you, the viewer, on his side with his likable persona. The supporting cast also gives a strong performance, providing the perfect pitch of crazy that is required and Nurse Ratched providing an instantly unlikable presence. So, if i had seen this film without reading the book i would probably be able to give it a higher mark but...well now the problem begins because, you see, the novel is perfect and the film is not wholly true to the novel. The major thing that really bothered me right from the beginning was Nicholson. Nicholson could never be McMurphy truly because he just does not have the physical presence that is required for a rugged street fighter type, it was a battle he could never win. The other problem for me was that the darker side of McMurphy wasn't shown as well as it could have been, meaning that the character could (and should) have had more depth. Chief Brompton was cast perfectly though (his character could have been given more attention though). So in summary, great film, see it...but read the book first, even if it blights the film, its worth it!",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Legendary actors play as side characters and they do an amazing job of course. There isn't a single time I thought ""Huh... That seemed off."" actors that play as mental ill people are so natural you don't ever doubt them. Actresses that play as doctors are such real characters. Male nurses are so real aswell. You can feel their emotions, what they must feel like. You connect with every character.
In general I'm gonna give acting a 10/10Storyline is amazing aswell. There were a few times I felt boring but still the movie did an amazing job on story.This movie is so ahead of his time.

717,jc_yoshi_06,Analizing the movie,9,26 November 2007,"Many people who want to cheat the system fail in succeeding, for example Randal Mc Murphy, from the movie ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest"", tries to pass as a mentally ill patient but only ends with his death. As many movies have symbols that a reader can connect to, moral values are shown to make a movie meaningful ass well the movie can also have two characters which personalities stand out, and show a theme embraced by the actors, thus, creating a classic that will be shown to future generations for its values shown in the movie. From birth many parents teach their children moral values: Do not steal, no profanity, and always tell the truth, these are a few examples that can be used and remembered into shaping child's mind, later on creating a good citizen. As well as the opposite, some may not have had the chance to have a parental figure in their life so they can grow up emotionless and can end up a psychotic killer or a murderer(like Mc Murphy). In the movie, Mc Murphy lies his way through life and throughout his jail sentence and the mental ward showing how he only thinks about himself and always tries to beat the judicial system. As the lies continue to spread, Mc Murphy also manipulates the other patients and takes away their ""treats"" a manipulation that Nurse Ratched observes. Throughout the movie his behavior changes slightly as he shares the happiness of being free with his fellow friends from the mental ward. As moral values have been lost for Mc Murphy, the nurse Ratched has built a mental ward from values that create a friendly atmosphere and a place where communication is widely accepted. Nurse Ratched is the type of person who believes that all people are good or have good in them, and if they are mislead by vices or bad habits she can help them to a better path. As a nurturer, she takes care and lookouts for all the patients in the ward, even Mc Murphy. In the movie Nurse Ratched is viewed as the supreme authority, a figure that Mc Murphy is attracted to but at the same time despises a figure that Mc Murphy always tries to cheat and lie to. Mc Murphy can be viewed as the common thief, one who breaks all the rules, a rebel, a person who defies the authority and at the same time tries to cheat the justice system. A type of person who always looks for the easy way out, a person who through his behavior makes him always ends up with conflict with the authorities; he is also, in my opinion, a person who many people want to be but have a fear of being that person. Due to moral values and how society views these ""rebels"" the type of behavior Mc Murphy shows is repressed in us. His behavior makes him have an assault-battery-rape convict that makes him find an alternate choice to finishing his jail sentence. His behavior then changes to a caring friend, a friend who the whole ward admires, an admiration that made the Chief (the mute) talk. With these new friendships he puts all his attention on the Chief; he is the only person that understands Mc Murphy and also wants to be free from the ward, the medicine, and especially the other patients. The theme is based on how cheating the system can never happen without worse consequences happening. An act that punishes the person who tries to beat or cheat the system, for example, Mc Murphy, his jail sentence was actually made longer because his stay in the mental ward would be for life. As he finally understood how his plan fell apart he did not use his judgment but instead went on an impulse to flee from the ward. A thought that Mc Murphy could not stand, a thought that made him make foolish decisions to jeopardize his plan of escape. As time comes and goes, the moral values that have been shown throughout the movie will forever stay with me. The lesson learned here can make me choose between learning from Mc Murphy's mistake or learning the hard way and ending up dead from the foolish choice of trying to beat the system. The characters created an environment that in an odd way I related to them by showing how Mc Murphy is part of me that is trapped inside held by a conscience and high moral values that were thought to me.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

722,usman4673-578-963125,Jack Nicholson plays McMurphy as if he were born to it in this hilarious and heartbreaking classic.,10,25 November 2009,"McMurphy is an Irish-American brawler found culpable of battery and gambling. He is a Korean War veteran who was also held as a prisoner of war. He is sentenced to a fairly short prison term, and decides to have himself declared insane in order to be shifted to a mental institution, where he expects to serve the rest of his time in comfort and luxury.Randle Patrick McMurphy appears on the well-organized and claustrophobic scene of the psychiatric ward like a bolt from the blue in the movie, ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest."" He is a sharp-witted, elegant, aggressive, and an energetic person who always challenges the status quo from day one. He introduces himself to all and sundry in the ward, shakes hands and fills the silence with loud laughter. He is perhaps not mentally ill; he has chosen to be sent to the psychiatric hospital because he did not like to work on the prison farm, where he had six months to go before his discharge. The desirability of the psychiatric hospital for him was the idea of enjoying better food and a trouble-free lifestyle. This is not exactly what he actually gets.McMurphy has brought a touch of normalcy in the general atmosphere of the ward with his sense of humor and rebellious voice. He instantly engages in a long, hopeless, and endless battle with a ""Big Nurse"". What Nurse Ratched wants is a group of passive and silent men who do not offend or query how she has ordered things. It is their incarceration, voluntary or otherwise, upon which her job and role in life depends. Hence, McMurphy is the ultimate threat—a nonconformist who encourages the residents into a desire for action. He provokes them up out of the lifelessness and dullness in which they have been dwelling. In fact, he provides them with the creation of a treatment to their problems. The more victorious McMurphy is at disturbing the status quo, the more severe the battle becomes between him and Nurse Ratched. McMurphy is a very funny character but the humor ends when he discovers that Big Nurse has complete control over his fate—over what treatment he receives and when he is discharged. What starts as a boisterous mutiny against authority becomes a calamity. McMurphy is repetitively subjected to electric shock therapy. He manages to joke about it and to gather the strength to arrange a fishing expedition for some of the men. Finally, he makes a plan to escape one night but before that he invites everyone to a night of drinking and partying in the ward. The drunken orgy, complete with prostitutes, turns into a debacle and becomes the cause of his demise. Big Nurse comes to know about the party and sends him for electro-shock treatment. He returns lobotomized, as a human vegetable, after the therapy. All the lights in his bright mind and brave personality have been extinguished due to continual electro-shock therapy. Afterwards, his trusted friend ""Chief"" asphyxiates him with a pillow and saves half-living McMurphy from sinking into a vegetative existence. In spite of his final degradation to a vegetative state, he wins the fight for freedom that he has fought so courageously.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Is trail was over and the doctors had concluded that he is not crazy but Nurse Ratchet, played by Louise Fletcher, thought otherwise and suggested that he should stay so they can heal him. While in the institution he met a deaf huge Indian named Chief Bromden, played by Will Sampson. Later he found out that McMurphy found out that he was faking it. Together they planed an escape.

I read the book before I watched the movie and when I do that I try really hard to keep my opinions on the two mediums separate. I understand that what works well in a book can't work for a film and vice versa. The movie is a really great adaptation. All the performances are fantastic (especially Jack Nicholson's) and it just looks really great. But, and here's my issue, the ending of the movie doesn't fit.

Now, the scene plays out exactly like it does in the book which was great to watch but it just doesn't fit with the movie. One thing they changed was the point of view. The book is told from Chief's point of view and is ultimately his story of how he grows through watching R.P. McMurphy. The movie, on the other hand, is changed to be R.P. McMurphy's story. But the ending is the same. The movie, which is about McMurphy, ends with Chief's redemption. If they just fixed the ending to fit better with McMurphy's story then the movie could be perfect.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

730,amygirl-319-383662,An All-Time Classic!,9,19 March 2012,"This is one of the movies that changed the landscape of motion pictures forever.Jack Nicholson appears after his first big role in ""Chinatown"" and shines. Milos Forman's creation has to be praised- a mixture of drama and comedy fulfilled with deep emotions. Forman presents a whole new world, a world behind ""the Wall"". There is one enthusiastic person who tries to destroy, or better, avoid this barrier, but finally fails. Like the political scene in the middle 70's in Europe, two different worlds separated, causing so much pain and trouble for a ordinary person. Inside ""the Wall"" the regime dictates and jeopardizes the basic thoughts of democracy and freedom. Formans great talent to find a balanced story, which enters deeply inside of you; and a remarkable cast of Nicholson, Fletcher, DeVito and Redfield all together make a winning formula.This film was a prototype of all the modern movies made after it, from the ""Rain Man"", to the ""Deer Hunter"" to the modern ""Girl. Interrupted"".Forman and Kubrick led us into a new era of film, as the real leaders of modern Cinema.This is the one of ten or twenty movies you MUST SEE. 9 of 10 easy.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

It demonstrated that an honest individual who is funny, who defends himself, who enjoys life, who is always himself is often punished and destroyed by other people... It's only one the strongest impression about this great movie among others I have. This is neither comedy nor tragedy but is a tragicomedy which makes it even more realistic since our life is just that... Another strongest idea: good intentions in fact are horrible, they may lead to deadly consequences like we saw in this masterpiece...",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

The way Jack and Nurse Ratchett can seamlessly snap between crazy and bizarre is amazing and illusive on screen. The characters aren't static either, we see some normal people amongst a bunch of loony-bins which makes it not so predictable, despite the somewhat obvious name. I think in terms of script, there were some pure gold in terms of lines and words. I found myself taking notes and finding it nearly impossible not to go away laughing about some of the catch- phrases! I think that anyone hoping to act should watch this for this reason. If you are not an actor or performer, make sure you see it anyway. You will be purely entertained, so much so.

Firstly to any of you who didn't know, this movie was a remake of the book written by Ken Kesey, who refused to work on the screenplay because it would not be told in the same way as the book. If you had read the book you would understand my reasoning. The movie is one of the worst portrayals of a book that I have ever seen. They left so many details out of the movie that were in the book. Two Thumbs down, hopefully this crap will again be remade into something way better than what this is. This should not have been nominated for best picture (1975), and should not have won. The actors who got career boosts from this movie should feel ashamed for working in such a horrible movie and benefiting from it.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
734,marifquintela,Brilliant,10,6 January 2013,"Watching ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" was an experience. It's impossible not to feel sympathetic towards those ""crazy"" men. At the end, they don't seem crazy at all. That evil nurse is crazy, that one is. Well, I guess we are not supposed to find out if McMurphy was crazy or not, or if his friends were, if there is such a thing as to be crazy. We just sympathize with them enough to see the institution as an enemy. Are they really? Aren't they right after all, trying to control the situation? Well, if they are, I don't want to know. Law can be an awful thing, and that institution was merciless law. This movie is about freedom, about friendship, about going after what you think is right. Madness is only a concept that we use to explain what we don't understand. Life is out there for us to live. There will be consequencesbut there would always be. The final scene is simply unforgettable.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Why? Does this movie get so much hype? First of all, all the yelling, hootin', and hollering was ridiculous. I had to keep turning it down, it was so loud. Unnecessarily loud. Second of all, what was the storyline, the point? There wasn't one. No cohesiveness. Too random. Third of all, Rached had barely any screen time, and she wasn't over the top mean and all that. Like, at all. I was expecting scenes with her being a tyrant. I don't get it. She didn't do crap to them, except follow and carry out the simple rules. Fourth of all, the acting was pretty good, I'll give it that, but that's all I'll give it. The standards must've been pretty low back then. But, I've always heard throughout my 44 years of existence, how amazing this movie is and whatnot. Meh. At least i can say that I have seen it (take note, it's not, nor ever, I SEEN, don't forget the HAVE) and I can cross it off my list. Definitely giving this one thumbs down.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
736,jsplenda,Simply Fantastic,10,3 January 2005,"In my opinion, this classical masterpiece is the second greatest movie of all time (behind The Godfather). Jack Nicholson gives a tremendous performance in this funny, dramatic, tear-jerking classic. He plays the perfect role and captures it beautifully. By the way, Louise Fletcher was absolutely fabulous also. You just wanted to break her neck during the whole movie. That is a sign of great acting. The final scene is so heart-warming and sad that you can't help but cry and feel good at the same time. There is no doubt in my mind that Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, and Milos Forman (director) all deserved Oscars for this wonderful, dramatic movie!",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Although direction is very good, actors (All of them) have performed superbly, but the basic thing is storyline which in this movie is totally disappointing specially looking to the rating of this movie. There is no background or object of storyline. Extremely meaningless ending. In fact it is the end of the movie that virtually ruined each and every beautiful aspect of this movie which otherwise could have been a masterpiece. A beautiful Ferrari destroyed in accident with dirty hogs. This movie certainly does not deserve so high rating.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
738,kspit-1,One of the best movies ever made. A true masterpiece.,10,1 April 2005,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" has won the Grand Slam of in the Academy Awards of 1975 (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Screenplay) against stiff opposition and this is not for nothing. This movie, directed by Milos Forman, is a true masterpiece of human emotion and its themes of individual liberty creativity are universal and far-stretching. Although this movie is about a mental hospital, its themes are applicable to everything in our daily lives. R.P. McMurphy, superbly portrayed by Jack Nicholson (definitely his best role) who ""fights and *ucks too much"" is classified as mentally instable and sent to a mental asylum, exactly in the ward of Ms Ratched. Ratched is a control-freak and very old-fashioned, but she truly believes that she is helping her patients to get better. She is not Evil with a capital ""E"" and this one of the themes of the movie: How human beings can do harm to others without even knowing, actually thinking they're doing the right thing. McMurphy, fond of his personal freedom and creativity instills a sense of liberty and rebellion into his fellow ward companions, whose character is entirely imprisoned by the Ratched's engulfing persona. He gives them a confidence boost in their own abilities and tells them (in most cases rightly so) that they're not ""crazier than the average man in the street"". We get to know that the patients are staying willingly at the hospital and if they want they can quit. McMurphy is shocked when learning this, and so is the audience viewing the film. We ask ourselves - ""why are they staying here, caged?"". McMurphy tries to make his new friends liberate themselves and pursue a new active life. He is willing to risk his own freedom in order to achieve this goal - and in the end, he pays hard for it, although his aim is achieved. At the end of the movie, we have mixed feelings and strong emotions - we can both cry and cheer.The acting and direction are top-notch, and the music at the end gives the ending an edge you'll find hard to forget. ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" was based on a book of the same name, written by Ken Kesey. Find it and read it. And for God's sake, buy this movie, see it and cherish it for all your life.10/10 - I just wish more movies like ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" were made.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
739,BluebirdSeventeen,Fantastic film - heavy but moments of great humour,10,13 April 2014,"I watched this movie last night for the first time. Today I just can't get this movie out of my head! It was completely brilliant - superbly acted, fantastic script, and priceless humor mixed with some real hard and tormenting messages about the treatment inside the mental health institute.Jack Nicholson was riveting to watch. He played the pragmatist, Mr McMurphy. Ultimately he was incredibly genuine, broke all the boundaries, and brought out his comical humour to slice through the most troubling and tense of moments. Mrs Ratched - I didn't know what to think of her at first... it took me a while to work out what her intentions were. I thought it was brilliant how the director, Milos Forman, gradually revealed this antagonist's true colours, because on first impressions you believe she is just doing a difficult job. Well at least I didn't realise what a sour sweet she was!But the one word I came away feeling to describe her - suffocating. Watching this movie you feel trapped, dominated and oppressed by her unreadable expression, her persistent interrogating techniques used in ""therapy"", and her need for total control. You get a very uncomfortable feeling of powerlessness to her robotic, squashing and crushing demeanor. Very hard to watch in some places. Her group ""therapy"" with the stuttering Billy being one which sticks out in my mind. Enough to make you need therapy! Was she pure evil, incredibly ill-informed, or a dictator on a power trip? Must say my favorite scene was the basketball match with the ""deaf and dumb"" Indian giant, Chief, running up and down the court, completely annihilating the opponents as he put into practice the 'arms up' movement that Jack Nicholson had taught him early. A great cinematic moment! 10 out of 10.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
740,BigLikesTalkies,"Nicholson shines in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""",8,25 August 2014,"While watching Milos Foreman's ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", it occurred to me that I've been on a real psych movie kick lately. Shutter Island, Good Will Hunting, Cuckoo's Nest...I even caught myself looking at YouTube videos of Titicut Follies the other day. Psychiatry is often portrayed in a negative light in the media-- as a field of medicine where pedophiles and monsters pump their patients full of pills and electroshock while caging them like animals. While the field has come a long way in the last hundred years, the early 20th century was marred with highly dangerous and pseudo scientific procedures and patterns of inhumane treatment toward patients. ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is, among other things, a commentary on the barbarism of mid-century psychiatry.An adaptation of the classic anti-establishment novel by Ken Kesey, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" follows the free-spirited criminal Randall McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) as he is being admitted to an Oregan mental hospital. Randall aims to be declared insane so that he may ride out his short prison term in what he feels will be a comparatively comfortable setting. McMurphy is put in a ward with quite an eclectic cast of characters including the 6'5"" Native American ""Chief"" Bromden (Will Sampson), stuttering suicidal Billy Bibbit (Brad Douriff, who would later go on to play Wormtongue in the Lord of the Rings movies), the diminutive Mr. Martini (Danny DeVito, a connection I didn't notice until well over halfway through the movie!) and the spastic ""Taber"" (Christopher Lloyd). Shortly after his admission to the hospital, McMurphy begins to notice that many of the patients are being abused and degraded, kept in submission by the tyrannical and calculating Head Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). McMurphy bands together with the other patients in his ward to mount a rebellion against the oppressive Ratched, causing more than a few riotous moments.This film is intellectual gold. Aside from being immensely culturally relevant (a strong theme of individuality v. authority/establishment is felt throughout) the film is a scathing commentary on the state of mental health treatment in the 1960's (Ken Kesey based the story on his experience working in a VA Hospital in Palo Alto, California). The means and methods of treatment were inelegant and at times did more harm than good, while patients were stripped of their individuality and reduced to helpless subhuman husks of men in hospital Johnny coats. The dialog is smart, the direction is spot on (a number of the extras were actual mental patients, and the actors supposedly stayed in character between takes). The film lacks any true emotional content, save for the final scene, but overall I found it to be thoroughly satisfying.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
741,danny_collinge,Brilliant!!!,10,5 August 2005,"This movie is awesome, Jack Nicholson is amazing and fully deserves the awards he got from this film, i cant imagine anyone who could have played the part better - the role of McMurphy was originally offered to James Caan (Godfather,Misery). other star performers in this movie are: William Redfield (who died a a few months after the film was released), Louise Fletcher, Danny Divito, William Duell, Josip Elic, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. This movie has everything a good story, good acting, comedy, sad parts and a great ending. one flew over the cuckoos nest is totally different to any other film i've seen before which is amazing because it came out in 1975, I'm surprised no one has made anything like this because it was such a big movie when it first came out( won 5 Oscars.

742,brogan-stanford,Oh Nicholson,9,7 December 2014,"Jack Nicholson's mere presence in this picture was enough to bring this production to the screen, after the novel written by Ken Kesey was dubbed as 'unfilmable'; once Nicholson had his name on the contract, Hollywood took over. Nicholson's performance granted him an Oscar with acknowledgements that he was born to play the role of a misfit gone crazy when admitted into an insane asylum. The picture was moving yet simple and funny and was labelled as a dramatic masterpiece as it highlighted society's distorted outlook on the 'mentally unstable' and eventually won the 'top five' Oscars and was the second film in history to do so. This could never have been achieved if Nicholson's reputation had not got the ball rolling on this project in the first place. This picture was rightly the definition of the character that Nicholson should play and made him the top choice to play Jack Torrance in The Shining and the Joker in the 1989 interpretation of Batman.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

You almost feel like you are one of the characters, or you want to be one of them at least...because they're having so much fun in their roles and they're putting so much enthusiasm at every moment. It's not like they are acting, they literally are living in that mental institution!! Jack Nicholson's best movie in my opinion and he shines throughout the movie. He plays the role with his flesh and mind and soul(with everything he got), he made every effort to help this movie stay a masterpiece forever. In other words, every time you watch the movie, it gets better and better, you start to appreciate the details of the film more...It's not like Fight Club or Memento, (or any other flashy good movies of 1990s and 2000s).

He's an extroverted man and he always sees his fellow patients as his teammates.From that spirit he makes them very happy and he is the life force to them.He teaches how to think out of the frame.It is the best way to cure mentally unstable people but the hospital crew do not understand that reality.So hospital gives him a lobotomy, which put him into a vegetative state, rendering him silent and motionless.That is the true nature of rudimentary society.If there is a man who thinks differently ,society do not trust him.They all blame him and they force him to believe in conventional society believes.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
758,gollum_1600,Disappointing,6,29 April 2006,"I read the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in my Messages in Film class at school. I adored it. What an amazing story! The characters were captivating and well developed. It is one of the best books I had ever read. Then, my teacher says we are going to watch the movie. She told us about how great it was and all the Academy Awards it had won, and I was excited. I didn't really expect it to be able to live up to the book, but I knew it would still be a good film. I even got on this website, and low and behold, it is the number 12 movie of ALL TIME! I was surprised and now my expectations were a little higher. Then I watched the movie. I was shocked at how horrible of an adaptation it was. Not only that, but even if you completely forgot about the book, it was not even a good film! Where was the Christ imagery? McMurphy is the embodiment (other than his love of women) of Jesus Christ in the book. He lays down his life for the good of the other men. By the time McMurphy is wheeled back into the ward after the lobotomy in the book, all the men are gone except Chief and two others. Why? Because he gave the men strength enough to realize they did not need this place! He sacrificed himself FOR A REASON! In the movie, all the men are still in the ward! What was the reason for his sacrifice then? Also, why are the men so hateful towards each other in the movie? In the book, they band together as brothers. Again, in the movie the Chief takes a back seat. He does not even come along for the boat ride. Without delving into the Chief, you miss the whole point of the book: The Combine. The book was about the sacrifice of one man to rid one small part of the world of evil and totalitarianism. They don't even scratch the surface of an evil reign in the movie.

But Milos Foreman's One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is the best film EVER made. It is a tragic and hilarious. Touching and moving. It is both drama and comedy and balances it well.Nicholson gives the performance of his career he deserved his award as did Fletcher. True this was Nicholson's film but he certainly was not my favorite character. That title belongs to the character of good ol' Charlie Cheswick. He was warm and moving and equally naive. Cheswick stole just about all of the scenes he was in.This film usually has to suffer the debate of whether this or Jaws was better. Yes Jaws changed the summer blockbuster, was Steven Spielberg's masterpiece and is remembered more but the Academy Awards was 100% right in choosing this as the best picture of 1975. It is by far a superior picture. Not to say Jaws is bad but this film is the king of the motion picture industry.The bottom line is this is my favorite film and will always be because of it's authenticity ( real mental institution patients were used) and it's tragicly funny story. In my opinion it is the definitive masterpiece, classic and number 1.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

The main reason for this comment is a response to a couple of the other comments. Other people said "" I didnt think nurse Ratchett was that bad, she's was just doing her job."" What a bunch of crap. Watch the movie and find out that Nicholson should have been the nurse there. He's the only one there providing any help toward the other patients. If you notice the nurse sees the positive response to Nicholson by the the other patients that she is very jealous! Ratchett insists everytime to keep Nicholson in the asylum longer when the rest of the Board is completely convinced he is normal. Even Nicholson proves most of the patients in the asylum aren't even close to being insane. It's just the sedating drugs and shock treatments that mess them up. And nurse Ratchett gets off on all of it. I swear if you watch this movie and don't want to beat the nurse in the head there's something wrong with you! She played that part awesome!

But this one still stands out. Has anyone ever given a more involving, believable, bloody perfect performance than Jack does as Randall P. McMurphy? The whole cast are great, of course. What ever happened to Brad Dourif (apart from Bride of Chucky)? It's the greatest mix of pure sadness and riotous comedy ever. If you're a human being, you can't fail to respond to this masterpiece.

McMurphy doesn't steal the bus to go fishing, in fact, it was suggested as a field trip, to which Nurse Ratched agreed to if he brought enough men.This movie is one of the worst adaptations from a book I have ever watched.

In the movie there wasn't that many songs present and I honestly didn't even notice the music in the beginning, after the movie I did realize where the music was placed.

In the book, it was very detailed and more menaful to read rather than watching the movie that left out or didn't convey the details that were very known in the book. The movie is in a different perspective rather than the book and I don't feel the movie was as effective than the book. The music, was very drab and didn't get me into the scene that it was playing in because it didn't fit the scene it was playing in. In the beginning, the music that played was very displeasing to listen to. One the rather hand, the actors, especially McMurphy who was played by Jack Nicholson, really portrayed their characters of the movie. Along with McMurphy, Ms. Ratched, Martini, Billy Bibbit, and Chief were the characters that stuck out the most to me with their acting because of how well they showed their characters to be.

The asylum is the world, and the hospital staff represents the authority.Which (despite first belief) is not negative.It's just a form of control, being seen from the rebel's view becomes negative.BUT,keeping a cold shoulder,there is no evil or despotic act being taken by nurse Ratchet.She acted just as any authority would in order to keep control,trying to please majority(for example the ""vote for world series"" scene).An important plot-point of the movie is when McMurphy finds out that most of the loonies are free to walk anytime, but,although unsatisfied,they prefer to remain within the asylum.Just as people in real life, prefer cold-rusty-confort, fearing a change.There are two rebels, but total-opposite types, hwo deny the system in their own way.One is McMurphy, the revolt-rising-rebel,a man of action,a lover of life (with all it's flaws & vices),that's motto is ""at least I tried"". And the other is ""Chief"" Brandon,the quiet-rebel, that locked himself away from the world.That's why the two become friends. McMurphy tries to set a change, and soon becomes a sort of spiritual leader and model for the rest of the group, threatening Ratchet's control.He is off-course put at ease, because in the end, ""the system"" will always reprime the individual.

785,trammee2,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,10,3 July 2006,"In the movie One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, Jack Nicholson, played the role of Randle McMurphy. McMurphy, who was a criminal that was sentenced for a short term in prison, decided to declare himself insane so that he can be placed into a mental institution. The reason that he does this is to have an opportunity to live in comfort and luxury rather than the harsh life in prison. To his surprise, McMurphy experience there was completely different from what he had expected.When McMurphy first met nurse Ratched, they both knew they were going to be each others enemies. I see Nurse Ratched as more of an authority figure who wants correct human behavior while McMurphy on the other hand, likes to do things as he please. I think that because he wants to make her more aggravated, he tries to teach the patients new things that she would not approve. He questions why the patients on why they would want to waste their life in such an institution when there is such a big world out there where there are some people who are even crazier. The story ends with a tragic ending. The nurse's authoritative behavior ultimately led to the death of a patient which also connected to the death of McMurphy in the end. After the chief kills McMurphy out of mercy, he then breaks the window and left the ward. A free man just like how McMurphy has always wanted them to be.

787,bparnelly,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ben Parnell,9,22 January 2020,"The movie One Flew the Cuckoo's Nest is based on the novel written by Ken Kesey in 1962. This film is set in an Oregon psychiatric hospital with star, Jack Nicholson as Randle McMurphy, a new patient at the mental institution. McMurphy, a convict who has himself transferred to a state mental institution, throughout the movie he illustrates a stunningly persuasive portrait of a preeminently sane man being pushed to the outer limits of his sanity.This film takes place in 1959, when mental institutions were not only unfair and cruel to their patients but the outside world around these hospitals were completely unaware of what was happening within these facilities. It was believed that mental illness was caused by possession of demons and witchcraft based off of their abnormal behaviors that they did not understand. Novelist Ken Kesey made this novel one of the best sellers of the 1960's from his time working the ""graveyard shift"" as an orderly at a mental facility. He not only spoke to patients within the institution, he also voluntarily took psychoactive drugs like LSD as a part of the CIA mind control program to ""become an advocate to use these drugs as a path to individual freedom"". Academy award winner for best director of the film, Milos Forman, uses main character McMurphy to represent freedom and self-determination which oppresses the ward controlled by Nurse Ratched by protesting the rules of the institution with manipulation of the system to his advantage. He begins by getting transferred for evaluation from a prison farm to a mental institution assuming that it will be a less restrictive environment but is shortly mistaken when he faces the iron fist of Nurse Ratched who runs the psychiatric ward keeping her patients cowed through mental abuse, medication, and electric shock therapy maintaining a permanently grip on the mentally ill creating a harsh reality for the viewers of the film being how it was back then.
Later, the film pieces itself together and reveals McMurphy, Chief, and Cheswick are the only non-chronic patients sentenced to stay in the institution as the rest are self-committed and could voluntarily leave at any time. Whether their insane or not, the hospital is undeniably in control of the fates of its patients. When he takes the group of patients fishing, he symbolizes Christ leading his twelve disciples to the sea to ""test their faith"" as he brings these men out into the real world to experience what freedom feels like.
The movie peaks when McMurphy sneaks two women, Candy and Rose, into the ward bribing the night guard to throw a secret christmas party for the night because of Nurse Ratched's absence. After partying all night McMurphy and Chief prepare to escape the hospital once again they invite Billy but he refuses. Ratchet arrives in the morning to find the ward in complete disarray with most of the patients passed out drunk. Meanwhile moments later, McMurphy is once again trying to escape while Billy commits suicide he stops and flies into a rage and pins Ratched to the floor, choking her with both hands until one of the guards knock him out. As Ratched comes back to the ward with a neck brace and scratchy voice, rumors spread that McMurphy has escaped in order to avoid being taken ""upstairs"" but later in the night he is returned to his bed. Chief hovers over McMurphys bed as hes sleeping and notices he's completely limp and unresponsive. He then flips his head up and discovers the lobotomy scars on his forehead.
The movie comes to an end when the viewers see this emotional ending to the movie when Chief smothers McMurphy with a pillow in an act of mercy but resolves when he is finally able to lift the hydrotherapy foundation out of the floor and throws it through the window and escapes into the night, cheered on by all McMurphys fellow patients, ending the movie in a sad but resolved state. The film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a one of a kind movie created over 30 years ago but still carries the message that masculinity can be degraded just as easily as anything else which clearly spoke to the audience that watched this film, giving it the awards that it achieved.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

789,klinknerrachel,"Cast, Soundtrack, Quality of Acting",9,20 February 2020,"Milos Forman's 1975 film ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" would receive a four out of five stars because of the cast, soundtrack, and quality of acting. Casting Jack Nicholson as McMurphy was a quality choice by the director. Jack Nicholson portrayed McMurphy's strong stature and nature in the book through his presence and behavior on the ward. However, I was expecting McMurphy to be a bit larger and broader as described in the book. Other actors in the movies such as, Louise Fletcher who played Nurse Ratched, was not what I was expecting. As a reader one imagines Nurse Ratched as an older, heavier-set, ornery woman, only to find her middle-aged and average sized in the movie. Another essential factor in the film was the soundtrack. A movie's soundtrack is crucial in order to provoke the emotions of a viewer. Music is a tool to set the mood of a scene or build towards the climax of the plot. Taking a look at this film's soundtrack, I find that the musical selections chosen were well-thought out choices. The edgy nature of the film extends into the score, giving it a profoundly disturbing feel at times. The music has a tendency to always be a little off-kilter, and from time to time it tilts completely over into a strange little world of its own. Jack Nitzsche, the composer of the soundtrack, did an outstanding job creating a soundtrack that assists in illustrating the life of patients in a mental institute. The quality of acting throughout the film is also exceptional. The acting among the characters is very believable and thought provoking. Sydney Lassick, who plays Mr. Cheswick, developed a character with whom the audience fell in love with his quirky, kind, and loyal demeanor. All actors and actresses produced a film that vividly showed life at a physiatric ward. The emotions fixed on the actors' faces made the audience feel those emotions too. In conclusion, the film ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" was an overall outstanding film earning a four out of five stars.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

The film dares to be a tragedy on the human level. Life is often not pretty. Neither is this story. It is moving - deeply.

But I have watched it now and I most certainly agree that it's very deserving of the praise that it gets.The movie surely made me think about the biggest ideal of mankind - freedom. How the movie portrays McMurphy's view of freedom, how he changes opinions of other patients, and leads them to freedom. It asks us the same question as the characters, like doctors and nurses, in the movie are asked - Is McMurphy really crazy?So...Is he crazy? All he wants is freedom: freedom to watch sports whenever he wants and to have relationships, to walk freely, maybe go fishing. Can we blame someone for wanting to live according to his own desires? We empathize with McMurphy, maybe because we can all understand that desire to live freely. And also we grow to hate the person who takes it away from him along with the character,and that is probably nurse Ratched. Yes, she isn't fully responsible for all the things that happened to McMurphy, but she is a visible obstacle for him, keeping him away from what he wants. She plays with McMurphy and drives him to insanity, all so he can't ever get what he wants.The true desire, him being so sure of himself and being confident, gave other patients hope, but it affected the Chief most. We can see that in the ending, which was absolutely beautiful. I can't lie, it teared me up.Also I want to mention that the music was AMAZING, Jack Nitzsche really portrayed the feel and the energy of the movie very well, with beautiful sounds of the cuckoo. I want to say this is a big contribution to film music, especially in the 20th century.Amazing movie, a must-see film, 9/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

The film opens on a wide shot of a beautiful landscape, a car in the distance, we watch as the car makes it's way towards us and it offers a moment to reflect on the freedom of what we are seeing, for we will soon be incarcerated with mental's all around...But I'll just stick to the main thing that moves me about this film. For me this film is all about a word, a word which I've never understood, I've asked many people throughout my life to explain themselves when using this word, that's a lot because people throw it around sometimes like it means something, but no one has ever been able to even try and explain what in the giant hole in the ground it means. The word is 'normal', we've all had our normality questioned at some point, whether it's talking, walking, eating, sleeping, jumping or uni-cycling across the Grand Canyon. This leads people, some more than others, to question if they are 'normal', some people don't realise straight away that 'normal' is a bullshit word made up by bullshitters to bullshit the bullshitable.The film covers Randell P. McMurphy (Mac) , a smart ars con who get's himself put in a mental asylum thinking it will be easier to serve time there than in prison. He meets a group of characters who are so different yet most of them are the same, they are all terrified of the world. Insert an extreme extrovert in with a bunch of extreme introverts and you know it's going to be fun. All the characters are brilliant and fascinating and I could right separate reviews for them all, but let's stick to the film. The film only leaves the confines of the asylum a few times but for the most part it is in one area, the ward, so it's dialogue that drives this film and each scene is a revelation into the mind of the other characters, right from the get go we have a firm idea of what Mac is all about, as he is uncuffed and transferred from police custody he jumps in the air whooping and plants a smacker on the unamused officers cheek. Right from this point I thought ""Yep, I like this guy"". We are introduced to our first crazy, Chief, Mac attempts conversation but is told by Billy, a young boy with a stutter he is a deaf and dumb Indian. The rest of the characters we get to know through 'therapy sessions' conducted by the films 'bad guy', Nurse Ratchet, if the name Ratchet doesn't give you a clue, she is the controlling and oppressive Head Nurse who seems to take quiet but extreme pleasure in driving this group of men under her heel, in this film both she and Mac meet their match in each other. The first act is Mac trying to annoy Nurse Ratchet, objecting to music and trying to change schedule in order to watch baseball, he meets resistance not only directly form Nurse Ratchet, but the men he finds himself trapped with, having been fed drugs and calmly beaten into submission they are unable (at first) to smell the freedom offered by Mac. The turning point in the film comes when one of the guards reveals when taunted by Mac, that unlike prison, he will not be released until the powers that be (whom include Ratchet) decide he is sane. This presents a problem considering the fact he has made people think he is insane in order to be committed. This leads us to the most powerful point of the film (for me). Mac confronts the other patients for not telling him this was the case. It is then reveled that most of the patients are in the hospital voluntarily and can leave whenever they want.This for me is the heart of the film, most of these characters have deemed themselves insane and are hiding themselves from the world. Now while crazy people do indeed exist, these guys merely think they are because of societies selfish and mean nature. Instead of embracing bad experiences in their lives, learning, dusting themselves off and moving on they took it as a sign they weren't fit to live as everyone else does. Billy is the prime example of this, a stutter will make anyone self conscious and he tells stories of a love life which stutters like his speech, he is not insane, unless you count wearing your heart on your sleeve a reason to break out the butterfly nets, but from my experience a great many people will tell you that is a wonderful characteristic. So he commits himself thinking it's for the best and Nurse Ratchet, instead of helping him, indulges this belief for her own bloated ego and allowing him to deny himself all life has to offer out of fear.We all know the end shot of this film, even if it's through the Simpsons references it's got over the years of Chief breaking through the window and running to freedom. Chief is the biggest introvert (literally and figuratively) that has ever been, choosing not to speak, cutting himself off from the world and just not taking part. (Aside from brushing the floor) But in meeting Mac, he sees the error of his ways and offers hope for us all by finding the strength to break free from societies conventions and labels and small mindedness. That's why I love this film, it remind me of the word 'normal' and the fact this an insane world, and I'm proud to be a part of it.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

And so when I finished reading One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, I rented the movie, because I heard that it is one of the greatest films ever made. The characters are well cast and Nicholson's performance is haunting, but I was too distracted by all the deviations from Ken Kesey's novel to enjoy it fully. I recommend this film, but would strongly suggest that anyone touched by it should read the book afterward.

Nurse Ratched is perhaps one of the greatest and yet most underrated movie villains in cinema history; power-hungry, controlling, and tyrannical, she stops at nothing to prevent McMurphy from bringing joy, or to a degree, the real world into the lives of these detained misfits. Nicholson is the perfect rebel, one has to wonder whether he is truly crazy, or so sane he can no longer take the insanity of the medical staff and establishment. This movie is as close to perfect as i've ever seen. One of only three movies to win the big five academy awards, this movie is most certainly my favorite.

814,yntalamagkas,Has been voted as one of the best movies ever and is worth it,9,1 April 2007,"My comments summarised in one word: Amazing. It is not only Jack Nicholson's acting, but it is also the storyline and its absolutely brilliant ending. How often have you watch a movie that made you look into wikipedia or search the internet to find more information about the facts/ practices depicted on the movie? Rarely. Be certain that this will be one of them!It is the acting of all of the cast, the screenplay and the very realistic representation of the life inside a mental asylum that gets you absorbed into the movie. You can see how some people hold a place of responsibility (nurse Mildred Ratched) while they clearly shouldn't be there. Does this happen in real life? Certainly it does. Does the picturing of the asylum represent real world situations? Yet it does. Does the acting of the mentally ill cast, although sometimes it might be seen as bold, add to its reality? Certainly. Do you get to share the leading actor's worries, dreams and hopes? Do you share his actions? It is one of the rare cases that you do.In conclusion ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"", is a title that anyone who calls himself a cinephile should certainly watch. If I were to make a category of best movies of all times, I would rate it just above Alfred Hitchcok's ""Psycho"".",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
815,franckgiannini,The true meaning of the cuckoo' s nest!,9,26 February 2007,"Excellent film in all aspects. as a viewer, i felt that i was a patient myself. it was interesting to see how the patients became all self conscious about who they were.jack being able to persuade them to change their routine schedule was proof that not all patients need the sort of therapy mental institutes provide.If not in some cases mental institutes help patients worsen their condition due to over medication and irrelevant conversations initiated by the nurses. it was interesting to see for every opportunity the patients had to escape, something always retained them to stay. for most of them, the institute was their home. they would not be able to function in society and may face rejection by others due to their stigmas. their fear of rejection is what kept them isolated in the hospital, not the barbed fence and secured windows. their only family was the ones inside the institute. Jack brought awareness to each individual in the hospital and made them realize they had a voice. when he died, a part of them died with him!the native Chief represents an important factor in this film. natives are the most discriminated people of our history.we see that he to is afraid to escape into the real world because of the racism. when he observes what is done to Jack in the end of the film, he knows he is better off out in the real world. He takes the risk so he can go to Canada where most of the reserves for natives are held. there he will be accepted. Billy killing himself expresses how the doctors and nurses had power to fear and control the patients using their weaknesses in character and personality. it is a sort of brainwash and manipulation tactic hospitals use to overpower their patients. taking away their freedom of speech, will to live is was really makes the patients ill. taking away their self- consciousness and alienating them of their existence. one normal man awakens the ones who are asleep and shows them they have freedom of speech and a chance for change. when his actions begin to work, the doctors fear him, so they shock him until he is a vegetable.this is a great metaphor on how the government has control over the citizens using tactics to manipulate us. making us believe everything we see even if it is not the truth. we as humans live in high secure society, but don't realize it.more and more are political systems are taking control of our freedom to live in order to have complete control our way of thinking and living. this resembles the metaphor behind this film. a good example is president Jfk who was assassinated because he wanted change and good for the society. Same with jack, he is assassinated from his essence as a great human being,to be left with no more identity and self awareness of himself.it easier for the government to stuff patients with pills so they don't interfere with the ideal society they are trying to construct with perfect flawless people.this film expresses how sometimes for some people, illness is socially constructed and not biological related. pressures from the ideal society is what makes them sick. two thumbs up for the written script and performances in this epic film!",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

820,sac_9,One of the greatest movies and life lessons of all time,10,4 September 2007,"Not many movies have won the ""big five"" in the academy awards. It's enough to win just best picture for a lot of movies. This movie portrays every film element to the highest degree, from the beautiful panoramic shots of the mountains outside of the mental institution to the story of ultimate redemption McMurphy and Chief find at the end.The movie is seen through the eyes of Randle McMurphy (Nicholson). He is sent to the mental institution because he would rather be considered ""insane"" and live in ""luxury"" other than being a jailbird in prison. Once he gets into the actual living area where the insane are, he looks up at this tall, native looking man they call ""Chief"". McMurphy's initial reaction to Chief was his little Indian dance he did to mock him, but once Chief didn't react McMurphy asked him if he played football and says to chief, ""God damn, boy, you're as big as a mountain."" Little by little, you could see their friendship start to unfold out throughout the movie.In One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the title ""villain"" would definitely belong to Nurse Ratched. She gave threats to the patients, she was even friends with one of the patient's (Billy) mom. She also tries to toy with McMurphy's mind by trying to get him to conform with the customs of mental facility. It doesn't work out for her as planned. Including a classic scene where Nurse Ratched's threats cause little Billy to commit suicide. In rage, McMurphy has seen enough and actually chokes her out. This causes McMurphy to go through a lobotomy and become a vegetable at his stay at the clinic.I know many people probably disagree with this but, I think Chief killing McMurphy at the end was beautiful as much as it was heartbreaking. It symbolized that McMurphy, still had a chance to redeem himself and become a hero, even if it were death. It also gave Chief clearance to finally ""escape"" the premises and ""fly from the cuckoo's nest"", and how he did it at the end was classic. That's what makes this movie one of the greatest of all time, not only because of the sensational acting and the sociological significance, but because of the message and symbolism of the story.The directing by Milos Foreman was phenomenal, not only with the memorable acting by Jack Nicholson, but with the camera shots he used in certain scenes. For example, the scene before McMurphy was about to get electro-shock therapy they show a very close up angle of him to show the intensity and crowdedness he had to go through while getting the shock treatment. Nicholson also makes it pretty believable that he is actually getting shocked, by making ""gurgling"" noises and such.They actually go back to the ""lying down"" closed angle shot at the end of the movie when Nicholson passes away. I thought it was very brave of the director to keep that long shot of McMurphy's dead self, because by making it last as though it were a still shot, to me it seemed more and more believable that McMurphy was actually dead. I don't know how Nicholson just lied there stiff as a board. I know he may have won his Oscar because of his heroic and charismatic character, but how he dealt with himself in those two scenes is what tickles my fancy.The ideology of this film is, in my opinion, what makes it one of the greatest of all time. The story brings up the question of who's actually the insane; McMurphy and his patients, or Nurse Ratched and the staff? Clinically, McMurphy was not insane. Even the doctors and professors stated that, but since he didn't follow the norms and the dictatorship of Nurse Ratched, he had to stay at the sanitarium longer. I also loved the allusion of Chief, by acting deaf and dumb. He played the omniscient or ""god-like"" role of hearing and seeing everything, yet not saying anything himself. It almost seems as he was the narrating the story until he befriended McMurphy.I don't know if I could think of a more evil villain in a movie other than Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). The evil looks she gave to her patients when they were doing something wrong was as cold-hearted as one could get. Also her audacity to tell Billy's mother about his sexual deviance is as sinister as you can get. She knew that it would hurt Billy deeply, which was a major reason he was ""insane"" is because of his relationship with his mother. He eventually killed himself, angering McMurphy.I never thought I would cheer out loud when a grown man was choking out a little woman, but I did here. This scene did a fantastic job of not making it taboo, but making you want her dead even more. This did change Nurse Ratched however, it made her a little nicer to the patients at the end and made her realize that if she abuses her power as a nurse, it can come back to haunt her.The meaning of this story is wonderful and helped Jack Nicholson set the bar for acting. The symbolism of Chief's and McMurphy's redemption serves as a corner stone for many many movies today. Whether it be the costumes of the patients, the crazy acting, or even the beautiful classic shot at the end of the movie where Chief runs out to freedom; This movie will never be forgotten. And it serves as a good lesson for everyone out there who feels left out can all come together and get freedom. I advise anybody who says they love movies to watch this film, because it will not only change your views, it will change your life and you can't say that about a lot of movies.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

The continuous blending of the crazy and normal worlds is so well done that in the end I was no longer sure which was which.

826,enekiel,over all critique of the movie!,10,26 November 2007,"I have seen many movies in my life, and have many favorites while others are less enjoyable. Some movies are made purely for entertainment, and some actually send out messages. In the movie, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the main character, Randal Patrick McMurphy, does enough in the movie that could be taken as a lesson.In the beginning of the movie, Randal starts out in jail for his assault-batter-rape sentence, where he is required to work in the prison farm. After spending a while on his term, he becomes tired of working there, and decides to make people believe he has a mental illness. He is sent to a psychiatric center where he thinks he will remain comfortable, and makes many friends, while serving his term. While no one's allowed to leave the center, he takes all of his newly acquired friends and decides to go out for an enjoyable day fishing. Due to his actions, he was judged by the head of the center and prison. The head nurse, Mildred Ratched, convinces others to let him stay and have McMurphy stay to get therapeutic aid, only because after a few weeks of being evaluated, he was caught as the center knew he was pretending to be ill. McMurphy changes the atmosphere of the center only to realize that he was better off at the prison farm. Every time McMurphy messes up, he goes through the pain of electro shock therapy. From all of his friends there was one, The Chief, who gained his trust and respect since he too was fooling the staff. Later on, when McMurphy decided to break out of the center, he threw a party, where all the patients were drinking and doing everything they were not suppose to. The next morning one of the patient was found in bed with a woman, and from the fear from his mother finding out, he committed suicide. when McMurphy learned about the incident, he attempted to kill nurse Ratched by choking her. He was taken to the shock therapy room, where he had gone through so much pain, he had turned into a human vegetable, and his body was dragged back to his room. Chief could not witness him in his current state, he believed McMurphy had no choice, and it was to reduce his suffering and was better this way so he covered his face with a pillow and killed him, because he believed McMurphy . Chief then used McMurphy's idea to escape the center, that both had decided to do together.McMurphy was better off at the prison, then at the center, where his lie had taken his life. McMurphy's plan was great, his down fall was, that he slacked off to much. He wanted to have fun, before getting out, which cost him his life.Chief played his cards right, and no one suspected a thing from him, and he got away with it. It is better to go through and serve the time for your guilt, then try to get out of it through a lie. McMurphy lost everything while trying to beat the system, but the system beat him. No matter what in the end, a person will still go through punishment one way or another.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
827,sadeddin,my point of view,10,26 November 2007,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a film directed by Milos forman. The film based on a novel by the same name written by Ken Kesey. This movie refers constantly to different authorities that control individuals through subtle and coercive methods. Randall Patrick McMurphy an imposing, red-headed Irishman, R.P. McMurphy enters the institution after he is convicted of statutory rape, yet immediately it is suspected that he is a sane man who chose the institution as preferable when compared to the work farm where he would have been sentenced. McMurphy is a boisterous man and a ""gambling fool"" who looks out primarily for his own self-interest. For Kesey, McMurphy represents ideas of sexuality, freedom and self-determination against Nurse Ratched's oppression. In that mental institution there was a nurse named nurse Ratched A middle-aged nurse who controls the institution where McMurphy is sentenced, Nurse Ratched (also known as Big Nurse) is a stern, controlling woman who behaves with a serene confidence. She is a mechanical woman who attempts to suppress all human, and in particular all feminine characteristics, but she cannot hide her large breasts, her one incongruous physical trait. She is manipulative and dictatorial, using any methods to assert her power over the patients. In comparison to McMurphy, Nurse Ratched represents ideas of sexual repression, authoritarianism and conservatism. ""Ratched' who has a great influence on the patients. Mac Murphy didn't know that nurse Ratched has the power to keep him there forever. There was a challenge between MacMurphy and the nurse, which she wanted badly to win the contest. MacMurpy was having a good friendship with the other patients includes Billy Bibbit who committed suicide, a teenager whom Ratched has humiliated and dominated, and Chief Bromden a tall, half-Indian patient in the ward, he is the patient who has been in the institution the longest. Although others think that he is deaf and mute, Chief Bromden instead chooses not to speak, originally because others ignored him and then out of fear of Nurse Ratched. With the help of McMurphy, he begins to speak once more and reassert himself against Nurse Ratched and her workers. Chief was mostly ignored because of being mute, but also respected because of his size. MacMurpy saw in Billy a younger brother figure, and he wanted to teach him how to have fun. One night McMurphy sneaks into the nurse's station and calls his girlfriend, Candy, and tells her to bring booze. Another woman tags along and both enter the ward after McMurphy bribes the night watchman. The patients drink while Billy flirts with McMurphy's girlfriend. McMurphy sees that Billy likes Candy and tells her to sleep with Bibbit. While Billy and McMurphy's girlfriend are in a separate room, the rest of the patients, including McMurphy and the Chief who had been planning to escape, pass out from drinking. When Nurse Ratched arrives the next morning she commands the attendants to clean up the patients and conduct a head count. A confrontation with Billy leads directly to his suicide. McMurphy explodes into a violent rage, viciously throttling Ratched. McMurphy is subdued and taken away again for punishment; he's given an electric shock and eventually returned to the ward. Chief Bromden, unwilling to leave McMurphy behind, suffocates his neurologically disabled friend with a pillow. He follows Randle's plan and successfully escape.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
828,lesleygmz,my interpretation of the film,8,28 November 2007,"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is a film based on a novel written by Ken Kesey. Directed by Czech Milos Forman the $4.4 million dollar film is known as one of the greatest American films of all time. Its symbolic theme takes place in a mental institute where various authoritative figures attempt a consistent routine in order to maintain control of their environment.Things seem to change in the institution once the very flamboyant and rebellious McMurphy (played by Jack Nicholson) is admitted to the establishment. McMurphy attempts on many occasions to convey his basic human rights and desires by in subordinating to the stern regulations set by the oppressive institution, which later causes him his own very undesirable state of vegetation and then death.The film portrays a simple, yet forgotten, messagecheaters never prosper. Unfortunately, this is a very true statement. And because of McMurphys'selfish acts of riotousness the ward has lost a patient who committed suicide. Sometimes we as human beings get too caught up in our own lives that we forget about those who surround us. We need to remember that everyone we encounter has a significant reason as to why they're in our lives, whether we realize sooner or later on down the road. We need to take into consideration that others have lives of their own and perhaps something we say or do may affect them in either a positive or negative way.The film definitely sets a tone of morality and reminds us that everyone has needs of their own. I enjoyed watching this film and would recommend it to any mature viewer.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
829,spiritgirlleo,One Flew Over The Cuckoos nest,5,11 December 2007,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest was a product of Kesey's time, he used to work at a mental facility. Also, he used to take medicine and he experienced how to be in a mental facility. The story center of attention is on Randle McMurphy, where he transfered from a workfarm to a psychiatric hospital. The two main characters that stood out the most for me was Patrick McMurphy and chief Bromden. The psychiatric hospital is based in an all men asylum. A movie like this expresses how unsympathetic life can be in a mental hospital or other types o facilities.Randle Patrick McMurphy is brought from a work farm to a mental facility to be examine of a mental illness that he can have. McMurphy is an all loving type of guy, and very charismatic. He was charge of child rape but never been convicted of. He decided to change the routines of the patients by watching the World Series on television, running the card table, playing basketball, and by organizing a fishing trip. He wanted for everyone to be treated as normal such as pleasing their needs. A major point of the movie was when he says that, he just is going to be for one hundred and sixty five days. It was not true because the nurse had to tell him when it was okay for him to leave the facility. At that point, he noticed that he should have stay at the workfarm. Also, when at the end he end up being like one of the rest because he is a near negative vegetative state to its most elderly patients.Another character that impacted me was chief Bromden. In the beginning, he acts as a dumb deaf person but in the end he ends up being the most the most intelligent and loyal to a friend. The Chief Bromden is a Native American that has been there since World War II. He knows all the secrets of the mental institution since everyone thinks he cannot hear. He was a potent man of over six feet tall but he sees himself very small compared to McMurphy. McMurphy teaches him to believe in himself and to regain self respect. In the end, he helps McMurphy by killing so he wont have to suffer as being vegetative.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
830,MswmSwmsW,A few thoughts on this magnificent film,10,26 June 2002,"Well, my guess is that by the time i am finished writing this, there will be more than a couple spoilers, so those who havent seen it may wish to skip this review.That being said, i have watched this movie many times now. Strangely enough, i had not seen it until just a couple weeks ago, when i bought it on DVD without having ever learned about it. Somehow i knew i would enjoy it.  To understate my reaction, I was extremely impressed.What truly stood out for me was Nicholson's performance.  I have seen many of his movies, but i believe that this was the first film i have seen of his that took place in the earlier years (well, Easy Rider is another, but that isnt necessesarily a Nicholson movie). Very few actors that i have ever observed have the simple PRESENCE that this man does within this film.  Every glimpse, every facial expression, his body language, even his clothing add to his performance.One of my very favorite shots of the movie is during the first meeting that McMurphy is present.  When he notices Nurse Ratched pestering Billy, the simple, unspoken action of him playing with his card deck is enough to convey more than any piece of dialogue ever could.  The posture reeks of defiance, the eye contact and facial expression reveal his immediate understanding and suspicion of the dynamic beteween the nurse and the patients.  It is no more than, perhaps, 5 seconds, but it truly left a mark on me.Anyway, the real reason that i wrote this is because i had a thought regarding the interaction between McMurphy and the Chief.  It seems to me that the Chief is representitive of the spirit world, and McMurphy is representitive of the hedonistic, purely human world. As the movie progresses, and McMurphy slowly changes his behavior, Chief actually seems to mirror the progression, except, he does it in the opposite fashion.In a way, it seems as though the two characters are actually one soul.  As McMurphy comes into the hospital, he is self-centered, arrogant, and seeks attention.  However, as the movie progresses, his attitude changes, and he develops a legitimate concern and love for the 'patients' that inhabit the ward with him.**DEFINITE SPOILER***Just prior to the first electroconvulsive shock therapy, we are introduced to the fact that chief is neither deaf nor dumb, and is infact a passive observer within this hospital.  Ironically, this moment of growth within chief, where he learns to trust mcmurphy with his secret, is mirrored by mcmuphy's initial steps of psychological and spiritual progression.  After the ECT, he displays a greater interest in others, as well as a subtl appreciation of his position.  Concurrently, Chief, though expressing his feeling of powerlessness, is growing in strength, feeding off of McMurphy's raw energy and enthusiasm.As the next few scenes progress, with the climax of Chief taking McMurphy with him through one of the most compassionate death scenes i have ever witnessed, it felt as though we, as an audience, witnessed the assimilation of McMurphy's soul with that of Chief's.No doubt that this particular interpretation is influenced by the naturally spiritual/enlightened nature of native americans, but even if completely unintentional, the spiritual connection and transition seem to be there.Additionally, when it is revealed that most of the patients there are voluntary, a whole new dynamic is added, not only to the individual characters, but to the interactions between them.   The idea that they voluntarily put themselves in such a place infers that they simply can not deal with leading their own lives, and require the close supervision and regimine that the hospital provides to them.Because of this, it seems that all of the repressed personality traits within each character instead become the dominant traits due to the ability to act as 'strangely' as desired within such an environment.  Once this is revealed, so much of the interaction becomes a 'play' of sorts.**end of spoiler stuff***well, all in all, its phenominal.  i could keep going and going, but i wont at this time.  I simply dont know what more to say.  All of the performances are inspired and moving.

835,peace-rox,why the #8 exactly?,3,26 February 2009,"I watched this film finally, after waiting for weeks for an opportunity to watch it to present itself. I got so very excited about this movie, reading all the quotes, people's comments, and the testaments to the brilliance of it. But was it really that brilliant? Yes, it was a good movie, a classic example of the 70s style; over bright lighting, too-realistic makeup and questioning of absolutely everything to do with the establishment. Don't get me wrong, I usually love these movies. But this one fell a bit flat.*SPOILERS*I think the main problem was that I couldn't really sympathise with Jack Nicholson's character (and yes, i know, I'll be in trouble for this). It was implied in the movie that the only reason he got himself into the mental home was because he didn't want to stay in jail (the comment about 68 days where he finds out they can keep him indefinitely). So I could see no reason to excuse him for some of the ""insane"" things he did. His only reason seemed to be selfishness. When he did find out that it wouldn't be the ""68 days"" he was hoping for, he immediately backed down, and stopped being the hero and saving the ward. He just escaped. You could say this is good, as it is a realistic portrayal of a person, but there simply wasn't a single reason I could identify to sympathise with him. In the end, when he had a lobotomy, I was not moved by it at all. Yes, I think I would have been moved by Billy's death, BUT I already knew he was going to die, which is unfortunate, because I think that took most of the tragedy out of the movie. Stupid 20 to 1.

841,hawtgur1,The movie did not do the book justice,5,26 February 2010,"I finished the book a few days ago and immediately went get the DVD since the book was mind blowing. I was even more hyped when realized the movie has won five Academy Awards. As it turned out, however, I was greatly disappointed, as many fans of the books had echoed. I want to start by stating I have ever expected the movie to follow the book entirely, for it is understandably impossible to cram a 300+ pages story into a 2 hour movie. The main issue I have with the movie is that the director and actors had totally misinterpreted the characters and the core issues the writer of the book wanted to convey.Nurse Ratched was this machine-like ex-army nurse who represented the oppressive and dehumanized aspect of the modern society; she allowed no one to disrupt her absolute power in the ward and was depicted as a manipulative and tyrannous person in the book. Yet in the movie, she was cold-hearted and sort of oppressive alright, but one who essentially seemed to have the patient's best interest in mind. Who, as a matter of fact, was sort of the victim here, having this random guy messing around in the ward.And McMurphy. Oh boy, he was the ultimate hero in the book. Flawed and imperfect like the rest of us, he came to the realization that his initial rebellious acts against the Nurse out of selfishness became a ray of hope among the patients. He then came to challenge the Nurse on behalf of the patients, in hoped that by defeating the Nurse, the patients would heal from their sicknesses. In the movie, Jack Nicholson captured the free-spiritedness of the character but no further. His action seemed to be motivated by amusement rather than self sacrifice, which, imo, completely ruined the purpose of the book. Of course, the movie itself is not bad at all, there were some substantial acting, certain messages worth reflecting. However, if you want to capture the true beauty of the story, I strongly suggest you to read the book instead.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
842,tuttletastic,Solid,8,2 May 2010,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a movie about a mental patient named R.P McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who fakes being crazy so that he can avoid doing manual labor in prison. Although this is the setting for the movie, the actual theme is that of a person, McMurphy (Mac), providing better therapy to the patients of a mental institute than the doctors or nurses can provide. The story focuses primarily on Mac as is tries to lure each of the patients out of their comfort zones and into life. As Mac does this he becomes a larger than life hero in the eyes of the mental patients, and a thorn in the side of Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). Ratched has a harmful, narcissistic need for control. Overall, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest does an excellent job of setting the mood for a mental institute both in the sound and visual department. The institute itself is run down and feels as though money is tight for upgrades. This really brightens Mac's colorful personality, and sets a nice contrast. Often times the dialogue is just a bunch of chaos because the mental patients get into argument frenzies. These arguments help give the feel of a mental institute, while also allowing the camera to zoom in and capture Mac or Nurse Ratched's feelings about the given situations. All of the above, along with realistic lighting, great camera work, and terrific acting won the movie its Oscars. Irony plays a large role in why One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was and still is successful. There are quite a few situations of irony, with the main two coming from Nurse Ratched's need to control, and the ""surprise ending"". As mentioned in the theme, this movie focuses on how well Mac helps the patients in the mental institute. As a sharp contrast though is how much Nurse Ratched, the helper, is harming her patients with manipulation and brow beating. As for the surprise ending, well, that will be left a surprise. This movie is not unlike others that have come along, in which the main character takes hold of a group supposedly doing the right thing, but were not. Most recently we saw a similar character in How to Train Your Dragon. In How to Train Your Dragon, Hiccup, a young Viking, teaches the other Vikings that the dragons are good when it was common belief they were bad. Hiccup is being manipulated and brow beaten by society and especially by his father to kill dragons. It's not hard to see the similarities between Hiccup and Mac, or Nurse Ratched and Hiccup's father. It's an entertaining theme, watching one sole character change an entire group for the better. It is a universal theme that movie goers will enjoy for years to come, no better example of this theme is found than in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I would find it unfair to a reader not to mention this; although this movie is a good one it suffers from a pacing standpoint. This movie's middle section is not unlike an action movie. What I mean by this is that in action movies, sometimes there is so much action that the viewer gets bored. In One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest the middle portion of the movie is filled with crazy people acting crazy to the point of exhaustion. If you can get over this, or find amusement in it, then this movie will surely entertain.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
843,mathaytaceChristou,Freedom and Power,9,29 July 2010,"The theme of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, is in reality a sociology question in the form of a Motion Picture. That question can be summarized as ""What is the proper Balance between Freedom and Order?"" Randall P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is the central protagonist of this film. At the beginning of the film, he is being transferred from the state prison where he is incarcerated for Statutory Rape, to a mental facility for evaluation, following complaints of belligerency and violence. From the time he arrives at the facility he seems to enjoy disturbing the status-quo, upsetting certain individuals (Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) in particular) and inciting rebellion amongst the other patients against the authority of the nursing staff. Though this rebellion is often times uplifting, and seemingly good for the other patients' well being, at other times it is destructive and harmful especially during the ending of the film.Nurse Ratched, while often portrayed as an unflinching power hungry authoritarian figure, does legitimately seem concerned for the well being of her patients. Like McMurphy, the outcome of her stance, seems to bring both good and ill for the patient's fragile mental states. She is the main antagonist to McMurphy, and the two often square off, almost using the other patients as pawns in a power struggle.The film ends, after several confrontations (each escalating in intensity) with the aftermath of a disruptive and forbidden party involving alcohol and sex held in the ward after hours. One of the more emotionally disturbed patients (and new friend of McMurphy) commits suicide after facing the social consequences of an illicit sexual encounter McMurphy pressured him into during the party. After this suicide, a visibly shaken Nurse Ratched, attempts to maintain order encouraging the group to return to the daily routine. McMurphy is upset by her insistence on maintaining routine after the death of his friend, and thus attempts to strangle her to death. After this confrontation, he is lobotomized as he has become dangerous to others as indicated by his violent outburst. Once Chief (a close friend of McMurphy portrayed by Will Sampson) notices his condition, he suffocates him (out of seeming compassion) and escapes in a dramatic manner, in homage to McMurphy's earlier attempt.Both sides of the quandary of freedom and order ""win"" and ""lose"" in the ending of the film. Nurse Ratched protects the group by putting down (via the lobotomy) the dangerous element of McMurphy, yet, McMurphy inspired the freedom of ""Chief"". It seems to me that the film wants us to ask how much individual freedom is necessary, and how much social control is necessary, yet answers neither for us. The film is different than say George Orwell's 1984 in that it raises the issue without preaching a message, letting us decide for ourselves. It also differs from 1984 by its modern day realistic setting, as opposed to the fantastic future of 1984, making the question more timely, as opposed to the more speculative and/ or allegorical nature of Orwell's work.The editing of the film was utilitarian, but that is not necessarily an insult. The film introduces us to the characters and situation at hand, without getting in our way with distracting ""artistic"" shots or melodramatic scenes (not that those are necessarily bad in the right context). There are a few places where the direction and editing do differ from the rest of the film, but these scenes are well done, and do not effect the feel of the film negatively.The first is the opening, where the daily routine as structured by Ratched is enacted as the nursing and security staff ready the ward for the day. The almost robotic readying of the pills, waking of the patients and starting of the records is almost entirely dialogue free, allowing us to see the precision of the status-quo before the arrival of McMurphy.The second is the climax of the film. The shots become longer, and the scenes slower paced, so that we can feel the weight of the various actions both past and present. As the consequences of both Ratched and McMurphy's actions come to light, the film forces us to focus on the human cost of the fight.One Motif Present throughout the film is the use of the Nudy Deck. Several times throughout the film, McMurphy pulls out a deck of pornographically themed playing cards, which he seems to play with during important scenes. To me the deck seems to reference his irreverence toward authority and the concerns of others. He also uses the deck to toy with the mind of one of the more simple minded patients. He seems to escape into them, when he does not want to bother with the world around him.Another Motif is the Mountain. In the opening shot, we see a mountain range in the distance. Later in the film Chief tells McMurphy he is strong as a mountain. Later when Chief escapes, the music that played during the mountain range shot returns, bringing us back to the image of the mountain. The mountain is strength of will. The theme of this film is classic. The question of how much power a person should have, as compared to that of authority figures, is one that has been debated for centuries. I like that this film points out the argument, without attempting to give us an answer. It expects us to bring our own assumptions, feelings and thoughts to the film, so that we may interpret it according to our values, and not those of anyone else.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
844,joejoeday,THE best film of all time.,10,15 October 2011,"It has to mean something when a film ranks #8 in the IMDb Top 250, wins the five most prestigious Academy awards and is still considered underrated. Upon first watching the film, I was sceptical and half expectant of it being mildly overrated. The film is as close to flawless as any other film I have yet watched, and that includes some IMDb favourites, such as fellow masterclasses Shawshank Redemption and the first two Godfather movies. The screenplay and directing of the film is sensational. I have not yet read the book, or seen a play adaptation, but it is something I would very much want to do. The scripting is quickly-paced, but this never becomes it's downfall and simply adds to the sheer insanity of the film itself. Though, the velocity of the film itself does halt when need be - thus, making the more tragic, dramatic scenes even more touching and heartbreaking. The directing, from the excellent Milos Forman, is also something to shout about very much. An Oscar well deserved! Though, the film's stand-out of many strong points is the acting. Within a large and extensive cast, there is not a single bad actor and a handful of outstanding ones. Jack Nicholson, playing the hot-tempered convict Mc Murphy, and his usual psycho routine are as convincing as ever. As is, Louise Fletcher in her role of Nurse Ratched, without a doubt one of the greatest film villains of all time. She's callous, unpredictable and a role not many actresses would be able to succeed in doing so to any positive effect. Of course, the supporting cast, (and the ""nuts"" as Mc Murphy playfully dubs them) are outstanding. It's brilliant to see pre-stardom talents, such as Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito and the undermined Brad Dourif really go into there roles. Some lesser known actors, such as Sydney Lassick as the child-esque Cheswick, William Redfield as the opinionated Harding and the mesmerising performance of Will Sampson as the unforgettable Chief. All the latter three actors, sadly, passed away within years of the film's release.In short, an unbelievably great film - if you were to watch any, make it this one!",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
845,fallon03,Over time the characters change.......,9,24 October 2010,"R. P. McMurphy chooses to wait his time in a mental institution rather than have to do his time in jail, in the film One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Jack Nicholson plays the character that would be more willingly live in the psychiatric ward than suffer his existence in the criminal justice system. Jack's superb acting capabilities shine in this film, creating a character personality that is realistic to the background of the psych ward. Over the course of the movie the audience has the opportunity to see the changes of these characters. It is these changes that help the audience determine if McMurphy's true ambition is to live out his criminal sentence in the psych ward or regain his freedom and independence. Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, adds intensity to the film as the audience slowly learns of her domineering personality. This minor plot of the film increases the insanity and stupidity of the psychiatric ward environment. Nurse Ratched brings more conflict for Randle McMurphy and the other inhabitants of the building. Nurse Ratched attempts to suck the life out of McMurphy just as she has done to the other patients, it is obvious that she enjoys and needs to dominate the ward of patients The viewer must realize that there are just too many subplots to follow all with a detailed line of thought. Each ward patient brings their own story to the screen, it appears at times that these subplots overpower Randle's plight to regain his freedom from the criminal term and the psychological term. These subplots consistently appear to the viewer throughout the rhythm of the film. Intense lengthy close up angles allow the viewer to review every detail of each patients' facial movement, allowing the viewer to realize the true insane personality of each ward patient. Dramatic use of white on white colors throughout the film aid in creating the impression and feeling of a cold uncaring temperature that truly resembles the psych ward created by Nurse Ratched. These set colors keep the viewer involved within the insanity and stupidity of McMurphy's plight for freedom, keeping a monotone color portfolio supports the sterility of the mental hospital making the film realistic to the viewer. Like other films about mental illness, The Snake Pit or What about Bob?, the audience truly sees a change in the character personalities and their individual goals or ambitions over time in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. It is the evolution of the character changes that continues to draw the viewer into the storyline. Are the patients ever going to get organized to break away from Nurse Ratched's authoritarianism, will McMurphy ever get to watch the World Series, and will Nurse Ratched ever realize that she is mentally ill, perhaps as much as some of the patients of the ward?",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
846,tsteuber001,A Call to Defend Human Dignity,8,27 October 2010,"The movie One Who Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) is a soulful allegory about the struggle for human dignity. It is set in Oregon State Hospital in Salem, Oregon. Randall Patrick Mc Murphy (Jack Nicholson) is the protagonist who plays a fast whit, foul-mouthed rebel who arrives at the institution for what he thinks is only 68 days, just enough time for him to receive a psychiatric evaluation and then be on his way. The doctors there and the legal authorities think he's been faking his angry tirades and rants just to get out of his work detail at a work farm where he had been serving time for statutory rape. As Randall settles into his life there and befriends the inmates, he immediately begins detest Nurse Mildred Ratcher (Louise Fletcher). Nurse Ratcher is the embodiment of everything Randall has been rebelling against his whole life. She likes routine, is predictable, projects fear and thus runs the ward that way. Describing his disdain for her he says to his psychiatrist Randall exclaims, ""She likes a rigged game."" She expects the inmates to tow the line and when Randall begins to contest he inspires the other inmates to do the same. Jack Nicholson does a super acting job of playing the rebellious yet heroic mental patient.When Randall finds out that most of his friends who are mentally ill are there voluntary and he is committed, he begins to further rebel and highlight the injustices that are perpetuated upon the inmates. He advocates loudly that the inmates be allowed to watch the 1963 World Series but is shot down by Nurse Ratcher. When a riot breaks out during group therapy where Mr. Cheswick (Sydney Lassick) demands his cigarettes and an explanation from Nurse Ratcher as to why she withheld them for him. He shouts to her, ""I am no little kid!"" After this occurrence the following scenes then show what happens when you stand up to authority. You receive shock therapy.As in the Shawshank Redemption, Randall is continually seeing to escape. He tries to get Chief Bromden, (Will Sampson) to accompany him. However, before he goes he invites his prostitute girlfriend, Candy, and her friend to the asylum for a night of partying. In the morning we see him slumped onto the floor too drunk to even go through the window he unlocked to escape. The sequences of events that follow bring the emotions to a height. Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif) is found sleeping with Candy in a room and is ridiculed by Nurse Ratcher in front of everyone. He chooses to escape the pain of the moment by committing suicide in the psychiatrist office by slashing his neck. Upon seeing his dead friend, Radall turns on Nurse Ratcher and begins to choke her to death. The scene ends with Nurse Ratcher fitfully coughing after Randall is assaulted by the interns. The camera angle of looking straight down on Nurse Ratcher and her almost demise evokes a feeling of near jubilation.The movie concludes with, Chief, Randall's friend witnessing his return in the middle of the night from another ward where he had been isolated. He sneaks over to his bed and tells him he is ready to leave with him but is horrified when the lighting revels that the doctors have performed a lobotomy on him. The Chief does the honorable thing and to preserve Randall's human dignity, he mercifully smothers him to death. Afterwards, the Chief escapes almost as a way of freeing not just himself but Randall's spirit. One Who Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a well theme drama that entreats the audience to have more compassion for the oppressed and to also rise up and confront human tragedy no matter where you find it.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Reading the book prior to watching the movie, the movie felt like a butchery, all the thematic ideas were cut to make a pretty poorly constructed movie. Again, the plot of the movie made no sense without the prior knowledge of what was supposed to happen based on the book. Many characters were either cut or sidelined in an effort to make Taber relevant, even though it served absolutely no purpose to have him in the movie. Without giving any information, there seemed to be many important events and lines from the book that didn't make it into the movie, probably to make it a little more acceptable to viewers.

Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher did a great job in their roles but that is pretty much it.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
849,tieky,Sweet,9,7 June 2003,"I just watched the movie. It's a powerful show, but i won't be commenting about the powerful performance made by the cast.I think this show is a satire of the society outside. The nurses, the staffs the doctors, feel like a beaurecratic government to me. The patients of course, are the masses. The nurses don't repond well to any of he patients' problems, and give reasons and excuses for not helping them. Ther also seem to give an air of superiority and never treated the patients as who they are but treats them as what they are afflicted with.If you guys can remember , there's apart where the nurse Fletcher said that most of the patients are remanded in the loony bin voluntarily, just like voters they are.McMurphy is just like the anti-government that tries to change the little things that go on in the mental hospital, like trying to watch the ball game, or bringing the boys out fishing.A powerful show.... WATCH IT",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
850,ab_abdi,A Great Mentality,10,21 August 2014,This movie is about a guy who is admitted to a mental institution on the basis to be confirmed that if he is indeed mentally ill. McMurphy upon entering the institution finds the people there are lifeless and to his shock most of them have personally volunteered to join the institute.It is later agreed upon that McMurphy is in need of therapy and thus must remain in the institution. The director makes the movie revolve around McMurphy trying to bring 'life' to the people of the institute. McMurphy quickly gains fame and thus the support of the retarded people. Together they repeatedly break the rules and regulations of the asylum and are punished. Believing he doesn't belong there McMurphy decides to run away until things take a very tragic turn.The idea of the director to break away from normal day routine and enjoying life is conveyed strongly by the ending which tells us that even though McMurphy himself is not there but his idea of 'life' is.,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

To date, for me, this is still one of Nicholson's finest performances. There are so many great supporting rolls performed to perfection in this movie, it is unbelievable. Just watching Danny DeVito's first film performance gives an incite into the amazing actor he was to become. Louise Fletcher played her part so well, you actually did want to hate her. I can't begin to tell you how realistic some of those characters were (and I should know). If you haven't seen this movie you should stop what you're doing and do so immediately.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

His character is so well built that you forget it's Jack and Randall P McMurphy become real to you.  The supporting cast is excellent as well.  Nurse Ratched is portrayed perfectly as a manipulative control freak.Of course, the acting is where the greatness ends.  The direction is decent, but nothing special, and the writing is just terrible.  After reading, and loving the book, I just couldn't like this movie.  Ken Kesey's novel is nothing short of superb, and the plot of the film adheres to the plot so poorly that it loses so many of the things that were great about the book.All in all, the movie falls far short of the book.Acting: 9.5/10 Overall: 5/10",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

The plot of this film is used generally well. It follows the book for the most part and keeps my attention. The actors in this film are spot on. I could immediately tell who was who and they capture the character very well. The director chose very good actors for the characters in this film.I would recommend this book to anyone. If you have read the book, you definitely should see the film. There are some differences but it is pretty true the book. It's filmed pretty well and has some interesting humor in it. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and I also enjoyed viewing the film. They were both excellent pieces of work. I highly recommend this film.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
856,akrausmann,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Film Critique,6,21 December 2011,"I feel that the film ineffectively uses the two techniques of characters and acting. When the movie first started the only three characters I could recognize right away were Patrick McMurphy, Chief Bromden, and Nurse Ratched. After viewing the film for two days it still took me awhile to figure out who was who in each character. Billy Bibbit was easy to identify by his stutter, but Harding was hard to distinguish. It took some time to see which character was who.The characters' acting was not that great in my opinion. McMurphy's actor was very thin and didn't look built enough to play that character. His temper towards Nurse Ratched was perfect though. Chief Bromden was the main character who's actor fit him perfectly. Aside from being an Indian man the actor was great at keeping quiet through the film and also his body structure fit the character. Nurse Ratched in my opinion was to calm and didn't react to some of the situations in the film like she did in the book. She was also described in the book differently than what her character looked like in the film. I would recommend both the book and the film for anyone. I really enjoyed the book. It starts off slow, but it is worth it when you get to the end of the novel. The film was also enjoyable. It contain a lot of humor and fit the book pretty well. There were minor differences in the movie that weren't in the book, but it makes the film more interesting. If you do decide to read the book, you should see the film as well.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
857,skye-weiler,One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest. Movie v Novel,4,21 December 2011,"The book ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" by Ken Kesey and the film produced by Milos Forman did both an excellent job in performance but the film lacked very important detail that the book had. The film lacked character development and also the point of view of Chief Bromden was lost. I have decided to analyze both the film techniques. The film ineffectively captured the characters development in the play. For example, Chief is a mysterious character that all the patients have led up to believed was deaf and dumb. Although his placement in the film did not suit the placement he had in the book much of it was ineffective. Information such as his childhood past was vital piece of information for the concept of the story. It was never talked about or sparked at in the film. Chief's problems on why he is in the ward are forgotten in the film. Another example would be McMurphy; he was looked as a very rude and crazy man in the film. The book however did capture his craziness and wild side towards Nurse Ratched but that is not the all-around persona he had in the book. McMurphy character in the movie leads you to believe that he might be crazy because you don't see as much development he's still the same guy that stepped first foot in the ward. The film ineffectively captured the point of view. The point of view difference between the book and film is that the film has made it third person rather than the original first person. The book displays a first person point of view in the eyes of Chief Bromden. The film however grasps the book in a third person point of view. This is understandable because it would be rather hard to have a narrator who is supposedly deaf and dumb be our main focus point. It is a disappointment to know that Chief's story did not get touch upon in the film but the film did a good job in cooperating different perspectives in the movie. The movie and film are both excellent creation and both have their downsides but the reader should read the book because it provides very good detail and more descriptions in its final copy.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
858,tamer_crosby,not a simple movie,10,24 January 2004,i think that this movie is not as simple and easy to understand as it appears for the first time.and also it's not a comedy (or maybe black comedy).i think the director wanted to tell us lots of things and to send messages to us (not only a story about some mental patients in a hosp.and the brilliant thing (beside the genius Nicholson)is the director made his movie so that any level of audience can understand it easily.,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Jack Nicholson is stellar as always but in this role in particular, he just knocks it out of the park.You can recognize some early faces of major celebrities such as Christopher Lloyd and Danny Devito. I've heard that the movie differs from the book but knowing the changes I think it still works. I don't really care about the Oscars but thank god this one got recognized back then, it would have been a crime to not prize this movie. Another thing I can say about this movie is it's subtlety. The main character isn't exactly an hero and the ""antagonist"" can't quite be categorized as a villain. It's up to your interpretation.

With controlling Nurse Ratched who is truly more scarier than any Freddie Kruger or Scream Mask and other patients from the wacky to the down right absurd. Yet however we can play fun at the strangeness of the characters, we can be reminded of how true to life this is, and the fact that it was actually set in a mental institution adds to the effect. Michael Douglas and Milos Forman have done an excellent job in making the novel by Ken Kesey come to life, and we must not underestimate the importance of Chief Bromden as a character as in the novel it is his perspective that guides us through the 'fog' Through out the film there is a daunting feeling the McMurphy's vibrant, laughing, card-playing and over zealous character is to be ill-fated. The end is well worth waiting for. I suggest that you should read the book first, and not after. Truly fantastic performances from all of the cast, and some notable characters such as Harding, Billy Bibbit and Marcini (I need to list them all really), this is definitely a classic and is very symbollic.

863,movieman1214,Review,10,25 March 2004,"Critic: movieman1214 Movie: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) Rating: A+ Rank: #1
**SPOILERS AHEAD**`One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is the only movie that I can be spellbound and in awe after watching it for the tenth time. It is included on more than fifty Top 100 lists just on this site alone, and it graces my number one slot as well. Not to mention, it currently fills the number 8 spot on this site's top 200 best films, and the number 12 spot on IMDB.Originally written by the stereotypical hippy, Ken Kesey, `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' has been interpreted as a symbol for the way a sixties hippy would have seen America, as a giant metaphor for an American society that crushed and did not accept the highly liberal lifestyle of the times hippy. After this explanation, all of the characters seem to have a different meaning, Nurse Ratchet would symbolize a crushing American society, all the patients would be hippies who are now considered crazy and are put into their place by traditional society, and Randle would be the rebel that does not want to give in. `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' also has a literal interpretation that is, at times, more widely accepted: it could have been some sort of an autobiography of the when the author worked as an orderly in the psychiatric ward of a VA hospital. This interpretation seems to make more sense, but I would not doubt if the first is just as correct given the author's background.`One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' became an instant success among both critics and the public. Narrated by the Chief, the book proves to have noticeable differences from the movie; but this not a new thing for adaptations. The title proves to be misleading for the film. At first we naturally assume that the `One' from `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is meant to be the films protagonist, Randle. Although, after that final scene when the Chief dramatically pulled the bathroom water basin out of the ground and threw it through the window, achieving to do what Randle could not, we suddenly realize that the `One' from `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is not Randle but instead the Chief.The book's rights were eventually bought by one of the fans of the book, Michael Douglas. When he bought the rights to the book he had the play version in mind. Just about everyone knows that there was a play before there was the movie, but what some people don't know is that the first stage version featured the then nobody actor, Gene Wilder, as Billy Boy Bibbit. The play only ran for five to six months then shut down because of lack of interest from the actors.It is not hard to see that `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' the play, and `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' the movie hold some very close ties. After all almost the entire film takes place in or around the mental institution, with the exception of that one scene where Randle takes everyone fishing. Not to mention that another tie that the movie shares with the play is the same producer, Michael Douglas.One of my favorite aspects to this film is simply that is does not have a real antagonist. Some will put up the argument that Nurse Ratchet was the films antagonist but this is not entirely true. Nurse Ratchet is the opposing force, yes, but she does not mean to be. She is simply doing her job as she thinks best; she is not out to get Randle or any other patients on the ward, she is not purposely being the opposite force. Although she was technically the antagonist she was not meaning to be, I don't believe that it is right to give her the title of antagonist. Most people will come to the conclusion that she is the film's antagonist, given the scene where she refuses to talk about the cigarette ration with one of the patients until he sits down. She comes across as a menacing snob that could care less about the people on the ward; although Louise Fletcher plays the part of Nurse Ratchet in such a way that it comes off as if she was just doing what she thought was best for the patients.What makes this film great is the fact that every patient on the ward, although crazy, did not give in to stereotypical `crazy' roles. They were all playing a person with a different mental disorder. Most of the credit for this can be given to the director, Milos Forman, for making the actors pair up with someone with the same disorder the character was supposed to have. The characters were by far the strongest aspect of this film.The movie was filmed inside a real Mental Institution, the actors were forced to stay in character until they left the set to go home, and because so much of the film was shot inside this made a sort of ambience of isolation that put the film on a higher level. The casting of the various patients on the ward proved to be harder than it seemed. The director wanted to cast unknown people for the parts in order to get the feeling of newness when you watch the film. He went about his auditions by putting them all in the therapy format and he would play Nurse Ratchet. He would then expect the actors to improve the scenes based on the questions he was asking.Jack Nicholson won his first of three Academy Awards for his role of Randle McMurphy, but he was not the first person the director or the producers thought of when they were casting `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. Amazingly, he was last on all of their lists. Before him were such people like Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando, and Burt Renolds. It was because of Jack's earlier films that they did not think the part was right for him, only when they saw him in `Five Easy Pieces' that they finally realized the man's acting ability. When they tried to cast him he was working on another film at the time, and it was either wait for him, or make it with out him. They chose to wait.When it was time to cast Nurse Ratchet, Louise Fletcher was, like Jack Nicholson, at the bottom of the list. The difference between her and Nicholson was that she was not playing the part like the producers and the director wanted it. It was not until Milos Forman realized that making Nurse Ratchet unknowingly evil would make the film more powerful, so he cast Louise Fletcher. As for casting the Chief this was the biggest of their problems. It had not occurred to them that there were very few large Indians. So they had a hard time finding someone, until a car salesman, and a friend of Michael Douglas', found this big Indian. He came into his carlot wanting to buy a car but instead was given a role in a movie.Milos Forman was the main reason why this film is such a classic. He was one of the few foreign directors that made it big in the United States. He directed two Academy Award winning films, the first being `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and the second being `Amadeus'. Milos Forman originally got the job of director for being a director both Saul Zaenty and Michael Douglas respected, and for being cheap. The film was on such a low budget that they could not afford a big name director. His directing style was not a normal one. He made sure all of the actors stayed in character by filming without even saying action. He shot the entire film, with the exception of the fishing scene, in sequence. He paired the actors playing the patients on the ward up with real patients that had the same disorder their character had.`One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' won a total of five Academy Awards and became the second out of a total of three films in Oscar history to sweep the `Big Five': Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best (adapted) Screenplay. The only other two films that accomplished this were `It Happened One Night' and `Silence of the Lambs'. In addition to its five Oscars it also won five Golden Globes, various English Academy Awards, and Jack Nicholson personally won five different awards for his role as Randle McMurphy.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

And for a reason - Ken Kessey is a great author and the book is simply brilliant! I was so in love with it, I decided to watch the movie, too, despite the fact that most of the movies made after books are... well, they're not that good. So, the moment came. I pressed ""play"" and... well, no. Jack Nicholson acted exactly like McMurphy would've but there were many scenes from the book which were missing in the movie. I have no idea why Milo Forman decided to cut them off but it was a kind of mistake. He could've replaced some of the other not-so-important scenes with the important ones.

It's a movie that will surely trigger some thoughts. Superb acting, super casting, and also sad but still super finishing. It shows us what happiness really means. Without any question, it's the best acting of Jack Nicholson. One will be surprised to find out that how a mental patient can change the life of his fellows. Though sometimes characters lose their exact path, still it's for the ultimate climax.

An all time favorite of mine if you like a good deep movie watch this timeless Movie! In a word the Director did a fantastic job and Jack puts a most interesting and believable performance as the bad guy/just trying to stay out of the system as much as he figures a different way to get into more troubles then he bargained for.

868,happyjackalope,A comment on One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,9,3 July 2006,"The wild violin music played during the opening credits of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest perfectly describes the movie. At times it is playful, yet there is a sadness that surrounds it. Our hero is McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson. He is a convict looking for an easy way to escape the busy work that he is forced to do in prison. McMurphy claims to be mentally ill and is committed to a hospital, run by the dominating, cold Nurse Ratched. McMurphy makes friends with many of the patients, particularly the Chief, Billy, Harding, Cheswick, Bancini, and Taber. The main conflict is the power struggle between Nurse Ratched's absolute control and McMurphy's rebellious nature which inspires the other patients to become more independent.The most interesting aspect of the movie is how realistic it appears. The patients truly seem as if they were indeed patients and not hired actors. It can be seen in the background that the actors stay in character even when the camera is not focusing on them. It is also interesting to see that McMurphy does not fool anyone during his stay at the hospital. Although they believe that he is not insane, he continuously gets punished when trying to confront the nurse about her power games. To cure his ""insanity"" McMurphy loses his ability to think on his own. The movie ends with one flying over the cuckoo's nest.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

When she was having that meeting with Dr. Spivey she wanted control, and even tho she new that McMurphy was faking the whole thing she wanted to keep him on the ward so she could break him in, not so she could help him! The thing is that she thinks shes helping the men. And the main thing why people thinks shes evil is that she drove Billy into suicide. She try's to tell the men ""Lets try to get on with are day"" I am not shocked at all that McMurphy tried to kill her.

870,mcjaggerislegit,"Great stuff, worth checking out!",10,11 January 2013,"I usually hesitate to review any movie based on a Book,musical or any other medium before knowing the source material. However I can say that despite not reading the book, One Flew Over The Cuckoos nest is an excellent film that is sure to entertain any fan of movies. The plot follows Mick Murphy, a convict who on his last couple weeks of his sentence pretends to be insane so he's moved to a mental institution as he figures it'll be more comfortable. Well after several instances of disobeying the cold Nurse Ratchet,he learns he's committed to the institute and Nurse Ratchet isn't going to let him go. That's the main jest of it but a lot of time is spent getting to know the other mental patients and and their interactions with Mick Murphy, the most interesting one being Chief, at least for me. The cast what can I say? One of the best cast films ever in my opinion. You see many future stars in there early years including Danny Devito,Christopher Lloyd and more. Of course Jack Nicholson's here and delivers one of his best performances to date. I won't spoil the ending, but it's a nice, bittersweet ending to a film that's harsh but never ceases to entertain.

872,harrisonreinwald,A Masterpiece of American Cinema,10,5 October 2018,"From the vague but beautiful opening shot with the eerie bowed-saw to the symbolic and tragic ending, it is difficult to not become fully immersed. Every role, even the non-speaking ones are played marvelously. Every actor, especially Nicholson and Fletcher, totally embody their characters. The fluctuation between high intensity to absolute hilarity to shocking twists and the breaking of the human spirit despite man's innate desire to revolt against such things, is captured here perfectly. It's the perfect borderline uncomfortable mix that sticks with you, one you won't find anywhere else because whether you like it or not, it's there and it's real. This is Jack Nicholson at his finest, possibly even at his peak. While it is quite different from the novel, the strength of the acting, directing and the desire for a grounded film shedding light on a subject that still has a stigma attached to it. Through the film, the funny scenes as well as the heart-wrenching ones, are all undercut with a realistic looming sense of dread. The acting, directing and quality of a screenplay adapted very differently from the novel were carried out and executed perfectly. This film is tragic, but enchanting.

I believe that, of movies that were made from books, Cuckoos Nest is the most faithfully reproduced. I've seen this movie many times and I always enjoy all the wonderful performances. Also notable are the careers that were launched with Cuckoos Nest. The almost unrecognizable Danny DeVito as Martini. The frenetic Chris Lloyd fitting so neatly into the band of lunatics. Will Sampson was inspiring as Chief Bromden. Cuckoos Nest, overall, coaxes such a wide range of emotions, from out and out hilarity to tear-jerking sadness, that it is nearly impossible to classify.

They both suffer from similar problems. Both novels focus on the internal experiences and perceptions of the main characters, and rather than doing something creative, the film-makers simply tell the story and leave out the point of view. In the novel the entire story is told from the point of view of one of the patients. Sometimes he is drugged, sometimes he is in a fog and sometimes he's thinking clearly. To the reader it is as if you are experiencing being incarcerated in the asylum. All of this is lost in the movie. I really recommend reading the book and forgetting about the movie.

Made from the international bestseller by Ken Kesey this movie draws forward everything that is great in the book and gives it a little touch of more. Jack Nicholson appears here for the first time since he played in Roman Polanskis's ""Chinatown"", and he shows his finest performance yet, he is very convincing as the healthy/lunatic Randle Patrick McMurphy and his acting is close to perfection. Milos Forman's creation has to be praised as one of the best movies that has been made, his mixture of drama and comedy filled with very deep emotions make this movie a masterpiece of filmaking. This movie has a remarkable cast of actors like, Nicholson, Devito, Lloyd, Fletcher and Redfield and all these actors together are a winning formula. Many movies are made by a certain theme, some movies are drama and some movies are comedy. Somehow this movie has a touch of everything, the film is in all aspects funny, witty, heartfelt, disturbing, bizarre, dramatic and very realistic, the film drives on the mixed emotions of the characters and the audience. One of the greatest parts of this film is the music, the music, made by the genius Jack Nietzhe, just underlines the meaning of the film, it brings forth emotions that had otherwise been missed. It's a crucial part of the film and does the movie much good. This film shows us, like never before, the real lives of those who are locked inside a phychiatric institution, their lives are portrayed with utter realism. The way Milos Forman switches emotional gears is devastating, your laughing at some point in the movie and before you know you are suddenly crying. The characters of the book are great and they are very well portrayed by the actors in this film, Jack Nicholson's performance as McMurphy is simply one of the best that he - or any other actor- has ever delivered and other actors like Lloyd and Devito do a fantastic job. The greatness of the acting in this film lies in the very unlike acting of the actors, they each play a character that face different mental problems and these characters aren't the normal patients you see in other movies.When you watch this film you lose track of the time and your whereabouts, the only thing that matters is the film and the characters. Time flies and before you know it, the movie is over and you sit there totally paralyzed, a deep sadness over the dramatical ending is within you and at the same time a great joy over seeing the picture. You view the film and it has an extraordinary impact, you will be mesmerized, entertained and deeply affected. It's art of the highest order! Milos Forman, like Stanley Kubrick led us into a new era of filmaking, they made movies that had great impact on the lives of the people who saw them, I would definitely say that this movie is one of the greatest movie of all times and it has had a big impact on the viewers that have seen it and it has made a path that many modern films today follow. Forman, I salute you.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Each actor did more than a great job. I did not doubt that any of these isn't a crazy person! not for a SINGLE moment! Jack Nicholson's performance was something else. Definitely deserved his Oscar achievement!Louise Fletcher's performance was as great and spectacular as Jack's! I'm absolutely going to watch more movies of her after seeing this performance from her!The worst thing of this great movie is the ending. I really hoped to have a more detailed ending than seeing Murphy die like that! I would have loved to see more scenes of him struggling with the Docs and trying to defend him self. Five of six minutes of that can never hurt nobody, i guess! but that ending isn't a bad one at all, actually, it was a very good one!",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

During these last years is becoming a fact that the budget is the main ingredient you need to make a great movie. I think that this movie is a clear example that it isn't the truth in fact Forman disposed a little budget making one of the greatest movie of all times.The only ingredient that is essential is the talent and the will to give great emotions with your movie.Too many people are forgetting these two things thinking too much at the money.This is why i think that ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" is a hope for everyone who wants to make movies.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

This movie shows us that wanting too much control to keep right in a person can also be harmful, the ruthless nurse makes him an easy character to hate. We could summarize that ""McMurphy"" is represented as the freest man who acts against established authority, which constitutes the great act of freedom, or rather, the essential human act. Indeed, he is the only individual within the great mass, who thinks that the act of disobeying and being free is the act of reason.

The relationship between certain characters really warms your heart. Jack Nicolson takes us on a journey that allows us to develop empathy towards the other characters but his love for life and quirky sense of humour makes us learn to listen to him and also makes us question his emotional state.

I was talked awesomely about this film, and I wanted to see how good it really was.When I started, I could't move away from my TV's screen, 'cause what I was watching, was a real ""Good Film"". Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Randy McMurphy was fantastical, also Louis Fletcher and Brad Dourif, who surprised me very much.Until the end, I was enjoying this ""must-see masterpiece"" without caring about the fact I knew how it would conclude, so, when the time came, I started to feel like talking to McMurphy, literally, to make him aware of what would happen to him. I was caring about Jack Nicholson's character, something Milos Forman nailed.I won't say what happens, because that's something you need to find out, but what I can say, is that I almost cried.

Truly great acting by all cast members. Nicholson is at his very best. The ending was perfect. Not sure that if they were to make the film now it would end but I think that makes the film more real. Danny De Vito is great. Josep Elic is memorable. the card game is absolute class. Sydney Lassick is masterful. Christopher Lloyd albeir ina slightly cameo role is at his very best (perhaps matched by his role in taxi). William duell is excellent as Sefelt and is reminiscent of Stan Laurel.

Even the most obvious, necessary, and sobering scenes -- as when McMurphy tries to strangle Nurse Ratched to death -- were received, not seriously, but with sophomoric cheers and applause. Maybe that's the way to get the most out of the movie -- see it as a simple-minded anti establishment parable -- but I hope not.

Just to start, I'd say this is one of those films that you recommend to every person you know; it's a ""must watch"" without any doubt. In my opinion, what makes this movie such a well-crafted masterpiece is the essence behind the plot. Milos Forman, the director, showed that he could handle a complex movie without trouble. Additionally, he managed to perform a great job catching the spectator's attention. In my opinion, what we see here is one of Jack Nicholson's best performance EVER. You can barely differentiate between the thin line that he's crossing; you can't tell if he's acting or that's just himself displaying his inner craziness. And that's beautiful. The composer Jack Nitzche achieved perfection with the main theme and the movie's soundtrack. You can feel a mixed emotion between what is sadness, happiness, madness and gloom... All at once. That's what just makes this movie even better. Music fills your soul. To summarize, this is a great and beautiful movie with the perfect components to make you feel that you won't forget it.

898,Sia7013,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a 1975 American drama film directed by Milo Forman, based on the 1962 novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey",10,7 December 2015,"In 1963 Oregon, Randle Patrick ""Mac"" McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a recidivist anti-authoritarian criminal serving a short sentence on a prison farm for the statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl, is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation. Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment.McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients. McMurphy finds that they are more fearful of Ratched than they are focused on becoming functional in the outside world. McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader; his fellow patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, stuttering young man; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is belligerent and profane; Jim Sefelt (William Duell), who is epileptic; and ""Chief"" Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent Native American of imposing stature who is believed to be deaf and mute.McMurphy's and Ratched's battle of wills escalates rapidly. When McMurphy's card games win away everyone's cigarettes, Ratched confiscates the cigarettes and rations them out. McMurphy calls for votes on ward policy changes, to watch the World Series, to challenge her. He makes a show of betting the other patients he can escape by lifting an old hydrotherapy console, a massive marble plumbing fixture, off the floor and sending it through the window; but fails to do so.McMurphy steals a hospital bus, herds his colleagues aboard, stops to pick up Candy (Marya Small), a party girl, and takes the group deep sea fishing on a commandeered boat. He tells them: ""You're not nuts; you're fishermen!"" and they begin to feel faint stirrings of self-determination.Soon after, however, McMurphy learns that Ratched and the doctors have the power to keep him committed indefinitely. Sensing a rising tide of insurrection among the group, Ratched tightens her grip on everyone. During one of her group therapy sessions, Cheswick's agitation boils over and he, McMurphy and the Chief wind up brawling with the orderlies.While McMurphy and the Chief wait their turn, McMurphy offers Chief a piece of gum, and Chief murmurs ""Thank you...Ah, Juicy Fruit."" McMurphy is delighted to find that Bromden is neither deaf nor mute, and that he stays silent to deflect attention. After the electroshock therapy, McMurphy shuffles back onto the ward feigning brain damage, before humorously animating his face and loudly greeting his fellow patients, assuring everyone that the Etc only charged him up all the more.As the struggle with Ratched takes its toll, and with his release date no longer a certainty, McMurphy plans an escape. He phones Candy to bring her friend Rose (Louisa Moritz) and some booze to the hospital late one night. They enter through a window after McMurphy bribes the night orderly, Mr. Turkle (Scatman Crothers). McMurphy and Candy invite the patients into the day room for a Christmas party; the group breaks into the drug locker, puts on music, and celebrates. At the end of the night, McMurphy and Bromden prepare to climb out the window with the girls. McMurphy says goodbye to everyone, and invites an emotional Billy to escape with them; he declines, saying he is not yet ready to leave the hospital—though he would like to date Candy in the future. McMurphy insists Billy have sex with Candy right then and there. Billy and Candy agree and they retire to a private room. The effects of the alcohol and pilfered medication take their toll on everyone, including McMurphy and the Chief, whose eyes slowly close in fatigue.Ratched arrives the following morning and discovers the scene: the ward completely upended and patients passed out all over the floor. She orders the attendants to lock the window, clean up, and conduct a head count. When they find Billy and Candy, the other patients applaud and, buoyed, Billy speaks for the first time without a stutter. Ratched then announces that she will tell Billy's mother what he has done. Billy panics, his stutter returns, he starts punching himself and then locks himself in the doctor's office. Locked inside, Billy kills himself. McMurphy, enraged at Ratched, chokes her nearly to death until orderly Washington knocks him out.Some time later, the patients in the ward play cards and gamble for cigarettes as before, only now with Harding dealing and delivering a pale imitation of McMurphy's patter. Ratched, still recovering from the neck injury sustained during McMurphy's attack, wears a neck brace and speaks in a thin, reedy voice. The patients pass a whispered rumor that McMurphy dramatically escaped the hospital rather than being taken ""upstairs"".Late that night, Bromden sees McMurphy being escorted back to his bed, and initially believes that he has returned so they can escape together, which he is now ready to do since McMurphy has made him feel ""as big as a mountain"". However, when he looks closely at McMurphy's unresponsive face, he is horrified to see lobotomy scars on his forehead. Unwilling to allow McMurphy to live in such a state, the Chief smothers McMurphy to death with his pillow. He then carries out McMurphy's escape plan by lifting the hydrotherapy console off the floor and hurling the massive fixture through a grated window. Chief climbs through the window and runs off into the distance, with Taber waking up just in time to see him escape and cheering as the others awake.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

The film flows in such a way that it seems to submerse you in the mental institution portrayed in the film and at certain points makes you feel a little ""nuts"" yourself. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the film has very little or perhaps no musical score at all from what I was able to tell.

Jack Nicolson is especially good as the lead character.I am a Psychology major so, I guess I could be biased toward a movie and book that take a look at the mental health care system and point out what is wrong with it. I will say that some of the content could be disturbing to those who have not read the book or are not familiar with mental illness. I feel that the movie can be enjoyed by everyone.

Nichols gave a masterful performance (as he usually does), and was well-deserving of his award, but though Louise Fletcher was very effective as the cruel nurse, I didn't think her performance should garner a best actress nomination, let alone a win in the prestigious category. At best I think it could possibly have deserved a nomination for best supporting actress, and, in my opinion, that would be generous. Very solid ensemble cast, almost any one of the patients on the ward could've been nominated for best supporting actor. The story worked well, I was intrigued from the start. I loved all of the scenes with the ward meetings; the performers seemed to feed off one another and they all worked very well. Cukoo's nest also had its humorous moments and its surprises, and of course the psychological struggle for power between Nicholson and Fletcher, but ultimately failed to wow me.

Is totally understandable this movie won the 'Big Five Academy Award', it's a cult film. You must watch it before you die, be sure you won't regret about it.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Both McMurphy and Nurse Ratched push each other like a competitive game, and it the end it hurt them and innocent victims who were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

I'm sure that every bookreader would agree with me - all the emotions of the book were stamped to the ground with this butcher-ish adaption. Mcmurphy seemed like a typical violent fella, who just did things because he felt like it. But one of the most important part of the story was the reason WHY he did all these things.

I thought to myself, ""how did we actually do this to human beings!"" I thank God that changes were made to how the United States of America, as well as several more industrialized nations throughout the world, have made reforms to their mental health system. And I pray that changes are made where they have not been made. One thing that I loved about this film was the fact that only a criminal convicted of assault and statutory rape was able to be kind to those who had nowhere to go, and nobody to stand up for them.

917,thedog-70652,A movie to remember (contains many spoilers!!!),10,22 March 2016,"One Who Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a movie about Randle McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson, who is transferred to a mental institution for mental evaluation from a prison farm. He hopes to avoid the hard work and relax the rest of his sentence by trying to pretend to be crazy. In the institution he meets a cast of characters such as Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), Chief (Will Simpson), Martini (Danny Devito) and quite a few other people on the ward during his stay. The main nurse Mildred Ratched (Louis Fletcher) serves as the antagonist who keeps a firm hold on her ward, while Murphy mixes things up in the ward, really showing everyone how to live outside of Ratched's control.The main theme in this movie is freedom. And not necessarily freedom from the institution itself, but freedom from the mental barriers that exist, possibly because of the institution. Of course everyone in the institution has some sort of mental setback, and they sit through the therapy sessions with Nurse Ratched, but these sort of sessions simply point out their issues, and don't necessarily instill any self-confidence in the individuals themselves, and bury themselves deeper into their issues. Such as when Nurse Ratched gives Billy a hard time when he speaks about the time he told a girl he wanted to marry her, but never told his mother about the relationship in the first place; instead of providing any helpful insight to this issue. This all changes of course, when McMurphy comes into the picture. He brings a sense of life into the institute, and helps instill individualism in each member of the ward, being able to speak up for themselves. Such as the scene where Cheswick speaks up about wanting his cigarettes when Ratched starts to ration them since the boys would lose all their cigarettes to McMurphy while betting on card games. McMurphy even convinces Chief to stop playing dumb and deaf, and finally leave the ward. This plan all goes south, however, when during a party Billy sleeps with Candy and Nurse Ratched finds out. Billy commits suicide after the nurse tells him that she will tell his mother about his escapades. McMurphy strangles Ratched, leaving her in a neck brace. He is however, given a lobotomy essentially making him a vegetable. While McMurphy didn't come in with a mental illness, he did have one now. Chief, seeing how his spirit was broken, knew it was the time for freedom. He freed McMurphy of his body by smothering him with a pillow, then breaking the glass with the large marble counter in the tub room, running off into the sunrise. He gave McMurphy the freedom he would want, and the spirit of freedom was instilled into the rest of the ward, as they cheered on Chief when he ran. While it's hard to say what would happen to the ward after the fact, the spirit of freedom still lives on in all of them, along with the true memory of McMurphy. No one else saw him as the vegetable he became, so the hope and power given to them may convince them to have the self-confidence to leave the ward, as many were there voluntarily.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Milos Foreman tells the story so crisp and clear it is like viewing a movie in 4K. Nicholson gives hands down one of the most memorable characters ever that has ever been in film and the patients besides McMurphy (Nicholson) are portrayed so well that it is easy to forget that they are acting.

Nothing can sum this story better than the book. Personally I would recommend reading the book. It tells a much more in-depth and touching tale. But the movie is a good substitute if you can not read the book. The movie tells the tale of old McMurphy only, while the book looks at the perspective of the old Chief Bromden. The movie does not do the Chief justice. It does not fully portray his character like the book does. The movie did have good acting though by Jack Nickolson which helped give a sense of reality to the story. The horrors that occurred in the mental institution are not exaggerated. The horrors of Lobotomy and Shock Treatment really did occur in some mental institutions.

As soon as it introduces the group of patients playing cards together you instantly fall in love with them, with the amount of charisma and chemistry they have between them, it makes it hard not too. The first and second act of the movie was so uplifting and just puts a smile on your face the entire time your watching. But once the third act starts, it has completely different feel. It goes from uplifting, light-hearted, and fun. To tragic, hostile, and gains an air of melancholy around it.

The characters don't really show the condition they have as in personality wise and why they are there.

After reading the book, I decided to watch the movie, to see how it was translated on the big screen. Unfortunately, the movie throws around the plot of the book. People die in the middle of the book, and by the end of the movie, they are still alive. The deaths were a huge part of the novel! Not only that, but the fishing trip didn't go how it went in the book either which was a huge disappointment. Along with the plot not being followed, the pacing of the movie mad every scene feel so rushed. I didn't have time to transition from one thing to another. The pacing almost made me lost because I was trying to catch up. Lastly, The characters were a slight disappointment. In the book McMurphy was loved by the other patients, but in the movie it seemed like he was a jerk and people couldn't wait to get rid of him. I also pictured McMurphy to be much bigger because the movie described him that way. Jack Nicholson is not a big guy. Overall, I was disappointed.

The movie, based upon the book, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey, is an original novel coming to life. Words from a page are turned into a pleasing visual film that makes you sit on the edge of your seat. As a classic novel, the book does not follow the original written novel as closely, the main character changes from the book to the novel, and the emotions held within the novel are less-existing in the movie. The movie does not follow the book closely, leaving out key-events such as; the black boys seeming excited to take patients temperatures, or the event in which Mr. Harding's wife visits. Both of those events are not present in the film. The main character changes in the film, in the film, the main character is McMurphy, a wild man who is avoiding jail, while in the book, Chief Bromden is the main character; Chief Bromden tells the story through his eyes in the book, and this is not present in the film at all, instead Chief Bromden is rarely present within the film. Lastly, the emotions within the book are less-existing in the movie. In the book, mostly the emotions held are less pleasant and humorous, while in the film, the director tends to lean towards humor in the film. All of these reasons given further explain my reasoning for the rating I have given this movie. The movie does not follow the book, and after reading the book, this is disappointing, while the characters and their point-of-view changes as well, also the emotions shifts from the novel to the movie.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Deserves a 5 star rating because I did appreciate some parts of the movie, but yet again I would not buy this movie due to many parts of the movie to be weary to my liking. 
The movie ""The One Who Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" has a splendid soundtrack, the pacing seemed slow, and the ending has a drastic cliffhanger. The movie has a splendid soundtrack because it's relaxing to listen to, Jack Nitzsche is the producer of all the music in the movie. The pacing of the movie seems slow in the beginning which is quite annoying, but it might be due to the fact that the actors in the movie are acting to be mentally disturbed. The actor of McMurphy; Jack Nicholson, was a great choice to be set in the movie because he also was in the movie ""The Shining"" which definitely made the pacing of this movie faster due to his upbeat personality, and he is great with acting ""crazy"". The ending has a drastic cliffhanger because someone rand away from the Hospital, were they found and brought back? Did they die? Did they live there life like all the other rabbits out there? No one will know.

If you read the book and watch the movie, you will notice that many parts are skip or switched around. Not only did the movie not follow the book, but some of the characters are bad actors.
The reason why I think that the characters are bad actors is because the nurse, Mrs. Ratched, barley smiled, and she doesn't show a lot of expression throughout the movie, but chief and McMurphy played their role professionally. Even though the book did not follow the book, one thing I did enjoy is the music. The music is relaxing, and it relates to the movie.

938,hanleytaylor,"The movie was okay, but the book was so much better.",5,24 May 2018,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (OFOCN) is a movie that was released in 1975; it is based off a book bearing the same name by Ken Kesey and directed by Milos Forman. I would just like to quickly note that I read the book; had I not read the book, I may have thought that ""OFOCN"" was a good movie, despite the recurrent plot choppiness, but since I read the book, I believe that it is only an okay movie. The movie does not follow the book very well. The main idea of the plot was still there, but there are things that were important in the book, but left out in the movie. The character interpretation left something to be desired. Sure there were good actors- Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Lloyd- which made the movie better, but the personalities of their characters, especially those of Nicholson and Fletcher, were completely different and altered the plot a little. Another thing that was not close to being accurate was that the entire book was narrated from the main character, Chief Bromden's, point of view, complete with his hallucinations. In the movie, McMurphy is the main character, and Chief isn't even seen for most of the movie. I feel that the director could have done a better job with that; they could have used a voice over, so that chief could still narrate things from his point of view. Also, many of the important events that happened in the book, did not happen in the movie or they switched the characters that were in the events. The book was written to show how people with mental illness live and how they were treated at the time, which was shown in a deep way through the character personalities, the way they interacted, Chief's narration, and the events that happen in the book. Since the movie changed a lot of these things, I believe that the story lost its depth and its underlying meaning; it just became a movie about a sane guy disrupts a bunch of ""crazy people"". Lastly, the movie jumps around a lot; they leave out some details that leaves you wondering, ""What caused this to be happening now?"" Overall, I recommend that you either read the book or watch the movie, not both, though I would recommend the book over the movie any day. The movie itself has good actors and a fairly strong plot line, but does not follow the book it is based off of very well. All in all, I would give OFOCN a 5 out of 10.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
939,costellotaylor,A slightly disappointing movie compared to the book,2,24 May 2018,"I would rate the movie ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" directed by Milo Forman in 1975 a 2 out of 5 stars because, although the movie has a decent plot and the actors did their job well, the movie was far different from the book. 
 I thought that the actors did a nice job. These actors played their parts well and from the looks of it, enjoyed participating in the production on the film. but what I struggled with throughout the movie was that the actor's appearances did not match what I had visualized while reading and did not meet the books physical description of each individual character. Personally, I would not have picked the actors that they did because of they did not fit the characters personality and looks. I also felt that they movie skipped from one scene to the next with little transition. Another large problem I had with the movie is there were so many new scenes and the entire movie felt rushed as if they were trying to fit too many things in at once and I feel that it ruined the quality of the movie. I found myself getting confused on where the scene was taking part and what was going on. I feel that, if the movie was slowed down with less scenes and more details, I would have enjoyed it more. This leads me to my final criticism that I may have already made fairly clear. I read the book before watching the movie and would 10/10 recommend the book, but was very disappointed after how the movie ruined the story. There were a lot of events that did not match up, some in which did not even happen. This really look away from the meaning of the movie and the awareness it was meant to bring. Overall, I think I did not like the movie because I had read the book prior and enjoyed it very much. The movie would have been much better if it would have followed the original plot from the book, if the actors would have matched the looks and personalities of the characters, and if the movie didn't skip through every scene is such a short amount of time.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
940,butzlerbrady,A Pretty Decent Interpretation,7,24 May 2018,"The movie, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" directed Milos Forman in 1975, is an interesting interpretation based off the book and should receive a 7.1 out of 10. I will first start with the negatives of this movie that brought its score down a bit. As director Milos Forman did make it his own by changing up the script from the book, I think this negatively affected the movie. I feel as though Chief wasn't as involved in parts of the movie, and it makes it odd when he and McMurphy all of a sudden strike up an unlikely friendship. This would have been explained a lot better if Chief would've been allowed to go on the fishing trip and start bonding with the guys a little more. Also, Cheswick does not die in the movie, and the other inmates do not leave the ward at the end as they do in the book. I feel as though this takes away from the harsh life of the ward and the reason why McMurphy wanted out so bad in the end. What ""OFOTCN"" lacked in plot, it made up for in casting. The actors in this movie were quite fabulous. Jack Nicholson made a perfect McMurphy in my opinion and Will Sampson was the Chief I had pictured in my head all along. The movie kept excelling with its cast by sprinkling in actors such as Danny Devito as Martini, Christopher Lloyd as Taber, and Brad Dourif as Billy Bibbit. These actors fit their own ""insane"" quirks with perfection and couldn't have done a better job. ""OFOTCN"" kept the excellence going with its special effects. Lastly, I believe that the special effects in this movie exceeded its 1975 dating. Usually when one watches an older movie like this, you can see the cheesy special effects come into play. I thought that the boat scene with the water splashing everywhere was done very well. Also, all of the blood that came into play in the movie was very well done and didn't look fake as it so often does. In conclusion, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" was a above average film by a slight margin. If someone asked me the exact words I would use to describe the quality of this movie, I would promptly say that it was ""pretty decent,"" no more, no less.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
941,cookethan,A Missed Oprotunity,6,24 May 2018,"6.5/10One Flew Over a Cuckoo's Nest relies on the power of the setting and natural talent of the actors to compel the viewer to an emotional connection with the characters, but the tactic simply falls flat, making for a drab and uninteresting film. 
 The first issue I have with the movie was the weak connections between characters. Despite stellar individual performances from Jack Nicholson (R.P. McMurphy), William Redfield (Harding), Danny DeVito (Martini), and Brad Dourif (Billy Bibbit) the film fails to build anything more than surface level connections between the characters. Throughout the story the audience is left with a sense of dissatisfaction from meaningless interactions between characters that fail to have any real consequences, something I will touch on more later.
 The second main issue I have is the atmosphere of the movie. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest had the potential to create substantial fear and anxiety for the viewer by making Nurse Ratched and the ward some dangerous and hostile towards our group of patient protagonists, but instead the atmosphere of the ward comes off as bright and welcoming and Ms. Ratched's threats never seem to carry any weight. This goes back to character actions not having any consequences, the primary problem in the film. Throughout the film we see characters make decisions that break the rules of the ward, but we never see any consequences that these actions have until the very end of the movie. For example, when the patients break out of the ward and go fishing they receive no punishment for breaking the rules. The same is true when McMurphy punches through the window: no consequences. The only time we see a major consequence for a character action is when McMurphy undergoes the shock treatment and lobotomy, but by this point it is too late to make it meaningful. More on-screen consequences would have made the ward more dangerous and Nurse Ratched a figure to fear. Instead we get an carefree romp of a movie when we could have had a meaningful story about a group of strangers bonding together to become better people.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

All the actors looked and fit their part. I don't think they could have found better actors for the characters in this movie. The characters were easy to connect with and relate to. Jack Nicholson does an excellent job playing the role of the stubborn McMurphy, and Louise Fletcher does a good job playing the role of the mean and scary Nurse Ratched. Watching them two bicker and compete against each other during the whole movie was quite enjoyable. The movie was pretty well paced. None of the scenes in the movie seemed rushed to the point where you wouldn't be able to understand what is going on. My favorite scene in the movie is when McMurphy brings the women onto the ward and they cause chaos during the night while Nurse Ratched is gone. The only thing about this movie that I did not like is that it does not follow the book completely. There are some scenes from the movie that are included from book such as the fishing trip and McMurphy and Chief Bromden getting sent up to Disturbed. Some events not shown in the movie are Cheswick's death and Chief's hallucinations. Chief also was not very prominent in the movie as he was in the book, which was kinda disappointing.

While One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has great acting and a setting that fits how it is described in the book, it is unable to properly tell the story. To begin with, it completely switches the main character from Chief to McMurphy, which won't be a big deal if you don't read the book first, but since I did the whole movie just seemed off without the narration of Chief's thoughts. With that, the entire movie's tone was way off. The movie felt like it was light-hearted with the bright lighting and laughing going on throughout almost all of it, but in the novel I felt the tone as dark and depressing with it being a very major point that the characters refused to laugh. Finally, this leads to the ending, which just felt abrupt, it was a depressing ending to an otherwise light-hearted movie with little build up, leaving almost no sympathy felt for the characters. I was disappointed by this movie, but if you watch the movie without reading the book it you may like it more.

944,felchjasmine,You won't see that coming!,8,24 May 2018,"""One Who Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" directed by Milos Forman should be rated a 4 out of 5 because mostly follows the book, has very good screenplay from the actors, and the plot is almost seamless. The first criteria is the connection of the book to the movie. There were a few parts taken out, but it did not take away from the movie. The most important events from the book were portrayed in the movie; an example would be when Chief and McMurphy were sent to disturbed. The second criteria is the great screenplay of the actors. I think that Jack Nicholson and Danny DeVito did a great job playing the characters as Randle McMurphy and Martini. The actors portrayed the reason why they were in the ward very well. The last criteria was the plot. The plot of the movie was for the most part very easy to understand, and it was entertaining. I had a hard time understanding the fishing scene, and there were a few characters missing from the trip in the movie that were originally present in the book. Overall, the movie had fantastic screenplay, a flowing plot, and the movie closely follows the book; this is why I decided to rate the book a 4 out of 5 stars.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
945,menzynskitaylor,'Almost' a Good Movie,6,24 May 2018,"The movie ""The One Who Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" directed by Milos Forman, would be rated 3 out of 5 stars for me because many changes were made while adapting the book into a movie, there was very little emotional connection for me, however the actors were great fits for the characters. There were many changes that I didn't appreciate in the movie version. Some important plot pieces were completely taken out changing the story line, such as Chief going to the fishing trip all together. Because of all these changes I had a difficult time having an emotional connection to the events and characters in the story. The changes made the movie seem rushed therefore the feelings I gathered from the movie was much less in comparison to the book version. However, the characters were all loveable thanks to the people who played their parts. Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Danny Devito, Brad Dourif, Will Sampson, and many other actors did a phenomenal job depicting their characters just as they were in the book. Reading the book of course I was going to have a biased of the movie; however, the people playing the characters in the story truly gave me the most perfect representation of the characters that I was imagining in my head. I would have wanted more screen time to have had the story be better developed so I could have more of an emotional stance on the movie, and so we could have more screen time with these amiable characters.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
946,vonrudenmarcus,"Solid movie with great acting, but leaves out the imagery the book described so well.",7,24 May 2018,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a serious toned movie, with some mildly disturbing themes, but also has its moments of light hearted humour. The movie is of course based on the book, but without spoiling anything, I can say that they have multiple differences and many small things are left out or not properly explained. Without reading the book first, understanding some of the characters and the ending may be difficult or just confusing. OFOTCN is a solid movie with excellent acting, Jack Nicholson is always a plus, but is lacking in production value and a clear direction. It isn't clear what everyone's intentions are until towards the end of the film we get an idea of what just some of the characters want. The music isn't memorable and the movie's visuals having nothing especially different or specifically appealing about them. Another minor complaint is that the nurse never truly felt evil in the movie as she did in the book. In the movie, she seems to be a woman just doing her job rather than a control freak constantly abusing her powers. The hospital is an evil place as in the book, but it never truly feels evil like in the book. Chief explains things in the book through his own mind that allows us to see the hospitals ""true colors"" and understand just how evil it is. Without Chief's narration in the movie or any other visual symbolism, the hospital is just... a hospital. The viewer sees what it is from the outside and you can see how the inmates live, but seeing the hospital through their eyes at any point would've made for a much more interesting and in depth experience. When reading the book, I thought of the asylum as like the prison from Shawshank Redemption, which is an excellent film sharing many of the same themes. A truly evil place with a twisted leader, but the movie just doesn't deliver what the book constructed so well.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
947,unsethlarissa,Book vs Movie. Who will win?!?!,4,24 May 2018,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (OFOCN) was released in 1975; it is based on the novel by Ken Kesey and is directed by Milos Forman. The movie centers around R.P McMurphy (Jack Nicholson). In an attempt to escape from the work yards in the penitentiary, McMurphy fakes a mental illness, leading to him being admitted into a mental hospital. There, he befriends many of the other patients in the ward and attempts to break them out of the strict and monotonous routine set by Head Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). In the book, Chief played the main role, however; in the movie, McMurphy is the main character. Like this instance, many other important events in the book were not displayed in the movie. The movie itself was good, and if I hadn't read the book, I would've gave it a better rating. All in all, I would rate ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" a 4 out of 10.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
948,masoncassidy-98785,Recommended movie,8,24 May 2018,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975), based on the novel by Ken Kesey and directed by Milos Forman earns a 8 out of 10 star rating by me, one reason being how closely the movie relates to the novel. If were to not have read the novel before watching the movie, I would have gave this movie a 10 out of 10 star rating. I feel that the movie left out important scenes that were made very important in the novel. Another reason why I would give this movie a 8 out of 10 star rating is how the characters compare in the novel and the movie. Each character seemed to be different in the movie than they were in the novel. Although I am giving thi movie a 8 out of 10 star rating, I would recommend watching this movie, preferably without reading the novel prior to the movie.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
949,balsdonwilliam,"Serious, but sometimes Fuuny",7,24 May 2018,"6.8/10 ""One Flew Over A Cuckoo's Nest"" is a serious, but sometimes humours movie based on the book, though you can tell several differences that I did and didn't like. The first part that I didn't like is the pacing. At first the pacing seems pretty normal, but during the end, which I won't spoil, has an extremely fast pace. My second issue is how the movie sometimes goes way off the book. In the book there are certain events like Cheswicks's death, or that Chief went fishing with them that happened in the book didn't happen in the movie. For my third thing, I did like the actors that were in it. In the movie Jack Nicholson really brought the movie to life, and brought some of the parts in the movie rememberal. In the ending, while the movie had its flaws, it was a humorous movie that you will remember for a long time.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
950,olsongarrett,Needs Work,6,24 May 2018,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest received a 6/10 stars due to the combination of the plot and the acting in this classic movie. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest was directed by Milos Forman, and the story was written by Ken Kesey. The plot was very iffy from the beginning due to key events in the story missing such as: Chief didn't have any role compared to his role in the book, Cheswick did not drown himself, and the Doctor not going fishing with the patients. Lastly it felt like the only thing going well for the movie would be the perfect acting of the characters, they literally made this movie good. Other than that the director missed many opportunities to make this movie astounding with his acting crew, but choked with the plot of the story.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
951,leisdana,7/10,7,24 May 2018,"The 1975 movie, ¨One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest¨ directed by Milos Forman is a moderate movie because of the characters, how it follows the book, and the emotional connection is lacking between the book and the movie.
The characters are played well by the actors, but some of the characters changed in the movie. An example of this is that Chief is not a main character. The movie moderately follows the book written by Ken Kesey, but if you have read the book and loved it, then you may be a tad bit disappointed with the movie. You may be asking why? Well, one of the main characters, McMurphy, doesn't have red hair in the movie which is the one of the main reasons why people first notice him. The book makes the characters more memorable than in the movie.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
952,kilfoylepaul,The One Who Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest Revew,8,24 May 2018,"There are primarily three things I used to critique this film : characters/actors, pacing, emotional impact, that I feel make it a good film. I feel that these three criteria help make this a good film. You can't have a good movie without good actors, pacing, and emotional impact. In the movie I feel that Jack nicholson, the one who plays mcmurphy in the film did an amazing job portraying who mcmurphy is. One of my biggest problems with the film was the pacing. I feel there was no good sense of time in the film. I didn't feel like they were there for very long. The emotional impact of the film was amazing. I really felt for the characters All in all I feel it was a good movie. It wasn't the best movie i've ever seen, but I would recommend this film to all viewers",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
953,jandy-6,"Timeless movie, even our grown daughter likes it.",9,15 January 2006,"My new husband and I saw this movie when we were first married and we both discuss and remember it 30 years later. The characters are real, like the neighbors next door instead of unbelievable. Of course Jack Nicholson was and is still a great actor who after all these years pulls in the crowds. For a short while, I truly believed he would be typecast into ""crazy' roles from that point on. His mix of crazy and humor is the true mark of an Oscar winning performer. His dreams to crash the place and escape were well acted out and believable. Having seen this movie on the drive-in screen almost 30 years ago, I would still pay to see it again.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
954,nonesuch93,I'm human. Just let me be one !!,10,17 March 2008,"For me, this is inarguably one of the greatest films the American Cinema has ever produced. There are many reasons:ACTING: Thoroughly deserving, both Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher won Oscar for their performances. The rest of the cast did as good as them both.DIRECTION: Excluding the technical aspects, Milos Forman directed as good as any one. Each and every character was given its proper time to be developed and perceived by the audiences. He was able to successfully show that the only regular way of life a human must follow is to follow an irregular path regularly. The movie makes us believe that we are humans, we have desires, we need freedom: of thoughts, of actions, and most importantly, of perceptions !!THE TITLE: The allegorical title of the film ""One flew over the Cuckoo's nest"" means ""Cuckoo's nest"" as the hospital and the ""one who flew over"" it is ""McMurphy"" (my dear Jack). The name is allegorical as well as deep since Cuckoo is the ONLY bird that doesn't have its own nest. So is the case with the patients that do not own the dwelling but still they're the cuckoos with a nest(hospital).A bit about the 2 main characters:NURSE RATCHET: Her main purpose seems to be keeping her patients weak, in order that she can mold them into what she wants them to be - good, docile ""rabbits"" who can be sent back out to fill their places in society quietly.McMURPHY: An ""uncivilized"" brawler, and is curiously honest, for he never pretends to be anything other than what he is. It is his ability ""to be himself"" that differentiates him from other inmates.He is his own man which sets him apart from the frightened, repressed group of men who have placed themselves voluntarily Under Nurse Rached's authority.FINAL SAY: As they say the audiences like happy endings, well the movie has an exception here either.It neither makes you gloomy nor very happy i presume. What it does is: see for yourself!! Without a doubt in my mind, 10 out of 10!",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

957,Firas1,one of best Jack Nicholson film,9,22 April 2020,"This movie remains possibly THE finest psychological drama I have ever seen, mixed with both outrage and subtle comedy. You can look at Jack Nicholson's face and know exactly what he is thinking. He has zero unconscious bias against anyone and just wants everyone to find a way to enjoy life. Not to mention how amazing that it debuted supporting actors such as Christopher Lloyd and Danny deVito. This movie also made Nurse Ratched (sounds vaguely like wretched, or more like ratchet, a tool that clamps down but doesn't let go!) an icon for cruel treatment. Interesting that this movie was released just five years after Reagan signed the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act to end long term involuntary incarceration of mental patients.They just don't make movies like this anymore.",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
