0,Leofwine_draca,Better than the competition,6,13 October 2020,"ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL certainly isn't a great film, but it's better than I'd been expecting and it's considerably better than the likes of VALERIAN and GHOST IN THE SHELL. Robert Rodriguez is an old hand at making comic book style stories and this is certainly a visually impressive movie, with a fun plot involving extremely realistic and humanised cyborgs. It screams cyberpunk and BLADE RUNNER, with plenty of cool action sequences taking your mind off the shallowness of it all and the overloard of CGI on frequent occasions. The cast are also a lot better than you'd expect for this kind of film, and the main character looks great.",Alita - Battle Angel
1,SnoopyStyle,good start but...,6,26 February 2019,"It's 300 years after The Fall, a devastating global war. Zalem survives as the sole floating city. Beneath it lies the slums of Iron City where many of the world's surviving population has gathered. Only products from the factories go up to Zalem. No one goes up although rumors persist. Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) runs a clinic repairing robotic limbs for the poor. He scavenges cyborg parts from Zalem's scraps. He repairs it and names her Alita (Rosa Salazar) after his dead daughter. She has no memories. She is befriended by Hugo who introduces her to the popular sport of Motorball. Dyson's ex-wife Dr. Chiren (Jennifer Connelly) is working for crime lord Vector (Mahershala Ali). Girls are being murdered for their robotic parts.Surprisingly, I really like the start of the movie. I even like Alita's doll eyes. The city could use a bit more grime. I don't particularly like Motorball. It reminds me of a futuristic Rollerball which leads me more towards a B-movie vibe. I thought the dead girls could be a good dark serial killer mystery but it's simply an excuse to introduce some bad guys. The story gets further and further into things that isn't very interesting. I love the first cyborg battle in the alley but it gets a bit boring after that. I still like the movie but it's a bit boring as it keeps going. I figured it would elevate with a visit to Zalem but it's not that either. I'm a little disappointed after a good start.",Alita - Battle Angel
2,boblipton,Gets The Story And The Money Behind The Production On The Movie Screen,6,29 September 2021,"Essentially a movie version of the nine-volume manga, this movie was in development for more than a decade by James Camern before he handed over the script to Robert Rodriguez. With the actors enhanced with CGI -- particularly Rosa Salazar as Alita, with the enormous eyes of Japanese anime -- it's hard to view this as anything but an animated picture. Rodriguez, with the largest budget of his career, spends it wisely and gets the money on the screen. Assisted by fine actors like Christopher Waltz and Jennifer Connelly, the story is half Pinocchio, half Conan the Barbarian, as directed by Cecil B. Demille.It's not the sort of movie that I search out, but given the enormous talent involved, I had to take a look. I have to admit that for this sort of movie, it seems very well done.",Alita - Battle Angel
3,Prismark10,A bloated messy spectacle,6,23 July 2019,"A big budget adaptation of a Japanese manga. Alita: Battle Angel has some great action courtesy of director Robert Rodriguez who makes good use of a bigger budget.The hands of producer James Cameron are everywhere in the visual effects. It looks like a Cameron movie. Unfortunately his typewriter is visible in the screenplay he co-wrote. A clunky story made worse because he wants to use this movie to set up the sequels.Set 300 years in the future with a nice makeover of the Fox logo. After a destructive global war, there is a wonderful floating city up in the sky called Zalem.The film is set in the slums of the city beneath. Iron City where it is a wretched dog eat dog world and people dream of getting into Zalem somehow. However no one goes up unless they win a champions league supreme Motorball competition once every few years.Dr Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) finds some cyborg parts and rebuilds her calling her Alita (Rosa Salazar) after his dead daughter. Ido is also a Hunter-Warrior looking for the scum who killed his disabled daughter some years ago. He also seems to know more about what exactly Zalem is as does his ex-wife Dr Chiren (Jennifer Connelly) who is desperate to get back up there by hook or by crook.Ido is worried about Alita who looks and frustratingly acts like an innocent trusting young girl and her brain has no memories of who she was. Iron City is a violent world where women are being killed for body parts.Alita excels as a warrior and in the game of Motorball. She comes to the attention of Vector (Mahershala Ali) the criminal who runs this city. One of his scavenger's Hugo befriends Alita.It is wonderful to look at, the action soon becomes derivative and repetitive though. The film also shows its influences too easily. Blade Runner, Tron: Legacy, Rollerball, Robocop.The screenplay lacks a killer punch. Like some of the baddies, doomed to get up and repeat their mistakes.",Alita - Battle Angel
4,claudio_carvalho,"Great Screenplay, Cast and Special Effects",8,15 July 2019,"In 2563, three hundred years after the war ""The Fall"", the mysterious scientist Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) finds part of a female cyborg in a junkyard and brings to his laboratory. He finds that her human brain is amnestic but intact and gives the name of his deceased daughter Alita (Rosa Salazar) to the cyborg. Alita meets on the street Dr. Ido´s ex-wife Chiren (Jennifer Connelly), who is also a scientist that works to the powerful Zapan (Ed Skrein), and befriends the young Hugo (Keean Johnson), who brings cyborg´s parts to Dr. Ido, and learns that both dream on moving to the floating city of Zalem. Hugo teaches Alita how to play Motorball and she learns that the champion of the Motorball Tournament moves to Zalem. Soon Alita discovers that Dr. Ido is a hunter warrior and after finding her cyborg body in a crashed spaceship, she decides to become also a hunter warrior but Dr. Ido refuses to replace her body. Who was Alita and what is the secret of the cyborg body found by Alita?""Alita: Battle Angel"" is a sci-fi adventure with great screenplay, cast and special effects. The Japanese anime of an amnestic cyborg that finds who she was is engaging to any sci-fi fan. Dr. Ido is a sort of cyborg Dr. Frankenstein and the direction of Robert Rodriguez is entertaining as usual. The conclusion indicates that there will be a sequel. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Alita: Anjo de Combate"" (""Alita: Battle Angel"")",Alita - Battle Angel

The sky city of Zalem (not Elysium) rules over the factory town of Iron City which make the world's worst beer. Dr. Ido scours the dumps for parts to cannibalize for cyborgs He discovers a cyborg head of old technology with the brain still in it. He attaches the head to the legs he had created for his deceased daughter, Alita. Alita (Rosa Salazar) looks like a typical teen created by Margaret Keane. There are a number of things happening in the city...there is a slasher, bounty hunters, and motorball which is like rollerball with swords. And oh yea. There is a human boy.It was a fun action film that leaves you hanging for a part 2. Since Hollywood loves trilogies, you know what to expect.Guide: 1 F-word. No sex or nudity.",Alita - Battle Angel
6,kosmasp,Rodriguez doing it again,8,8 May 2019,"So while James Cameron is really very busy with Avatar 2-5 (I know? Wasn't it supposed to be a trilogy?), he does find time to produce things like this. But we have Robert Rodriguez at the helm. A director who is always juggling between kid friendly themes and themes that are aimed at adults. And he mostly succeeds in his efforts.In this case he gets a playground like never before - at least that's how it feels. Even bigger than the one he had with Sin City and he had quite a budget there too. Here we get a movie from a source material a lot of people seemed to have been curious about. Now I never had heard about Alita, but the movie is really something when it comes to Science Fiction. The PG-13 boundaries have also been moved it feels at times. At least we get quite a lot of action, but then again most involve something non-human (even if it is human like).If you like Fantasy and Action you will be more than entertained, even if the story is quite predictable. It did not translate quite into the box office, so I'm not sure there will be more movies ... but we'll take what we get",Alita - Battle Angel
7,classicsoncall,"""I do not stand by in the presence of evil.""",7,9 September 2020,"This really isn't a criticism, but ""Alita: Battle Angel"" is primarily a movie made for teens and young adults, so for me it had limited appeal. I know Japanese manga comics and anime have found increased popularity over the years, and this appeared to be anime brought into the physical world so to speak. That's particularly true with the character of Alita (Rosa Salazar), who actually does look like an animated version of a super-hero type warrior. Her doll eyes in particular were distracting for this viewer, who kept wondering why she was made to look like a robot. Alita has the fighting skills of Panzer Kunst, a lost combat art for machine bodies in the twenty fourth century. More specifically, she's been restored from an Iron City scrap pile by Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz), and given the body of an URM (United Repunlics of Mars) berserker, following a brief run with the synthetic body of Ido's own daughter who died. There's plenty of fight action and while it takes some time for Alita to recover her past memories, it seemed like she was able to defeat an army of formidable techno-warriors much too easily given her size and youth. A good portion of the story utilizes the concept of the 1975 film ""Rollerball"", here renamed Motorball for the Iron City crowd. By handily defeating the Second League of Champions in her first Motorball contest, the film makers set up an expected sequel in which she graduates to a First League battle to become champion, which goes without saying, as it's a foregone conclusion that Alita would prevail in any future movie.",Alita - Battle Angel
8,jboothmillard,Alita: Battle Angel,4,17 February 2019,"James Cameron (The Terminator, Aliens, Titanic, Avatar) was originally meant to be director, he stayed as producer, along with Jon Landau, but he passed on directing to Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn, Spy Kids, Sin City, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For), based on the Manga comic series. Basically in the 2563, the Earth has been left devastated following a catastrophic war known as ""The Fall"". Cyborg scientist Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) is scouting the junkyard metropolis of Iron City, when he discovers a disembodied female cyborg head with a fully functioning and intact human brain. Ido rebuilds the cyborg (Rosa Salazar), who wakes up with no memory of who she is or where she came from, he names her ""Alita"" after his deceased daughter. Whilst exploring the city, Alita befriends Hugo (Keean Johnson), who dreams of moving to the wealthy sky city of Zalem. Hugo introduces her to the competitive sport of Motorball, a battle royale race wherein cyborgs fight to the death. One night, Alita follows Ido, she discovers he is a Hunter-Warrior, and they encounter three cyborg assassins led by Grewishka (Jackie Earle Haley). When Ido is injured, Alita instinctively attacks the cyborgs, killing two of them and severely damaging Grewishka, who retreats underground. Despite Alita rediscovering her skill in the ancient martial art of ""Panzer Kunst"", Ido discourages her from becoming a Hunter-Warrior. The next day, Alita finds a Berserker body from an old downed ship outside the city, she brings it home, but Ido refuses to install her in the body, fearing the consequences of her heart's full compatibility with it. Alita is fed up with Ido and registers as a Hunter-Warrior, then she and Hugo enter the Kansas Bar to ask other Hunter-Warriors in helping her take down Grewishka, but Grewishka is not on the wanted list, they refuse. Suddenly, an upgraded Grewishka storms into the bar and challenges Alita to a rematch, revealing he has been sent by his boss, Nova (Edward Norton), to destroy her. Alita demonstrates great courage and combat skills, but her body is sliced up by Grewishka's bladed fingers, he is blinded and forced to retreat by Ido, Hugo, and another Hunter-Warrior. Ido transplants Alita in the Berserker body, which automatically interfaces with her system. Alita enters a Motorball tryout race as a means to send Hugo, who she has fallen in love with, to Zalem. Ido discovers that all the other contestants in the game are Hunter-Warriors and wanted cyborgs hired by Vector (Mahershala Ali), an entrepreneur working under Nova, to kill her. He warns Alita as the race begins, she is able to destroy many of the contestants with her superior skills. Meanwhile, Hugo is hunted by and framed by cyborg bounty hunter Zapan (Ed Skrein) for murdering a cyborg, he calls Alita for help and she leaves the Motorball race to rescue him. Zapan arrives and reveals that Hugo has been attacking cyborgs and stealing their parts for Vector for use in his Motorball games. Zapan knows that Alita is in love with Hugo, he mortally wounds him and tells Alita that Hunter-Warrior law dictates that she must either kill Hugo or let Zapan finish him off. Hugo is saved by Ido's ex-wife Chiren (Jennifer Connelly), also a master cyborg engineer, with his head being attached to Alita's heart, while Zapan has part of his face sliced off. Ido transplants Hugo's head onto a cyborg body, Alita is told that Hugo was given false belief that his actions would eventually buy his way into Zalem, and Ido confirms that this lie was fabricated by Vector, and that citizens of Iron City cannot enter Zalem unless they become Motorball champion. Alita decides to confront Vector, who is being mind-controlled by Nova, a powerful Zalem scientist. Nova talks to Alita through Vector, reveals that and then orders Grewishka to kill her, they battle, and she finally kills him, then stabs Vector, telling Nova he made the mistake of underestimating her. Ido tells Alita that Hugo has run away, she finds him desperately attempting to climb a factory tube towards Zalem. Alita pleads with Hugo to return with her, but a massive spiked defence ring set off by Nova shreds Hugo's body and throws him into the air, Alita is unable to prevent Hugo from falling to his death, but he thanks her for changing him before letting go. Months later, Alita becomes a star athlete of the Motorball tournament, as the crowd cheers, she points her sword towards Zalem while Nova watches her from above. Also starring Eiza González as Nyssiana, Michelle Rodriguez as Gelda, Casper Van Dien as Amok, Jeff Fahey as McTeague, Lana Condor as Koyomi, Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as Tanji, Die Another Day's Rick Yune as Master Clive Lee and Derek Mears as Romo. Salazar looks like a figure from a Margaret Keane painting, because of her big eyes, but is good as the female cyborg who slowly becomes a tough fighter, Waltz is likeable as the scientist who helps her to develop, Connelly is alright, and Ali is reasonable as the villain. You cannot deny the spectacle and special effects are amazing, the dystopian world is impressive, and the main plot of the lead character trying to rediscover herself is fine, but it is too keen to get into the fast-paced sequences, with the Motorball sequences and a lot of robotic body dismemberment, it goes off-track often and gets confusing at times, it is almost more style over substance, an average futuristic science-fiction fantasy action. Okay!",Alita - Battle Angel
9,Tweekums,Thrilling sci-fi,9,9 January 2020,"This film is set in the year 2563, three hundred years after 'The Fall'. The action takes place in Iron City; a dystopian location in the shadow of the wealthy, floating city of Zalem. One day, while scouring the city dump for spare parts, Dr Dyson Ido discovers the remains of a female living cyborg. He then attaches her to the body he had made for his disabled daughter who was killed before she could use it. She awakens with no memories of who she is so he calls her Alita, after his late daughter. He then shows her the world; cautioning her about some of its dangers. She later befriends Hugo, who introduces her to the sport of motorball... a dangerous sport where cyborgs compete for the chance to be allowed to move to Zalem. She also discovers Dr Ido is a 'Hunter-Warrior', a bounty hunter, when he is cornered by a trio of killers she instinctively helps him; using martial arts skills that were believed lost... clearly Alita is somebody special. She soon becomes known to the city's shady authorities and they want her power source. She will have to fight to save herself, close she cares for and for the justice she believes in.The early parts of this film may seem a little slow but they serve to introduce the protagonists and the world they inhabit. Once the action begins it is exciting. Much of the fighting is between cyborgs but some of it still manages to be a little shocking given the films rating. There is a good sense of mystery about Alita's character and we gradually learn more about her throughout the film as she learns about herself. The cast does a solid job; Rosa Salazar in particular impresses in the role of Alita. The special effects are great; Alita may be CG but apart from her large eyes one might think she was real. Similarly most of the action looks real even in situations it obviously couldn't be. The only slight weakness was the sport of Motorball; the way it was presented, with commentary, reminded me of pod-racing from 'The Phantom Menace' crossed with 'Rollerball'... a minor quibble though. The ending is clearly designed to set things up for a sequel or sequels... I certainly hope we get more as I really enjoyed the story so far and was left wanting more. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the genre.",Alita - Battle Angel
10,paul_haakonsen,Fantastic movie...,8,30 June 2019,"Initially I had some aversion towards this project when I first came to learn about it. Now, I loved the animated Manga ""Battle Angel Alita"" when I was a teenager, so I was somewhat split on how to feel about a live action movie rendered upon that. And with it being a non-Japanese version just added to that doubt.But still, I decided to sit down and watch the 2019 ""Alita: Battle Angel"" movie from director Robert Rodriguez anyway.And luckily so, because this movie was phenomenal. Director Robert Rodriguez put all my doubt about the project to shame. And this movie was a thrill ride from beginning to end. Actually, ""Alita: Battle Angel"" can be summarized with just a single word: wow.The storyline told in this 2019 live action movie was quite good. It was compelling and interesting, and writers James Cameron and Laeta Kalogridis managed to create something that grips the audience right away and doesn't let you go before the movie ends.The characters in the movie were quite nice, nicely detailed in personalities and equally nicely brought to life on the screen by a cast of wonderfully talented actors and actresses. Rosa Salazar, playing Alita, was spot on. She really carried the character so well and also carried the movie phenomenally. And with the help of the likes of Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly and Mahershala Ali you are in for a grand movie. It was cool, but not surprising to see him in a Robert Rodriguez production, to see Jeff Fahey in the movie and his character was really cool. Just a shame he didn't have more on-screen time.Initially, I had a little aversion to the way Alita looked. But it quickly grows on you and becomes a nice character trait to her.Now, the CGI used in ""Alita: Battle Angel"" was nothing short of amazing. And it had to be spectacular for an ambitious movie such as this. Glad to see that the CGI team really came through here and made the movie so impressive and realistic to look at.I was genuinely entertained from start to end by what director Robert Rodriguez presented in the 2019 movie ""Alita: Battle Angel"". And I can warmly recommend that you take the time to sit down and watch it.",Alita - Battle Angel
11,BandSAboutMovies,Who is this for?,6,24 February 2020,"When I saw the first trailer for this movie, I thought, ""No one but me is going to go see this movie."" But you know, it's the most successful movie Robert Rodriguez ever released. And I guess it was a success - the film grossed $85.7 million domestically and $319.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $404.9 million.That's good, right?Well, to break even against marketing costs, the movie had to make around $500 million, so it either lost $53 million or barely broke even. Dude, I'm sweating making my minimum payments on my credit cards and these dudes are farting around with figures where $53 million - the amount of money that Mario Bava could have made Danger: Diabolik thirteen times.PS: I had to do the math for what that movie cost in Italian lira versus U.S. dollars, then do the inflation calculation from 1968 to today. I laugh, because I once said that I would never use math.So yeah - how did a movie based on Japanese manga artist Yukito Kishiro's 1990s series Gunnm and the 1993 original video animation adaptation Battle Angel ever make it to U.S. screens?Guillermo del Toro told James Cameron about it - way back before Avatar. The film sat for years before Cameron asked Robert Rodriguez to condense and combine his 186-page screenplay as well as 600 pages of notes into a shooting script. That work led to Rodriguez getting the directing job and hey - we have a movie.2563 and we're already three hundred years after the Great War nearly killed everyone on Earth. That's when cyborg scientist and part-time bounty hunter Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) finds a disembodied female cyborg in the scrapyard of Iron City. He names her Alita after his dead daughter and saves her human brain.Alita is in love with the city and meets all manner of people, from Ido's ex-wife Dr. Chiren (Jennifer Connelly) and a kid named Hugo who introduces her to the sport of this new world, Motorball.However, Hugo has a big secret: he really works for Vector (Mahershala Ali, who was astounding in the third season of True Detective), the man who runs Iron City and Motorball.Alita also learns her father figure's secret - he's a bounty hunter - and when she trails him one night, she saves him from a gang of cyborg killers. One of them, Grewishka (Jackie Earle Haley), hounds our heroine for the rest of the movie. Alita dreams of bigger things and her past life where she was a Berserker, one of the soldiers of the enemy United Republics of Mars.You know, maybe reading the manga would have made this all much easier.Alita goes off and registers herself as a Hunter-Warrior, but is unable to rally any of the other hunters to help her stop Grewishka, who is working for Nova (Ed Norton). Alita's body is nearly destroyed by the killing machine before Ido, Hogo and dogmaster McTeague (Jeff Fahey!) save her.Now in a new Berserker body, Alita soon takes over the Motorball league, but loses the love of her life due to the machinations of Nova and his soldiers. The film ends with Alita as a Motorball star, promising that she will someday get her revenge.You know all that money I mentioned at the top? It didn't really matter in the long run. That's because this ended up being the last Fox movie ever made, as Disney purchased the studio, moving us closer to the corporate-controlled world that this movie portrays.I enjoyed this, but I have no idea how anyone else would react to a movie based on a manga from the 90's made for a worldwide audience. It's one of those movies where it cost so much that there's no way that anyone would see any money from it. But man, it looks really cool, right?",Alita - Battle Angel
12,zardoz-13,An Above-Average Anime Epic,8,6 March 2019,"""Sin City"" director Robert Rodriguez's manga-inspired, post-apocalyptic, science fiction, cyberpunk, origin epic ""Alita: Battle Angel"" is a spectacular, but predictable fantasy extravaganza set in the dystopian future of the 26th century. The action unfolds in the year 2563, after an Armageddon referred to as ""The Fall,"" otherwise known as ""The Great War,"" has devastated Earth. The eponymous heroine is a formidable cyborg warrioress, abandoned to rust on a scrap heap, who fears nobody and nothing. Miraculously, Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz of ""Inglourious Basterds""), a bespectacled cyberphysician, rescues her remains, and then revives this 300-year old combatant. Like Rodriguez's previous, mature-themed, actioneers ""El Mariachi"" (1992), ""Desperado"" (1995), ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (1996), ""The Faculty"" (1998), ""Once Upon A Time in Mexico"" (2003), ""Planet Terror"" (2007), ""Machete"" (2010), ""Machete Kills"" (2013), and ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" (2014), ""Alita: Battle Angel"" qualifies as a triumph of style over substance. Each of these B-movies is the equivalent of cinematic junk food. Fast-paced, outlandish, but diverting nonsense, these nine guilty pleasures are ideal if you find yourself plagued by insomnia. Rarely does Rodriquez fail to deliver. The combat scenes in ""Alita"" rival those in the Keanu Reeves' classic ""The Matrix."" James Cameron, who has helmed masterpieces, such as ""The Terminator,"" ""Aliens,"" ""The Abyss,"" ""Titanic,"" and ""Avatar,"" co-scripted the screenplay with ""Terminator Genisys"" scribe Laeta Kalogridis. Reportedly, Cameron bought the rights to manga writer Yukito Kishiro's ""Battle Angel Alita"" (1990) and then sought to direct it himself. The success of ""Avatar"" and the pressure of directing four ""Avatar"" sequels forced Cameron to shelve Kishiro's manga heroine. Happily, Rodriquez stepped in and took the helm, with Cameron doing double-duty as writer & producer. Manga fans will be pleased to learn ""Alita"" preserves a substantial part of Kishiro's characters and conflict. Of course, Rodriquez has toned down the horrific gore from the source material to avoid an R-rating. You won't see Grewishka sucking the brains out of his enemies as he did in the manga.
After he resurrects Alita, Ido equips her with a cyborg body which he had designed initially for his crippled but now departed daughter. Alita awakens the next day and admires the lovely designs that adorn her new body. Ido tells her she is 300-years old, and he explains she was a battle warrior like none other in the universe. As in the Jason Bourne thrillers, Alita remembers nothing from her past, until she engages in combat. Nevertheless, our heroine doesn't know what to make of these fleeting memories, especially when she performs the ancient, martial arts, fighting technique ""Panzer Kunst."" Once she shifts into full-combat mode, Alita is not to be toyed with, despite her petite stature. In some respects, Alita's repeated clashes with an obnoxious, overbearing, part-human/part-cyborg colossus, Grewishka (Jackie Earl Haley of ""Watchmen""), imitate the Biblical story of David & Goliath. Alita never backs down from any fight. Later, when she is reduced to little more than a head and torso with one arm, she refuses to capitulate to Grewishka. By far, Alita ranks as the most pugnacious female warrior cyborg you'll ever see in any movie. She can make fools of her opponents, such is her acrobatic skills and timing. At one point, Grewishka acquires a weapon which transforms each finger of his mechanical right hand into flying chains with grappling hooks that can be deployed at supersonic speed against an unsuspecting opponent. Indeed, Grewishka is one of Alita's chief adversaries.
After Alita acquires her new set of limbs and legs, she learns more about Iron City, Zalem, and Motorball. A war has decimated Earth, and only one gigantic, airborne, saucer-shaped city out of ten has survived, and it is called Zalem. The Earth itself resembles a sprawling wasteland, and Zalem has built a factory and farms on the land beneath it to supply and nourish its hopelessly affluent citizens. The multi-lingual metropolis of Iron City lies beneath the shadow of Zalem, and the refugees of this holocaust have gathered from all parts of the Earth to settle beneath it to provide for the floating city. Gigantic tubes that anchor the flying city to the terrain are designed to transport cargo to Zalem. Literally, Zalem constitutes a heaven on Earth. Naturally, everybody dreams of ascending to Zalem, but immigration is strictly forbidden. Zalem has combat measures to repel any attempts to breach it. In this respect, ""Alita: Battle Angel"" resembles the Matt Damon & Jodie Foster sci-fi saga ""Elysium"" (2013) where disenfranchised minorities struggled to enter the city orbiting Planet Earth to take advantage of its life-saving medical treatments.
Not only does ""Alita"" allude to ""Elysium,"" but it also features a sport reminiscent of ""Rollerball"" (1975) starring James Caan as well as the 2002 remake with Chris Klein. In both versions of ""Rollerball,"" everything revolved around a futuristic sport called Rollerball, a souped-up version of roller derby, with life and death outcomes which mimicked the mass hysteria that galvanized ancient Roman audiences during their bloodthirsty gladiatorial tournaments. Supposedly, only the greatest player in the murderous sport of Motorball has a chance to ascend to Zalem. The harrowing Motorball scenes are among some of the most exhilarating, with a wide variety of cyborgs careening around recklessly as if they were competing in a demolition derby. These cyborgs resemble refugees from a ""Transformers"" escapade. Not only does Alita tangle with the minions of a tyrant, Vector (Mahershala Ali of ""Green Book""), who supervises Motorball betting, but also with an omniscient overlord, Nova (Edward Norton), who manipulates Vector from Zalem.
Altogether, watching the above-average ""Alita: Battle Angel"" is a lot of fun. When Rodriquez isn't dazzling us with the staggering, CGI-laden, gymnastic battles, he trots out an impressive cast, including Jennifer Connelly, Ed Skrein, Rick Yune, Jeff Fahey, and Jai Courtney, with Michelle Rodriguez performing a voice-over in Alita's memories. Produced for a mind-blowing $170 million, ""Alita: Battle Angel"" concludes on a promising cliffhanger. Whether or not a sequel ensues will depend entirely on its box office statistics.",Alita - Battle Angel

""This film is based upon 660 years of science fiction flicks you've already seen--only the names have been changed, since ""Steamboat Willie's"" creators are STILL bribing the U.S. Congress to keep extending American copyrights back from 2563 to 1925.""

14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Mostly great,8,18 February 2019,"Alita(Salazar, handling every single of the countless facets of the role perfectly) is found and repaired by Dr. Ido(Waltz, a father figure with a secret), making her one of the dozens, perhaps hundreds, of cyborgs that he fixes. She has no memory of her past. However, when she gets into violent confrontations, she gets flashbacks that help her figure it out. Almost immediately(to the point where it's silly), she falls in love with Hugo(Johnson, charming yet covering up something), and he with her, as the two yearn for something better than the paltry existence in the harsh environment of Iron City. Their romance is a major element in this. And like with most of those, while I thought it worked well, clearly many do not agree. And I do understand why. Ultimately, your mileage may vary.Let's tackle the big one: is the titular character an example of the uncanny valley? It was a gamble to make her resemble the manga version so closely, most of the excellent redesigns going at least a little further. I would argue that it works. It's not as though her face is the one thing that reveals we're not looking at a human actor: almost no part of her entire body is flesh and blood. Do note that a number of other characters in this have proportions that are much further from humanoid. I suppose that's the point others are making - she does look a lot like, but not quite exactly like, a human. It will work for some, and not for others. The CGI is photo-realistic, and the world building is incredible. You completely believe that this is a place that people live and work; not a series of sets. That it's massively populated; we're not just seeing a lot of extras. The 3D, too, is an upgrade from Avatar, adding depth and atmosphere, rather than being cheesy and calling attention to itself. The action starts out very good and gets better with each scene. This has uneven pacing, and suffers from trying to fit in every single thing from the first two volumes of the original work. Reading them I didn't get the sense that Yukito Kishiro intended for them to be translated directly into a massive Hollywood blockbuster. While they're compelling, they don't fit that format too well. The ending reveals that without at least one sequel we simply will not get a conclusion to the story this sets up. I think this would have fared better if it had gone with some of the later books, such as the ""tuned agent"" storyline, which, I would say, lends itself better to this sort of thing, and could have closure.There is a moderate amount of strong, bloody, brutal violence in this(since they're part robot, it gets away with it with a PG-13), albeit it does do away with the most horrifying material(which would have landed this an NC-17, easily) from the graphic novels. I recommend this to any fan of speculative science fiction. 8/10",Alita - Battle Angel
15,view_and_review,Next Level CGI,7,15 February 2019,"Right away the most eye-popping thing about this movie is the CGI. This was some next level graphics. The CGI for Alita (meaning the girl not the movie) was astounding. We're not talking about a few-seconds clip or even one scene, we're talking about her being the feature piece in just about every scene.Going beyond the graphics (because it's easy to be distracted by them), the movie was decent. I'm not familiar with the manga Alita and whereas this movie made me a bit more familiar there were still lingering questions. Also, at times, the script was elementary. That may have been by design because you got the sense that Alita was like a child emotionally and developmentally so some of her statements and actions were supposed to be juvenile. It made her character more puritan and of course more vulnerable.Alita can shape into a nice franchise but it will definitely rest upon the awe factor of the graphics.",Alita - Battle Angel
16,morrison-dylan-fan,"""Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby,Just call me angel of the morning, (angel.)""",7,4 December 2020,"Despite having heard about the art form for years,I've never read a Manga. Being aware of the title since reading about adaptation plans in UK film magazine Empire during the early 2000's,I last month picked up the first excellent volume of Yukito Kishiro's epic as my Manga intro. Having been intrigued by the trailers, I got set after reading the Manga to catch a glimpse of Alita.View on the film:Taking a similar path to the one he took for Sin City (2005) in paying respect to the original roots, director Robert Rodriguez & The Matrix (1999) cinematographer Bill Pope spectacularly frame the thrilling action sequences directly from the pages of Yukito Kishiro's drawings, soaring in ultra-stylised arc shots spinning on each of Alita's take downs.Bringing light into Alita's Manga eyes from the scrapheap her head is pulled from in the last major Fox release before it was sold to Disney,Rodriguez streams a crunchy Cyberpunk atmosphere, which welds the smooth CGI that eyes Alita between live action and Anime, with gliding whip-pans over the decayed post-apocalyptic landscape where Alita lays waste to the cyborg gladiators.A project he has been wanting to make since 1995, the screenplay by co-writers James Cameron & Laeta Kalogridis powers up when using Yukito Kishiro's Manga as the spine,thanks to it allowing space for Alita to grow from the hard-knocked scrapheap, into a tough as nails battle warrior, (a major recurring theme in Cameron's works) whilst also charging wonderfully strange Cyberpunk sparks (such as serial killer robots and a head transplant.)While a part of the original Manga, Cameron's move to expand Alita's romance with Hugo to be more in tune with his star-crossed lovers on the Titanic (1997) sinks from making the emotional punch it attempts to, partly from the disengaged turn by Keean Johnson as Hugo,and also due to it eating up time which could be used to explore the more quirky Cyberpunk elements in Alita's battles.Holding her mechanical heart out to Hugo, Rosa Salazar gives a fantastic performance as Alita, bringing a doe-eyed warmth to Alita's captivating Manga eyes breaking away from her machine origins with emotive self-discovery, which Salazar balances with growing brutal skills to take down all the baddies in the city,as the battle angel rises.",Alita - Battle Angel
17,FlashCallahan,That.....looks........fatal.....,4,15 February 2019,"Abandoned Alita is found in the scrapyard of Iron City by Ido, a cyber-doctor who takes the unconscious cyborg to his clinic.When Alita awakens, she has no memory of who she is, nor does she have any recognition of the world shes in.As Alita learns to navigate her new life and the treacherous streets of Iron City, Ido tries to shield her from her mysterious past.Much like Ghost In The Shell, Alita suffers from all style over substance. Yes, the film is amazing to look at, and there are some truly awe-inspiring set pieces in the film, but much like the desolate place Ido finds the titular character, the rest of the film is hollow and devoid of any soul.Why Rodriguez directed this is baffling. There is none of the directors style to this film, it's just an empty vessel that feel like it has been shredded within an inch of its artificial life to make the running time slimmer.Waltz is wonderful as usual, but his character seems to empathetic to be a hunter at night, and more interesting characters like Skrien or even Fahey, are pushed to set piece heaven and given very little to do.If you have to see this, find the biggest screen, in 3D and lower your expectations, because this is nothing more than a charmless set up for a franchise that will never happen.I'm pretty sure that this will be one of the biggest disasters of the year, but it won't affect the director or Cameron, because it's just too dull and boring for anyone to care about it's existence.A shame, as it had so much potential to be a beautiful world builder.And then Ed Norton turns up as a glam rocker come the end.I only hope this doesn't Norbit Ali's Best Supporting actor nomination",Alita - Battle Angel

It's an entertaining movie, mostly because of the visuals, but story wise it's a bit weak. The CGI's are well done, the action scenes are better than expected, the characters could have been better. I guess there will be more movies about Alita and I will probably watch them all, but would I watch this one again? Probably not, a one time view is enough.",Alita - Battle Angel
21,siderite,"Nice movie, nothing great",8,29 June 2019,"I believe people who will watch this movie will be either those wanting a quick CGI and action filled movie and/or those who read the manga. Both would be partially satisfied. The action sequences are spectacular, but not really good in terms of actual action. The CGI works, but doesn't bring much to the story. The actors do their job well, but in a plot that doesn't really value them. I think the hardest and most visible role was Jackie Earle Haley's Grewishka, who is at most a secondary character. Vector was diminished to the role of the basic cardboard villain, for example. All of Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali and even Jeff Fahey were completely wasted on their roles. Now, for the manga, it was clearly deeper, having more space, but it wasn't really a very complex manga to begin with. The movie, I feel, remained faithful to the story there.The biggest hope and disappointment both was the ending. The last scenes didn't make a lot of sense and the end was left open, with Alita vowing to get to Zalem to finish her job and defeat her nemesis. I hope the sequel, if any, will be better, but how often was that hope in vain with Hollywood movies. Anyway, Cameron now is focused on Avatar and the box office for the Disney/Fox leviathan was less than enticing. Here's to hope!",Alita - Battle Angel
22,cherold,Wonderful overall even though the story falls apart in the end,8,13 July 2019,"This marvelous movie about a sophisticated, charming robot girl living in a dystopian future has exciting action sequences, humor and pathos, solid special effects, and most notably the wonderfully charming character of Alita.It's a little hard to apportion credit for Alita, who has been animated from a motion-captured performance by Rosa Salazar, but I absolutely love this anime character come to life.The story is compelling, as amnesiac Alita tries to piece together her past while getting to know her present. There is mystery and excitement and intriguing flashbacks.And then, three quarters of the way through, the story collapses into a big, chaotic mess full of poorly attached threads leading to an unsatisfying, anti-climactic non-ending that betrays most of what lead up to it.Robert Rodriquez is a real hit-or-miss director, and while overall Alita is one of his strongest films it also puts his many flaws on display. The result is well worth seeing, and I'm eager to check out any sequels coming down the pike (although Rodriquez history with sequels is not a promising one), but this is not quite the movie it should have been.",Alita - Battle Angel

24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Visually stunning but messy, bloated and, often, clumsy.",5,10 February 2019,"'Alita: Battle Angel (2019)' is just so poorly, and strangely, structured. That's its main problem, really. It's messy, bloated and, often, clumsy. As a result, it feels far longer than it actually is. It awkwardly races past what feels like its natural end point just to reach an arguably even more awkward 'sequel-bait' finish, simply so that it can tie off a few loose ends and, strangely, introduce and then finish off a (more or less) completely new plot-point - one that goes back on something we've seen just moments prior. This overstuffed finale is incredibly unsatisfying, especially since most of the issues that led to its inclusion are ones that could have been easily fixed. It's one of those cases where the film, and several of its individual scenes, feel both too long and too short all at the same time. Another issue with the adaptation is the fact that it doesn't feel as though it's saying anything. I don't mean in terms of overarching messages, although they're missing and would've been appreciated, but I do mean in terms of character. There are arcs but they're basic and don't seem to flow all that well. Plus, peripheral characters are often given much more to do than main ones and the plot seems to pop them in at random points. None of the picture's events really connect with each other all that well and the set-ups rarely match the pay-offs. Still, pretty much all of them are acted well enough and are visually interesting. This leads me to perhaps the piece's biggest positive. It looks great. It's as simple as that. Though our entirely CG central character could've easily resided in the recesses of the uncanny valley, she ends up as a believable, life-like and likeable protagonist whose digital nature never takes away from our engagement with her. Perhaps the eyes are a bit strange and unnecessary (as is the fact that she's entirely CGI, to be honest), but it works within the established world and isn't as distracting as I'd feared - in fact, it's barely noticeable after a couple of scenes. Sometimes, the characters who have a real-life rotoscoped face look a little dodgy, but the rest are absolutely fine if you get on board with the flick. Because of this, the action sequences work rather well and are actually the most entertaining thing about the affair, for better or worse. Most of the movie is entirely computer animated anyway, so these 'over-the-top' and more obviously digital set-pieces still seem relatively grounded and don't take away from your investment. It does feel like the filmmakers were lost in the visuals, though. The end result is intermittently enjoyable and never especially dull - even if it does get tiring towards its, frankly, terribly paced final third. It's very, very messy, however, and doesn't really seem to have anything to say, even within its own world. Apparently, this is supposed to be part one of three. To be fair, I'd be more than willing to see where the story goes. I'm not pining for a sequel straight-away, though. 5/10",Alita - Battle Angel
25,bowmanblue,Please let the franchise continue,9,4 March 2019,"Yes, every film these days isn't just a film. It's the beginning of a larger body of work, a shared universe, or trying to set up an ongoing franchise. And, besides the Marvel Shared Universe and a few pre-existing properties like 'Star Wars,' most fledgling film franchises struggles beyond the first offering. That's simply because they make setting up a wider universe more of a priority than actually simply telling a good story (that 'Dark Universe' saga that tried to get off the ground with Tom Cruise at the helm, anyone?).Now, I'm not going to say that the producers of 'Alita: Battle Angel' wouldn't love the franchise to still be going in ten years time (complete with all sorts of spin-off tales of secondary characters and probably a TV series to boot), but at least it stands on its own as a great story and - if it doesn't get a sequel - can be looked at as a whole, rather than something that started and was never concluded.It's set well into the future where the world has been ravaged by one giant war (aka 'The Fall') and half the (unlucky) population live in a junkyard of a city on Earth, while those better off live in a floating city above it, known as 'Zolum.' The status quo remains until a Dr Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) who specialises in creating cyborgs out of spare parts finds the remains of a young cyborg girl ('Alita,' in case you haven't guessed!) on the scrap heap and takes it upon himself to rebuild her. Of course the plot needs her to have forgotten who true identity and - naturally - this all links in with what will become her destiny to bring a little more equality between the two last cities on Earth and the mysterious ruler who 'watches all.'So, it's kind of one of those 'prophecy/saviour' type films which certainly aren't that original, but, if done right, are very entertaining - and Alita is very entertaining. First of all Rosa Salazar is a very likable lead and, despite not having too many major roles to her credit, does brilliantly at holding the weight of the story on her shoulders. She's also got on hand Christoph Waltz, who always turns in a great performance in whatever he's in. This is no different and their relationship is the character-highpoint of the film.Alita's love interest is 'Hugo' (Keean Johnson) and, although I couldn't really find fault with anything about his performance, I got the impression that his part could have been played by anyone. Jennifer Connelly is on the cast-list, but I felt she was a little underused and could have been in it a lot more. And, despite being a big fan, I only found out that Jackie Earle Haley was in the film after seeing his name on the credits and having to look up who he played online afterwardsIt's all stylishly directed by Robert Rodriguez, despite having James Cameron as co-producer and writer, the directoral honours seemed to have gone to Rodriguez. His natural style of fast-paced shots work better for the action and amount of CGI used. I know Cameron did - practically - an entire film ('Avatar') in CGI, but in Alita (and this could just be because a more modern film can blend live action and computer effects together) better, the effects look for more polished and real when compared to 'Avatar.' The soundtrack is also pretty generic and you certainly won't be humming the theme tune for months to come after leaving the cinema.But, that's just a minor gripe. Basically, if you're in the mood for some great action and don't mind the lengthy two-hour run-time, you should definitely check this one out. After only a couple of scenes you'll stop wondering why Alita's eyes are so (CGI) big and concentrate on her growth as a character (and, is it just me, or is she using 'Sting' i.e. the sword from 'Lord of the Rings' to save the world?).I see that it's only got a big of a lukewarm reception from some critics, but, if you see what the fans are saying about it, I think you'll know who to believe.

26,ThomasDrufke,Incredible Visuals Bogged Down By a Bad Script,7,25 February 2019,"Coming from the producing mind of James Cameron, Alita: Battle Angel is one of the most visually impressive films of recent memory, though it doesn't necessarily have the script to go along with those dazzling visuals. Rosa Salazar is fantastic as the titular Alita, and once again proves that she deserves more starring roles in Hollywood. The problem lies with the screenplay, a cringe worthy romance, and underdeveloped characters.

27,Cineanalyst,Childish Banality,4,11 October 2019,"I'm not directly familiar with manga, comics, or young adult fiction, but there's obviously a trend from these pulpy sources for teenage sci-fi dystopian franchises that has made its way into movies over the past several years now. There's the four ""Hunger Games"" movies (2012-2015), ""Ender's Game"" (2013) and its rumored sequel, the ""Divergent"" series (2014-2016), ""The Maze Runner"" trilogy (2014-2018) and, now, this, ""Alita: Battle Angel,"" among others, I'm sure. Despite featuring stars in supporting, if not leading, roles (this one wastes the talents of Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Michelle Rodriguez and Edward Norton), loads of CGI action, sci-fi and apparent political and religious commentary, it's depressing how alike these pictures are in their blandness.I understand that children tend to lack for life experiences, and I'm taken aback by how much full-grown adults read this fluff, but still, is there nothing more than puppy love, sports and exams? Essentially, all of these movies are school nightmares. The dystopia part seems to merely represent the childish confusion with the adult world, for which all that training in games and tests are supposed to prepare them. The sci-fi, wars and class conflict of these worlds tends to be too simplistic to be of much interest, as they're generally reduced to the saccharine teen romance anyways. I mean, c'mon, the upper class literally living in a city above that of the lower class. The religious symmetry is the same, too, and as blatant. There's even cyborgs, or robots, or AI, here, but regardless of her 300-years-old-heart, presumable inability to procreate and indicernible sex organs, she nevertheless has the hots for a meatbag who rides a futuristic motorcycle--and vise versa. Meanwhile, we spectators are supposed to be awed by the picture's spectacle, while, as in ""The Hunger Games"" series as well, the televised spectacle within the narrative is employed by the oppressive regime to mollify the poors. Is that supposed to be ironic or just insulting?I probably watched this at the wrong time. I recently read Lewis Carroll's Alice books, which may well surpass all children's literature. Carroll didn't pander to the familiar, the banal, of childish lives as do these school nightmares, even though his books, too, can be read as a child's nightmare encounter with the adult world. And the books remain clever and complicated enough to also satisfy mature minds. ""Alita"" does do one curious thing, though--curiouser certainly than its excessive CGI and motion-capture obsession, twirling fight moves and absurd hero poses. In one scene, the titular Alita enters a bar named ""Kansas,"" where she's followed by a little dog and, eventually, three men who aid her. Clearly, the reference here is to ""The Wizard of Oz."" Interestingly, L. Frank Baum's book was something of an Americanized (and dumbed-down) imitation or variation on the Alice books. In the franchise age of movies, there seems to be no end to such inanity of repetitious imitation. More variation would be appreciated, though. I hope the Wizard of Oz, James Cameron's other upcoming franchise additions, for ""Avatar"" and ""The Terminator,"" turn out better, but I have doubts.",Alita - Battle Angel

32,tabuno,A Decent if not Original Sci Fi Fusion Movie,8,20 February 2019,"This digitally enhanced human actress sci fi action movie makes its mark as coming closer and closer to breaking the artificial animated characters barrier (as with Avatar, 2009) threatening to take the place of live actors in the near future of movie making in the years to come. This rather sophisticated movie full of derivative elements from a number of classic sci fi movies brings to the big screen a rather good emotional and cerebral manipulation of compelling human sensitivities. This movie resembles a composite of movies including: Robocop (1987) and mechanical war machines; Soldier (1998) and a garbage planet; Serenity (2005) or Hannah (2011), and Ghost in the Shell (2017) and enhanced assassins; Star Trek: First Contact (1996) and the Borg Queen; Ready One Player (2018) and futurist cities and; Elysium (2013) or Insurgent (2015) and bifurcated worlds. In many ways this populist movie caters to the appealing but stereotypical black and white emotional triggers inherent in the movie going audience. One example is the over-emphasis of mechanical replacement limbs that seem to be everywhere in the movie. Nevertheless, this movie is a contradiction in that even though really unoriginal and oozing with drama appeal to the masses over a more award-winning authenticity, the script retains credible pacing, audience interest as its supposed to, and incorporates a nicely accomplished fusion of elements from other movies.",Alita - Battle Angel
33,The-Sarkologist,Rather Entertaining Sci-Fi,7,22 February 2019,"I wasn't really sure with regards to this film especially with the way the previous live action Manga had turned out. Okay, it was written and produced by James Cameron, and directed by Robert Rodrigeuz so that has something going for it, expect for the fact that Cameron's latest offerings have been somewhat sub-par - a far cry from the great action movies he made back in the 80s. Still, it is science fiction so I guess I was always going to give it a shot.The first thing I should point out is the incredibly heavy use of CGI. In fact it is so heavy a part of me literally felt that I was simply watching a high quality manga film as opposed to an actual live action movie. I guess that is what CGI can actually do these days, but it was so obvious and noticeable that I felt that either they were aiming for that look, or were just over using it to the point that it started to look a little tacky.It has been quite a while since I saw the original manga, though as it turns out the original was not only based on a series of earlier manga books, but apparently the original director was only making it as a side project. However, as I was watching it I did get some flash backs from the original and a bit of further research does suggest that it was reasonably faithful, except for the fact that they were Anglicising many of the characters, particularly Dr Ido.The story is about how Dr Ido is scouring the scrap heap for parts when he discovers the remains of a human who still happens to be alive. So he takes her home and gives her a new body (though I should point out that a majority of the characters are actually cyborgs). The city that the film is set it is known as Scrap Iron City and sits below another floating city which dumps all of its scraps down below. Ido is a cybertechnologist meaning that he specialises in building and fixing up cybernetic parts.Most of the film is about how Alita tries to discover her past, namely because she can't remember a thing. It soon turns out that she happens to have once been a soldier, and a pretty advanced one at that. This of course raises the interests of a number of rather nefarious people, though of course there is another character that is higher up the food chain. That actually made me wonder how long this film was going to be, especially since Cameron is well known for making some particularly long films.That is where it was a little disappointing because it felt as if the film came to a sudden end with a lot of unanswered questions. Then again, the film is based on the first two books in the series, which is what the original film was based on as well. The original film wasn't completed though, however there are hints that maybe, just maybe, a sequal or two will eventually be produced. Mind you, I'm not entirely sure how the next film will proceed because it felt as if there was, maybe, only another half-an-hour of story left when the film came to an end, but then again, I haven't read the books so I'm not all that familiar with the story as is.",Alita - Battle Angel

Just tell a good story.'Alita: Battle Angel' isn't a bad story, but its not really all that great a story either. In fact, by the end of the film I had far more questions than answers. Why? Where? How? Is that even possibl? Etc, etc. I became increasingly bored as the film progressed. What started out as a relatively unique premise became formulaic. And for the hundredth sci-fi movie there was the battle to the death in a futuristic sporting event cliche. Yawn, how many times have we seen this before?? So American, no offense...With so much CGI it felt like I was watching someone playing a video game. Off course, the CGI intensified as the film progressed until nothing was realistic anymore. Oh boy, and off course there's the cliched ""love story"" as well. Teenagers 'falling in love' without even knowing one another. That's called LUST, Hollywood, not love!! You simply don't understand the meaning of love! There was absolutely no chemistry between Alita and Hugo. Why would a human fall in love with an android anyway? That's just bizarre!Ah, and there's the Blade look-alike character, Vector, who also tries to act like him. (I actually still don't fully understand this character. So, he becomes someone else and then his eyes turn blue????). Critics praised Rosa Salazar's acting as Alita. I guess she was good, since it was a very demanding role, but so much of it just didn't feel real because of all the CGI, and I didn't entirely believe her character. Christoph Waltz is a fantastic actor, but even here his character is so incoherent that I didn't buy his character either. The same goes for Chiren (Jennifer Connelly).Everyone's always talking about going to Zalem and how badly they want to go there - and Alita is from there - blah-blah-blah-blah, but we never get to see Zalem, so what's the point? We never even get a glimpse of what Zalem is all about. It's just talk, talk, talk and more talk about Zalem.And they always do that same old darn superhero pose. Ugh, so over it! Yawn. Oh, and I see the ending leaves the door wide open for a sequel. Think we can see more of Zalem if there's to be one? And what the point of the bloody place is?Ok, credit where credit is due. The visuals were really good. Not the overblown CGI-heavy scenes, but the android designs and how realistic they looked.Would I watch it again? Nope!",Alita - Battle Angel

40,cruise01,Alita is visually exciting with impressive action.,10,16 February 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel (5 out of 5 stars).Alita: Battle Angel is a visually impressive masterpiece of a cyberpunk action film. Probably one of the better anime manga series adapted onto the big screen. James Cameron who has written the script with Laeta Kaogridis and been attached for the project for more than a decade. Director Robert Rodriguez did a great job bringing it onto the screen. The story is epic, the action sequences are stylized and exciting, the visual effects are impressive, and the cast is great with their characters.The plot is good. It may be at times overwhelming with a lot going on and side plot or two into the mix. It takes place in a future around 2500 after a catastrophic war left the planet devastated. While there is a floating city were the rich lives and a city on the ground known as Iron City. A cyborg is tossed into the scrapyard from the floating city known as Zalem. Dr. Ido (Christoph Waltz) finds a cyborg that he saves and brings her back known as Alita (Rosa Salazar). Alita self discovers herself that she has more potential than what she can be. Her past during the war to becoming a hunter warrior which is a bounty hunter. Which brings the attention in Zalem from Vector (Mahershala Ali). Who wants to stop her by sending every cyborg after her.Alita meets and falls for Hugo (Keean Johnson) who teaches her about a gladiator battle royale game called Motorball (almost seems similar to Rollerball movie). Which is an impressive and breath taking action sequence when Alita is free for all battling against every cyborg in the game. The action sequences are exciting. Alita fight scenes with the cyborgs may look like a video game cut scene. Which is a stylish fight scene.The visual effects are also good as well. It may be a little cheesy with the cgi on Alita (which has a motion capture by Rosa Salazar). The futuristic setting looks grim with the city on the ground looking more like a wasteland with a lot of people with robotic limbs. And bounty hunters looking more robotic than human. And big robot machines (looks like it came from a Robocop movie). The motorball arena and game alone is intense and breathtaking. Definitely, one of the exciting action packed climax ever.Rosa Salazar was great in delivering Alita. Christoph Waltz was good as Dr. Ido. Jennifer Connelly and Mahershala Ali were great as Chiren and Vector. Ed Skrein was good as the bounty hunter cyborg. Keean Johnson also delivered as Alita's love interest.Overall, Alita: Battle Royale is a great film. One of the best movies this year. It deserves to be seen on the big screen if you are into sci-fi futuristic action films. The story was great, the action is breath taking, visual effects are amazing, and definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat.",Alita - Battle Angel
41,eddie_baggins,The storytelling can't match the spectacle in this visual delight,6,15 February 2019,"A long-term passion project for producer James Cameron, who handed over directing reigns to Robert Rodriguez after deciding to make 100 Avatar films, Alita: Battle Angel is one of the years biggest blockbuster risks as the $200 million dollar production looks to bring Yukito Kishiro famous graphic novel and anime to life for audiences around the world.To say the risky production pulls off the difficult tasks completely would be wrong, as there's a lot within Battle Angel that could've done with some refinement and readjustment but as a popcorn shoveling big screen spectacle, this visually stunning ride is right up with the best of them.Set hundreds of years into the future, where humans and cyborgs have morphed into one, Battle Angel offers viewers a smorgasbord of visual delights as Cameron and Rodriguez's production team push modern technology to the limit as they bring Rosa Salazar's motion captured Alita to life and the hustling and bustling futuristic Iron City into existence.Alita the character is the films biggest triumph. A photo-realistic creation that's imbued with heart and soul by Salazar's energetic and creative performance, any concerns fans had about Alita being done well should be well and truly put to rest within the films opening segments and full credit must go to the filmmakers and crew behind her creation.Whenever Alita is front and centre to proceedings, the film feels like an adrenaline filled and heartfelt ride, but suffers in most departments around her.Never a strong suit for the director, Rodriguez struggles in telling the story and explaining the world that encompasses Alita and her journey. There's a lot of ground to cover for the film but in trying to do so supporting characters, dialogue and world building all suffer.From barely explained past occurrences (wars with Mars, floating cities) to cookie-cutter or threadbare supporting turns (was that Jai Courtney I just saw? Why is Edward Norton dressed up like a Crash Bandicoot villain?) and some extremely cringe worthy dialogue, Rodriguez's known flaws as a filmmaker do hold Battle Angel back from achieving something truly special, and you can't help but feel if Cameron did indeed take hold of the reigns of this project the heart and soul and storytelling know-how would've matched the visual joys that are had.One thing that not even the experience of Cameron could've saved however is a collection of irksome performances.Lead by the far to gracious screen-time of Keean Johnson as Alita's instant-boyfriend and scrap collector Hugo, Battle Angel gives some fairly so-so roles to performers who feel like they're not having the best of times. Christoph Waltz looks bored and stilted as Alita's new daddy Dr. Dyson Ido, Jennifer Connolly gets very little to do as Dyson's ex-wife Chiren, while poor old Marershala Ali and the usually awesome Jackie Earle Haley (hidden in a completely CGI'd role) don't have much luck as villains Vector and Gewwishka respectively.The other big issue that will hold Battle Angel back in a lot of people's books is in the fact despite its two hour plus run-time, you come away from the film feeling like its saved many of its huge spectacles or narrative pay-offs for its hopeful sequels, a shame as one feels like its unlikely Battle Angel will become the hit its filmmakers and studio expect, meaning we the audience have been in turn kept in the dark from the best this world and story has to offer, with the films ending a mostly buzz-free affair.Final Say -A visual and technical delight that should be enjoyed on the big screen, Alita: Battle Angel can't match its spectacle with storytelling and character building, a shame since Alita is a lovable protagonist and creation, in a world that seems ripe for cinematic exploration.3 hearts out of 5",Alita - Battle Angel
42,leonblackwood,"Brilliant animation, with a great storyline! 8/10",8,20 January 2020,"Review:
What a brilliant movie! The attention to detail is truly amazing, and the storyline was unique and interesting throughout. I honestly don't know how some of these movies are hitting the Billion dollar mark, but a movie like this, which knocks down all of the boundaries, doesn't even make half that amount. I know that the advertising campaign wasn't that great, and some of the Alita die-hard fans weren't that impressed, but I personally thought that it was a great movie. As I didn't know anything about the original Manga character, I was seeing this movie from a standalone point of view, and I was glued to the screen from the beginning to the end. You kind of forget that she is an animated character after a while because her facial expressions and movements are so real, against the real-life characters. I know that she was James Cameroon's baby, after buying the rights 15 years ago, so many people are saying that he would have done a better job, but we will never know, as his commitments to Avatar took over. Anyway, I can't wait for the sequel, if there is one, and I'm hoping that Alita comes face to face with the evil Nova, played by Edward Norton. The movie is set in the year 2563, 300 years after Earth is devastated by a catastrophic interplanetary war known as ""The Fall"" or ""The Great War"". Scientist Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) discovers a disembodied female cyborg with an alive and intact human brain while savaging for parts in the massive scrapyard of Iron City. Ido attaches a new cyborg body to the brain and names her ""Alita"" (Rosa Salazar) after his deceased daughter. Alita awakens with no memory of her past, and meets Dr. Chiren (Jennifer Connelly), Ido's estranged ex-wife, and befriends Hugo (Keean Johnson), who dreams of moving to the wealthy sky city of Zalem. Hugo introduces Alita to Motorball, a battle royale sport played by cyborg gladiators. Secretly, Hugo robs cyborgs of their parts for Vector (Mahershala Ali), owner of the Motorball tournament and the ruler of the Factory, Iron City's governing authority. One night, Alita follows Ido, and they are ambushed by a gang of cyborg serial killers led by Grewishka (Jackie Earle Haley). Ido is injured, and Alita instinctively fights using ""Punzer Kunst"", which is a lost combat art for machine bodies. She kills two of the cyborgs and damages Grewishka, who retreats underground. Ido reveals that he is a Hunter-Warrior, a type of bounty hunter hired by the Factory. Grewishka goes to Dr. Chiren for help, who is working for Vector. Despite Alita believing that fighting will help her rediscover her past, Ido discourages her from becoming a Hunter-Warrior. Alita finds a highly advanced cyborg body in a crashed spaceship outside the city. Recognising that the body belonged to a Berserker, Ido refuses to install Alita in it. Frustrated with Ido, Alita goes off and registers herself as a Hunter-Warrior. At the Kansas Bar, she and Hugo are unable to recruit other Hunter-Warriors to help take down Grewishka. Zapan (Ed Skrein), a cyborg Hunter-Warrior bully, provokes Alita and she severely beats him in a fight, triggering a chaotic bar brawl until Ido arrives to intervene. Suddenly an upgraded Grewishka appears and challenges Alita to a duel, revealing that he has been sent by Zalems technocrat overlord, Nova, to destroy her. Despite her combat skills, Alita's body is sliced up by Grewishka's chain-bladed fingers, but Ido, Hugo and Hunter-Warrior dogmaster McTeague (Jeff Fahey) arrive and force Grewishka to retreat. Ido apologises and transplants Alita into the Berserker body. Having fallen in love with Hugo, Alita enters a Motorball tryout race for the prize money to send Hugo to Zalem, where Vector has bought off the other players and attempts to have her killed. Meanwhile, Hugo's relationship with Alita leads him to decide to quit his criminal job. He confronts his partner Tanji, but Zapan appears, kills Tanji and frames Hugo for the murder of another cyborg. Hugo narrowly escapes and calls Alita for help. She abandons the race and finds him just as Zapan does, but Zapan mortally wounds Hugo. Dr. Chiren, having changed her mind about working for Vector, offers to help save Hugo by attaching his severed head to Alita's life support system. When Zapan sees through the trick and attempts to stop Alita, she seizes his prized Damascus blade and slices most of his face off. Ido transplants Hugo's head onto a cyborg body and tells Alita that Vector's offer to help Hugo reach Zalem was a lie. Ido is certain that citizens of Iron City cannot enter Zalem without becoming a Motorball champion. Alita storms the Factory and confronts Vector, who reveals that Chiren has been harvested for her organs for her betrayal. Vector summons Grewishka, but Alita's new nanotech body allows her to easily destroy him. She forces Nova to speak to her through Vector. When Nova threatens to harm her friends, Alita fatally stabs Vector. Ido tells Alita that Hugo has fled to climb a cargo tube towards Zalem. Alita catches up to him and pleads with him to return with her. He eventually agrees, but a serrated defence ring dropped by Nova shreds his body and throws him off the tube. Alita catches him but cannot pull him up, as his arm is breaking off. Hugo thanks Alita for saving him before falling to his death. Months later, Alita is the rising superstar of the Motorball tournament. Cheered on by the crowd, she pledges vengeance by pointing her plasma-charged sword toward Zalem, where Nova watches from above. Will Alita ever get her revenge? I honestly couldn't tell you because I haven't read the graphic novels, or heard about the plot for a sequel. It did end a bit abruptly, with a lot of unanswered questions, so I hope they release a sequel soon. I was extremely impressed with the action scenes, and Alita's superb skills, and I liked the chemistry between Alita and Ido. It's hard to find a fault with the film, which is why I was surprised that it didn't make more money at the box office. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch, especially if you have a cranked up system, and I can't wait for the sequel. Brilliant!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Robert Rodriguez, who also brought you El Mariachi in 1992, Desperado in 1995, Four Rooms, From Dusk Till Dawn, The Faculty, Spy Kids 1, 2 & 3, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Sin City, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, Grindhouse, Planet Terror, Shorts, Nespresso: The Piano, Machete, Spy Kids 4, Machete Kills, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For and Red 11. He is due to release Machete Kills In Space, which is in development, but there aren't any plans for another Alita as of yet. I don't know if that's because this movie didn't make a big profit, or if James Cameron's is just ultra-busy, but the story really needs an ending.Budget: $170million

43,TheMovieDiorama,Alita: Battle Angel ambitiously falls from Zalem and lands in a trashy mess.,5,13 February 2019,"James Cameron is a household name. Attach his name to any project and audiences will flock to see it so that they can be visually assaulted with state-of-the-art effects. But is it another case of style over substance? Yes. Completely. Alita is a muddled mess, but there are various enjoyable moments to be had. A cyborg scientist reassembles a disembodied body, and in the process creates Alita. She discovers she was a warrior, and was tasked in destroying the sky city Zalem, putting a stop to an antagonising puppeteer named Nova. That's the gist of the story, but there is so much more. Too much even! And that is half of this film's problem.It is a culmination of several chapters from the manga with so much world building and exposition, that its two hour runtime had no space for genuine character development. The first half of this film nearly bored me to death with constant explanations. Hunter-Warriors, Zalem, Motorball, ""Panzer Kunst"" and ""The Fall"". I didn't have time to whip out a notepad to write all this down! The screenplay sacrifices natural conversations and relationship bonding for world building, and it didn't work. The romance between Hugo and Alita was undercooked, with them bonding over exposition. Her relationship with Dyson was probably the most developed, but again was severely lacking in depth. The few moments of enjoyable thrills and dialogue, including the Motorball tryout race and initial battle with Grewishka, were then proceeded with dull dialogue that disabled any lasting impression. Several characters, particularly Chiren, instantly changed motives with minimal processing. We get it, Alita rejuvenates her motherly instincts but atleast give her time to develop this and not just immediately change within the snap of a finger. I will say that the Hunter-Warriors had personality and were led exceptionally by Skrein's menacing performance. The whole YA approach reminded me of last year's failure 'Mortal Engines', and that's not a good sign.As with any blockbuster produced by Cameron, the visual effects typically transport audiences to a new world. Fortunately this depiction of the 26th Century is bursting with environmental details that surprisingly gives the world life. The dirty metropolis of Iron City looked and felt trashy, whilst the ominous Zalem provided a utopian city that acted as an overbearing symbol of wealth. The motion capture, especially Salazar as Alita, was exceptional and impressed me for the most part. The effects do lose detail when the action starts, with characters jumping and weapons flying becoming very noticeable, which does consequently take you out of the film. Hugo as a cyborg in particular looked incredibly rushed and unpolished. I did appreciate the level of gore and violence. Limbs were flying off in every direction!The performances were all fine. Salazar maintained the lead role well and was supported by Waltz who gives the best performance. Johnson wasn't great, and was clearly employed for his good looks. The biggest crimes though were underutilising Connelly and Ali. Their antagonising characters held no power or menace, and more development should've been on them. Rodriguez' directing techniques were adequate, however the Motorball hunt sequence was exhilarating and gave me a sense of hope that this film might just be good. Alas, that hope was squandered when the film suddenly ends of a cliff hanger in a bid to open up to a sequel. Nope. The likelihood, considering the budget, is slim and therefore Alita will remain as an unfinished story. I will always support new adaptations, particularly of Japanese source materials, and I do praise the effort that Rodriguez put in. But it falls short with its explanatory story and one-dimensional characters. Alita still remains a fallen angel.",Alita - Battle Angel
44,pmtelefon,Very entertaining.,8,18 August 2019,"""Alita: Battle Angel"" is a fun ride of a movie. For a movie like this to work you need to care about the characters. Alita grabs hold right from her first scene and she never lets go. Rosa Salazar gives a terrific performance as Alita. The rest of the cast is good as well. The action scenes are exciting. ""Alita: Battle Angel"" may go on a little too long but it never wears out its welcome. This is the first Robert Rodriguez movie in many years that deserves to be seen more than once. I hope they make a sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel
45,digitalbeachbum,What could have been perfect was ruined by,5,9 February 2020,"I had never heard of Alita before this movie was released. I stopped collecting comics and other art long ago. However, it intrigued me to see how they would incorporate live action footage with new animation technology. So when it came to HBO for free I couldn't help but watch it.I was entranced and lost in the story so much that reality ceased and time stopped, which is a good sign. I enjoy the acting of Christoph Waltz and Jennifer Connelly so I immediately like the movie.The opening scene was very well done and I thought that the hidden background story was excellent, top of the line writing.The animation was, OK, I wasn't really impressed. I am not sure if they were deliberately trying to make her look fake or if she was supposed to be more robotic. The other cyborgs were really fake looking. Their faces looked like they were wearing those flat paper masks on a stick. They looked really bad to me.The writing was what really impressed me. Simple. To the point. Easy to follow. Realistic. As I said before I was lost in the story from the beginning.The direction and cinematography was awesome. The look and feel of this period was very well done.However, every thing fell apart, once during the ""Berserker"" find and then the ""Hugo"" repenting. Those two scenes were filled with flaws. The magic was broken during these two parts because they were out of character or they broke continuity in the flow of the movie.The other thing which really ruined the movie was the one scene (climbing up the conduit) where deus ex machina happens and I couldn't help but groan out loud and facepalm the scene. It was stupid and it was unnecessary. The writers or director is to blame and I'm not sure why they ruined a perfectly fine movie.While I give it a low score, it was better than that, because everything else I thought was good. I'm actually looking forward to the next installment to finish the story.",Alita - Battle Angel
46,matthewssilverhammer,More Cameron Than Rodriguez,8,8 March 2019,"Alita isn't based on a young adult novel, but it certainly feels like it; a young person experiencing a classic hero's journey, a corrupt authoritarian leader, a collection of friendly misfits, plenty of romance punctuating the sci-fi-fantasy core. And like many YA films of recent years (Divergent, Maze Runner), it isn't immune to the worst tendencies of the genre (convoluted storytelling, corny one-liners). But unlike many of the lesser entries in the field, it leans much heavier into its higher aspirations, with immersive world-building, cool action, impressive effects, engaging commentary and an unexpectedly empathetic hero.
Based on a popular manga, it tells the futuristic story of a recently reborn cyborg who uses her mysterious fighting powers and big heart to help start a revolt against the upper class. Like Ghost in the Shell meets Hunger Games, it often plays and looks like an anime come to life; Alita has the look down (big eyes, bigger head, tiny mouth), and the story is a familiar but solid mix of aspirational fantasy and high sci-fi. The themes are arguably cliched, but I see them more as timeless: the classic struggle between the uber-rich and everyone else, and the unfortunate truth that making it above your given station is nearly impossible without much personal sacrifice.
Mostly though, Alita is just plain awesome, both the movie and the character. Rodriguez knows how to stage his combat, thankfully letting the camera capture every colorful move with clarity and confidence; and the technical advancements and creativity to make Alita, not only bad-to-the-bone but, affable and emotive are remarkable. It's a shot of dystopian adrenaline that should be seen on the big screen.",Alita - Battle Angel
47,southdavid,From Dusk 'Til Yawn,4,13 February 2019,"As much as understand, and buy into, the desire to have movies made that are based on fresh IP rather than rebooting or sequalising tried and tested characters, I just couldn't warm to ""Alita: Battle Angel"".A CGI motion capture by actress Rosa Salazar, Alita is a partially destroyed cyborg with a human brain who is restored by skilled doctor/engineer Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz). Despite having no memory, Alita soon discovers she's a skilled fighter and that her history is somehow linked to the city above the city, an oasis for the privileged, built on the toil of the floor-dwellers. There is only one way to elevate yourself to the higher city, to become supreme champion of the violent sport that dominates the cities entertainment - Motorball.The positives first. It looks amazing, Weta haven't always managed to create at the same standard as the industry giants since their work on ""The Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy, but with ""Mortal Engines"" towards the end of 2018 and here with ""Alita"" they appear to be back on top form again. So all the visuals of Alita and in particular the scenes of her fighting look great. They are well choreographed and shot and it's easy to tell exactly what's going on there.Unfortunately, that's about it for the positives. The post-apocalypse-y world and set up of ""Alita"" is one we've seen a great many times before, and better in some cases, but it's the characters that really killed the film for me. Aside from the fact that they too are all played out tropes, I didn't find the chemistry between any of them compelled me to care about their characters or relationships. It's all very conventional. None of the actors, even the really good ones like Mahershala Ali, Jennifer Connelly or Waltz can make much out of dour humourless characters. The killer failing though is the lack of spark in the central love story, which much of the plot and the ending revolve around.One more thing, and I'm not sure if this is a positive or a negative. It's quite spectacularly violent, almost certainly the most violent 12A rated film that I've ever seen. Characters are decapitated, torn in half and ripped limb from limb, admittedly it's always the robot parts that take the damage and there's no blood but I'm glad that my son wasn't with us, and though there were no visceral reaction from any of the younger children in the audience, it was certainly and source of conversation amongst the parents as we were walking out.The visuals can't cover the dullness or familiarity of the story and unfortunately, for me, this was a bit of a miss. (And Motorball seriously rivals quidditch for the dumbest fictional sport).",Alita - Battle Angel
48,Vartiainen,Worthy of its name,8,4 March 2019,"I've been a fan of the original Battle Angel Alita manga for a long time. I even wrote my high school graduation essay about its take on cyborgs. So, when I heard that James Cameron of all people was also a fan and wanted to direct a movie based on it, I was hyped. And then my hopes and dreams were promptly crushed when he passed the reins to Robert Rodriguez. A man, who I still maintain, has directed only one good movie. Two, if you count Planet Terror, but that's bit of a stretch.Only one good movie. That is to say, before this one.As a hardcore Battle Angel Alita/Gunnm fan it pleases me to say that this is a really good adaptation of the original manga, as well as a borderline great movie in general.A few reasons for this. Firstly, it gets the characters. Alita, played beautifully by Rosa Salazar, feels like she felt to me in those first few stories. Vulnerable and naive to the world due to her memory loss, but with a lust for battle and a spine of steel. She's one of the few female protagonists I've ever encountered who's honestly more than a bit bloodlusty without ever apologizing for it. And that's refreshing. The side characters also feel mostly like they should. I was especially surprised by Hugo (Keean Johnson), who I felt was the weakest character in the manga by far, but who's one of the better ones in the film.Secondly, the visuals are amazing, even by today's high standards. Perhaps this shouldn't come as a surprise - it is still produced by Cameron, after all - but I was nevertheless impressed by how much they managed to make it look like the manga. While also adding to it. The action scenes are also nicely choreographed. This film has some of the nicest fighting scenes seen in years, and they alone are almost worth the price of admission.All that being said, the plot juggles perhaps a ball or two too many. I personally would have dropped at least the motorball subplot, but apparently that was Cameron's favourite part in the manga, so what can you do. Some of the characters are in the manga, which doesn't mean they should have been in the film. Especially if they're in it just to set up a sequel. The dialogues are pretty melodramatic as well. Personally I liked them, but I can see how they can come across as hokey to some viewers.I'm pleased with this. It probably would have worked even better had Cameron been the director, but even as it is it'll go down as one of the best scifi action movies of the current decade. Very easily recommended.",Alita - Battle Angel

Alita can't remember her past, but eventually does when she longs to be a hunter-warrior and also finds romance. Connelly (Labyrinth) plays doctor, Chiren who is also Ido's ex-wife.

51,jtindahouse,An unbalanced and pointless story,4,3 March 2019,"'Alita: Battle Angel' is a PG-13 movie that has characters being split in half with a sword. How is that possible you ask? I had to ask myself the same question, until I realised what it meant. It implied that no character in this movie is actually worth anything. No characters actually have any value or worth as people. This is a great con job. This fact lies right before our eyes but is also exceedingly well hidden.This movie is technically very well made, however that is about where the compliments have to end. I struggle to understand how people find a story where the hero is so far superior in strength to every other character entertaining. 'Alita' is immensely powerful already, and then as if that isn't enough she obtains an all-powerful sword to basically make her invincible. That is boring and not something I ever want to see in a film. An equal battle between good and evil always makes for the best films.Then there was the love-story. I have never seen a love-story so unearned in a film. The two characters simply meet in the street and instantly fall in love. Hard to believe the same writer was behind this and one of the greatest love-stories ever told 'Titanic'.

52,jamesrupert2014,Entertaining enough cyberpunk adventure despite a flimsy story and a lot of nondescript characters,7,23 September 2019,"A rebooted cyber-girl turns out to be a state-of-the-art terminatrix, gets involved with a human boy, and plays a mean game of motor ball. There is not much to the movie other than its sometimes astonishing visuals and Rosa Salazar's (or her avatar's) performance. I found Alita's appearance to be on the appealing side of the uncanny valley and the character to be surprisingly sympathetic and engaging, considering the source and genre. The rest of the cast were serviceable in their standard cyberpunk roles, although Hugo (Keean Johnson) was a pretty bland love interest. The rudimentary plot serves to glue together a bunch of action set pieces as Alita gets the best of a variety of cyberbullies and gets to play 'motorball', a vaguely defined 'rollerball'-like game which, like Harry Potter's 'quidditch', makes little intrinsic sense but serves to advance the plot and give the characters something exciting to do when they aren't fighting. The special effects are excellent but not overly imaginative (derivative of 'A.I.' (2001), assorted Kate Beckinsale films, and the aforementioned 'Rollerball' (1975). I've not read the manga but suspect that images that look great on paper don't always translate (Dr. Ido's rocket powered maul comes to mind). The lack of a proper ending was disappointing.",Alita - Battle Angel

Rosa Salazar really brings Alita to life, even though Alita is a CGI character, but she really gets you invested into her, makes you the audience forget she is CGI. Effects where so amazing it almost puts The Matrix to shame, and the futuristic setting makes you forget about Blade Runner. All the other characters also comes alive has well.

Manga is starting to look pretty good isn't it?Anyway, it seems like a lot of the bad reviews are... political. You know, the, ""people only like this because they are (insert woke insult)."" and that's really not fair.I'll go out there and admit that Alita's eyes kind of freaked me out. Too realistic, too cartoony eyes, and that left me with an unsettling feeling. It was creepy. It was creepy in the same relative way the Elves on the Shelves are creepy.But the story comes fast and hard and leaves you very satisfied in the end. It kind of felt like Princess Monanoke kind of ending. And that is all with a story about someone that in really pretty innocent in a world that is really pretty horrific, and that is also a fun thing to watch.But, yeah, her eyes kind of freaked me out. Aside from that, it was a totally enjoyable film. Give it a shot and ignore the politics.",Alita - Battle Angel
55,stevendbeard,Manga Done Right,8,16 February 2019,"I saw ""Alita:Battle Angel"", starring Rosa Salazar-the Maze Runner movies, Parenthood_tv; Christoph Waltz-The Legend of Tarzan_2016, Spectre; Jennifer Connelly-Only the Brave, Hulk_2003 and Mahershala Ali-Green Book, Luke Cage_tv.
This movie is based on a series of Manga books called 'Gunnm'-it was changed to 'Battle Angel:Alita' when it hit America-that was published from 1990-1995. It is written by James Cameron, who changed the title to 'Alita:Battle Angel'-he was going to direct it too but he got too busy with the Avatar movies-and it's directed by Robert Rodriguez. Since Robert directed it, it was filmed in Austin, Texas. If you are a Manga fan, then you should really enjoy this film-if you are not, but you like good action movies, you will still probably like it. It is set in the 26th century-watch the opening credits with the 20th Century Fox logo-and there are 2 main divisions in this world: the Dump is where the beggars, criminals and bounty hunters live along side the cyborgs with human brains and Zalem is a floating city above the Dump where the rich and privileged live in comfort. Christoph plays a scavenger in the Dump that repairs damaged cyborgs, so he is always looking for good spare parts. He finds Rosa-well, just her head-and takes her home and gives her a new body. At first, Rosa can not remember anything from her past but slowly, things start to come back to her-one of the first things she remembers is that she can fight like Bruce Lee, which is good, because a lot of people are trying to kill her. Jennifer plays Christoph's ex wife and Mahershala is a bad guy. FYI: There is a game played in the movie called Motorball and it reminded me of an older movie called Rollerball. There is also a big name star in a quick cameo role as a villain.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes.
I'm not a big fan of Manga-something about those big eyes-but this is Manga done right. I would buy this on Blu-Ray.",Alita - Battle Angel

57,robfollower,"Alita: Battle Angel"" is big and fun entertainment",9,17 February 2019,"From visionary filmmakers James Cameron (AVATAR) and Robert Rodriguez (SIN CITY), comes ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL, an epic adventure of hope and empowerment. When Alita (Rosa Salazar) awakens with no memory of who she is in a future world she does not recognize, she is taken in by Ido (Christoph Waltz), a compassionate doctor who realizes that somewhere in this abandoned cyborg shell is the heart and soul of a young woman with an extraordinary past. As Alita learns to navigate her new life and the treacherous streets of Iron City, Ido tries to shield her from her mysterious history while her street-smart new friend Hugo (Keean Johnson) offers instead to help trigger her memories. But it is only when the deadly and corrupt forces that run the city come after Alita that she discovers a clue to her past - she has unique fighting abilities that those in power will stop at nothing to control. If she can stay out of their grasp, she could be the key to saving her friends, her family and the world she's grown to love.James Cameron, Robert Rodriguez and producer Jon Landau have crafted something special and its one of those films worth seeing in 3D. Trust me, the visual effects are insane, the action set pieces are easy to follow and well shot, and Rosa Salazar is fantastic as Alita.
Finally, if you live near an IMAX theater, I strongly recommend seeing Alita in IMAX 3D because you will get to see about 26% more image in a number of scenes. Alita also stars Jennifer Connelly (Good looking as ever), Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein, and Jackie Earle Haley.Alita accomplished the goals of bringing the cybernetic skeletal frame to the works and customizing it with that Cameron flair. It's beautiful world building and special effects, it's action for the most part is delivered, and the storytelling is not bad given how difficult it is to cram a series into two hours.Overall, ""Alita: Battle Angel"" is big and fun entertainment. It might appeal not for everyone taste, but this movie was done so well that it left wanting more. A very pleasant surprise.",Alita - Battle Angel
58,alindsay-al,A good visually stunning film,7,10 February 2019,"This film has had some build with some production issues but the promise that this film will revolutionise how we watch films, but I feel like it wasn't as inventive but was an enjoyable experience. The premise of the film sees the remains of a cyborg recovered as Alita trys to work out her past and this world that she is living in. The character of Alita is completly CGI and at first this was a little strange but as the film went on I really cared about this character. She was very sympathetic and was a great action hero to watch with an interesting story about her. Christoph Waltz plays the man who finds Alita and does a really good job in this film, he is a very caring character and I cared about their relationship throughout this film. The rest of this cast was not as good, Mahershala Ali plays a villain in this film and he was completly underutilised in this film, he is a great actor but is given a really poor character in this film. Jennifer Conolly is in this film and I thought she was so bland in this film, her character didn't need to be in this film as she really added nothing to this film in any way. Ed Skrein is in this film and is quite fun to watch but he isn't in the film enough to learn about his character or care about his role in the film. The story in the film has some emotional beats to it especially in the first half . However, this film has a very bland generic plot, especially with a tragic love story that is really not interesting at all and you won't care even though the film wants you to. The script has some decent dramatic dialogue in it and some interesting unique elements aswell, though there is some cringy lines in this film that really takes you out of the moment. The style of this film is fanatastic, it looks incredible, a great use of effects and a good blend of action scenes make this a great experience to see on the big screen. Overall this is a fun film to watch that if you are a fan of great looking films then you should see this film.",Alita - Battle Angel
59,CubsandCulture,Lackluster world building is put before a complete story,3,2 August 2019,"I blame the MCU success for this recent tendency among films, but like so many other cinematic universe attempts this isn't a completely film. Structurally it does not have the necessarily parts. It has no true climax, or for that matter initiating incident. The film feels very much in the midst of a franchise and frankly the littler mysteries the screenplay left to solve are not worth solving. The remaining plot-a generic techno babble good vs evil story that seems to steal from every sci-fi film in the last 20 years-wasn't enough to hold my attention. Some of this is the direction/design. This film looks rather like a Metropolis knockoff with a dash of Anime techno. It reminded me of all things of a bad animated film Robots from a decade or so ago. This world isn't worth spending time in.A lot of this is the character Alita. She is flavorless and largely a MacGruffin. Add in her creepy wispy design-the eyes especially are nightmare fuel-and the central character doesn't let the viewer. The film is emotionally and narratively inert because the main character is not human enough.Quite the bad film.",Alita - Battle Angel

Whilst she has lost her memory, she soon realised that she was something of note in the past.Whilst the animation of the girl is fun and the set pieces impressive, this film is held back by the seemingly desperate need to build things up for a sequel. As a result there is an obvious element that clearly needs airing, but which isn't. Waltz as avuncular Doctor makes a nice change and he carries it off well, Connolly is fine but wasted and Ali is rather a cliche.

Screenplay of the movie is average and few of the scenes are illogical and doesn't serves any purpose. Acting is another weak aspect of the movie as despite of some of the strong cast this department looks dull.

A Japanese anime hero has been brought to the big screen through the professional magical treatment of John Cameron. Alita is a very good film from beginning to end. I enjoyed the quick reference to Titanic scene on the motorcycle; and the Romeo and Juliet allusions (there is even a four note musical allusion). The main character is well-formulated, and highly sympathetic. The father figure is nicely understated and sympathetic as well. I think some of the critical reviews have been extremely unfair, and strike me as just being jealous of the success of John Cameron. His skill in making these Avatar types of films is undeniable to me. The only drawback to the film is the obvious attempt at setting up a sequel, which seems to be the goal of every superhero film ever made; so that should not be held against it. There will be a sequel; and it should prove to be highly entertaining.",Alita - Battle Angel
64,kirbylee70-599-526179,MANGA BROUGHT TO LIFE,9,4 August 2019,"For those who aren't aware of what Manga is it's a form of comic book developed in Japan that's fueled by colorful art and normally has adult themes. It's become quite popular since its inception and influential in comics in this country as well. While many Manga have been turned into animated films few have transferred into reality based films. That all changes with ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL. I should say somewhat changes because computer animation is still to be seen here. But it combines seamlessly with real footage to make an interesting, exciting and adventurous movie that most will enjoy.The year is 2563 and its 300 years since the Earth was devastated in an all-out interplanetary war. In this post-apocalyptic world Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) roams the junkyards for parts for his cybernetic customers, people whose limbs have been replaced with robotic parts. He comes across a cybernetic body with a human brain still intact and takes it home to attach to a body he has there. He names the cyborg Alita after his deceased daughter.Alita adjusts quickly to her new body though she has no memories of her past life. She meets a mysterious woman with ties to Ido named Dr. Chiren (Jennifer Connelly). Wandering the streets near where she lives with Dr. Ido she meets Hugo (Keean Johnson) a streetwise young man who dreams of getting off planet to the sky city above, Zalem. To fund his way there he steals cyborg parts he sells to Vector (Mahershala Ali), the head of the most popular game on the planet Motorball. The game consists of cyborgs battling it out on a track and Hugo takes Alita to see the game.One night after noticing Dr. Ido sneaks out after dark Alita follows him. She discovers that he is secretly a hunter-warrior, someone who hunts down rogue cyborgs with a bounty on their heads to fund his hospital. Wounded by Grewishka (Jackie Earl Haley), one of those he's come for, Alita steps in and instinctively knows how to fight the attackers using a long thought extinct battle form. Taking out two of the three attackers, the third returns to his employer, Vector, and is repaired and upgraded by the doctor Vector uses, Dr. Chiren.Wanting to help the doctor by becoming a hunter-warrior too he tells her no and to stay home. Like any young person she ignores his instructions and goes out to register on her own. Searching the nearby junkyards Alita comes across a body there, a Berserker, one of the bodies used by the United Republics of Mars (URM) during the Great War. She urges Ido to transfer her mind into it but he refuses.Knowing that Grewishka will continue to seek out Ido Alita heads to a nearby bar where the hunter-warriors hang out. Picking a fight with the most infamous member there she nearly defeats him before Ido steps in and puts an end to it. Her goal was to recruit the hunters to take down Grewishka but before she could round them up the bar is attacked and Alita damaged.With no choice Ido transfers Alita into the Berserker body. The technology even stuns Ido. Still alive and in love with Hugo who has now changed his ways, Alita is more determined than ever. Armed with the new body and still motivated to face off against the evil Grewishka, she enters the Motorball game. But Vector has something in store for her that may stop her before she has a chance to put her plan in motion.ALIST: BATTLE ANGEL combines some amazing storytelling with the most astounding visuals seen in some time. The film doesn't depend solely on those visuals though and instead intertwines these two items to make a tale that you will find yourself involved in and waiting to discover the outcome of while ignoring the remote control, never wanting to fast forward past any eye catching moment. It's rare that the combination of storytelling and effects works so effortlessly and yet director Robert Rodriquez has done just that. But then he has the experience to pull this off having made SIN CITY and the SPY KIDS movies.The acting here is much better than one would expect as well, including that of Rosa Salazar as Alita. In spite of the fact that her performance is CGI rendered had she not brought Alita to life through her acting abilities the character would have fallen flat. Instead she gives it substance.I know of at least one person who's not a fan of science fiction that said she loved this film. My guess is that everyone who has the chance to view it will do so as well. By the end credits it's a film that you hope will find its way to becoming a franchise with new adventures for Alita to experience. If not at least this one will satisfy those of us who have become fans.",Alita - Battle Angel
65,kluseba,The marriage of effects and emotions,8,27 March 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel is a cyberpunk action film based upon Japanese manga series Gunnm. This movie is the first installment in what is going to be a franchise centered around a sympathetic female cyborg with outstanding fighting skills who protects those who are dear to her in a dystopian world. This first movie tells how Alita is brought back to life by generous scientist Ido who is also secretely a Hunter-Warrior who tracks down criminal cyborgs. Against the will of the scientist, Alita gets inspired by her mentor's secret career and starts her own as the rookie soon impresses colleagues with her determination, empathy and skills. She also falls in love with young dreamer Hugo and befriends the members of his quirky gang. Everything seems to be perfect in Alita's new world but her mysterious past resurfaces in dangerous situations and leads her on an exhausting quest for identity. In addition to this, her admired lover Hugo hides a terrible secret from her. The greatest danger however comes from influential administrators and politicians who soon hire hitmen to uncover Alita's mysterious past and eliminate a respectable opponent that could change a dystopian world for the better.Alita: Battle Angel convinces if compared to numerous exchangeable superhero films by Marvel or DC Comics for three specific reasons. First of all, the heroine is dynamic, empathic and positive which makes her very likeable and viewers empathize with her. Secondly, the movie focuses on strong characters and a mysterious plot instead of overusing visual special effects. Thirdly, the film takes its time to develop characters and story carefully, creating a most fascinating, detailed and adventurous universe that leaves the viewers craving for potential sequels in the future.The movie also convinces in many technical departments. The visuals are stunningly beautiful, creative and diversified. The sound effects are very efficient and best enjoyed at your local cinema. The soundtrack is balanced, catchy and dynamic. The action sequences are colourful without feeling too exaggerated.The movie manages to keep a balance between emotional settings and technically stunning effects. Even though some parts of the plot are predictable and the film doesn't reinvent the genre of superhero movies, it's certainly one of the greatest of its kind and worth the positive hype. Robert Rodriguez has created a memorable film that can nearly compete with his masterpiece Sin City and it's positive that the influence of formulaic director James Cameron has been reduced to scriptwriting in this case. The outstanding performances by underrated lead actress Rosa Salazar and charismatic veteran actor Christoph Waltz must also be pointed out as they are perfect choices for the characters they play.

66,Pairic,Great SF/Adventure,8,16 February 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel: Although Alita is directed by Robert Rodriguez it very much shows the influence of James Cameron who wrote the screenplay and produced the film. The faintly animation style overlay especially on Alita (Rosa Salazar) certainly exudes Cameron. Rodriguez certainly comes into his own with the fight, battle and Motorball sequences. Motorball is a sport which closely resembles Rollerball in the 1975 film but only Cyborgs compete.
Alita's head (containing her brain )and core is found on a scrap heap by Dr Ido (Christoph Waltz) a Cyber-Surgeon who tends to impoverished citizens of Metal City. This city is below the sky city of Zalem, the last of it's kind, all of the others were destroyed in The Fall, an interplanetary war which raged 300 years before. Zalem is the home of the wealthy, only those born there may live there apart from the annual Motorball champion. Ido gives Alita a new body but is very protective of her and he has his own secrets.There are also gangs of organ leggers about who murder people for their body parts, even Cyborgs aren't safe, being stripped of detachable limbs by thieves. Whilst battling these gangs Alita starts to recover her memories, realising that she was a warrior who participated on the war 300 years in the past, she also recaptures her martial art skills. The romance in the film, she falls for the grifter (with a gold heart) Hugo (Keenan Johnson and hangs out with his posse, this gives things a bit too much of a teenagery feel.Great Cyborg assassins and bounty hunters, the best being the Cockney Punk (complete with Mohawk) Zapan (Ed Skrein), closely followed by the gargantuan Grewishka (Jackie Earle Haley). Jennifer Connolly plays Ido's estranged wife Chiren who has Motorball connections. There is also a dark conspiracy which links Motorball, the organ leggers and access to Zalem which involves Chiren's lover Vector (Mahershala Ali).A film which has the feel of Blade Runner and the Mobius comic strips with Zalem and The Fall being reminiscent of Larry Niven's Ringworld.

Alita.
It's a nice name.
I love it!I was really looking forward to this movie ""Alita: Battle Angel"". A cyber-punk setting and unparalleled computerized images that are perfectly injected into a real-life environment. Of course, you know Alita (Rosa Salazar) is the result of a hard-working graphic designer who has been sweating for hours behind his computer screen to project a graphic shell onto a real-life person. However, it didn't bother me. Alita seemed like a lifelike person. Even though she had those unnatural large Bambi eyes. I admit that at the beginning, my eyes always wandered down to her derriere to see if there was such a sweet little wagging tail. But eventually, how strange it might sound, I thought the end result was quite meager. Poor in terms of atmosphere and narrative.Maybe my expectations were a little too high. Or was it the cheesiness of the father-daughter story? There's the all-consuming grief after the loss of a daughter. A search for a surrogate daughter to appease this sorrow. And that causes Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) scouring the dump of Zalem (the last air city that immediately reminded me of the movie ""Elysium"") for discarded cyborg parts, so he could construct Alita. He's a kind of Frankenstein. But this time using non-human parts.Or maybe it was the romantic part. The last thing I needed. Really. The moment Hugo (Keean Johnson) came into the picture, I already knew that this rebel-looking hunk would make a romantic connection with this artificial being. And I really didn't feel like witnessing romantic frivolities that make young teenage girls float. The only thing you aren't sure about is the outcome. A happy ending? Or a catastrophic one?The only thing I regretted afterward, was that I hadn't seen it on the silver screen. Probably it will all have been bigger and more impressive. Because frankly, the visuals are really amazing so to call (Not so hard when you see the budget they had). Great eye for details. A city that looks like a run-down anthill where metallic constructions stand next to remnants of the past. And a whole bunch of futuristic technologies and vehicles.And also, the action-rich combat scenes look great actually. Swirling images in slow motion and impressive choreography you might say. Especially the fight in the bar with Zapan (Ed ""The transporter refueled"" Skrein), the skirmish in an alley after she followed Ido and the underground fight with Grewishka (Jackie Earle Haley) appealed to my imagination. And finally, there are also the Motorball competitions. Action-packed, fast-paced and mouth-wateringly brought into the picture. It immediately reminded me of the old film ""Rollerball"" from 1975.But despite all the graphic power and hard action, I found it overall disappointing and moderate. Even though the fighting was extremely solid in terms of views, it was too safe and colored inside the lines. Perhaps because they were aiming at a young audience. But most of all I missed a solid and clear story. The so-called Great War was mentioned, but they didn't do much more with it. The flying cities were also a complete mystery to me. There was no explanation. Beware, I had the same thing with ""Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets"". Also, a visually overwhelming film where the story is difficult to understand. This last film is also based on a comic, just like ""Alita"". I can imagine that fans of these comics can empathize better with the story. But my biggest annoyance was that at the end I realized that I had watched a lengthy intro to the sequel that is probably already on the table at Twentieth Century Fox. And I hate sequels. Good advice Fox. Provide the continuation with a touch of humor, because that was missing too here.

70,aidanratesmovies,Entertaining and Unforgettable,9,24 July 2019,"A magical, worldbending, and wildly entertaining experience. The film has its fair share of structural problems, especially when it comes to natural dialogue in a script and predictable plot points, but you can't help but forgive the film for these flaws from its shere sense of direction and thought provoking story and setting. The acting for the film isn't by any means amazing, but Rosa Salazar as Alita herself is certainly the films strongest point- as well as its use of CGI. The special effects are undeniably impressive, and though that is no excuse for a lack of a better script, it certainly helps the film with its otherworldly atmosphere and makes the whole product seem better than you would have thought. In the end, the film is nothing new in terms of story, but it certainly one I wouldn't mind watching again, and certainly one I will never forget.

I'm siding with my younger son here because I really enjoyed it .Alita is a creation from an age of despair. Found by the mysterious Dr. Ido while trolling for cyborg parts, Alita becomes a lethal, dangerous being. She cannot remember who she is, or where she came from. To accomplish her true purpose, she must fight and kill. And that is where Alita's true significance comes to bear. She is an angel from heaven.

73,truemythmedia,"For Fans of the Manga, an Absolute Triumph... For other Moviegoers... Not so Much",8,25 July 2019,"I love the character of Alita as if she were a real person, mostly because I've been with her on her journey for so long now. Alita is older than I am now, first entering the scene through Yukito Kishiro's amazing cyber-punk manga series Battle Angel Alita in December of 1990. The initial series is over two thousand pages long, but that only begins to tell Alita's story. After Battle Angel, the story continues with Battle Angel Alita: Last Order (around 5,000 pages in that story- I'm less than a third of the way through), and is still being told in Battle Angel Alita: Mars Chronicles (still in its infancy). To me, she is infinitely more compelling than any of the characters in the Marvel Universe (Spider-Man is the only superhero that comes close). Alita is a strong female protagonist with a thoughtful mind, a samurai-like code, a mysterious past, and a knack for getting herself into trouble in a world that feels amazingly fantastical. Alita is everything I want in a continuing series, and it's why I've followed her on her journey for this long.For many people, I'm sure this movie will be completely middling, and that's fine. For me, this was a chance to see one of my favorite heroines finally grace the big screen, a chance to see the Berserker body and the fabled panzerkunst fighting style. No, this movie isn't amazing; there are plenty of issues with it. If I were to show this to some of my fellow TMM reviewers I'm sure they'd groan and poke fun at me for giving this 4/5 Stars, and I could completely understand that. For most people this will be a 3/5, but if I'm honest with myself, I enjoyed this too much to give it anything less than 4 Stars.Go somewhere else if you want an unbiased review. I freaking love Alita.

It's explores it's world effectively and has amazing direction from Robert Rodriguez.,Alita - Battle Angel
76,robertemerald,Massive futuristic shenanigans,10,1 December 2019,"At its heart Alita is a very sweet first love story. That's the spine, and with such an adorable heroine, in so many ways, this is one movie that is impossible not to like. Add to that the fantastic city, yet another masterpiece, as impressive as movies such as Judge Dredd, Total Recall, Blade Runner, Elysium or Star Wars, to name a few. I liked the ideas behind the cyborgs, the vision of a future where what for us would be very advanced tech indeed, has in Akita's world been around for hundreds of years and comes with all sorts of possibilities, and that doctors may be as much mechanic technicians as serious medical men. The back story is sophisticated and well thought out. If you buy the dvd watch the extras first. This will greatly enhance watching the movie. All up, Alita is perfect entertainment.",Alita - Battle Angel

79,rgkarim,"Battle Ready, This Angel Is One Of The Better Anime/Manga Adaptations",8,14 February 2019,"Anime/Manga are series that have shook the fabric of animation to its core, inspiring unique tales that continue to go through the test of time. The variety of stories cover the variety of spectra, where no grounds are too sacred too cross. Each series potentially cross multiple volumes, issues, and episodes telling a complex, intricate tale that becomes ingrained in so many hearts, taking years to tell the story right. So trying to cram all that into a limited time movie can be quite the challenge, but Hollywood is willing to try as this movie I review today strikes. Robbie K here with another review, this time focusing on:Movie: Alita: Battle Angel (2019)Director:
Robert Rodriguez
Writers:
James Cameron (screenplay by), Laeta Kalogridis(screenplay by)
Stars:
Rosa Salazar, Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly
LIKES:ActingCastWorld BuildingDesign/Costumes/Make UpEmotionActionSummary: A good movie relies on good actors to make the tale come to life and fortunately the battle angel recruits a set of good warriors. Salazar of course is the star, utilizing fantastic control over emotions to strike at all the heart of the robotic girl and delivers a fantastic performance. Christoph Waltz may not have been tapped into full potential, but works very well in the role given as the doting father with a potential dark past. Connelly returning to a big production was good, poised and proper, executing the limited role quite well. And as for Mahershala Ali, well that actor knocks it out of the park, no matter what role he is given and Vector is no exception, though again more was needed.
Instead Alita's big selling point for me is the world building and design that Cameron's mind comes up with. Taking a comic/anime and turning it into the beautiful 3-D world, the director accomplished the goals by capturing the beautiful art of Alita's world. Old world charm meets futuristic technology in a gothic/horror manner that symbolizes the themes Alita's world brings. Costumes help support this for the non-CGI actors, with makeup that further emphasizes the details of the forced evolution the Fall brought and the lives it influenced. As for the CGI, it brought with it those horror filled designs, unleashing the unique robot and human champions that dwell in the post-war world. While not the most realistic looking, the animation is fluid, the persona's well crafted, and the theme is maximized.
Yet the story is also semi-impressive for the compressed time block it currently holds. Alita's world is packed with emotion in the young ""girl's"" journey to figure out her past, present, and future in hopes of changing the world. It's inspiring, and tells the details needed to get the story out by covering a fair amount of story. Most of this certainly inspirational, with Alita's character pulling the weight and bringing a champion to get behind with multiple layers. Even the action fits the manga theme well, gradually building in both suspense and emotional trilogy, with the latter component climaxing in the final battle of the film. Thus, you have some good story telling.
DISLIKESBroke one of my rulesPaceStory TellingAction lengthToo much into one filmTrailer SyndromeSUMMARY: If you've followed me long enough you'll know one of my pet peeves is unnecessary cruelty to animals, and Alita sadly does this. I haven't read the manga so not sure it if happens in the story, but an earlier scene and the rules established, meant this scene was unnecessary and that hits this reviewer harder than others.
Outside of personal preferences like that though, Alita's pacing was a little inconsistent, almost hitting moments that felt like a filler before taking off back into the exciting components. Some of this I felt arose from trying to tell all the story components of Alita's journey, cramming in some hastily developed story arcs into the 2-hour time frame to try and be complete, which we will talk about in the next paragraph. Nonetheless, the story telling is good with the emotional component and does hit the highlights, but it is still lacking the same punch and kick that the full series had time to tell, primarily in Alita's past that she so wanted to find. That aspect I felt was skirted, and perhaps is left to be fully answered in the companion novel released this year. It's not bad storytelling, just rushed which brings me to the next component
Alita's action scenes may have some amazing attention to detail and emotionally stimulating components that Japanese storytelling is famous for. However, the movie for me fell short of bringing the full potential out in some of the fights. This is especially true near the end, where a few fights held great potential for both excitement and emotional satisfaction, but chose to cut costs and montage the approach. It's not awful, but just not the same finish I was hoping with the other scenes. In addition, the flashback offered a chance to see some really cool moments, but again finished in a few blinks of the eye. Why is this the case? Well to me it felt like trying to fit too much into one film, in hopes of getting the interest capture for another sequel. It's not that they did it badly, but like the series it is based on, the film could have focused on aspects, done it well by maximizing those components and led into the next film. Perhaps the anima style is too big of a risk, but I felt it would have worked if not so much had been crammed in. Still, unlike other films Alita balances this a little better than most, but still not perfect.
Finally, the trailer campaign for this film has done its homework a little too well. Alita hammered the scenes to death, and much of the movie has been revealed in the released clips that you can essentially piece together everything you need. By such an aggressive campaign, it may end up harming itself rather than helping.
VERDICT:
To wrap this up, Alita accomplished the goals of bringing the cybernetic skeletal frame to the works and customizing it with that Cameron flair. It's beautiful world building and special effects, it's action for the most part is delivered, and the storytelling is not bad given how difficult it is to cram a series into two hours. Still, if the goal is for multiple movies, I believe some cuts could have been made to make stand-alone films that built into a trilogy instead of one mega movie, allowing for more complete tales. Nevertheless, I'm pleased with this film and felt very entertained by what it offered, proud to see strides made in live action adaptations of Japanese media. Is it perfect? No, but it has enough positives to check out in the theater and definitely worth the trip with friends.My scores are:Action/Romance/Sci-Fi: 7.5

80,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Alita: Battle Angel,6,2 March 2019,"""You are the most human person I have ever met"". So says the lovelorn character of Hugo in Alita: Battle Angel (my latest review). Good insightful quote because I don't think anyone in ""Alita"" actually registered as a full-on ""human"" being. Robo-apocalypse now people!In Alita: Battle Angel, a female half robot with a mortal brain attempts to recollect her past while trying to find herself in fictional Iron City (circa 2563). She also strives to become a star athlete in the savage sport of Motorball.Starring Rosa Salazar, the miscast Christoph Waltz, and the miscast Mahershala Ali (these dudes should have switched roles as the villain and non-villain), ""Alita"" doesn't quite win the ""battle"" for my total recommendation. Big eyes and small-boned aside, Salazar as ""Alita's"" lead comes off a little wooden even though she aptly knows how to handle herself in a fight.Registering at a running time of just over two hours and scripted by James Cameron (where the heck has he been?), Alita: Battle Angel is the cyborg movie to end all cyborg movies. Fundamentally, ""Alita"" is a little bit of Blade Runner, a little bit of A.I., a little bit of 1975's Rollerball, and something akin to an early flick by South African Neill Blomkamp. Look for some cheesy dialogue, some sumptuous yet dated special effects, and a one line cameo by former Oscar nominee Ed Norton (huh?).All in all, ""Alita's"" veteran director (Robert Rodriguez) has never been the most cohesive of maverick storytellers. With Alita: Battle Angel, it's just another sci-fi case of rinse, rinse, repeat. Still, Rodriguez knows where to put the camera, he knows how to shoot in 3D space, he ferociously knows his whip pans, and he knows how to intensely film samurai-style action. ""Alita"" may be polarizing, soulless, and mechanical but at least there are cinematic bodies in motion. That's half the darn ""battle"". Rating: 2.5 stars.",Alita - Battle Angel
81,rannynm,"An Epic, Action-Packed Film With An Empowering Message for Girls",10,18 February 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel, in one word, is exhilarating! This anime film is directed by Robert Rodriguez who produced Spy Kids and writer James Cameron, who most of you may know as the writer/director of Avatar. This film is visually stunning. The animation and real life footage totally merge together. This movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time!Alita (Rosa Salazar) is found by Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) disassembled in a scrap yard. Dr. Ido takes her core, which was still very much alive and attaches it to a cyborg body. Alita awakens in the doctor's care and wants to learn who she really is. Discovering the world around her, she is fascinated by Iron City. Ido tries to keep her from her past, while her quick-witted friend Hugo (Keean Johnson) offers to help her. The villains that run the city try to go after Alita. Little do they know Alita has these powerful fighting skills. To see what happens to Alita you have got to see this film!The setting really brings this movie to life. There's a violent, dangerous vibe you get right when you see the film. I felt as if I was actually there, roaming the dirt roads with the humans, cyborgs and bounty hunters. My favorite character in this movie is Alita. I fell in love with her right when I first saw her. The details in her eyes make her look so human-like. The action in this film is put together very well. Alita is a mix Wonder Woman, Cat Woman and The Matrix all put together. I could watch Alita fight all day. I love her!The message throughout this movie is about girl power, confidence and never giving up. This movie is PG-13 and there is one curse word I heard. Adults will enjoy this movie also. I give this film a whopping 5 out of 5 stars because it is worth every star and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults.Reviewed by Milika L., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

This movie is worthy of Oscars, since it has top notch visual effects, an excellent cast, great music, superb action, and a cliffhanger ending that leaves open the possibility of sequels if this movie breaks even worldwide and even on home media and streaming.

Now the technology is really powerful. The plot, but the plot, the progressive opposition, waste land depiction and emotional drama, there are relatively big problems.

Finally, the waste soil, the atmosphere should be more decadent, showing whether mechanical ball or city, are too peaceful, as if in addition to physical mechanization, people's lives are not distressed.

85,fntstcplnt,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),5,10 February 2020,"Directed by Robert Rodriguez. Starring Rosa Salazar, Christoph Waltz, Keean Johnson, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., Jackie Earle Haley, Lana Condor, Jeff Fahey. (PG-13)In the 26th century, scientist Waltz finds a broken cyborg with a 300-year-old intact brain in a junk heap and rebuilds it with a new body modeled after his deceased daughter. The new creation, Alita (Salazar), weirdly behaves like a teenage girl--and even crushes on a cyborg scrapper named Hugo (Johnson)--but proves to have whirlwind combat mastery and pursues occupation as a bounty hunter. Long-gestating adaptation of a 1990s manga called ""Gunnm"" has plenty to look at but very little that lingers; there's visual energy to spare in the fight scenes and high-tech roller derby horseplay, but character development is limited and the romance lacks weight and chemistry. Storytelling issues abound, from its clunky world-building to its rushed (and barely existent) third act that just sort of...ends. Salazar is an appealing heroine, though the decision to give her large, anime-style eyes is often distracting. Director Rodriguez brings his expected flair for camera movements and sporadic visceral excitement, but little else bears his quirky stamp or identity. Edward Norton has a cameo.53/100",Alita - Battle Angel

88,Abdulxoxo,Decent action film,7,24 December 2020,"Alita is a prime example of a movie that critics hate and audiences love. Upon its release critics bashed it and called it ""mind-numbing"" but the audience adore it and even demands a sequel, well, I side with the masses on this one. The movie is decent with solid story and it has good deal of heart. The film gives you just enough information and background about the main characters and puts them in an interesting enough story. The visual effects are first-rate and the whole production value is of high calibre. The action set pieces are entertaining and fun watch with good camera angles and effective slow motions. The performances are decent all around.
On the whole, I would have liked to have had more actual story development but as far as character development goes, this film lays it on pretty heavy when it comes to the main characters. Quite enjoyable for fans of action films.",Alita - Battle Angel

It also has a very substantive story as a solid foundation. The setting is very grim but Alita's character is uplifting and gives viewers hope. I liked how Alita's story also involves a quest of finding out who she truly is. She finds herself in a world where she can be seen as somewhat ordinary. But she comes to find out that she's far from ordinary. She's an angel from heaven. I really enjoyed this movie and the story itself can be explained further in other films. I hope there's a sequel as the ending laid the framework for more films. This movie is emotional, action filled, and has intense action sequences. The creators of this film did a nice job of spacing out the action. They didn't rush into it and every battle scene was meaningful. I would definitely recommend this movie.",Alita - Battle Angel
91,Troy_Campbell,"Ambitious, messy and exciting.",8,23 February 2019,"Sometimes it's hard to know why certain movies tickle your fancy. Every now and then a film comes along and, despite all possible logic, you can't help but enjoy it. And so there's Alita, a dystopian-future manga (Japanese animation) adaptation. With a list of flaws long enough to fill an essay, there's no way I can argue against anyone who claims it is a bad film - they're probably right. So why didn't they bother me, or at least, why was I able to forgive these flaws? It boils down to two things: first, the titular cyborg (played by Rosa Salazar via motion capture) is a plausibly real and captivating character; second, the spectacularly choregraphed action sequences are exhilarating. Although her love interest, human grifter Hugo (Keean Johnson), is as damp a squib as you'll find in a blockbuster, Alita compensates with her infectious enthusiasm, charming naivety and badass fighting skills. The battle against her own memory is as equally compelling as her battle against the baddies. The other supporting cast members (including Jennifer Connelly and Mahershala Ali) seem to appreciate the chance to ham it up despite the astoundingly bad and cliché-ridden dialogue, but only Christoph Waltz really makes an impression as the enigmatic yet endearing father-figure Dr Ido. In the pursuit of creating a photorealistic fantasy iron-world where the protagonist is a literal killing machine and majority of the population are somehow augmented with mechanical parts, the lion's share of the huge budget (estimated around $200m) has clearly gone into visual effects. Alita alone is a technological wonder, the entirely CGI teen-warrior another step in the direction of scarily convincing computer-generated humans. This is not an ape or a Na'vi or a digitally de-aged Marvel hero that's tricking our eyes into believing, but a young female with mostly human facial features - which is impressive. The CGI wonder doesn't end there. Whether it's Alita handing out beat-downs with her balletic martial arts or a ruthless full-throttle 'Motorball' race, the action set-pieces are full of visual panache and inventiveness where the editing (and some well-timed slow-mo) actually lets you see what is going on. Proving that you can't always understand your own feelings, Alita: Battle Angel is ambitious, messy, bold and narratively weak all rolled into one - and I love it.",Alita - Battle Angel
92,vithiet,"Thank you Rodriguez and Cameron, from a long time fan",10,16 February 2019,"For most people, I'd say it's a more of an 8 or 7 stars, but I'm completely biased. I grew up reading mangas and Gunnm was definitely in my top 3 ever. As a kid I would have never hoped to see a big screen adaptation. When I heard it was a project a few years back, I was cautiously optimistic since we are in an age of very well done CGI. I am now be able to say this is to date the absolute best Live action adaptation of a manga and a visual delight.
Yes there are a lot of cliches, yes some of the dialogue is clunky but considering the overall atmosphere of the movie, it is not that big of an issue. If you like entertaining, big spectacle action sci-fi (think Pacific Rim or Ready Player One) then you are sure to like Alita. If you're a fan of the original material, I highly recommend going as soon as possible and experience it in the most grandiose way you can (I am so happy I spent the $$ on IMAX 3D for this movie)!

The story is average nothing new or appealing. Big attraction is of huge robots, their games and fights with Alita. This is the main highlighted part for which one can must watch this science fiction thriller. Sets, camera work and fight sequences are brilliant. Worth to watch in theatre and 3D only for great experience. However story does not end here and we will have to watch another sequel which is indefinite to date. Impact of James Cameron (writer) is clearly seen all over the movie even it is directed by Robert Rodriguez. Story is easy to understand. Transformation of little Alita into full grown Alita is mark of perfect work. Costume, CGI works also having good job. Rosa Salazar did best acting for Alita with loveable emotion and kickass fights. Another impressive role done by Mahershala Ali (Vector). Must watchable for action lovers though thrill is lesser here.",Alita - Battle Angel
95,blott2319-1,Needed something less not something more,6,26 June 2020,"I feel like any discussion of Alita: Battle Angel has to begin with the elephant in the room, because that's what kept me away from going to see this movie in the theater. I simply can't comprehend the logic that led Robert Rodriguez and his team to use the big anime eyes. But it goes beyond the eyes! It's the fact that they decided to render the entire main character in a computer, when they could have used the actual actress in many of the shots. This would have humanized the film more, and stopped it from falling deep into the uncanny valley. They did the same with many of the other cyborgs in the film, and it takes something away from their relatability because they so clearly lack humanity. It is easily the worst decision of the film, and it constantly took me out of it when I'd see these cartoon-like characters juxtaposed with the real actors. Although, I will say that I'm not sure how much better it would have been if they did a live performance, only because Rosa Salazar doesn't exactly strike me as a great actress. Likewise, Keean Johnson who played her love interest in the film, is almost more robotic than the cyborgs.When you take away some of the visual flaws in Alita: Battle Angel, I think there's a decent story underlying it all. I can't say that it is all that original, because I've seen my fair share of stories with the exact same beats, but it has strong elements that have been recycled over the years for a reason. I'm always compelled to care about a father who has lost his daughter and seeks to form a similar bond with his new creation. I like the idea of an underdog story about a girl who seeks to make a name for herself and possibly overthrow the evil people in authority. I also appreciated that they didn't make the entire movie about Alita questioning her humanity, and the struggle for cyborgs to fit in with the rest of society. Instead, this entire film is set in a world where having cybernetic parts is perfectly normal, and it doesn't matter if you are 90% made of machinery. There were some impressive action sequences (even if they were all rendered in a computer) and I liked how Alita often took down people 5 times her size. Her first big action sequence is extremely satisfying.There was also a lot to like in the world they created for Alita: Battle Angel. It had a lived-in feel to it, and I appreciated that they thought through many of the finer aspects of how life worked in that world. I only wish that they didn't feel the need to keep telling us how the world works. There is so much tedious exposition in this film that I started to think the only reason they made Alita an amnesiac was so they could keep explaining things to her. So much of this information we could have understood without them walking us through the details. My biggest problem with the plot of the film (aside from all the breaks in the action to dump exposition) is that they tried to do a bit too much with the story. This felt like they needed to drop at least one layer in order to make the film more palatable. Let's see what all they tried to cram in here: We have the father-daughter story, the fight to reach Elysium (which is what I call it because I can't remember the name they used in this film,) the battle with the bounty hunters, the murderball league, and the romance. It's more than the script could handle, so I felt like we were bouncing around from one place to the next with little to no warning. I still found Alita: Battle Angel to be an OK film, but I feel like it would have been better as a TV series or something where they could have taken time to explore all these things instead of cramming them all into 2 hours.",Alita - Battle Angel

Well, the cinematography is indeed fantastic and the CGI awesome. Great action and characters.The story definitely isn't great and some dialogue corny beyond belief, but...

97,thekarmicnomad,Feels a bit childish - but quite violent,6,20 May 2020,"The first third of this movie is really good.
Alita is a very interesting character and the world is fascinating and there is a lot going on.Then there is some action and some romance, which is all pretty good.But then it starts to feel like a fairy-tale.The heroine has to, join a club to get some money to win a race to get to a place to fight the bad guy.
For this she needs to find a magic suit - which she does.
Also she needs some magic shoes - which she gets.
Now she just needs to kick everyone's butt - which she doesNow, this is pretty good fun -if that is your sort of thing- the action scenes are very well done and pulsating with energy.
A lot of the bad guys are half human/half robot. So expect robotic appendages to be savagely cut or ripped off, sometimes resulting in the death of the owner.
But after watching Alita beat everyone up for about the fifth time I started to get a bit bored with it.Apart from Alita I didn't care too much about the other characters and the world they live in makes less sense the longer it goes on.
Alita's family is apparently in danger but the villain, despite having seemingly ultimate power, can't actually do anything to them because of.... well I'm not really sure.Then the film just stops with no ending just a wink towards a sequel",Alita - Battle Angel

99,rockman182,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),7,14 February 2019,"When I first saw the trailer for this a while back, I was kind of critical. It didn't actually grab my interest. Still even today before viewing the film I had my reservations. It felt similar in theme to a lot of new age dystopian film adaptations that we get and the horrors of Mortal Engines flashed before my eyes. I am a fan of both James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez, though this was a mighty ambitious effort for someone like Rodriguez and isn't something that he has done before.The film is about a female cyborg with a human brain who is brought back to life by a doctor. The thing is the cyborg (named Alita) has sparse memory of who she used to be despite the fact that she has an extensive and effective battling capability. She is soon hunted down by foes who realize that her body parts can be vital to them. Alita is played by Rosa Salazar and the film also stars Christoph Waltz, Mahershala Ali, and Jennifer Connelly. The film spent a long time in development hell but I'm glad it was finally brought to life.I actually enjoyed this quite a bit. I think having a CG lead character blend in with regular humans is not just ambitious but could go wrong easily. I think it was done quite well here, and after a while you don't even notice that Alita is different. The fight sequences provide for a good amount of popcorn entertainment, especially if you are watching the film in the cinema in a more special format. Its a really fun action packed film and that alone was worth the watch.I think Salazar and the other actors do well in their parts. The storyline does feel under cooked at times, and often a little muddled trying to explain the higher power of villain and the world up above. The love story, I get it. However, I feel it impinges on the quality of the film at times. There is dialogue in here that is cheesy and moments that are unintentionally funny but I can't expect a full on classic when my expectations were low.When you are nearing the end you just feel like the film is heading towards franchise building with a sequel. I wouldn't have minded the film being a half an hour longer and reaching a finite conclusion. A sequel could be a slippery slope, I just hope that it matches the quality of this film. Overall, story writing, dialogue, and narrative content could have been improved but the action, CG, and fight sequences are top notch. Pleasantly surprised. I will give the film a re-watch in the future as I think its one that can reach the 8/10 rating with a little more thought.7.5/10",Alita - Battle Angel
100,jon.h.ochiai,"Reinvent Life in ""Alita: Battle Angel""",10,19 February 2019,"It's Earth 2563. In the aftermath of the apocalyptic War, resurrected wide eyed cyborg Alita, embodied by youthfully resilient Rosa Salazar, woefully tells kind human friend Hugo, played by spirited Keean Johnson, ""I'm just an insignificant girl."" Yet, from her simple origin, the Hero arises in Producer James Cameron and Director Robert Rodriguez's futuristic ""Alita: Battle Angel"". The screenplay by James, Robert and Laeta Kalegridis is based upon creator Yukito Kishiro's popular Manga ""Gunnm"".Cybernetics surgeon Dr. Dyson Ido, played by sincere Christoph Waltz, recovers the remnants of the young cyborg girl in a city junk heap. Her brain is alive in the cybernetic shell. Ido re-engineers the robotic body of his late daughter Alita, whom tragically died years previously. When this ""Alita"" awakes, she has no memory of who she is. She reinvents her life from zero, along with fatherly Ido.When human Alita died, her distraught Mother Chiren, beautiful icily sullen Jennifer Connelly, left Ido. Revered scientist Chiren becomes the lover of powerful nefarious Vector, played by charismatic Mahershala Ali, who deals in black market cybernetics and runs the Iron City Motorball Games. Motorball is the shiny loud CGI upgrade of roller derby or ""Rollerball"" from that 1975 movie. Deadly contestants race on roller-skates on a treacherous track attempting to push a metal ball into a hole.Elevated above populous industrial Iron City is the sky city Zalem, possessing advanced technology. Perhaps, cyborg Alita is artifact of Zalem technology? Both Ido and Chiren were both born on Zalem, and were banished to Iron City. If Chiren helps Vector prosper in the Motorball Games she can regain access to Zalem. She will be free to return home.The Writers' solemn futuristic narrative turns complicated. In 2563 there is no law enforcement to protect citizen from renegade cyborg. The secret society of Hunter-Warriors, a group of bounty hunters, take down cyborg criminals.
In high-stakes action, Alita discovers her great physical prowess and martial arts skills as she protects Ido from evil cyborg Grewishka, played by capriciously intense Jackie Earle Haley. Alita is the formidable cyborg warrior. Perhaps, her past is remerging?A link to her forgotten past lies in Martian technology from 300 years ago. Yeah, Martian. Alita recovers her symbiotic robotic body. She brings it Ido. Alita maybe be the fiercest, most advanced cyborg warrior in human history. Alita wants ""her body"" back. Ido tells her that the body is just a shell, ""neither good nor bad"". Good or bad is entirely up to Alita.Although 300 years old, Alita has the brain of, the spirit of a teenage girl. She befriends Hugo, vibrant Keean. Hugo is the rogue hustler, who along with his buddies ravages and jacks cybernetic parts to sell to Vector, ruthless Mahershala. Alita and Hugo fall in love. More than the spectacular high octane Motorball Games or the stunning Wu Shu and mixed martial arts smack down of Warrior-Hunters, what captivates is Alita and Hug's poignant love story.In this, James Cameron and Rosa Salazar create subtle movie magic. Rosa's visage of Alita is created on screen using performance capture technology. Rosa is beautiful and looks in real-life like Alita. Yet, the nearly human visage of cyborg Alita is beautiful and wonderfully strange. Alita has the big bright hazel eyes of an Anime character. The hair wisps are cool. Her tears streaming down her cheek touch. She kisses as the youth madly in love. Rosa is amazing.James and Robert's Alita gracefully transforms as the Hero, who bravely says, ""I do not stand by in the presence of evil."" ""Alita"" is about the young woman defining herself, discovering her power within, and falling deeply in love. Alita boldly reinvents her life. Although mostly machine, she is so poignantly human -- becoming greater than she knows herself to be. That makes ""Alita: Battle Angel"" something truly special.",Alita - Battle Angel
101,phanthinga,Hollywood you mofo finally did it,10,17 February 2019,"As long as I can remember Hollywood live action movie adaptation from anime, manga usually a sore to the eyes of fan around the world when most of the time the source material being butchered beyond redemption while in Japan live action movie that stick to the roots prove to be successful with title like: Gintama, I Am A Hero, Inuyashiki, Bleach...... just to name a few but because most of them appear to Japanese people only with limited overseas release so I'm very happy to say that Alita: Battle Angel is the best live action movie adaptation from a manga right now both on the budget and the quality. Robert Rodriguez got a quite rocky relationship with movie that heavy on the special effects in the past so it more amazing to see that Alita is the most anime-looking movie I've have ever seen since Scott Pilgrim vs the World and that just only the beginning. I love Alita as a character in the manga and in live action form even though her big eyes creep the hell out of me when I see it for the first time and I especially love how the live action movie actually make me care about Hugo and dedicate the whole movie to develop their relationship to the fullest. For the general audience Alita maybe just another big budget popcorn movie but for the fan of the series and fan of anime, manga like me the movie is a big milestone for the future live action movie from Hollywood",Alita - Battle Angel
102,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Probably one of the best anime live-action adaptations to date.,8,14 March 2019,"With the plethora of successes that the comic book movie has seen over the last decade, it's a little disheartening to see the Japanese equivalent fail to make much headway. There are just as many interesting and action-packed stories from manga and anime that deserve the treatment given to comic book movies. Instead, busts like Dragonball: Evolution (2009) and Ghost in the Shell (2017) have shown that live-action adaptations are challenging, especially when there's already an animated counterpart. This was why I was excited to see Alita: Battle Angel (2019).While many manga/anime film adaptations fail to grasp the feel of the source material, Alita appeared to be a passion project for James Cameron. The fact that Robert Rodriguez directed this movie helped as well, considering how well he brought the graphic novel Sin City to the screen in 2005. Of course, he also directed Spy Kids (2001), which was colorful and full of fun action. In the end, I found Alita to be somewhat of a mix between the two. It had the brutality and violence from Sin City, mixed with the fun cyberpunk aesthetic and action from Spy Kids. The fact that it works at all is a testament to the creative team behind it.To sum up Alita: Battle Angel in one word, it's ""dense."" Almost every scene is paced at a quick clip and doesn't spend too much time dwelling on any one topic. This allows it to cover a lot of ground that's probably condensed down from a few volumes of the manga. It's great that the story unravels so quickly, but some of the emotional beats aren't prolonged enough for the audience to develop a connection. I did appreciate that it wrapped up most of its loose ends, but I hope it does well so we can see the clearly intended sequel.Probably one of the best anime live-action adaptations to date, I give Alita: Battle Angel 4.0 stars out of 5.",Alita - Battle Angel
103,khanbaliq2,"Alita: Battle Angel is a great action-adventure film, featuring a solid cast, a strong female lead, and a story that is complete on its own.",8,29 March 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel (2019) turned out to be a little better than I expected. Well, in some ways, it's about as good as I expected it to be and, in other ways, it's a little better. There's nothing fantastic about it, but it's not a bad way to spend two hours because it's a good film. Some of the CGI I liked, especially views of Iron City and Zalem, and some of the CGI I didn't really like. Alita herself, partly a CGI creation, wasn't unpalatable, which is something that's important in this film. So, it wasn't a bad decision for me to go and see this film. I think that I should have gone to see Aquaman (2018) in a theater because it turned out to be better than I thought it would be. I can say that the director, James Wan, delivered with this film. There's nothing great about it, it's actually average overall, but it has some nice bits and it's entertaining. I think that, in this particular case, I should have listened to Grace Randolph.I can point out that when I make posts on my blog about the films that I see, this doesn't mean that I recommend these films. These are simply films that I've recently seen. But, since I usually see films because I want to see them, I would recommend seeing almost all of them. I know that many Hollywood films feature American propaganda, but this doesn't stop me from seeing them and enjoying some of them. Since I've been sick for the last few weeks, and since I can't wear my glasses for now, I've been spending my time on watching films, and I've seen a number of films that I can really recommend. The one film that I've seen not long ago that I would definitely not recommend is The Predator (2018). It's just a bad and vile film. But here are examples of films that I would recommend. Most of them are old Hollywood films because there's no point in spending time and money on seeing new Hollywood films. New Hollywood films are just not good if they're compared to old Hollywood films. The Hindenburg (1975) features good special effects and is definitely worth seeing. The Raid (1954) is a neat Western set during the American Civil War. Young Winston (1972) is a classy adventure about Winston Churchill in his youth. Nightfall (1957) is a good film noir in black and white. The Miracle Worker (1962) features some of the best acting by actresses in the 1960s. Crimes of the Heart (1986) is a good southern gothic film that features good performances from the leads. The Morning After (1986) includes one of the best performances by Jane Fonda. 'night, Mother (1986) is an interesting drama with only two roles. Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974) is simply essential viewing, and it features an excellent performance by Ellen Burstyn. Forever Young (1992) is one of those neat little romantic science fiction films from the 1990s. The Fly (1986) is just plain awesome. Bachelor Party (1984) is a surprisingly funny comedy from the 1980s. The White Buffalo (1977) is a Western that features Charles Bronson and... a big white buffalo. Nuff said. Assassination (1987) is another unintentionally funny and enjoyable piece of action junk from Cannon Films. Tough Guys (1986) is a pleasant and somewhat moving comedy. Coma (1978) is an excellent suspense film that was directed by Michael Crichton, of Jurassic Park fame. Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954) is an impressive epic in which Victor Mature ""acts"". It's set in Rome and features gladiator fights. Avenging Force (1986) is yet more action junk from Cannon Films in which Michael Dudikoff delivers yet again in the leading role. April Fool's Day (1986) is quite a good mystery slasher film that was filmed in British Columbia. Death Wish 3 (1985) features Charles Bronson talking about killing bad guys, with a wicked little smirk on his face. Death Wish 3, by the way, is one of those 1980s flicks, like RoboCop (1987), that show the decay and economic depression that took place in the USA in those years. American Dreamer (1984) and Bad Medicine (1985) are two funny comedies from the 1980s that I would definitely recommend seeing. Agnes of God (1985) is worth seeing simply because of the excellent performances by Anne Bancroft and Jane Fonda. A Soldier's Story (1984) is a fantastic drama, and I can't believe that I've never heard about it before I saw it. Country (1984) is yet another fantastic drama that has been forgotten in the mainstream. Well, anyway, I can go on and on with this list, but these are some of the most memorable films that I've seen in recent months.",Alita - Battle Angel
104,RforFilm,"While the story can get lost in it's giant world, Alita: Battle Angel does showcase impressive effects and action scenes",6,21 February 2019,"You have to appreciate movies like today's that are willing to take a big budgeted risk, especially if it's mostly original. Its not surprise that most studios tend to put more focus on established franchises...and I don't blame them. In the Hollywood system of actors and storytelling, it's still a business and they have to put as much focus there as well. One of the reasons we don't get too many original blockbusters is that more recent attempts have not done well. Is it because the movies aren't good? Likely. Is it because their not an established franchise? Maybe, but there's more to that.Today's movie is based off of an Japanese manga, but those have not had a good track record when it comes to appealing a mainstream audience. Ghost in the Shell and Dragonball Z have large American fanbases, but their movies didn't do that well. This is where a lot of analysts tend miss the mark; it's hard to predict an audiences tastes. Sure, a trend might make it easier, but I believe that people don't know what they want until they see it. Will people be interested enough about Alita: Battle Angel to make it a franchise? Let's see.In a post apocalyptic world after a large war, 2563 shows a mega city living under another one that's said to be nearly impossible to get to. Whatever the top city doesn't want, is disposed of in a large junkyard within Iron City. While looking for anything, Dr. Dyson (Played by Christoph Waltz) finds a broken female cyborg with a brain that's still functional. He takes it back to his lab, where he's made a business making robot limbs and repairs. He manages to repair the cyborg, wake her up and name her Alita, after his deceased daughter.Alita seems to have no memory of her previous life, but is just as curious as any teenage girl. She makes friends with Hugo (played by Keean Johnson) who shows her the ropes of a popular sport, motarball. While learning more about society and the city, she uncovers Dr. Dyson as a hunter-warrior. She too decides to become a hunter-warrior when marital arts and weapons skills suddenly emerge. Along for the journey is motorball elite Vector (played by Mahershala Ali), Dr. Dyson's ex-wife Chiren (Played by Jennifer Connelly) and more cyborgs that make Alita question herself, her peers and the state of society.It's clear that Alita: Battle Angel really wants to build a world where an audience can escape to (this is where producer James Cameron's fingerprints can be identified). For the most part, the movie does look really good. The design allows a lot of cyberpunk to be implemented, especially on Alita, who may be the first ""live action anime"" character. You'd think her big eyes would be a distraction, but I found myself forgetting about that and getting into her character and story. Rosa Salazar adds a lot of sweetness with a determined spirit that makes you root for her.Most of the side characters work too. Christoph Waltz shows a lot of pain as a man whose looking to regain an entire life. Mahershala Ali has the presence of an experienced businessman who has every right to be arrogant. Though Keen Johnson can seem a bit on the ""Hollywood hunk"" side, he does fine enough as well. You understand why he would be drawn to Alita, acting both as a parent and as a love interest. Everyone seems to have the right motivation to get the story going.What about the story? While I said the movie was designed well, it's writing is not as clean. This also wants to be a franchise so bad, that a lot of time is spent on world building. This can work, like Black Panther or Mad Max: Fury Road which blends exposition and story without much flaw. Alita: Battle Angel tries to get through a lot of story. It requires your attention if you want to have a full understanding. On one scene, were focusing on hunter-killers, then it's all about the motorball sport, and then it's about her finding her past, or it may be about the various gangs that roam Iron City.I'll give this six Alita mangas out of ten. I did have fun watching parts of it, but I did also find myself tuning out when the story switches gears. While an average Joe could still watch and enjoy, this is something that I doubt a lot of people are going to connect with. If your into cyberpunk and science fiction, you'll probably find a lot to enjoy from this. I doubt I'll be playing along for the maybe sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel
105,Holt344,"With stunning visuals and fantastic action, Alita: Battle Angel is an astonishing and entertaining sci-fi film - My Ultimate Review",10,10 October 2021,"Alita: Battle Angel is a cyberpunk-action film that is epic in scale, it's directed by Robert Rodriguez and produced by James Cameron and written by him and Laeta Kalogridis. The film is based on the manga with the same name. Having two big names behind Battle Angel, James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez, you know that you're in for a treat. They have made a brilliant sci-fi film, but it has a couple of minor flaws but nothing too big, so you can still enjoy the movie from start to finish and thus having a great time. Rosa Salazar stars through performance-capture animation as Alita whilst Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein, Jackie Earle Haley and Keean Johnson star in supporting roles. The acting performances are overall pretty good, Rosa Salazar shines throughout the entire movie, making the character her own and making her more relatable and likable. It's just a great and memorable performance. I didn't expect Alita to be such a well written character, she was kind of like Wonder Woman in a positive way. The film is about: Alita whom after being found by the mysterious Dr. Ido while searching for cyborg parts, Ido fixes her up and she then awakens in a new body with no memory of her past and sets out to uncover her destiny.Alita: Battle Angel was in development hell for quite some time and it's understandable, it isn't easy to adapt to the big screen but James Cameron, Robert Rodriguez and the other producers believed in the project and thus making the world so big and have an outline for a franchise done. Having now watched the film, I really hope they get the opportunity to make a couple of sequels because of how interesting the world is and the cast they got for the film. There's so many great and likeable characters. For someone who got recommended the film and almost walking in completely blind, I was surprised in how well made it was. Superb visual effects and the world building was insane, they really nailed the world both visually and in the script. Regarding the screenplay, it was one of the things the critics criticized and honestly I didn't really find the writing to be that bad. The romantic subplot was cheesy and deserves criticism but the rest was good. I also found Keean Johnson's performance as Hugo to be less than alright at times, but was mostly decent. The musical score was done by Tom Holkenborg and what a touching and epic score. Sound design was also phenoelo. Bill Pope served as the cinematographer, you might recognize him from the Matrix movies as an example and I've only good things to say about the camera work and cinematography of this film.For being mostly CGI in the action sequences, they're actually very well choreographed and flows so well with the editing and choice of music. I'm often very critical in how they choose to shoot the action sequences, for this film they nailed it 100%. Incredible action throughout the film and are one of the highlights. The bar fight being my favorite, I don't know how much were practical there but I think quite a lot. Let's talk about motorball, it was like the only thing I remember from the trailer and was it good? Short answer, yes. Long answer is though I liked it, I think it's more towards the younger audience and that's alright. There's something for everyone, young and old. Like how the tone can shift fantastically from light to dark, depending on what's happening. The director nailed that.Alita: Battle Angel is a sci-fi that you would never think would be epic, but it is. James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez had the right vision for what the film would be and they executed it perfectly, creating a visual masterpiece. Though a flawed masterpiece, it's truly an entertaining film worth coming back to.",Alita - Battle Angel

108,bankofmarquis,"Good visuals, not much else to recommend it",6,20 February 2019,"A few of my loyal readers recommended that I check out ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL in the biggest screen I could find, and in 3D. And...I'm glad I did for this film is a visual feast for the eyes, filled with eye-popping CGI and an interesting futuristic world on which the events of the film take place.Unfortunately...that is all that there is to this film, for the rest of the movie does not live up to the fantastical elements laid forth visually.Adapted to the screen from filmmakers James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez, ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL is a combination of the first 4 of Yukito Kishiro's series of 9 manga books, and (hopefully) the first in a trilogy of films that follows a robot, Alita, who is put back together by the mysterious Dr. Ido. When she awakens, she does not know what her past was, but as events transpire, it soon becomes apparent that Alita is much more than the sweet, young girl robot that her outward appearance would suggest.Rosa Salazar is winning enough as the completely CGI creation of Alita, but no so charismatic that she can carry the film on her own, she will need help - and that's where this film falls down. Christoph Waltz is mediocre in the underwritten part of Dr. Ido. Instead of being interesting and mysterious, he is bland and boring. I'm beginning to think that Waltz needs the words of Quentin Tarantino to shine (because he does shine in Tarantino films) but is just so-so when speaking someone else's lines. Jennifer Connelly is wasted as Ido's ex-wife, somehow connected to the power elite of the Universe and Marashala Ali (who will soon win his 2nd Oscar) is completely shutdown and ""one-note"" as the big bad guy. Ed Skrein, Jackie Earle Haley (completely unrecognizable in voice or character as the CGI bad guy Grewishka) and Keean Johnson are all very forgettable as others in this world. Only Jeff Fahey (as a robot-Cowboy bounty hunter) is able to jump off the screen with what is the beginnings of an interesting character.The battles, races, action and plot twists and turns are all ""standard issue"", pretty predictable and unsurprising. It is clear that Cameron and Rodriguez were so focused on the CGI and world building that they did not spend enough time on the plot, dialogue or pacing. And that's too bad, for besides the impressive visuals and graphics (and they are impressive), there is not much else to recommend from this film.Letter Grade: B- (for the visuals)6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Alita - Battle Angel

110,joebloggscity,Battle Angel - So much good to say but stronger storyline was needed,5,17 May 2020,"This should have had so much more going for it. From the get go to the off, the whole production has been blessed with having some key sponsors working on it. James Cameron, Robert Rodriguez, Christoph Waltz and some major manga figures.Yet for all the key ingredients it has, it really doesn't sum up to all its parts which is unfortunate as it is a good film.Clearly taking some influence from Ghost in the Shell, we have our female cyborg lead trying decipher who she is in an amoral futuristic world. You can't fault the actors, and Rosa Salazar as the lead is fabulous as is Christophe Waltz. Although I think Jennifer Connelly was underused.The look of the film is sumptuous, and the action scenes are explosive and thrilling.The problem is the storyline! It seems to compromise too much to satisfy a wish to not alienate a wider audience by not being too cerebral, but by doing so it ends up creating more problems for itself. The courage to push the storyline a notch or two up the ladder would have made this all so much more engrossing.There is a lot of good to say but it's the lack of faith in its subject is what hampered it. I hope they make a sequel as there is so much more to say & do for the character, but next time the writers & directors much allow it to mature more. Fine but ultimately disappointing film.",Alita - Battle Angel

I can say however, that the film looks stunning in 2d.Alita (Rosa Salazar) is a female cyborg head and torso that is brought back to life by Dr Ido (Christopher Waltz). She has no memory of her past life as she seeks a new life on earth in 2563. Whilst the visuals are fantastic there isn't anything fantastic in the story which isn't very original. You do feel a sense of empathy with many of the characters though, so the film is a pretty entertaining ride.

Not remembering anything about her past, Alita begins a quest of self-discovery accompanied by a boy her age who introduces her into the world of Motorball.It's a movie with a great premise, that of a girl with a particular set of skills who tries to remember who she was, which manages to keeps the viewer interested throughout its entire length. It's story is complex, well developed and implemented, being able to generate plenty of drama, emotion and suspense. But, what mostly impresses about this one is the action it creates, the battle moves and sequences which are simply incredible. It manages to be so impressive into this department that it makes your eyes water. The characters presented are also well thought, well played by their brilliant actors and also very well put into play.The visuals are also pretty impressive. Alita's CGI-ed character is wonderful, very well represented and very credible, being the center of the picture from one end to the other. As said before, the action part is very well represented with every single chance it gets while the dystopian world is presented in detail. It simply looks astonishing and this aspect contributes decisively to the overall outcome of the film.There isn't much to say about such a great movie which left such a good impression. There's little to dislike about it and judging by the way it was able to present its story and especially its action, the flaws are easily forgivable. It's a movie which generates a lot of emotion and the unique atmosphere it depicts are able to generate a wonderful sensation.

This could have gone against the film but I'll say here and now that it won't.In fact as I said at the very start of this review there are not many films I'll watch more than once but I'm definitely going to watch this again, there is just so much going on to see the first time around.Ok silly story which is obvious but the way it's told through the action, acting and most of all the gob smacking special effects!One definitely to go and spent your entrance fee on.Rating 9 out of 10",Alita - Battle Angel
114,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"With a compelling female protagonist, strong visuals, and great action, Alita: Battle Angel does not stand by in the presence of evil!",8,11 April 2020,"In a post-apocalyptic future, a female cyborg who lost all of her memories is found by Dr. Ido, a cybernetics doctor in the scrapyard who rebuilds and takes care of her before giving her a name Alita. Upon fighting a bunch of deadly half-robot half-humans, however, she realizes that she used a fighting technique known as the Panzer Kunst which triggers her memories whenever she goes into combat. Determined, Alita must fight against common enemies including Zapan and Vector in order to discover her true origins.After the manga Gunnm (also known as Battle Angel Alita in English) debuted in 1990, there were plans for a movie adaptation that was supposed to be directed by James Cameron (director of Terminator and Avatar), but the film went into development hell. After the success of Avatar, he left his directing duties to Robert Rodriguez (director of the Mexico trilogy, the Spy Kids trilogy, and the two Sin City films), but contributed to the screenwriting of the film. And thus the film came out in February 2019 to mixed to positive reviews (with praise towards Rosa Salazar's performance, action sequences, and the visuals and criticism towards the screenplay) and earned 404 million worldwide.Now, I only heard of the manga this movie was based on and didn't see the movie until a few months later during the summer of that year. To my surprise, it became a really good movie. Yes, it's not perfect and it's not without some problems, but out of all the live action adaptations that have been either downright terrible (Dragonball: Evolution and Death Note) or just disappointing (Fullmetal Alchemist), this film does respect the source material. It's what also got me into reading the manga what John Carter did when that film got me into reading the Edgar Rice Burroughs book series.Before I give this film some praise, like I said before, there are some problems that need to be addressed. Those who read the manga might be disappointed at some of the important details they've changed although the movie did respect the themes really well. And also, it left the door wide open for a sequel (which is probably unlikely due to Disney buying 20th Century Fox).That being said, the rest of the film is still good. The acting from everyone involved is superb. Rosa Salazar gives a lot of heart and humanity to her role as the title character and her determination to restore her memories of her true origins while fighting for justice makes for a really compelling female protagonist. Christoph Waltz also does a good job as Dr. Ido, a cybernetics doctor who also has some great scenes he shares with Rosa. Other actors including Ed Skrein, Mahershala Ali, and Jennifer Connelly also did good in their roles.The visual effects done by cinematographer Bill Pope are strong and beautiful and while the motion capture of Alita became a bit distracting, it blended really well throughout the rest of the film. The action sequences are not only intense, but are some of the best I've seen in a film that came out in 2019 so far the best being the Motorball sequence and whenever Alita goes into combat. And last but not least, the music score from Tom Holkenborg (also known as Junkie XL). He does a superb job by providing a mixture of colorful orchestra and electronics along with a beautiful main theme for the title character, thus creating a satisfying musical narrative.Overall, Alita Battle Angel may not be a perfect film and it's a shame we won't be getting a sequel anytime soon, but it's a well done adaptation that respects the source material and to those who haven't seen it yet, check it out. :)",Alita - Battle Angel
115,AngelHonesty,Crazy Good!,9,21 December 2019,"I find most si fi movies over do the CGI, but this one, was very good! It had the perfect amount of action scenes, mixed with a great stoyline, and some comedic relief when needed! This film was very well balanced, entertaining and well done.",Alita - Battle Angel
116,silvermistvio,Fantastic film. Totally cool.,10,7 July 2019,"When I watched this film, I didn't have high hope. I just thought it was just a fine film, it wouldn't have any difference. Moreover, I thought it wasn't that good. But I was totally wrong. After I watched this film, I realised that this is an absolutely brilliant film.I'm no fan of robot related films. To be honest, I don't even watch robot films. I know that this film isn't completely robot film, it's cyborg (half human, half robot) film. Cyborg films are a bit different from those robot films, but I could watch it.What I don't understand is that Alita's robot body still need to eat foods? I mean body has become robot and the system has been changed to robot. So, how the hell does that system digest foods? I'm sort of confused by that.I don't really like that they let Hugo died. I really hope that he's still alive. The scene where he died is really so sad. I even cried. And I love Alita's eyes. It's so big and so cute. And also I don't like the fact that Alita didn't try to protect Hugo. I really want her to try and protect him at all cost. But she didn't. I was a little bit disappointed. 😒Although this film is great, it doesn't have an end. The film could continue and they should've continued. But they stopped. So, I guess there would be sequel. If there is, I really want them to make. I really want to see how Alita deals with Nova.To conclude this review, this film is so cool. The story is brilliant and it's visually stunning. I don't know about other people, as for me, I really enjoyed it and I love it.",Alita - Battle Angel
117,witster18,Let's not all get our panties in a bunch.,6,13 August 2019,"Alita is an entertaining little sci-fi yarn, but no more entertaining, or complex, or groundbreaking than say, Transformers. I get it. The fresh new, part tekkon-kinkreet anime' clothes, and a female heroine(Luc Besson girl power style), DO spice things up just a notch, and there's plenty of surprisingly good fx/production-value, but this story and script is pretty bland. I'm left with little to no emotional value. Not even some star power actors can really add anything to this story. Even some much lower-rated films like ""Real Steel"" and ""A.I."" Capture this viewers attention and heart a bit more than this. Speaking of the afore-mentioned anime' - a film like ""Tekkon Kinkreet(tekkonkinkurito)"" is a completely overlooked gem that,imo, blows something like this out of the water, visually ANd emotionally.All that said.This IS an entertaining action film with mostly well-fashioned CGi, and certainly deserves another viewing. BUT, to see it hovering near the 8.0 mark is a bit of an anomaly. If it doesn't settle at or near A.I., around 7.0, I'd be a little disgruntled-with the voters, but as time goes by, it IS becoming readily apparent that ""entertainment value"", even when it lacks emotional punch, is the new measuring stick for ""good"" films on this medium. Maybe that's disappointing me worse than the film did - but I digress.63/100You'll like this If you liked: Real Steel(about even or ever so slightly below), Chappie(better), tekkon Kinkreet(much better), Solo A Star Wars Story(slightly better or even), Snowpiercer(slightly better ir even).",Alita - Battle Angel
118,Snootz,"Great CGI, lousy story presentation",4,2 November 2019,"With almost 2,500 reviews a this time, this movie probably doesn't need another. But here it is nonetheless.The review-camp breaks down into two groups: those who demand good cinema (and thus like me, rated this movie poorly), and those who ""Oh wow look at the CGI and special effects and fighting and action and just oh wow""... who awarded this 10 stars and proclaimed it the best. movie. ever.I grieve for the cinematic world.This movie does indeed have all the CGI and special effects one could ask for. If you're willing to shove story, directing and ""makes sense"" down the tubes and are just looking for an adrenaline rush, this should fill the time slot.If you're looking for content, rational plot explanation, or anything other than a Transformers-class heavy-action film, you will likely be disappointed. If a movie having an actual ending is important to the viewer, the viewer is instead going to find him/herself slamming into a plot brick wall with the assurance that your money will be welcome at the sequel presentation.This film sucks all the personality, psychology and philosophy from the story line and throws it in the dumpster, instead going for the ""total thrill ride"" concept that has so many gamer-pumped fanboys drooling. But it's as mindless as a first-person shooter and lame as Howard the Duck. Okay, not quite Howard the Duck lame, but it could have been much better had it presented an actual story and 3-dimensional characters.For 200 million dollars, one would hope for better writing and directing.",Alita - Battle Angel

120,kjproulx,"Visually Stunning, But Not Flawless",7,13 February 2019,"Not being a huge fan of novels known as Manga, I've always appreciated the stories they've created in the form of movies of television. Not knowing anything about Alita: Battle Angel prior to watching this film, I was eagerly awaiting this look at a futuristic world and with the talent in front of and behind the camera, I feel a lot of people should have been feeling the same way. While this movies groundbreaking in many ways, I would say the story itself, as well as the side plots, are not. There's a lot to like about Alita: Battle Angel, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Let's dive into one of Hollywood's latest releases.Cyborg pieces are found in a scrapyard by Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) and assembled to form Alita (Rosa Salazar). Now revived and not sure where she came from or what secrets her past hold, she sets out on a mission to find herself, becoming a warrior in the process. The story of someone not knowing who they are, only to become a noble hero, has been told many times throughout many mediums, but it always feels special when it's accompanied by great a great lead performance and visuals that are truly out of this world.Not only are the visuals the standout of this film, but the real sets feel lived-in as if they found an actual place in the world that looked like this and started filming. Putting the set pieces aside for a moment, this truly is a film to see on the big screen for the visuals alone. From the impeccable look of Alita herself to the broad scope of this world and what else may be out there, this movie is epic in every way. Sadly, the epic scale, brilliant visuals, and engaging action sequences are slightly bogged down by exposition.Written by James Cameron, Late Kalogridis, and Robert Rodriguez (who also directed the film), I would be remised if I didn't comment on the fact that there are a few scenes that feature some fairly cheesy dialogue and some on-the-nose explanations, which felt a little out of touch, given the talent on board. To add to that, I was able to buy into the romantic arc throughout the film, involving Alita and Hugo (Keean Johnson), but where their story ended up kind of annoyed me. That being said, I thought the positive aspects of this film far outweighed the negatives and I would actually see another instalment.In the end, yes, Alita: Battle Angel does feel like a set-up for future instalments in more ways than one, but this is a self-contained story. The visuals are some of the best I've ever seen and the performance capture is absolutely a step towards perfection. The score itself actually stood out to me, which is rare these days and I found myself engaged, simply due to the music. On a technical level, this movie is a near masterpiece, but there are a few too many issues in the overall story to really call it a brilliant movie. Alita: Battle Angel is a fun time at the movies and I feel that a recommendation is warranted here.",Alita - Battle Angel
121,kuarinofu,I wish I could like this so much more,7,14 July 2019,"Alita once again proves that Japanese original novels and manga are not as adaptable as many writers and directors think. Death Note, Dragonball, Ghost in the Shell... and now Alita. It gets even worse when Hollywood tries to re-make movies based on manga, like Oldboy. My mind can't come up with a good adaptation besides Edge of Tomorrow.
The script was horrible. There were so many characters, and I can't say that I understood what any of them were. Alita was changing so fast (mentally and physically) I wasn't able to catch up. I think they were kind of referring to a teenager growing up, but I doubt it. Her knowledge of the world also makes no sense. She knows what the Moon is but doesn't know what chocolate or oranges are. She constantly changes her attitudes, so you're never sure why she's doing what she's doing. Alita doesn't have any motivation up to the end and acts like an obsessive girlfriend most of the time. That is when she isn't acting like a grown-up female revolution leader. Her emotions and motivation are all over the place.
Other characters have nothing interesting going on either. IMO, Waltz was very miscast in his role, and he looks like he has no clue what is going on. I have no idea what was the purpose of Jennifer Connelly's character besides surgery as well. This applies to most of the characters though.
What I'm trying to say is that this re-packaging doesn't work. You can't turn a dystopian future story about a cyborg girl into basic teenage rebel movie of the early 2010s. And if you still bother adding all those storylines at least make them believable and grounded on something. You can't have out of nowhere ""I'd give my heart"" dialogue or unrealistic love from the first glance stories.
Consequently, such a mess of a story can't hold the movie. The first hour is just a set of cliches and expository scenes. They do a couple of obvious baits that will surprise no one and try to introduce as many characters as possible while not giving them anything to do in this movie. Taking into account the sequel bait I'm sure they might find something for them later. There was also some sort of miscommunication between the teams. Hugo often mentions that they live in a dangerous city and that she should trust no one, but the city looks all good shiny most of the time. People are laughing and having fun, not that ""dangerous city"" of people struggling for survival. The city also feels small and limited, everybody know each other and are connected in some way.
I only touched on some of the issues this movie has, just from the top of my head. I should point out though that the 3D artists and crews did an excellent job creating all those action scenes and overall character models. Alita and Zapan looked terrific, it also seems like Zapan was part costume/part CGI, and it was seamless, nicely done. I don't think it needed that many action scenes, though, but they were quite spectacular and not boring. I also love Alita's face expressions and animation, all her emotions are very distinct, and this does a bizarre effect on you.
While being very good in a technical sense, this was still such a mess of story chunks and attempted worldbuilding I can't say I liked it.",Alita - Battle Angel
122,Carycomic,This pushed all the right buttons for me.,10,16 February 2019,"First off, there was the CGI and mo-cap . They were absolutely flawless. The best I've seen since FINAL FANTASY: THE MOVIE!Then, there were the action scenes. Not since the original ROLLER BALL, starring James Caan and John Houseman, have I seen such high-tech gladiatorial fighting.Last, but not least, was the acting. I was, quite literally, moved to tears in all the right dramatic scenes. Rosa Salazar, as Alita, provided just the right balance of innocence and butt-kicking toughness. Christoph Waltz, as Dyson ido, provided the right combination of paternal love and technological brilliance. Jennifer Connelly, as his ex-wife, convincingly counter-balanced that with a mixture of selfish expedience and buried maternal emotion. And Keane Johnson, as Hugo, provided the most tear-jerking performance of all. A street-wise punk discovering true love for the first time in his own (and previously self-centered) life.As a bonus? The ending credits are less than ten minutes long! Something I haven't seen since the mid-1970's!!Long story, short: this movie is well worth your time and money.",Alita - Battle Angel

Alita was awesome.Still can't comprehend why this movie was that underrated. Everything is beautiful and Alita is amazing, such a beautiful girl inside out. This film had some of the best fight choreography I've seen in years also was the best movie released in quite some time. Now, We NEED Alita 2 movie!! After I watched it I just wanted more. Totally a new ride. Alita is a beautiful character. The fights - OH MY - so incredibly good and really stuck close to the Manga - and I was so amazed they didn't change the daring stuff. The animation was unbelievable & amazing. I was just left a bit unsatisfied because I waited the entire movie to see the other city but never did get to I hate ""To-be-continued"" endings! Truly one of the most underrated movies of 2019. It's such a shame that mainstream audiences don't like it. Any way, this movie is way too good for them",Alita - Battle Angel

126,Darkside-Reviewer,Better than expected!,7,8 July 2020,"I've never read the manga series or watched the Anime this movie is based on or even had any interest in seeing this movie until recently when I came across it on Blu Ray in a sale and I thought to myself I might aswell give it a watch while there's nothing new being shown in theatres due to lockdown.I really enjoyed Alita more than I thought I would the story is fairly decent keeping my interest throughout. The action scenes are fast paced and are beautiful to watch especially when there's cyborg limbs being pulled, ripped, teared and sliced off throughout the movie.The CGI looks spectacular throughout the entire movie some effects are better than the CGI used in Avatar although this movie does have an edge over Avatar mainly because CGI has gotten better over the past ten years but also the colours and style used in a Alita is sharper and sleeker than in Avatars.The only problem I had with this movie was it's disappointing ending. Throughout the entire movie it seemed like the plot was building up to an epic final fight that would see Alita fight her way up to Zalem and kill the behind the scenes bad guy Nova but nope instead we get her posing for the movies trailer and posters then the movie just ends which is really disappointing. Other than that the movie is really good and it did really surprise me with it's quality so I may try reading the manga and watching the Anime to see what was meant to happen at the end.I recommend watching this movie if your a fan of CGI/Animated movies especially if you enjoy Anime and manga it's a surprisingly good movie considering it's Hollywood's interpretation of a Japanese manga which history has shown very rarely works.",Alita - Battle Angel

128,anselmdaniel,"Beautiful action, vapid story",8,10 August 2019,"This review contains spoilers.'Alita: Battle Angel' is a cyberpunk action movie that premiered in 2019. The movie is directed by Robert Rodriguez. The movie's screenplay is written by James Cameron and Laeta Kalogridis. The movie's plot is based on Gunnm by Yukito Kishiro. The movie stars Rosa Salazar, Christoph Waltz, and Jennifer Connelly. A female cyborg is found after a large interplanetary war. The movie is about exploring this new post-apocalyptic world.Alita: Battle Angel is an incredibly beautiful movie. Across the 122 minute running time, the audience is treated to beautiful computer generated images. These computer generated scenes are impressive to look at and greatly improve the awe the audience experiences. There is a grand variety of settings the movie explores. It is not always an urban environment. The movie shows the audience the countryside, spaceships, stadiums, and underground areas. The settings were easily the best part of the movie as the production crew spent much of their effort here. This is one of the most enjoyable parts of the movie.The movie's story and characters suffer in this movie. The characters do not have much depth. Even though we spend 122 minutes with them, the only two characters with any depth are Alita and Dr. Dyson Ido. The other characters are given backstories but the execution of it has not been great. The characters simply do actions that they should not be motivated to do. The villains in this movie have many problems. I simply did not care about the story of the villains as there seemed to be unclear motivations other than to present an obstacle to Alita.The movie's action scenes are the best part of this movie and it shows. There is a great variety in the scenes and execution. There is so much that Alita goes through that is both breathtaking to the audience and important for Alita to go through. I was impressed with these action scenes. The motorball sequence was fun to watch and was important to the plot. The fight scenes between Alita and the enemy cyborgs are also impressive.I would recommend 'Alita: Battle Angel.' This movie has many beautiful scenes but a vapid story.Grade: B",Alita - Battle Angel
129,msbreviews,Rating: B+,8,25 February 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I'm writing this review one day after the Oscars night, and I can guarantee at least one thing: Alita: Battle Angel is getting a Best Visual Effects nomination and it's probably going to win. Calling it now. There are no words that can describe how immersive, realistic and groundbreaking the IMAX 3D experience is. Weta Digital is undoubtedly the most incredible VFX/CGI company since the beginning of this millennium. From the Lord of the Rings trilogy to the Avatar movie(s) and through the most famous TV series of this time, Game of Thrones, Peter Jackson's company keeps surpassing the impossible.Alita is a mix of Rosa Salazar's motion-capture performance and CGI animation, and it's the most beautiful thing I've seen in a long time. Visuals are not the most important aspect of a film, they're not even the key technical feature. The story and characters are and always will be the necessary ingredients for a movie's success. That said, I'm also the first to defend that without remarkable technical achievements, a film won't ever go above ""very good."" If you want a movie to be one of the best of the year, a combination of compelling story/characters and great filmmaking attributes is essential. Robert Rodriguez's film nails the latter requirement, but has a lot of hits and misses regarding the former.Like I wrote above, I have no vocabulary to describe how mind-blowing and eyegasmic this movie looks. If you're intrigued by how fascinated I am, you know what to do: buy an IMAX ticket and watch it. The visuals alone compensate for the price of admission. Besides the jaw-dropping VFX, the sound and production design are unbelievable. I could feel every punch, kick or scream like I rarely feel with other high-budget films. The amount of work that went in to build this world is worthy of recognition, and I honestly hope that by the end of this year, Alita is receiving a whole bunch of nominations for its aesthetics.I love how anime-like this feels. I didn't read the original manga, but you will like this movie more if you're a fan of anime. Rodriguez does a seamless job bringing Iron City to life, and there are tons of nods to how anime stories flow, which will surely please fans of said genre. Sadly, the screenplay isn't exactly written as it should be. One of the most emotive moments of the film trusts the audience to buy into the romance displayed on-screen, but since it feels very forced from the get-go, this unnecessary subplot carries too much influence on the end result.In addition to this, James Cameron and his team took a quite questionable decision concerning the main plot, having in mind the marketing surrounding this blockbuster. It's still a minor spoiler, so I can't really delve into details, but I'll write this: the closest the movie gets to its third act, the more worried I became. From the moment the second acts ends, I start realizing something that not a single person working on this film even hinted at. And that was the worst call they could have ever made. Not only it dragged the first half of the movie, but it deeply damaged its narrative.Once you see this film, you'll understand what I'm talking about. You'll get me when I say that the marketing strategy for Alita: Battle Angel ruined its story and it will definitely make a lot of people leave the theater frustrated, just like I did. Hopefully, this was just a misstep that doesn't affect its box office because this is a movie worthy of watching at a movie theater and ONLY at such place. Yes, it does have issues with its storytelling. It has a whole world that doesn't fit in just a 2-hour flick, so the plot becomes convoluted and a bit slow. However, I do think critics are being too harsh ...Alita is one of the most complex, intriguing and well-written characters of the last few years. While the screenplay contains fundamental writing flaws, its main protagonist is flawless. Despite still feeling a bit frustrated, I want to rewatch this movie so bad, just to get another opportunity to follow Alita throughout her journey. I love character-driven narratives, especially when the character in question is such a compelling one. Rosa Salazar delivers an amazing mo-cap performance (The Academy wants a new category? Well, Best Motion-Capture Performance suits your ceremony like a glove). Alita and Salazar share resemblances that can only be achieved with the unique camera-setup and technology that the production team had at their display, which is something pretty outstanding.Christoph Waltz brilliantly portrays Ido, as expected from such a high-caliber actor. Mahershala Ali (Vector) and Jennifer Connelly (Chiren) are underused, but they make their characters work for the story. Keean Johnson is fine as Hugo, but he's connected to one of the film's major issues. Everyone else is pretty great, each performance elevates their respective character, which helps move the plot forward. However, it all goes back to Salazar's remarkable performance and the way she and Alita carried the whole thing to safe harbor. Hollywood, put your eyes on this girl!Finally, the action. Oh my God! The action scenes are some of the most entertaining, riveting and thrilling sequences I've seen since Mission: Impossible - Fallout. While the latter based its action on real jaw-dropping stunts, Alita: Battle Angel probably delivers some of the best animated action ever. The motorball sequences are impossible of getting your eyes off-screen, and the fights that Alita goes through are so well-crafted. Honestly, I'm even scared of how these look in regular 2D. I doubt they feel seamless and flow as perfect as they do in IMAX 3D, so be careful with which choice you make. In my opinion ...Alita: Battle Angel is one of those movies that you HAVE TO watch at a movie theater, especially on IMAX 3D. You will not be able to grasp or feel the astonishingly immersive world that James Cameron produced, nor the powerful sound design. Its visuals effects are groundbreaking, and I promise you've never seen such a mixture of real and animation like this. Beautiful or gorgeous are not adjectives enough to describe the world where Alita lives. It's a visual experience, so do waste your time and money in supporting this film.I can't deny neither its storytelling problems or the damaging marketing surrounding this blockbuster. However, Rosa Salazar's terrific performance and Alita as the protagonist are more than enough reasons to make you feel entertained and captivated until the very end. The action is mind-blowing, and I'm not lying when I state that it contains some of the best animated sequences ever. I left the theater frustrated, but I can't wait to see it again on the big screen. Alita alone deserves that effort.",Alita - Battle Angel

133,MrDHWong,A fun effects-driven spectacle brought down by some unfortunate creative decisions,7,10 February 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel is a sci-fi action film directed by Robert Rodriguez (Sin City, Spy Kids) and produced and co-written by James Cameron. Based on the Japanese manga ""Gunnm"" by Yukito Kishiro, it is a fun effects-driven spectacle brought down by some unfortunate creative decisions.In the year 2563, human society is on the brink of collapse after a huge war known as ""The Fall"" has left a huge wake of devastation. Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz), a highly acclaimed scientist renowned for his work in cybernetics, discovers a deactivated female cyborg (Rosa Salazar) in a junkyard while searching for machine parts. Dr. Ido decides to rebuild the cyborg and name her ""Alita"", after his recently deceased daughter. Upon reactivation, Alita realises she has no memories of her past life and decides to set out into the world to discover her true identity.While it remains one of the better western adaptations of Japanese media, Alita: Battle Angel is still heavily flawed in a number of crucial areas. We do not see enough of the post-war ravaged world to feel like there is enough emotional weight to drive forward Alita's journey of self discovery. In addition to this, and without giving away spoilers, the film ends with an obvious set up for a sequel, and considering the predicted low box office returns, this seems like a bad idea. Also, the 3D added nothing particularly interesting to the overall viewing experience and considering that James Cameron was involved in the making of this movie, this is quite surprising. However, with all that said, the film still has redeeming qualities. For instance, the action scenes were always exciting and well-choreographed, with hardly any ""shaky cam"" used. The CGI effects were convincing as well, especially on Alita's eyes, which seemed less anime-centric and were used more to emphasise her curious personality. Rosa Salazar gives a great performance as Alite, playing her more as a confused child rather than an emotionless robot, and this in turn made her highly likeable. Even though this film may not be the sci-fi masterpiece the filmmakers were likely hoping for, it is still perfectly fine as a popcorn movie for anyone wishing to watch a mostly enjoyable action flick.I rate it 6.5/10",Alita - Battle Angel

The story isn't amazing and it's not quite as emotionally affecting as I would hope, but the actions scenes are terrific and Alita is a compelling character. Mahershala Ali was a great choice as the villain, however he felt underutilized. Say what you will about Robert Rodriguez, but he knows how to film with style. Alita: Battle Angel is definitely worth viewing on the biggest screen you can find.

Rosa Salazar is fantastic as the titular Alita, and once again proves that she deserves more starring roles in Hollywood.

145,sbweightman,"A true technical marvel, but the plot is weak and the dialogue is clunky.",6,9 February 2019,"Everything in this film looks superb, from the excessively detailed cybertronics to the realistically structured setting and city landscape - it truly is a technical marvel, and the attention to detail is astounding. The action scenes are graceful and fluid, the blend of CGI and real actors is seamless, and even the brief venture outside the city is a real treat from the grime of the urban androids.
But the story isn't great - it serves its purpose, and has a good range of characters, but it tries to fit too much in. The dialogue is clunky, the love story is very teenage i.e. ham fisted and lacks subtlety, and the action scenes are too few and far between. The acting is mostly good, especially Alita, although the villains are a bit one dimensional with their corny challenges.
There's obviously been a lot of care and love put into the special effects and presentation, and I definitely want to see more of Alita's story, but it's not as great as it could have been.",Alita - Battle Angel

151,PyroSikTh,"Not Sure What Everyone Else Has Been Smoking, but This Film is Terrible",3,12 February 2019,"Alita is a cyborg picked up from a rubbish dump below a floating city. A well-mannered doctor repairs her, gives her a new body, and she awakens with no memory of who she is and no knowledge of the world around her. I liked this a lot (yes, even a movie as terrible as this can have positives), because it meant the lead character went along with the audience learning about the extravagant world, it's history, and her own identity. We knew as much as she did. Unfortunately where this came apart was in trying to develop a world far too deep and rich for the film's runtime, and without adequately tying it to the core narrative. Exposition dumps felt forced in, and often had little bearing or pay-off.But that was only one part of the film's script problems. The biggest one for me was it trying to combine two separate stories from the original manga. Even when haphazardly combined as they were in the movie, it was plainly obvious that the two stories were not meant to co-exist, and the film makes little effort to actually marry them together. On the one hand we have the story of Alita's awakening in a dark city full of murders, body part theft, and bounty hunters keeping the law. This was actually my favourite narrative of the whole thing, and I wish they'd doubled down on it, not least because it ties into Alita's background and specialisations naturally.The second story they tried to shoe-horn in was a sporting event called Motorball, where cyborgs race around a track destroying each other and the winner is the last one standing or the first to score a goal with the titular motorball. Or at least I think that's how it worked, the rules of the sport were never clearly explained. Beyond being the least interesting part of the whole movie, and really just being there for some additional action sequences, the way they tried to tie it to the overall narrative was cack-handed to say the least. Everyone seems to have their fingers in bounty hunting and the Motorball, be they good guys or bad guys. Alita's love interest seems to have connections to both Alita's doctor, and the organiser (known as Vector) of the Motorball, through providing them with stolen body parts. Okay that works, but Vector is also under the thumb of Nova who seems to have a personal relation to Alita. Vector also works with the doctor's ex-wife who simultaneously works in the lab fixing Nova's criminal workers, and in the Motorball pits fixing up the contenders. If the over-coincidence of everyone knowing everyone else and all running in the same circles wasn't enough, background characters even share these insane connections; a number of bounty hunters also participate in Motorball.And each and every one of these characters seemed to have a ""massive revelation"" about who they really were. Oh my god the doctor's the murderer! Oh no wait he's a bounty hunter! Oh wow he was married to that evil-looking woman who works for Vector! Oh wait she's also at the Motorball! Oh look so's Vector! Of course Hugo knows all of them. Oh and he's the guy stealing body parts, of course. And yes, obviously he has connections at the Motorball arena, who wouldn't. Every ten minutes we were meant to gape at the latest character revelation. By the time Nova takes his glasses off to reveal Edward Norton (and yet not reveal anything else about his character whatsoever), I'd had enough and just wanted to go home.Ultimately the Motorball sequences were pointless. They had no pay-off at all. They did nothing but dilute the film in unnecessary world-building, haphazardly set-up the next film (that won't happen) with a frustrating and anti-climatic cliffhanger, and provide additional action sequences just in case anyone was getting bored with the over-rushed pacing that was trying too hard to squeeze too much in. As a result the film had no breathing room. We had no time to become attached to the characters, and the editing sliced off the ends of important scenes in order to rush through to the next exposition dump. We're at the doctors, now we're at the Motorball, now we're in the streets, now we're in a lab, now we're back at the doctors, now we're on the streets again. Cut. Cut. Cut.And oh my god that ending. Sorry I have to go back to that diabolical ending. The film spends it's runtime rushing through every point because there's so much story, worldbuilding, and background detail to fill in. By the time we get to the credits, the film still hasn't even finished the story. In fact it feels like the entire third act was cut out. The secondary villains have been dealt with, the love interest has tragically died (through stupidity and a complete lack of logic), the main villain's revealed to be Edward Norton, and then we get a timelapse as Alita works her way to becoming Champion and going up to the city to confront her foe and...credits. Yes, that's where the credits are. Right where the film starts to feel like it might start getting interesting, we might get some answers, and we might start to get some payoff from what's been set-up so far.Oh there's so much more, I'm not even done yet. The dialogue is awful, the acting is terrible, the characters are shallow. Rosa Salazar did a decent job with Alita and that cringeworthy dialogue, and Mahershala Ali flits between Vector and Nova effortlessly, but Christoph Waltz and Jennifer Connolly are wasted, Rodriguez favourites Eiza Gonzalez and Jeff Fahey are little more than one-line cameos (Fahey's character was interesting, with cybernetic dogs, while Gonzalez's character was a complete waste of her...natural assets). Jackie Earl Haley was apparently in this movie as well. Keean Johnson needs acting lessons, Ed Skrein was just Francis in a cybernetic body, and Jorge Lendeborg was just as annoying as he was in Bumblebee.On the note of the visual effects, yeah okay, that was pretty decent. Any praise heaped on that is worth it for sure. Alita is almost unrecognisably CGI, with such an incredible amount of attention put into detail, lighting, animation, the whole works. That said, I don't see why she needed to be full-CGI when a simple touch-up on live-action Salazar would probably have sufficed. Her body could easily have been a bodysuit refined in post-production, her hair would've appeared a whole lot more natural, and her signature eyes could easily have been an add-on instead of the whole reason for re-rendering her entire body. Furthermore it would've reduced the uncanny valley feeling she gave off, and married her with her live-action companions much easier. The creation of the city is great; dark and dangerous, without feeling overbearing and unlivable, while the advancements in technology were a sight to behold (like a motorbike with one big wheel, or the city walls being made of pure water, or the numerous amounts of cybernetic enhancements almost everyone seemed to sport).I could go on, but I'm just ranting. I found myself bored and uninterested within the first ten minutes of the movie, but I hoped it would improve as it went along. It didn't. It just got worse, and my sighs got louder. There's too many coincidences, too many plot holes, the romance sub-plot lacked romance, even the action scenes started to feel too hyperstylised and became boring. What's worse is that all that worldbuilding (which for once I might actually say there was too much) never had any payoff. We never get to see even glimpses of this fabled city everyone keeps talking about, the Motorball sidequests were pointless and took up far too much of the running time. Characters have no depth, their motivations make no sense, and every single one of them feels like they're in their own movie separated from everyone else. Key example here being when Alita walks into the bounty hunter bar and is told everyone looks out for themselves and compete for the bounties, to which her response is to immediately attempt a rousing speech to unite everyone against a ""common"" enemy that no-one else has even heard of. Of course it fails and she looks like an idiot. Yeah, they made the titular Battle Angel look like an idiot. I'm sorry, 3/10. It's only February and I feel like I've already seen the worst movie of the year. Do yourself a favour and save your time and money. Watch something else this half term.",Alita - Battle Angel
152,sweidman-28016,A Surprisingly Boring Action Movie,4,11 March 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel Review:Alita: Battle Angel is Robert Rodriguez's new movie based on the manga series Gunnm. It follows a cyborg named Alita (Rosa Salazar) who is revived and can't remember anything from her past. The trailers for this movie didn't look good. I had no interest to see it. Then there was some hype, not a lot, since this is a visual effects movie and James Cameron wrote and produced this movie. I got slightly interested but not much. My boss wanted me to see it for him so I did. This movie wasn't that good but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The plot was kind of interesting but the way it presented didn't do it much justice. Rosa Salazar has the best performance. She did very well with the character. Christopher Waltz did well as Dr. Dyson Ido. His character was interesting to me. Mahershala Ali played Vector and I guess I just liked him because I he's an amazing actor. The rest of the characters were bland and boring. Alita has a love interest with Hugo, played by Keean Johnson, and he was horrible. There was some dramatic scenes with him that I thought were kind of funny. I don't know if it was just the story or the direction. Robert Rodriguez did fine, I think. I think it was more the plot that was the problem. There was so much happening yet it was boring. Some action scenes were fine but I got bored for the 2 hours. There was also a lot happening and I checked my watch. There was like 30 minutes left so it was obvious that they're setting up for some sequels. What never managed to make me feel bored was the visual effects. They were absolutely amazing. They have to be nominated for the Oscars next year. Nothing wasn't just copied and pasted in spots. It was really cool and made it for something interesting to watch. After all this movie really is just for the visual effects and not the story. That's really all to the movie. Not much substance and bland. It wasn't horrible but I probably won't watch it again. I might watch the sequels but we'll see. We'll even see if they make them. The budget for this was $170,000,000 and after 4 weeks it's made $75,000,000. That's a pretty bad flop. If you want to see this, okay. You may like it, may may not.My Grade: C",Alita - Battle Angel

155,ethanbresnett,Unfortunately a lot more corny and uninspiring than I was expecting.,7,7 August 2020,"I'm sad to say that Alita: Battle Angel was a huge let down for me. Not a single character bar Alita captured my imagination or attention. The plot was pretty flat, the dialogue corny, the world bland... all in all not very ground breaking or spectacular.The shining light of the film is of course the CG effects in creating Alita. There were some truly extraordinary uncanny valley moments, with a great deal of humanity and emotion injected into the character. I can't take that away from the film at all, although I do feel that the budget was blown slightly on Alita. There were other elements of the CGI which looked very rusty in comparison, such as with the villain of the piece Grewishka. There was also some less than impressive CG with the world building, and a few of the action sequences could have been cleaner.Despite this the action was fun for the most part. It had good variety, was original to an extent, and was most definitely entertaining. Nothing too much to complain about from the action point of view.The real complaints come with the plot and characters. Having not read the source material I can't attest to the truthfulness of the adaptation, but I did get the sense that there was a grand and epic tale hidden somewhere, which the film failed to tease out. I think they tried to cram too much into a two hour film, resulting in rushed plot elements and empty characters. Its no mean feat making characters played by Oscar winners Christoph Waltz and Mahershala Ali feel bland and one dimensional, but Alita managed it. Ultimately I liked the idea of the world that they were creating, the background, the history, the essence of the characters, but they remained as ideas and weren't translated into well executed concepts.Alita: Battle Angel feels like a B-movie plot with a blockbuster budget. I appreciated what they were trying to do, with good ideas at the core, but these ideas just weren't teased out enough for me. There's still something to be had here for Sci-Fi and fantasy fans, but don't expect too much.",Alita - Battle Angel
156,nikola17,it was pretty good but not greatest movie ever,7,25 February 2019,"After seeing Glass was average, but this movie was alright i got hang of it. it wasn't boring or anything like that or me saying OH it was good movie but not like Terminator or Aliens or from dusk till dawn or Desperado those movies are better then this but this film i enjoyed it. i went to cinema payed 22 dollars for ticket and it was great experience it was very long 2 hour long film like Avatar. and no i didn't focus too much on script because its all about how i enjoyed film and what direction it goes, i didn't expect some things like wasted some actors, it didn't need to be 2 hour long Avatar film what it needed it to be a fast pacing and a simple pacing, this film if you like 2 hour long films that can keep you kick back for awhile for relaxing this is it. The story began to draw me in and I got completely absorbed into the story and the visuals. that's what got me into it. i love Robert Rodriguez biggest fan of From Dusk Till Dawn, Desperado aka the El Mariachi franchise that includes once upon time in Mexico, Sin city, Planet Terror, Machete franchise. great films and James Cameron i loved Terminator 1 & 2 and Aliens, True Lies, not much fan of Avatarbut it's good this is a Robert Rodriguez movie but James Cameron is a producer of this i am like OK this is good combination why not Robert and James can't be director's 2 of them in same movie or a different movie not just Alita. The story is a bit fast paced but not to a degree that it feels rushed it's better if it goes on because sometimes i am sick of movies when it goes for longtime just to get to the point of story. Alita as a character is great, she is kind-hearted, innocent, naive and protective. she is not annoying, she is not girl Throughout the movie Alita grows as a person and learns about sacrifice, loss, love and the horrors of the human mind. Alita is very likeable because she is such a good person in such a horrible world and you can't help feeling very sympathetic for an innocent being like her as she is exposed to the cruel world of Iron City. and cast i didn't like is Ed Skrein known for Transporter Refueled, villain from Deadpool lame villain, him in this movie could cast someone else. i thought Dr. Dyson Ido (Christopher Waltz) who is known for Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained, Blofeld in Spectre his character who is a renowned scientist, Hunter-Warrior and Alita's father-figure, discovers a disembodied female cyborg with a fully intact human brain. Ido rebuilds the cyborg, who does not have any recollections of her past, and names her ""Alita"" (Rosa Salazar) known for American Horror Story: Murder House, The Divergent Series: Insurgent, Maze Runner franchise. after Dyson deceased daughter. witch he did good in movie with his performance Alita made a new friend she liked Hugo
(Keean Johnson) Alita registers herself as a Hunter-Warrior. i thought another cast like Eiza González, Jeff Fahey, Marko Zaror, Michelle Rodriguez Michelle Rodriguez, Casper Van Dien, Jai Courtney i am like what a waste of cast given nothing to do as much most likely i didn't like Ed Skrein character witch i thought he was bad actor, no talented very wooden actor. could of cast Luke goss someone else for British actor. but i loved scene when Alita beats the crap out of him badly. But the romance threw us off a bit. it didn't threw me off it wasn't like Titanic romance but it this has little romance in it threw us off, of crouse it's James Cameron producing every single Cameron movie has little romance in it. this is kinda mix of Ghost of Shell and Ready Player one or i could say it's Absolutely spectacular hero-driven non-Marvel/DC scifi action, the next 5th Element It is really different from Avatar so there is no comparison here. The movie itself is really beautiful, colorful and vivid. The actors performed on real sets not CGI ones and it really shows so I would count acting as really top shelf. but not best i have ever seen i mean their are couple things it could of been better but i would not say it's great movie ever seen but i seen better Rodriguez movies like Desperado and from dusk till dawn. I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Don't easily trust people who only give destructive criticism. Just watch and prove it, judge it on your own opinion because sometimes with movies nowadays is getting awards like Black Panther all others saying it's great movie i am like there are crap they are judging their opinions of movies but they bombed this movie up ? this was good flick i would never say this a bad movie at all, it's bit boring, and it's overtime as well it's bit too long could of cut some scenes out of movie to make it shorter. make it more like battle film not a bounty hunter thing, this movie is worth watching and deserves to be at least nominated for Best Visual Effects witch i liked it was perfectly fine. this deserved a sequel i don't want to give away everything because these days trailers spoil everything for review readers just give movie ago it wasn't that bad at all 7.10 that's all i could say.",Alita - Battle Angel
157,akcenat,Just watchable (animated) teenage SciFi film,7,16 April 2020,"Film ""Alita: Battle Angel"" (Budget of more then $150 million) is an ambitious movie based on manga series, Gunnm. There are some entertaining scenes, but nothing that really stands out to differentiate it from the plenty of similar films. Despite the best efforts and even with solid star power, both in front of (Jennifer Connelly, Christoph Waltz, Jeff Fahey) and behind the camera (directed by Robert Rodriguez and produced by James Cameron) this is a case of style over substance. It pushes some boundaries in terms of content as well as movie experience, yet it is ~10 years late. At the end, it is visually stunning, stylish and enough fun, but ultimately is just not all that memorable. If you enjoy high-tech movies with solid fight scenes and big explosions ""Alita: Battle Angel"" is for you. I wanted more, so for me this was short on plot, little bit too long (124 minutes) and forgettable SCiFI film. It seems and it comes across as a (trial) film made as an opportunity for James Cameron to experiment with new technology ahead of his returning Avatar franchise.Rating: 6+/7-",Alita - Battle Angel
158,stevenrotherforth,Runs very close to 'End Game' for movie of the year.,10,31 July 2019,"Alita Battle AngelI am not a fan or have any knowledge of the Manga series of which this movie is based on.
I viewed this movie without any expectations and I can honestly say this movie more than impressed me.
From a visual standpoint 'Alita' is absolutely stunning.
Performance capture is spellbinding and I have said it before in my reviews.
If film makers can imagine it then they can successfully reproduce their vision onscreen.
We live in a time where CGI is truly amazing.
As a fan of film I will always appreciate story over technological wizardry but when the two can be combined then we as an audience can be transported into a world of make believe like never before.
'Alita Battle Angel' is a marvel of modern cinema.
A film that has reaped not nearly enough praise.
The source material is obviously rich and this transcends on to screen.
A story about a young female cyborg salvaged from a scrapyard in the distant future.
Awakened but with no memory of who or what she is.
A fighting machine from a time of lost technology.Rosa Salazar provides the performance capture for Alita bringing her to life.
She is delicate and innocent. A character that the audience will immediately fall in love with.
But when the moment calls she turns into a deadly foe. Meeting the most fierce of enemy head on.
Action set pieces are a plenty. Wonderfully staged and exciting to behold.
A bar room brawl scene and the Motor-ball sequence being the most thrilling.
Christoph Waltz provides excellent support as the Doctor who finds Alita.
The onscreen chemistry between the two help carry the films more tender moments.
Mahershala Ali plays the villain but is under utilised as is Jennifer Connelly.
Her character could have been played by anyone and this is perhaps Director Robert Rodriguez's only failing.
He has created an excellent franchise starter with this movie. My only fear is that nowadays if a movie fails to crack a billion dollars at the box office then it can be claimed to be unsuccessful.
This is nonsense. In regards to 'Alita' we are dealing with a story that isn't familiar to all.
Sure for the hard core Manga fans seeing this movie find its way on to the big screen is fabulous.
For those like myself who was unaware it may take time for this excellent film to make impact with a wider audience.
I really do hope this movie gets a sequel and we get to see Alita's world expand on the big screen.
If like me you enjoy Home Cinema then ""Alita Battle Angel' is a must buy especially on 4K Blu-ray.
This film transfers wonderfully on to the format. The HDR image is a tad dim but colours do pop here and there and shadow detail is always visible.
There's the odd soft shot here and there too which is to be expected with a CGI laden film.
The Dolby Atmos sound mix is thunderous. The Motor-ball chapter once again being a stand out.
In terms of height effects there's little going on up top. Chapter four offers decent effects but over all the mix is immersive without being intrusive.
I also had the opportunity to see the 3D Blu-ray version of the film and I have to say this was a rarity being more impressive than the 4K version.
This was one of the crispest 3D movies I have seen on home media.
So to sum up 'Alita Battle Angel' which ever format you choose to view just make sure you do watch and support this movie.
That way we may get that sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel

With that kind of cinematic pedigree, backed by a reported $200 million budget, this kick-ass cyberpunk adventure seems to be aiming for the same blockbusting box office heights as the Hunger Games franchise. But a lumpy script, muddled plot, stock characters and tired genre tropes may dampen its commercial breakout potential beyond its core sci-fi action-fantasy demographic. While not exactly a misfire, Rodriguez and Cameron's joint effort lacks the zing and originality of their best individual work. First alerted to Yukito Kishiro's original manga comics series by Guillermo del Toro back in the late 1990s, Cameron initially announced plans to adapt Alita in 2003, before the phenomenal success of Avatar took him down a different path. Fitful spells of preproduction followed, with Cameron still attached and apparently unwilling to yield control to another director. However, Spy Kids and Sin City creator Rodriguez finally came on board in 2015. But Cameron remains hands-on as producer and screenwriter alongside two fellow Avatar veterans, Jon Landau and Laeta Kalogridis. Alita takes place roughly 500 years from now, in the dusty streets of Iron City, a ramshackle junkyard metropolis huddled in the shadow of the flying citadel of Zalem. Ever since a vaguely explained apocalyptic war centuries before, traffic between the two cities is now highly restricted. A kindly doctor who specializes in repairing half-human cyborgs using scavenged parts, Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) stumbles across the battered shell of a former robot superweapon, nursing her back to life and christening her Alita (Rosa Salazar) after his late daughter. A born-again innocent initially unaware of her bloodthirsty past, Alita soon starts emoting like a normal human teenager, even developing a crush on handsome young robo-junk dealer Hugo (Keean Johnson). Alita opens strongly with a razzle-dazzle rush of inspired design flourishes and suspenseful clues. With Jackson's Weta Digital handling animation and visual effects, the first act is a sumptuous sensory experience shot in warm colors and radiant, super-crisp 3D. Many of the film's 1,500 CGI shots are magnificent, from the superbly detailed wide-angle cityscape vistas to Alita's kick-ass confrontation with the monstrous killer cyborg Grewishka (Jackie Earle Haley), a kind of Transformers version of Popeye with swollen metallic arms. But the film's biggest CGI challenge is blending the digitally morphed, motion-capture version of Salazar's performance into an otherwise mostly live-action cast. Superhero and fantasy movies do this all the time, of course, and nobody has done more to perfect this technology than Cameron or Jackson. But the risk with Alita is the ""uncanny valley"" effect, first identified by Japanese robotics scientists to describe that unintentionally creepy moment when artificial humans start to look too similar to the real thing. With her saucer-sized manga eyes and stylized doll face, Alita sometimes seems to have stumbled on set from a Pixar production. Even using cutting-edge effects at such a high technical level, this Mechanical Pixie Dream Girl still looks jarringly artificial in places. Proud Mexican-American Rodriguez adds his personal mark from the first frame with the Iron City production design, an agreeably funky steampunk barrio with Spanish-language signs and architectural nods to Latin America. The paternal relationship between Ido and Alita is also full of alluringly strange echoes, with distant traces of Frankenstein, Pinocchio and Pygmalion. But all this promising material unravels in the film's second half, when the plot becomes bogged down in clunky exposition, illogical sideways serves and action-heavy carnage. Alita's half-remembered past life as a cyborg soldier is too poorly explained to make much dramatic sense, as is her driving urge to escape Iron City for Zalem. Her sappy romance with Hugo quickly becomes a dreary slab of boilerplate young-adult soap opera, peppered with excruciating lines like, ""We don't belong anywhere, except together."" It also does not help that Johnson is a charisma vacuum of white-bread boy-band blandness. Departing from the original Japanese manga, Cameron and Rodriguez make Alita's unlikely ambition to become a Motorball champion central to her character development, largely because it gives them an excuse to mount one of the film's most kinetic and bombastic action set pieces. This sense-battering robots-on-wheels sequence is an impressively complex spectacle, but essentially a heavy-metal orgy of digital effects with minimal dramatic point. Imagine a stage production of Starlight Express directed by Michael Bay. Crucially, Alita contains scant traces of the warmth, wit and punky attitude that characterized most of Cameron's early work, and which has underscored every previous Rodriguez movie to date. Indeed, besides a couple of leaden one-liners, the screenplay is strikingly low on humor. Naturally droll, wry, subtle performers like Waltz and Ali are obliged to operate in muted one-note mode. Another oddly lazy touch is the background chorus of minor characters who look like refugees from '80s music videos, with their piercings and tattoos, wild Mohawk hair and artfully ripped leather jackets.",Alita - Battle Angel
162,Pukeonthestreet,Unfortunately overlooked,8,11 February 2020,Another film that suffered from the modern get it in and out era. This is a great sci fi action flick that was unfortunately pushed out way before it got it's due.,Alita - Battle Angel
163,colewaters,Alita Battle Angel,10,24 February 2019,Alita Battle Angel is a must see movie especially in IMAX 3D. Every second of this movie got better and better. There is no other movie like it.,Alita - Battle Angel
164,backup-50362,This movie takes the best from other great movies,6,13 July 2019,"There are strong elements from Back to The Future, I, Robot, Ghost in The Shell and so many other great movies in this one.The writing is confusing and most of the characters, especially the main CGI girl aren't very like-able but the movie is carried by great visuals and good suspense.To be fair, sometimes the CGI characters look like Shrek (2001) characters mixed with live people, but I still respect the work put into it. It's just not very convincing most of the time. Maybe if the whole movie was CGI that'd make more sense.It was great seeing Christoph Waltz as always, and some actors from Game of Thrones and other good stuff - they did great. The acting was overall fantastic except on the main character. That could've been better.Overall, if you like the movies I listed that this one takes inspiration from - it's a great watch. It's a bit too 'diverse' and baffling sometimes but it's an American movie and those guys are really trying hard to not have any white or asian people in their movies, because that's bad, apparently, for some reason. Or men. Yeah. They're only there to be evil as in most other American movies. But there was some romance that was refreshing and sweet, despite the terrible way it ends. Yeah, like I said, mostly the few men die in those full-of-women movies so you can guess how that romance ended. Funny how everyone can be rebuilt when convenient, except when the writing is bad and we need a sad scene. The worst part is the ending overall, it's sort of a cliffhanger that suggests a sequel, which is usually a terrible idea, but on it's own, it's still a great movie.The sad part is that any potential sequels will be done by Disney, so Alita will suddenly become a transgender muslim feminist who only kills the white men.",Alita - Battle Angel
165,kgprophet,Animé not for Adults,5,21 February 2019,"I am not a big fan of Animé. I didn't realize how much this film was made in the animé style. All I remember after James Cameron made Titanic, he was deciding whether to do Avatar or Battle Angel next. Judging by the box office returns, it looks like Cameron made a wise career choice. One thing that this film had going against it was the all too familiar setup. The amnesiac super skilled fighter. Super skilled fighter discovers her long lost talents. Super skilled fighter torn about using talents to defeat bad guys, or not.Another unintentional drawback was the Rollerball (or whatever they called it) derbies, which the film presented as the main set pieces of the film. However, it made me think of the god-awful remake of Rollerball back in 2002 (I still haven't been able to sit through the whole thing yet). As much as the 3D screen tried to dazzle me with action-packed super-cyborgs, it just didn't 'wow' me.One thing for certain needs to be made clear. This film is made for teenagers, or a bit younger. The whole cast and story are all about what every teenager film ever made deals with. New found feelings for the opposite sex, but oh, there's a rival lover. What to do? For the adults, there is the always appealing Jennifer Connelly and Mahershala Ali as the adult stud. But their scenes fall flat for the most part. Then there is the flamboyant Christoph Walz, usually a scene stealer, here feels miscast and not bringing his character to life.Avatar made huge breakthroughs with motion capture technology and CGI rendering of human-like characters. It certainly doesn't feel like there were any breakthroughs with this film, where the main character is CGI, and needs to sell to the audience that baseball sized eyes can pass the uncanny valley test. For me, compared to other big CGI extravaganzas, the whole presentation of CGI characters in their CGI environments felt more like a cartoon. Scenes with real humans unfortunately came off as stiff line reading. I was reminded of the much better ""Ready Player One"" as another dystopia that found it's groove and had much more engaging CGI characters.I never have watched any of the Roberto Rodriguez young teen adventures he has done through the years. As much as I worship films like ""Sin City"", I didn't feel the Spy Kids, et. al. films had much to offer for an older adult like me. ""Ready Player One"" proved that a script can find something appealing for both young and old audiences. ""Alita"" lacked any real depth. Does this mean the Franchise button won't get pushed on this character? My guess it is unlikely to merit a sequel, due to the hefty price tag and lackluster box office returns.",Alita - Battle Angel
166,W011y4m5,Really?,6,15 July 2019,"It's genuinely hard to fathom the fact that a mind like James Cameron's is responsible for crafting the screenplay for Alita: Battle Angel... As it suffers from the exact same astoundingly obvious problem as Mortal Engines (an immediate failure which also springs to mind as a direct comparison) - written by an equally talented filmmaker Peter Jackson - as both are awfully, INDEFENSIBLY rushed & underdeveloped, ultimately cramming an illogical amount of source material in to just one installment in what was only intended to be the launching film in a potential franchise.Bluntly, the movie is inconsistent, speeding from one CGI action sequence to the next with little to no connective tissue in between, meaning emotional pay-offs feel unearned & lack any satisfaction or emotional investment for it to be a rewarding viewing experience. Additionally, character's stories are forced to progress unnaturally quickly in order to continue things onwards so by the time audiences have acquainted themselves with each individual's motivations, they've already evolved in to something entirely different. EVEN MORE disappointingly, things border on farce when a person is killed, only to be brought back to life - only to be killed again in their very next appearance on screen afterwards; it's a feature repeatedly constructed upon consecutive large-scale set pieces & important sequences, missing all the little intimacies which make a story great that are usually interwoven throughout. There are countless memorable MOMENTS, but that doesn't necessarily mean they fit together to form anything watchable or at the very least, coherent.All I can infer is the creators were impatient, unwilling to wait for the sequel to adapt some other parts of the original - so as an easier alternative, all of them were patched together in to one larger whole until the screenplay resembled some kind of Frankenstein's Monster... Because as a whole, that's what this is the equivalent of; a soulless, destructive beast devoid of personality.The visual effects are impressive & Rosa Salazar delivers a sweet performance, making the most of the little she's given to work with - conveying Alita's perceived innocence & naivety quite beautifully through the motion capture... But besides that, an absolute disaster.",Alita - Battle Angel
167,jamiedarlow-37510,Massively disappointing and unengaging,4,30 March 2020,"It has beautiful visuals and good intention but falls down due to its poor script. Focusing on Alita (Rosa Salazar) a cyborg created by Dr. Ido (Christoph Waltz) who, despite his best intentions, cannot prevent Alita from discovering her true calling and extraordinary abilities as a warrior. With her power and mission for justice, she fights against the oppressors that torment the city. I think there's more to it but honestly it's mainly worth seeing for the action sequences including a pretty awesome 'Rollerball' one. These are when Rodriguez gets to shine fully and his directing skills are still undoubtedly sharp and brilliant. The character design for Alita is beautiful and she is one of the most unique looking heroines in recent cinema. The film's main flaw is the script behind it; the dialogue is weak and the character's motives usually make no sense, including a blossoming romance between Alita and a guy which just feels really forced and unnecessary. The acting also isn't great sadly; even the great Christoph seems to just walk through it. Despite all its visual artistry and ambition, it falls flat as a pancake narratively and had potential to be so much better",Alita - Battle Angel
168,vjnambu,Alita steals your hearts,7,20 February 2019,"I saw Alita Battle Angel's trailer in theatre when I went to watch aquaman which was stunning and urged me to watch it in theatres. I waited for it to release on 14th and finally watched it. Let's see whether it met my expectations.Plus:
The biggest plus point of alita is the lead character played by Rosa Salazar through motion capture. When the lead character itself is charismatic half of the problem is solved. You won't feel to take your eyes off watching the cyborg alita who is so adorable. She is naive and righteous on one hand and brave and deadly on the other hand. Also is given a good support by Christoph waltz as alita's foster father. Alita's love interest Hugo is also good and their romance is fine.
The next plus point is its visuals. Art direction, visual effects and action scenes are truly amazing. I heard that James Cameron wanted to direct it but couldn't since he was busy with avatar. But some say that he is the ghost director of the film. Whatever it is, direction was great.Minus:
Story is the biggest drawback. It is not great or maybe you can say its underdeveloped. Screenplay is incomplete at several places just making it keep for a sequel. Also does not hold your attention completely despite being visually stunning.Verdict:
I read Alita Battle Angel team will lose 100-200 million dollars and not recover its 170 million dollar budget. I hope nothing like that sort happens since I am already waiting for its sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel
169,asb_deutsch,I have mixed feelings for this flick,7,24 February 2019,"First things first, chick was top notch. Animation was brilliantly done. I was thrilled to go with my girlfriend! I somehow agree with the critics that there should have been more character development on Anita. Maybe they have left it for the sequel. But given the hefty budget, will it be able to break-even? I don't think so. It will remain a cult film just like Blade Runner 2049!",Alita - Battle Angel
170,DeBBss,Better Than What I Expected,6,25 May 2020,"Adapting an anime movie into to ""live Action"" has always been proven difficult, with Ghost in the Shell failing on several levels. Alita: Battle Angel is the best live action anime adaption I have seen so far, but isn't saying too much. I'm a huge cyberpunk fan, and Alita: Battle Angel gets a lot of things right about the genre. What upsets me is everything that surrounds the concept of cyberpunk, like the screenplay and pacing.The screenplay is very messy in the second act. The pacing really starts to build up at about half way through, but after Alita's second battle with Grewishka, it feels like it resets. There's several other issues with the screenplay, like the cheesy dialogue. It really caught me off guard with the dialogue because it felt like it was written by a little child sometimes. The dialogue is also cheesy because of the poor delivery of the actors/actresses. One good thing about the screenplay is the world building. It's all very creative, and it's awesome to watch if you're a cyberpunk fan because everything is developed very well.The acting is very questionable at certain moments. Because of the acting, it really takes you out of the mood. One thing that is my favorite part about the film are the characters' cyborg bodies. The cyborg bodies are really creative and interesting because you see a mixture of parts, like it was salvaged together. The character development was done reasonably well, with Alita being the protagonist. We get to see her develop into who she really is, and this theme was played very well into the story.The CGI was very impressive. It helped a lot with creating the cyborgs. All of the fight scenes were probably not done practically whatsoever, so if the CGI was done poorly, it would be obviously bad, but it was consistently good. On the topic of fight scenes, Alita: Battle Angel has a bunch of creative and entertaining fight scenes that were definitely the highlights of the film. I also loved seeing all the different cyborgs and how their bodies were built to fight in different ways; it added multiple levels to the fight scenes.Alita: Battle Angel was a solid anime adaption; it might even be the best anime adaption so far in cinema history. Alita: Battle Angel is very creative, with the world building and characters being at the top of the list. It's entertaining and well produced with the action. It's just the really bad screenplay and pacing that took me out of the movie. Overall, Alita: Battle Angel is a good movie that's worthy of a watch.",Alita - Battle Angel
171,saraccan,An ordinary cgi fueled action,6,23 February 2019,"It is very hard to say bad things about the technical aspects of this movie; visuals, cgi, music, sound etc. but obviously these elements don't make a movie on their own. The story is incredibly weak and full of cliches. Some characters and their purpose in the movie feel very awkward. It's a manga adaptation and they rarely work out as good live-action films.A doctor finds a broken cyborg girl in the trash and fixes it. Then she turns out to be a battle angel lol.",Alita - Battle Angel
172,eventlaunch,So good I watched it 4 times and still want to watch it again,10,7 July 2019,"Without a doubt this is the best movie of 2018-2019. I admit the trailers put me off this movie but once I got to watching it I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. And Alita wow, you root for her from the moment she wakes up to the end 10/10",Alita - Battle Angel
173,aarongnr,Even better the second time,9,20 June 2019,"I watched it in the cinema when it got released, and I watched it in german.When I first saw it I thought that it was only really half a movie, but watching it the second time I don't think so any more. It's perfect for a part one of a franchize.I strongly recommend watching it in english (I watched it in german). While Christoph Waltz voice is obviously the same cause he speaks both, it doesn't really feel quite right in german. Also Rosa Salazars voice acting is AMAZING. She brings so much emotion into her voice, it's outstanding.Watch it again if you've only seen it once, it only gets better!",Alita - Battle Angel
174,gpeevers,"Enjoyable, But too much for one movie",7,27 February 2019,"A dystopian cyberpunk story set 500 years in the future after the Great War, it's about an amnesiac cyborg named Alita. Alita is found and named by the doctor/scientist that finds her in a junk pile and brings her back to life. The gladiator sport of motorball appears to be the principal form of entertainment in this society, and forms a major part in the story (motorball looks to me an awful lot like rollerball).Iron City is an intriguing post-apocalyptic setting with a massive multicultural population that also includes a significant number of cyborgs (humans with various levels of cybernetic replacement parts), lying in the shadow of the last sky city Zalem (all the other sky cities were destroyed in the aforementioned war).The film works very well visually, has some interesting characters and several compelling interweaving plot threads but it just doesn't have the time to develop any of them properly.Perhaps the story would have been better served as a television series on HBO or somewhere else. There's not enough time in a two hour movie to do all the things they tried to do. Not enough time for character development which is a shame because you have some interesting characters and wonderful actors. Not enough time for story development, because the film makers assume the audience wants to get to the action. Not enough time for world development, we get an interesting glimpse of society and its development, but the only explanations are brief asides.The film was quite enjoyable, with great special effects and an endearing lead character, but it could have been even better.The film makers included some amazing talent James Cameron was co-writer and producer (has 3 Oscars), Robert Rodrigues was director, Mahershala Ali plays Vector (has 2 Oscars). Christopher Waltz plays Doctor Dyson Ido (has 2 Oscars) and Jennifer Connelly as Chiren (has 1 Oscar). Unfortunately both Ali and Connelly are largely wasted with underdeveloped characters and limited screen time, and although Waltz is given more to do - it's not much for an actor of his talent. Rosa Salazar as Alita is largely effective, but her character's development is rushed to propel the plot, and her portrayal is occasionally uneven - which could be the CGI or the editing.The setting of the film has considerable parallels with Elysium (2013) though Alita is more of an action film with an anime inspired plot, while Elysium was more of drama/thriller with a social commentary.",Alita - Battle Angel

2019
12A
director: Robert Rodriguez
starring: Rosa Salazar,Christoph Waltz,Jennifer Connoly,Mahershala Ali,Jackie Hearl Haley and keean Johnsonoverall rating 79/100Alita battle angle is a strong action/sci fi film, still with some floors but not enough to make this a bad film lets dive in to the ups and downs for this film.First lets start of with one of the main incredible parts of this film, Its CGI. This film was simply stunning to look at and it really shows how far special effects has come along as this was some of the best i have ever seen. What they managed to create was something so stunning and interesting it really made the film enjoyable to look at.Another big positive for the film would be its amazing world building. Again the whole new world that Rodriguez has managed to create was so unique and stunning it really makes you think what it would be like to live in such a atmospheric and exotic environment.And this film had so many different components concerning the world the characters are in that it really added something new and fresh to the film and the action genre.Another positive for me would be the character design of Alita. Rodriguez and co really did not hold back in making Alita as similar to the manga style as they could and this was refreshing to see for me as they managed to make her look so realistic despite here eyes. And the general creativity of the robots/cyborgs really were interesting to see especially with a lot of the villians.Now a negative for this film would be its pacing issues in the beginning half of the film. The first 30 minutes or so of this film felt very rushed and they were trying to introduce to many subplots at once. So the focus of the plot was lost just for a bit but luckily they managed to find there feet after this to connect everything together in a impactful way.Now the main positive for this film would be its incredible action sequences. This was up there with the best and most entertaining i have ever seen in any film. The creativity and uniqueness of each sequence kept you on the edge of your seat and was so entertaining. It made you forget about everything else just for those few moments. The key highlights for me would be Alitas bar scene and monsterball.The next positive for me would be the great acting performances. Particularly Christoph waltz Jennifer Connely and Mahershala Ali. Christoph Waltz was fantastic his acting was so authentic and believable that you really felt his passion for Alita which added a positive aspect to his scenes with her in. And Jennifer Connoley and Mahershala Ali despite not getting to much to do ( we shall talk about that in a minute) they still did a very good with what they had and we will talk about the star of this film in a later paragraph.However i would like to add that i felt Jennifer Connely and Mahershala Alis characters were slightly underused in this film. My main issue though was Jennifer Connely and her character. Like i said previously Jennifer did a great job with what she had but thats the issue she did not have enough. I did not feel connected to her character mostly because she was not included with any of the emotional scenes with Christoph Waltz at least not enough anyway. And it would of been better if she had a few action sequences with Alita. I just think her character needed more time to shine and have more narrative layers to her.And another slight issue i had was the very large amount of characters in this film. in the first half of the film. You were introduced to so many different villains and sub plots to do with them it got a tad confusing but when they killed off some and just focused on a few particular ones it worked a lot better.The next positive for me would be the films humour. Alita being so oblivious to her surroundings at the beginning in my opinion was actually pretty humorous. The fact that it was almost like training a baby really had some funny moments especially with food.The next positive for me would the emotional narrative moments between Alita and Christolph waltz. Just seeing how much Dyson cared for Alita really was sweet to see and there relationship growed throughout the film. And also the fact that Dyson named Alita after his dead daughter also added another surprisingly sad moment especially with the flashback explaining what happened.Another slight negative linked to previous comments. The plot of the film was to overstuffed with different components in the beginning of the film. They were trying to add to many different components to quickly luckily this was sorted as the film went on.Next i really loved the narrative twists in this film. Every 30 minutes or so throughout the film there was a different twist in a characters personality. It really kept you on the edge of the seat as the people you thought would be the protagonists turned out bad and visa versa it really kept your brain thinking about what was going to happen.The final big positive for me is the star of this film Rosa Salazar doing a fantastic acting performance as Alita. She really did a fantastic job and you could see the passion Rosa put in to this project especially with her emotional and action scenes this really should be the start of something big for Rosa Salazar.And finally just one last little negative for me is the fairly cringe script for Keean Johnsons character Hugo. Some of the things he had to say were very cringey and sloppily written luckily his relationship hip with Alita was interesting enough for him not be a complete waste of time in this film.Overall despite a few narrative and character flaws Alita battle angle is a very solid action adventure which has left me intrigued for Alitas hopeful future.",Alita - Battle Angel
176,yankeedoo,Bad,2,26 February 2019,I would say ready player one and alita are both the same. Rubbish not worth saying anything else just makes me laugh how much did it cost and director must be counting his money and laughing,Alita - Battle Angel
177,gavinp9,"OK, not great, futuristic robot film",6,17 February 2019,"'Alita: Battle Angel' is set 500 years in the post-apocalyptic future and is based on the 'Gunnm' manga. Alita (Salazar) is an amnesiac human brain found by Dr Ido (Waltz) and put into a robot body. With the help of Hugo (Johnson), she then sets out to try and piece together her past, which obviously isn't what it seems, as she's a warrior cyborg.The world-building is OK, but a bit too derivative - there's the unseen ""higher class"" up on Zalem, a floating city, and everyone else on the ground is basically in the slums. All very reminiscent of 'Ready Player One', 'Mortal Engines' and 'Blade Runner'. Vector (Ali) is the bad guy, but both he & Chiren (Connelly) are controlled by Nova (Norton). Some of the bounty hunter bits, especially Zapan (Skrein), seem pointless.Overall, a lot of it looks good and Alita's CGI fits in well to the rest of the world, but there's a few too many convenient plot points (i.e. new body). It probably would've worked better as an MA-rated film, seeing as Rodriguez is the director, they get one F-word in and there's a fair bit of violence. It makes me want to see the 'Red Rising' novels turned into films even more. The ending is a blatant set up for the sequel, making the whole film feel slightly undercooked.",Alita - Battle Angel
178,thebricks,"Great movie, critics wrong as usual",10,17 February 2019,"Wasn't expecting the best movie, but for a February release, this was amazing. Can't believe it took this long for James Cameron to get this on screen, I'd been reading about the project for years on Ain't It Cool News, it was like his holy grail project that never could get made.With Robert Rodriguez directing, I wasn't so confident in this movie. The February release date wasn't a good sign either. However, after watching the movie, I had a pretty good time. It definitely reminded me of the Japanese anime I used to watch growing up. I'm not familiar with the books but this captured the feeling of anime that movies like Ghost in the Shell couldn't.Highly recommend.",Alita - Battle Angel
179,kermitkid,"Why, Rotten Tomatoes?",9,30 March 2020,"This movie is proof that Rotten Tomatoes is full of baloney. Don't listen to the critics! This movie is fantastic! I've heard other people say the film's main fault is there is too much story, and it moves kind of fast, but I didn't think that. I thought the story flowed pretty well, and was easy to follow. The character designs for the cyborgs are super creative. There are no bad actors in this film. Mahershala Ali as the villain is a particularly stand out performance. He gives such a subtle performance, to the point where you know he's lying and has bad intentions, but you don't blame characters for believing him and joining him. He's just the right amount of manipulative. He reminded me of an evil version of Morpheus from ""The Matrix."" The action sequences alone are worth the price of admission (go see it in 3D). There was one sequence involving a futuristic gladiator match, and not only are the action and visuals impressive, the background commentary is hilarious! There is definitely a lot of heart put into this movie. A lot of people, when the trailer came out, were complaining about the main character's ""big anime eyes'' and how distracting they were, but I only noticed it in a couple of scenes, and I blame that on the camera angle. Most of the time, I didn't notice or care. The MPAA is a strange thing with how they rate movies. The film is PG-13, but there is so much hacking off of limbs (to the point where even ""Star Wars"" would call it excessive) and so many other moments of graphic violence that made my jaw drop that they got away with it in a PG-13 movie. It's because most of the violence involves cyborgs, so I guess that because they're not completely human, it's ok? But if it were the same exact movie, but everyone was human, this would definitely be R. The movie also does not feel complete, because it isn't. They were so sure this would get a sequel that they didn't focus on wrapping up the story, and instead have a ""to be continued"". I'm so sick of that, because if this movie doesn't get a sequel, it was kind of a waste.

Similar to the story of Pinocchio.However any scene involving Keean Johnson was like there was a narrator in the movie instead of a real person. You can overlook it at first, then it just broke the forth wall and the film. At approx half-way, Rosa's character Alita sounds incredibly fake scripted and breaks the film. Many other people/characters also lean towards ""narrating"" themselves instead of acting.When the screenplay picks up and becomes energetic, all camera angles are looking at feet, or looking upwards like a snivelling creep, completely disrespecting the audience. Another hollywood cliche.All CGI violence is ultra violent, unnecessary and does not match the context. This makes the movie look fake as well.

181,ayoreinf,The Art of great movie makers lies in their obsessions,9,18 February 2019,"In fact I could say it regarding any great artist. Most of them are obsessed with something, and it shows in their art. But limiting myself to the field of cinema, I'll simply mention Billy Wilder and his obsession with the masks or disguises we humans wear. John Landis and his obsession with the mad world we live in. John Badham and his obsession with people beating the system, often manifested in elaborate machine of a sort. I could carry on with these examples, but the issue at hand is Alita: Battle Angel and the two creative minds behind the film.First among them is, as far as I'm concerned James Cameron, who wrote the script and produced the film. And if one looks at the first two installments of Terminator (which I consider a single movie seperated into two parts), at Avatar and at this movie the idea of the human soul in the machine and its victory over it shines through. The strength of the human spirit is an issue in most of Cameron's movies, but since I didn't see them all, I will not discuss them here. Also true of Cameron's career is his obsession with complete control over the world he presents in the movie, hence the importance of the 3D technique in Avatar and in this movie.Personally I don't like Robert Rodriguez as much as I like James Cameron, mainly because I often think that he cares too much for the stunning visuals of his film, and too little for plot and character development. But in this case I think teaming up with James Cameron helped him to get a better balance. This is definitely a visually stunning movie, but the characters are all well written, (at least the leading ones) and the story makes sense inside the borders of the world it presents.The cast of the movie is mostly superlative, though some of the smaller characters are very superficial, it doesn't hurt the story so much, as their roles are very limited which means that not having a developed character makes sense cinematically. It's hard to pass judgement on the quality of Rosa Salazar's acting as we don't really sea her face but rather her cyborg face designed to look as part of the Manga world from which the source material arrives. Still during the movie it never felt like she wasn't human, or real, and that's quite a lot. The other three real roles in the film are Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly and Keean Johnson. All three are very professional to say the least.As far as all other aspects of movie making, I can't find a single fault, it's all done at the highest quality. So to sum it all up, a real good sci-fi about the real strength of the human soul when pushed well above the limits we're familiar with.",Alita - Battle Angel
182,SilverOrlov,Internal otaku satisfied)),8,19 July 2019,"Great adaptation of great manga. Good performances of the battle, very spectacular special effects and the environment(city, nature and so on). And the most important thing is that this film is not only an ""entertaining show"", but like a manga, with an interesting and serious plot(It is a pity that the author could not better reveal many aspects of the story, two hours is too little for this). I really hope for the second part, if it does not slide down in quality and will be the same as the first one, then, apart from some logical nonsense of the character's deeds, there will be no claims for this film.
P.S.: I do not really like the actress herself(her appearance), but in the film, thanks to technology, she was very well done. Very beautiful and, in my opinion, very similar to the manga prototype.",Alita - Battle Angel
183,Thrashman88,Alita Rocks!!!,9,24 February 2019,"I honestly didn't know much about Alita's magna origins, but I found the trailers fascinating and having James Cameron's name attached to it certainly helped. Well, I wasn't disappointed: Alita Rocks! If I'm correct, this is her origin story and being that, it still doesn't give away much, paving the ground for an inevitable sequel. The effects are amazing, the Alita character is seamless and when the action kicks in it does like a freight train.
There are however, traces of other movies of course: I found certain similarities with Neil Blokamp's criminally underrated, ""Elysium"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Matrix"", ""TRON"", ""Rollerball"", ""Terminator"", ""Star Wars"", and the list goes on. These influences are evident all over ""Alita"" and yet it feels fresh and exciting. It is probably the best Science Fiction film besides the Star Wars and Marvel movies (the latter of which have become tiresome IMHO). Robert Rodriguez did a great job directing and, despite not actually seeing her on film, Rosa Salazar is the embodiment of Alita (the actress' most distinctive facial features are all over Alita's CGI character).
I've read comparisons of this film with ""Ghost In A Shell"", but in my opinion Alita is a far superior movie, far better structured and far more entertaining.
The ending certainly leaves the door open for a sequel that, if done right, could actually be much better.Alita won't disappoint you!",Alita - Battle Angel
184,WalkdenEntertainment,"Stunning Visuals, Disappointing Plot",6,9 March 2020,"Set in year 2563, Dr Dyson (Christoph Waltz) searches for spare robot parts among what appears to be a futuristic waste site. While looking, he soon find a main robotic part with life still within it. Soon Dr Dyson puts together a body for this new robot part and gives her the name Alita. Alita and the film audience soon learn more about the past and how the world became the way it is today. Alita also soon discovers that she has abilities and hidden memories from her past.From the word go, Alita: Battle Angel is a visually incredible film that really pushes visual effects to the extreme limits. Based on the visuals, I would assume the film's 3D would be impressive but nevertheless, I suggest movie lovers watch the film in 4K as it's easily one the best discs I've seen for 2019.But as far as plot, I struggle to give solid praise to it. Alita alone as a character has plenty of plot points to deal with as she questions who she is, what is her past and where did she come from. But the filmmakers decide to put so much more into the plot along with this that the film becomes cluttered with subplots. Alita is focused on playing a futuristic sport, saving others, earning money, investigating others and trying to recruit other people in order to rebel. I shocked that the writers and filmmakers tried to complete everything plot and detail within the films approx. 2 hours. It's almost like this should have been a sci-fi TV series, something I feel that the audiences would have been more happy with.Alita as a character is great and I felt she was able to carry the film on her own. Thankfully there are also some other good key characters and actors such as Christoph Waltz & Mahershala Ali. But some other side characters are fairly cliche and predictable, particularly Alita's human love interest who also has secrets of his own....Overall, I had high hopes for Alita. I wanted it to be the next big action sci-fi film but the end result is that the film has a dissatisfying plot but strong visuals. For over 2 hours the film has lots to tell but it feels incredibly crammed and disjointed with so many changes and frequently occurring turns. It could have been a masterpiece if it didn't try so hard. 6.5/10 - Walkden Entertainment",Alita - Battle Angel

186,movieman6-413-929510,Robert Rodriguez and James Cameron portray the technical world of the Alita Battle Angel manga beautifully.,6,16 February 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel is a new Sci-Fi action film directed and partly written by Robert Rodriguez, the director of: From Dusk Till Dawn, Sin City and Machete. The film is based on the manga of the same name.
The film is set in the future where cyber doctor Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) finds a devastated cyber body of a cyborg on a garbage dump. When Dyson manages to repair the body, he calls the cyborg Alita (Rosa Salazar). When Alita wakes up, she no longer has any memories about who she is and what happened to her.
Dyson teaches her about the world where she lives and how everything goes here. All poor people and cyborgs still live on the arde, but all rich creatures live in an area that floats above the earth.
Despite her new lifestyle, Alita is still curious about who she used to be and tries to find out, together with her human friend Hugo (Keean Johnson). For example, she goes against Dyson's rules and wanders around late in the evening with Hugo, despite the dangers that take place in the evenings. This is how Alita comes into contact with bad cyborgs, who threaten her. When Alita engages in the battle with these cyborgs, she learns that she has extraordinary fighting capabilities. Alita decides to use these abilities to protect her friends and family against the injustices of the dark corrupt world and eventually discover who she is and what happened to her in the past.
James Cameron had the rights of the manga on which this film is based for a while, but has not yet made a film of it. Because James Cameron is currently too busy with the planned sequels to the first Avatar movie, he left the director work to Robert Rodriguez. James Cameron is still one of the writer and producers of this film.
With this film they tell an interesting story about what the world might look like in the future. Where all poor people continue to live on earth, while rich people have created a world of their own where everything is much better. For example, this film looks a lot like the 2013 Sci-Fi film Elysium.
Robert Rodriguez and James Cameron portray this technical world beautifully. So this film contains beautiful images of technical landscapes. The cyborgs that live on the world are also portrayed in a special way with a mix of CGI bodies and motion capture faces. Most cyborgs look pretty realistic, but in some you can see that the bodies with CGI are stuck in the film, so you see the real faces on fake bodies. For example, some cyborgs seem a bit strange and fake in the film.
Rosa Salazar puts down good acting in the film as the leading role. With her, the effects look best. In the film she also has a nice father daughter relationship with Christoph Waltz's character.
Her character is invincible in the film, so that as a viewer you no longer worry about her, because you know that she wins every fight anyway. If they had given a weak point to her character, you would have given her more attention as a viewer.
The only way she can be threatened is when enemies go after her loved ones and try to kill them. The relationship she has with Keean Johnson's character also works better when they are just friends, but when they are put down as lovers in the film, this is somewhat forced.
Other size actors such as Mahershala Ali and Jennifer Connelly seem to play more in this film just to earn some money. Despite the fact that they do good acting, they do not do much special in the film and their roles could also have been played by lesser known actors, without this having made a difference.
Other actors only partly appear with their faces on a cyborg CGI body in the film. Although some of them look a bit different, you can see that they enjoyed acting in this film.",Alita - Battle Angel

Anyway, visually, this is the most amazing movie I have seen in my lifetime. It is freaking amazing, the animations are out of this world, the CGI is fantastic, Alita looks gorgeous and every enemy too. It is truly a masterpiece with an amazing story, adapted precisely to the manga and anime, detail to deatil. The biggest and main issue I have with the whole Alita story is the melodrama, the romance and love between her and her boyfriend which is non-sense to me, but hey, that's how things are going in the manga too, so no hate at all.",Alita - Battle Angel

192,thenolanfan,Alita Review,6,9 February 2020,"This movie begins well in my opinion, it it one of the rare CGI movie where you can really relate to the character is emotions, all tjat due to the details that wer put in the facials expression of Alita. However, the film goes worse and worse when the mission is revealed, it become only a bland movie with 0 substance, all lot of useless visual effects, and a déja vu story. This is sad because as I said it begins quite well. I think that this movie doesn't worth a watch, if you want to see a really touching movie then watch Schindler's List if you want to watch a visually stunning movie then watch Avatar, but Cameron isn't the best director to make those kind of movies ( he doesn't direct the film but is strongly involved in the making since he originally wanted to direct it himself).",Alita - Battle Angel

I was waiting the whole movie for someone to say ""You are more human than anyone else I've ever met"" and of course that line was in there.There is some decent action I guess, but it's all very average, and does the one thing that's asking for failure these days.

197,jamesjustice-92,Rodriguez and Cameron together: what can go wrong?,5,16 February 2019,"Turns out - a lot. I didn't have any great expectations about this movie and the only reason I wanted to see it was James Cameron's name in the screenplay and producer's credits. I guess the days when this name alone represented success are long gone.
Alita is empty, dull, uninteresting and uninspiring movie that only kids could like because of the abundance of special effects and visuals and I don't know what else kids cherish in a good movie nowadays. All of those comic books adaptations are lifeless by its nature because comics are books with pictures, nothing more. And here's the same with Alita, the japanese anime or manga or whatever I don't really care but what I do care about is the plot, a good story that teaches you something, that makes you turn on your brain and not turn it off. What is the story about? Beats me. Is there character development? Thinner than a sheet of paper. By the time the credits start to roll you realize that you don't know anything about the world of this movie - the ending tells you to go see the sequel as usual and maybe you'll get the answers to your questions but why should I care to go? The movie didn't give me ANY reason to.

199,galahad58-1,Alita: Cinema Angel,8,17 February 2019,"There is a lot of criticism about this movie because of the ending. I will say that the ending disappoints because there is no ending - it just abruptly stops similar to the ending of a charter of a book. Be prepared - while it does not say Part 1 - it ends as if there is a second part to the story.Ignoring the ending - this is a marvelous film. Rosa Salazar (and the animators) bring a lot of humanity and life to the main character. She feels real - she captivates you and draws you into her story.Christoph Waltz is extremely good - not as good as he was in other movies (since he is limited), but good enough to be a very strong supporting role to our heroine.The only performance that was underwhelming was that of Keean Johnson. It was not a strong performance and felt weak compared to Waltz and Salazar. He showed that he is outmatched by someone with acting talent and a better actor should have been chosen.Everything else: special effects, story, directing, editing, etc. was wonderful. The 8 is a strong rating and this is a highly recommended film.",Alita - Battle Angel

Alita meets a young man Hugo (Keean Johnson), but soon learns her new world is a dangerous one. She discovers clues to her past fighting the corruption of those who run the City, Iron City. Above iron City is Zalem a city in the sky. Hugo tells Alita that is where he wants to go. You might say it's like a Heaven where life for everyone is good. That's what we are told. Nova (Edward Norton) who says he sees everything runs Zalem. Hmmm.................You have to give this a chance as it is a very good, heartwarming story as well as many Cyborg battles, which show excellent CGI and spot on editing. Remember this is more than 300 years in the future and things have changed from what we knew back in 2019. See? Yes, I did say ""heartwarming. "" You'll see. Dr Ido is very protective of Alita and tries to convince Alita that she has been given a second chance at life and to just enjoy it for now. Of course, Alita cannot buy into this and wants to fight when necessary; and Alita finds a kind of love with Hugo. See?Alita discovers that she is a warrior and doesn't shy away from hand to hand combat. Guns are not allowed In Iron City. And Alita has a fondness for the game of RollerBall where many Cyborgs compete. Am glad this did not turn into a Rollerball movie. Alita joins the Hunter Warrior Society. Hunter Warriors are basically Bounty Hunters and only go after their Marks for money.Notables: Jennifer Connelly as Dr. Chiren, Dr. Ido's ex wife and who is a partner in the Rollerball games run by Vector (Mahershala Ali), and who also promises people to send them to Zalem for money or to do a job and both Dr. Chiren and Vector work for Nova, who for the purposes of this story, may be considered a god and we only see him at the end and has given Dr. Chiren and Vector orders to kill Alita; Jackie Earle Haley as Grewiska, a tremendously large Cyborg who meets Alita early on and has orders from Vector to kill Alita; Ed Skrein as Zapan, a Hunter Warrior, who is constantly a nemesis to Alita, and Hugo later on.Note: James Cameron was a producer on this and had screenplay writing input.This is very enjoyable and fast paced too. Rosa Salazar is perfect in the role of Alita and we really enjoyed Christoph Waltz as the very protective Dr. Ido.

201,TheVictoriousV,"Entertaining and well-made, at least sufficiently so",6,14 February 2019,"Reviewing Ghost in the Shell, I cited one of the funniest counter-points to the idea that casting ScarJo as a Japanese character from a Japanese source material constituted ""white-washing"". That counter-point: Asian actors' eyes are too small to portray live-action anime girls anyway (actual thing someone ""explained"" to me). With Alita: Battle Angel, Robert Rodriguez presents a digital solution, and no doubt unnerves many in the process, entertaining as his film may be.Rodriguez is known for two things: violent and gritty pictures that would be right at home on an exploitation tape from the 70's, and CGI brain farts that play like (and sometimes literally are) the creative efforts of his young children. Alita, in some respects, brings on elements of both Roberts, but has also been compared to the knack for imagery he displayed in 2005's Sin City.The movie is produced by James Cameron, who I expect couldn't give two damns how convincing it actually looks anyhow. It takes place in a science fiction future that looks like most of 'em, and the expository caption ""300 years after The Fall"" makes me displeased that it doesn't share the universe of Cloud Atlas, where the centuries succeeding ""The Fall"" saw humanity revert to a savage state as the high-tech future crumbled. There's also the unusually helpful 20th Century Fox logo, which fades into a gritty ""26th Century"" version.The eponymous Alita, a cyborg, is found and repaired by Iron City scientist Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) and does not at first recall her own significance or combat capacity. Played well by Rosa Salazar, Alita aims to become a Hunter-Warrior (essentially a licensed bounty hunter), as Ido reveals himself to be as a side gig, and find out more about who she is/was. Eventually she is herself hunted by the likes of Ido's shady ex-wife (Jennifer Connelly), Hunter-Warrior Zapan (Ed Skrein), a monstrous assassin named Grewishka (Jackie Earle Haley), a powerful businessman known as Vector (Mahershala Ali), who runs deadly ""Motorball"" games, and an entity from the affluent sky city of Zalem. I won't describe his role too much here.The supporting cast contains Michelle Rodriguez, Keean Johnson, Lana Candor, and Eiza González as Nyssiana, a live-action face on a CG'd body that couldn't look more fake or inconsitently lit even if I'd pasted the face on myself using Snapchat. There are also appearances from Jeff Fahey and Casper van Dien, actors I didn't know we were still using.I kid, but the cast is certainly one of the film's strongpoints. Many of my currently working favorites - Ali, Hayley, Waltz, the always loveable Michelle Rodriguez - are here. Waltz in particular forms a moving bond with Alita, whom he regards as a daughter, having just lost his own.Alita, like Ghost in the Shell, is based on an older, decidedly more Asian source material - a cyberpunk manga that I of course had never heard of. I suppose the main character's status as a machine makes her presence in the Uncanny Valley (the term is often used in the field of robotics, after all) more excusable than, say, CGI Peter Cushing from Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was meant to be a real person. As I mentioned above, certain shoddy effects cannot be explained away in this manner - i.e. the live-action face added not too seamlessly onto an animated robot.For the most part, though, I can admit that the visual effects of Alita hold up (certain action scenes make for quite a ride and the robo-designs can get wildly creative), even if I am unimpressed by this ""new"" futuristic world that has a little bit of Wakanda, a little bit of Naboo, a little bit of Elysium, a little bit of WALL-E's crib, and so on and so forth. I guess there's only so many new images man can conceive (movies like Ron Fricke's Baraka confirm that, at the end of the day, OUR reality already supplies the most unthinkable sights). No bother.As familiar as it looks visually, the world is still fairly well-realized. We learn about it via the memory-less and initially innocent Alita, as she herself must learn how everything works. It gives us much to keep track of at once, yes, but it all feels natural, as our heroine is discovering all these words and inventions with us. A wholly great or original movie it is not, yet it is unabashedly fun and weird in a way that's hard to dislike, and it still exists in a universe all its own.",Alita - Battle Angel
202,gareth-75442,"It's all about the cgi, unfortunately nothing else",5,12 January 2020,"OK nothing wrong with manga, you either love it or it's meh!
With all comics or ""graphic novels"" (as the grown up kids prefer) the fans love them for different reasons & they buy them for different reasons, some love the stories & art, some just the art, some only for the cover art,now just because a particular series or story is long running & long loved in one form doesn't mean it will transfer to another medium & also be successful, as far as blockbuster movies go this is up there with the best of them at a $170 million budget but with a worldwide gross of just $405 million it's definitely not performed like a blockbuster movie, while not regarded as a flop its also not a resounding success.
The set & cgi are fantastic, the story, plot & characters are just meh! But nothing more than meh!
James Cameron & Robert Rodriguez gave an interview stating ""this is an amazing story that needed to be told"", unfortunately it seems there wasn't a large enough audience that wanted to see/hear it, I imagine it will do well with the DVD & BluRay release.
Nothing about any of the characters is relatable, there isn't anything about any of them that moves the viewer so they care about them or their individual stories, scenes with interactions between characters are played out like 80s TV soap operas to hammer in the emotion then into an over the top street ""Roller Derby"" game to mimic the big league Roller Derby game of the pro's then into individual scenes of violence & action, big bold scenes to slowly reveal the abilities of alita & mixed in amongst all this are the sub plots of other characters,and theirin lies the problem, it's too much, it plays out like a video game where literally everything is cgi & no matter how good the cgi the brain can't be fooled into believing anything is real, it's just eye candy.
An example of another problem, something that seems to have been completely missed by Cameron & Rodriguez, take Judge Dredd the comic, a massive hit in the UK, exported to the US & garnered a big fan following there, then in 1995 a big budget movie, $90 million, it only took $113 million worldwide, massive flop, then 2012 a reboot of judge dredd, a slightly different take of the same character with a $50 million budget, took only $35 million worldwide, an even bigger flop, here's the thing Judge Dredd was created from the way America was being viewed at the time, the ""gung ho cops"" the insane gang violence, the whole out of control nature of the US, Judge Dredd was a p***take of how the creators saw justice & society spiralling into chaos in america, a big hit in the UK because of the inspiration from another culture, but literally nothing more than a parody of the United States, a fact lost on the producers but clear to audiences, alita battle angel, battle angel alita or gunnm, whichever you want to call it may not have been a parody but massive influence of American culture is evident all through the story, at the time 1990 - 1995 this may of been new & amazing in a manga comic, certainly the visual art would have been pleasing to the reader, eye candy, but faithfully recreated on the big screen its nothing new with nothing different to say, Astro boy, an animated movie based on the manga Mighty Atom is basically the same story as alita & another failure, Cameron & Rodriguez should have learned from the failure of that & spent the money & their time on something else, they should also have learned from George Lucas's original Star Wars story, his original draft is completely different to what actually made it to screen, the draft has no Darth Vader, no Emperor Palpatine, no Han Solo, no Wookies, no Ewoks & Luke Skywalker wasn't the hero, he was a cyborg, more machine than human & almost insane, probably the inspiration for Forrest Whittakers character in ""Rogue One"",thing is they should have had the ""vision"" to see that battle angel alita would fail.

203,jackgdemoss,Alita is my favorite character in 2019 cinema,9,8 March 2019,"Did it have some strange stylistic choices? Sure. Was it clearly building to a sequel, leaving the audience wanting more? Absolutely. I would certainly consider these drawbacks to the film, but they pale in comparison to the marvelous positives that Alita: Battle Angel has going for it. What must be said first because it is the most important by far: Alita herself is stunning. She bewitched me the moment she appeared on screen with her warm, unique, and sentient image. Throughout the film, her beauty and charm in and out of combat constantly had me smiling or cheering with excitement. She truly is a character to root for. Beyond having the single most loveable character I have seen in months, Alita: Battle Angel boasts an uncanny way to lull the audience into a sense of safety and understanding, meer moments before they flip us on our heads. The rhythm and tone of the film are hard to pin down but it makes for exciting twists at times, and is constantly marching the plot forward.

205,Gresh854,"Alita Has Mind-Blowing Action But, The Story Isn't All There",5,16 February 2019,"From the man who granted us the 21st Century's Casablanca-AKA, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl-comes a deliberately anime-persuaded frenzy of crisp awesomeness that is unfortunately held down by its inconveniently spattered storyline structures. Alita: Battle Angel highlights visually some of the most-if not, the most-muscle-fueled, groundbreaking CGI action segments ever-a produce often typifyed within projects associated under the name: James Cameron-but, flunks to poise all of the tumbling, thickly densed plot-based scraps and metals that it wants to cram into its minimal two-hour runtime.Make no bones about it, the first act of this movie was nearly worthy of a one star in my book. The writing was atrocity at its mountain top, the narrative was zooming left and right uncontrollably, and my spirit of inquiry was extinct. Mercifully though, what bears on is MUCH more luring and furthers its valuable, idiosyncratic action spectacles and bloodthirsty, borderline PG-13 (reaching for an R-rating) Japanese-influenced combat absurdities. Mainly however, the brawny, badass evolution of our darling, charming main character, Alita, is what nurtures this film from nosediving off into an abyss.Alita: Battle Angel is a suitable live-action introduction to a (plausible) franchise based off of a beloved manga that should have most of its followers entranced. For those who are unfamiliar though, it-in all probability-will turn out to be a hit and miss due to its deficiencies within its confusingly impulsive diegesis anatomy and sometimes, unforgivably colorless dialogue. With that in mind, I am nevertheless, eager to see what the future of Alita sequels have to offer, as they have a sturdier chance of becoming grand now that this freshman ingress has been windswept and evaluated.

206,namob-43673,"Decently entertaining, but nothing else. Absolutely nothing else...",2,7 March 2019,"Personally I do not like Manga so much, and I know absolutely nothing about the comic this is based on, this might impact my review slightly since this movie is not made for me.With that said however this movie is terrible. Worst movie I have seen since Solo, and that says all you need to know.There is almost no plot whatsoever, and what little there is is driven by the Worst ""love"" story ever put to film. This is not a joke, I have never, ever seen anything worse. It is so bad that when the ""love"" interest, and one of the most annoying characters of the movie, dies (stupidly of course) I was chearing and put up a middle finger towards the screen. At that point in the movie I was angry that I had spent money on this garbage.
The ""story"", or rather lack thereof, is lackluster, cliche, and extremely predictable. Most predictable generic action movie since Black Panther, and again that says all you need to know.There is no character development, other then partly for Alita. The visuals and special effects that so many praise are not anywhere near the level of reserving said praise. The transformers movies, every Marvel movie (except for BP) and most other movies have far better CGi and special effects. They spent $200 million making this movie! Where did all that money go? Very few good actors hired, there is only 5-6 different sets, special effects mediocre, are computer graphic engineers so expensive they took half the budget? If so they need to refuse to pay those hacks.Alita never really need to earn anything either. I saw one of those indoctrinated fanboys mumble something about Cap Marvel being a Mary Sue, which is very far from the truth. But IF Cap Marvel is a Mary Sue, then Alita is the biggest Mary Sue that ever Mary Sue:d... well, except for Ray of course.
The truth is that none of them (except for Ray of course) is a Mary Sue, but Alita never truly go through anything. She is just this kickass android robot person that suddenly wake up and can fight anything. Which would be fine if there was an actual story! Why do so many movies lack the basic sense of writing a good script?Why was there a ship there convincently waiting for Alita like a huge blinking McGuffin and why has no one else, like the bad guy, taken it? Why is that nurse lady even in the movie? Completely pointless. How come a few teenage boys can take down cyborgs on a daily basis almost effortlessly? What happen with technological development? You telling me that in all those years people didn´t invent or re-invent tech to make their lives better? How come Alitas head seem to survive everything while her body gets thrashed over and over? I can go on forever with all the plot holes.The only redeaming quality, and likely why so many people seemingly like this movie, is the action sequences. In perticular the chase scene out of the stadium.
Despite having pretty good action, this movie is still boring due to what I mention above. There is never any tension, you know what will happen long before it does. It felt like watching a badly edited game-play of a game I have played through 6 million times, only more boring.2/10, and I cannot recommend this to anyone. If someone tells you this is a great movie and they´ve seen it 8 times, as I have seen in some comment sections, I would suggest that you slowly walk away and then call nearest asylum to check if they are missing a patient.",Alita - Battle Angel

209,FairlyAnonymous,This is one of the worst movies I've seen in theatres...,3,18 February 2019,"This is a movie in the same way that Avatar the Last Airbender (2010) was a movie.It's not even really a movie.It's a wikipedia recap of a bunch of volumes.Everyone speaks in exposition, all the dialogue is cliche, there is no good acting, the pacing is all over the place, there is no build up to any scenes, no tension to any of the action, no focus on what the main plot is, little to no good character development and very few reasons to feel invested in the characters.I can't even tell you what Alita's character arc is! This movie is just all over the place and is an incoherent mess. It feels like a movie that was meant to be 3+ hours long that got chopped down to 2 hours. There is just a ton of content that is missing that is required to build up characters and to make them interesting, but instead this movie decides to use the worst possible cliches at every possible moment to try and summarize what the audience should be feeling. This movie only really works because cliches exist and audiences understand what they mean and the context in which they are used so the movie doesn't waste the time in making those moments its own.For instance, there is a scene where Alita gives a big speech, ""We need to join forces and work to find the big bad guy."" yet the movie hasn't put ANY TIME into establishing that Alita was even planning this or aiming to bring this bad guy down. Never. The audience simply understands, ""Oh, this is the riveting failed speech cliche where the protag tries to get everyone to work together."" However, the movie itself never explains why the moment is in the movie and why we should be invested in it. The entire film is like this. Just a string of movie cliches tied together to the point where the audience understands what they should be feeling at what time but they have never been given an actual explanation within the movie for the existence of those moments.This movie is literally on par with Avatar: The Last Airbender. Terrible pacing and writing and trying to cram in too much exposition too quickly.Gaah, it's just such a frustrating film to watch and I desperately wanted to like it, but couldn't. I really truly want anime/manga live-action adaptations to succeed but you can't try to cram in exposition at an insane rate.",Alita - Battle Angel

A James Cameron written and produced CGI-fest, telling the tale of a Pinocchio meets A.I. meets Blade Runner meets Mortal Engines meets... Rollerball? So, its the future, of course its bleak, and the rich live in this floating city and daily it rains its trash on the people below, and one day Dr Dyson Ido is trash collecting and finds a cyborg's head, also I think he picks up a T- 800 arm, but tosses it aside, so he decides to take the head home and give it a body, Geppetto style, to have a new bestie, or to replace someone lost?? However as it turns out, she's a weapon, the doc is also a bounty hunter, and the rich up in the clouds seem to be manipulating everything, and to get up there she needs to get involved in some killer cyborg podrac... I mean Rollerball... And the winner gets to go upstairs to live the life of luxury. Like that wasn't the plan all along??? Who throws out a powerful weapon like Alita: Battle Angel? I know nothing about the source material, but I found the movie to be fun and exciting, as long as you don't think about it to much. Why does everyone dress like its the 1990's for instance, or, if the population has been thinned out and lots of cultures are now living together in tight spaces, after several hundred years, they didn't adopt a common language?

He barley worked as a bad guy in Tarzan. As a Good Samaritan doctor,and a bounty hunter, he is not very believable.
But enough about him.The CGI effects are pretty amazing. They have put a lot of work and money into them. I only wish they had put just as much work into the story and the pace of it.The problem is the movie goes in spikes. It has a long straight dull than it goes up in a spike with an action sequence,than it goes down again into a long dull. For so go up again when your about to turn it off.

I am Awed by how Beautiful and touching and human this character of Alita was..My God, those eyes and her expressions just made the movie hypnotic and spellbinding! There is something about a female form, small and unasuming possesed of mind bending fighting skills and unfathomable strength that is just so cool to see portrayed onscreen...The movie Wonder woman another example and Planet Hulk, the warrior princess who was possessed of strength in her small form to rival the hulk himself...Alita was just so endearing, humanlike ,skillfull ,Fearless and Powerful that it was stunning to watch onscreen..just LOVED IT!....The cinematography was outstanding here and the cgi used to create Alita was absolutely seamless and hauntingly convincing and blended with the real humans flawlessly...I hope there will be a sequel, the stage was set for it!
the supporting cast of cristopher waltz was fantastic as was Ali and connely...Connely appears so much older and Harder looking in this film than when I saw her many yrs ago..hard to tell if its the makeup or has she aged that way?

216,drunken_munki,Overated Hollywood mess,5,12 December 2020,"This movie simply looks confused and disjointed. The world of Iron City isn't depicted very well, often looking like a fun city with roller skating and coffee drinking on the promenade. But we're told it's a dangerous place when the strong feed on the weak.The movie is as generic as it gets, where the CGI looks frankly disturbingly bad even only after 1 year after release -- it already looks dated.The weird CGI model of the protagonist is the stupidest thing I've seen other than the Original 'Sonic' movie character design, and the entirety of 'Cats'. Interestingly all three of those travesties occurred in 2019. The big eye thing and the oddity of her mouth and teeth I just can't get passed.Now then, the character of the Doctor is broken compared to the Manga or the Anime, they didn't understand that he enjoyed killing and hunting bounties, for the thrill and the money. They tried to make him some sort of hippy grandfather who was also a robotics expert, and a prolific hunter.They make a big deal about Alita getting her hunting licence, but they do absolutely nothing with it in the whole movie. They instead focus on rollerball, a nonsensical although cool battle royal racing game. But three entire sequences of this in the movie is too much.Overall this is a mixed watch, and beyond the CGI spectacle it is quite shallow. The acting is average, and the characters are pretty boring really.5/10 an average action movie that removed the intrigue from the manga.",Alita - Battle Angel

Also the other side characters in the film are also very interesting and all play a great part in the film.The film does seem a little rushed at times and I also think we should of seen more of the main villain Nova but I think there setting up for a sequel.Motorball is amazing which is the fictional sport in the film and its awesome and a thrill to watch and watching it was like the first time I watched Pod Racing in Star Wars just a jaw dropping scene and every moment was great to see I think Video Game of Motorball would be a massive seller.
Forget Quittich and Pod Racing I want to play MotorballJust a great movie with a great story and awesome action scenes and perfection in Cgi this a great film for anyone who is a fan of scifi and cyperbunk.

224,coasterdude44,An incredible spectacle with some of the best CGI Mo-Cap so far in film history,9,17 February 2019,"This film was amazing. Everything from world/setting building and production design, there were moments of genuinely breathtaking cinematography and some very well done action sequences. Most of the cast we're great in the film aswell with Christoff Waltz again putting on a great performance who felt completely believable as the character he was playing.The character of Alita herself was also great and was such a complicated yet well constructed character and was very likeable as the female protagonist, it's highly likely that she will probably stay as being my favourite female film protagonist of the year behind Captain Marvel when it comes out. Her Motion Capture CGI was absolutely brilliant which was stunning in most of her scenes and borderline mesmerising in a few others. It's amazing to see how far the technology has come in the past few years and this movie kind of woke me up to realise that fact. CGI has now come to a point where it can now almost completely resemble live action without falling into the realm of uncanny valley now, which film audiences are going to now realise in the next oncoming decade and I'm now very excited to see how future films are going to use this technology to their advantage.
Overall, I thought this film was genuinely breathtaking and a breath of fresh air from the rest of the current movie trends going on at the moment. It was a near perfect manga adaptation which I really haven't seen since Edge of Tomorrow, with some great character development and worldbuilding, along with some groundbreaking special effects. It's not perfect, but I think it's safe and sane enough to call it a masterpiece and it's one of the very best from Robert Rodriguez.",Alita - Battle Angel

Taking into consideration the original source material, being a little kitsch; I wanted to love this, but it just didn't fulfil my expectations. Do not watch any of the trailers either, as it pretty much a spoiler.",Alita - Battle Angel
226,scb_coldsteel,"The best anime adaptation I've seen, but still not a great movie.",6,25 March 2019,"So I saw Alita Battle Angel at the theater. To be honest I was a bit apprehensive about seeing this movie. Hollywood has just not figured out how to make a great anime/manga adaptation. Overall Alita probably is the best adaptation I've seen. While that bar is pretty low, Alita is still a very entertaining action-packed film that is sure to entertain with its nonsensical action and graphics. Unfortunately it also suffers from a number of glaring flaws that will make this a highly polarizing film.The plot of Alita actually does a good job of following the manga. Alita begins the story as a seemingly frail amnesiac cyborg in a dystopian future gone wrong. As the story progresses however you are introduced to a myriad of badass action scenes that demonstrate Alita is not all that she seems. As Alita's past and present intertwine she must come to terms with her existence as she tries to find her place in this new world order.From there the plot progresses in a fairly typical anime/manga fashion. Realistically most of the plot points are an excuse to see cyborgs fight each other and to further explore the intricate cyberpunk world the film introduces. It may not be the most complex of plots, but I genuinely had fun watching the film.The action in this film will have you smiling the entire time. Of course all of the action scenes were ridiculous and over-the-top in the best way. I have never seen a film capture the action sequences and choreography of a manga so well before. Every few minutes you're introduced to another absurd villain for Alita to destroy and man is it satisfying to watch.On top of the nonstop action, I really enjoyed the setting and the overall atmosphere of the film. The dystopian cyberpunk setting was just really well done and intricate. The characters may have been one dimensional, but I was constantly entertained by the dark and gritty underbelly of the cyber city. Plus seeing a bunch of cyborgs destroy each other in roller derby is just as fun and insane as you would expect.Again, the movie just did a great job capturing the essence of the manga. It also certainly helps that Alita is visually stunning. It really is a very pretty film. You can definitely feel James Cameron's influence with the amazing and unique graphics. To give credit though Robert Rodriguez did something that I just have not seen done before in an adaptation. He made a film that aesthetically perfectly captures the insane world of anime in a seemingly believable and fun manner.So I had a blast watching Alita Battle Angel. If I rated movies purely on my personal enjoyment this would easily be a 9. However this film had multiple flaws that hurt the overall rating. While Robert Rodriguez captured all of the strengths of anime/manga he also left a lot of the weaknesses of the genre.The film had a superficial and bland group of villains that existed only to be destroyed. It was simply hard to care about the conflict in any real way. The overall conflict and the plot progression came second to the action and everything felt like an excuse to see more violence. Alita of course follows every anime cliche you can think of as a character and really is quite one-dimensional. It takes a lot of suspense away when you have such a overpowered character simply for the sake of being overpowered.I don't think there was a single character in the film that was well-developed either. Literally every character was a walking cliche. All of the relationships felt so weak and superficial. Particularly the romance which was terrible all around. Plus there were a few cringe-worthy scenes due to the very anime like dialogue that will have you rolling your eyes. The same goes for the predictable plot and the weak twists and thrills. This just wasn't a movie that had any level of innovation beyond aesthetics. These are all constant criticisms for anime and unfortunately none of these weaknesses were addressed for the adaptation.Alita is a difficult film to review. I really enjoyed the movie for a number of reasons. It is non-stop in-your-face action that really did an amazing job capturing the source material. It easily is the best example of Hollywood adapting a manga. Unfortunately the film also had a number of glaring weaknesses that hold the movie back. If you are a fan of anime or mindless action you are sure to enjoy Alita Battle Angel. If not however you are going to become bored quite quickly with a lack of a coherent plot or any kind of real character development. A 6.5 out of 10.",Alita - Battle Angel

I get that they were going for the naive yet dangerous, but it was really too much.I think if you are in the YA range, this would be a great movie. Younger than that and the violence is too much.

230,RhapsodyReviews,Well Done Movie.,9,24 November 2019,"Review:
'Alita: Battle Angel' is a cyberpunk-action film directed by Robert Rodriguez. It is based on the Japanese manga series 'Battle Angel Alita' by Yukito Kishiro.
I went into this movie not expecting much. It came out in January which is the month for a lot of garbage films, and I'm not a big fan of Japanese style action films. This one caught me be storm and surprised me beyond belief.
The film centers around the titular heroine Alita (Rosa Salazar), a cyborg who awakens in a new body with no memory of her past, so she sets out to uncover her destiny.
The shining star of the film is definitely Rosa Salazar as Alita. Throughout the movie Alita grows as a person and learns about sacrifice, loss, love and the horrors of the human mind. The rest of the cast are mediocre at best. Which is not a fault of the actor rather when the characters there were hired to play.
The world is 90% CGI, but it's beautiful. The action scenes in this movie are fantastic, probably the best I have seen all year, and this was a January movie. The story is a bit fast paced but not to a degree that it feels rushed.
Overall, I finished this movie excited to watch it again. It has great action, beautiful CGI and a heroine that you route for as soon as she is introduced.

I mainly saw this film because Christoph Waltz was in this. I'm sure I didn't spell his name right.The story of Alita is where it nearly falls flat. Christoph plays this doctor who repairs robots and limbs when he stumbles on Alita. So he repairs her and takes care of her as she tries to regain her memory. Then she meets some guy who looks like my friend Austin and she helps Christoph hunt for these cyborgs. There are a few twists here and there along the way, but overall it was a decent experience. I especially liked Alita who had enough personality to be likable.I hear it follows the manga quite well according to my friend. Like I said, it's good to experience just once and with not too many movies coming out in the month of February, Alita is about the only good one out of the whole month and it doesn't look like anything else is coming for the rest of it. Pretty sad.",Alita - Battle Angel
236,hunter-friesen,"""Alita"" Malfunctions Where it Matters",2,28 February 2019,"In the twenty-third century, a colossal war known as ""The Fall"" took place and wiped out a majority of the people and resources on Earth. The only two places that remain is the poverty-stricken wasteland of Iron City and the luxurious sky city of Zalem.Now in the year 2563, Dr. Dyson Ido scouts through the scraps and finds a broken female cyborg that appears to be a relic from the great war. After her body and human brain are repaired, she wakes up and is named Alita, the same name as the doctor's deceased daughter.Not remembering her past, Alita sets out to discover her past and the purpose that she serves in this divided time. Her journey takes her through the streets of Iron City as she interacts with a mix of both humans and robots each fighting to survive in the tough world.After years of lying dormant, Robert Rodriguez was appointed to direct this adaptation of the first four manga book in the ""Alita"" series.Best known for making fast and cheap films focused more on action than story, right away it becomes clear that Rodriguez was the wrong man for the job. Needlessly setting the pace to maximum overdrive and never looking back, Rodriguez blitzes past all the background information and shoves the audience straight into the narrative. Important questions are never answered or given a passing thought as the film either expects the audience to already know all the answers or to just not care enough to bother asking.Along with the fast-paced story comes some rapid action set pieces that share the same miserable fate. Keeping track of what is going on becomes a chore as the characters whisk around the screen with their superhuman abilities. Anyone wishing to see this in 3D should pack some ibuprofen.Despite being written by the usually brilliant James Cameron, the screenplay is filled with some of the most atrocious dialogue of the modern era. Cameron's ham-fisted approach towards the themes of humanity and morals are so predictable and cheesy that is sparks a feeling of nausea every time a character opens their mouth.Even weaker than the dialogue is the overall plot, which is absolutely incoherent with no rhyme or reason for anything. Even when Cameron tries to explain anything, he lazily falls into drab expository dialogue that creates more questions than it gives answers.""Alita: Battle Angel"" boasts a solid cast on paper, but the script fails to develop any of its characters in a meaningful way. Arcs and clear motivations are nonexistent as characters do whatever the script needs them to do even if it makes no sense.Quite possibly the worst part of the script and film as a whole is is the downright insulting cliffhanger ending. After answering zero questions and setting up nothing interesting, the film has the audacity to stare right at the audience and tell them that all will be revealed once they come back and pay more money.Fairing just a smidge better than other departments, the acting is still subpar across the board, which comes at a bit of a surprise considering the supporting roles are filled by three Oscar winners.Playing the titular character is Rosa Salazar, who does an alright job. She does pretty well at blending her human emotions and robotic body into a believable character, but she tends to overact during the most important scenes.Keean Johnson plays Hugo, a motorcycle riding drifter who gets romantically involved with Alita. Johnson is mostly just a pretty boy and is never able to make his character even tolerable enough to care about.Jennifer Connelly is very cold and stilted as Chiren, the ex-wife of Ido. Not speaking above a monotone, Connelly tries to make her character mysterious but ends up being boring and uninteresting.Both Christoph Waltz and Mahershala Ali are below average in their supporting roles as Ido and Vector, respectively. Each one doesn't really seem to care and just kind of pass through each scene with little energy.With Robert Rodriguez, James Cameron, and a $200 million production budget, ""Alita: Battle Angel"" proves yet again that money can't buy quality and that even the best talent in the industry can still make a truly awful film.",Alita - Battle Angel
237,MinistryofDoom,Fantastic special effects but mediocre story,7,9 July 2019,"This is the story about a female cyborg, named Alita, found ravaged and destroyed in a futuristic city's dump by a doctor who specializes in robotics and prosthetic limbs. He rebuilds her, she comes to life, and then she spends the rest of the film learning about her new world.Now the good and the bad. The good: This was a fantastic movie with mind-blowing special effects. Of course, Alita was directed by Robert Rodriguez and produced by James Cameron who lent Rodriquez the tech he used to create Avatar, and it shows. There are CGI films and then there is THIS, which surpasses many recent films in both quality and style. This film could have never been possible 20 years ago. There is just no way.
The bad: while film was great, mainly for its special effects and visuals, and set up a world that is so rich with life and wonderment that it demands further exploration, the story was, unfortunately, weak. Rodriguez meticulously created this world for us, yet he failed to put in the same amount of effort into creating the character of Alita, herself. By the film's abrupt end, we are left with many questions about who she is, where she came from, who created her, why she was created, what purpose she served, etc. Throughout the film, we are given bits and pieces but nothing quite so clear. The same goes for the antagonists of the film. It's not clear what the role of Jennifer Connelly's character is in the film nor what is her motivation. Likewise, we don't get to know what is behind the other antagonists all the way up to the top villain, who isn't even revealed until the very end.The film ends with no real conclusion to the story because there wasn't a coherent story. Sure, Alita battles a bunch of other cyborgs but she never goes head to head with her real enemy and so what we have is 2 hours of Alita discovering herself and her abilities and testing them out on random cyborgs.One final note: I understand the reason to give Alita her big anime-style eyes, knowing that the film itself was adapted from a manga and anime with a similar big-eye art style. However, the choice to have Alita be the ONLY character with this characteristic makes her look weird and out of place. Are we to simply accept that this is who she is and how she looks? Or do the other characters in this world acknowledge this strange uniqueness to her as well? If the choice to give her this characteristic is an aesthetic device to give nod to the film's anime/manga roots, then why is it that none of the other characters are done in this style?",Alita - Battle Angel

Finally good fight scenes and true cyber-punk story unlike the terrible Ghost in the shell adaptation.
They actually borrowed from a lot of different manga and steered way of original. original was really dark as its core was ""everyone will betray you"" and everyone did. almost all the characters in original went insane. Ido was not the saint he is here not even close))) So here we have princess warrior who everyone loves over themselves. i would say its a let down from a really dark and mature original.

243,gcsman,A worthy addition to the fantasy-adventure genre - dazzling and fun,7,18 February 2019,"Bottom line is, I enjoyed this film, and from a technical perspective it's practically flawless. In the landscape of fantasy/adventure movies this one lies somewhere between the outright techno-fantasy of Tron or Ready Player One, and a Marvel live-action superhero film. I liked the unhurried pacing of the scenes and linear storytelling. Stylistically, lots of scenes look like they've been lifted right out of the manga graphic novels that Alita is adapted from. Wide-angle establishing shots zoom in to extreme closeups; odd camera angles look at characters either from below or far above. It reminded me a lot of the ""Sin City"" pair of films with their ultra-faithful renditions of noir graphic novels. I assume that's no coincidence, since Alita's masterful director Robert Rodriguez was a co-director with Frank Miller on those two films as well. In spirit though, Alita is closest to the Blade Runner films, though mostly in sunlight rather than gloom.A lot has been made of how the central character, the young/old warrior girl Alita, has been rendered through CGI -- she's ""played"" by Rosa Salazar in the same motion-capture sense that Andy Serkis played Gollum in LOTR. But Alita is probably the most utterly convincing version of this technique that we've yet seen. Her luminous honey-gold eyes are big, but not TOO big. She has a terrific flashing smile but with a little overbite that's quite endearing. Her expressive face and voice are nuanced, natural, and convincing. Her cyborg body moves just like it should including the quicker-than-human pace that is crucial at many points in the action. And she has some real personality that the script takes at least a little time to explore. A key feature is that from the moment she first wakes up, with no memories of her past life and in a newly built artificial body, she acts with confidence and fearlessness (kind of like Wonder Woman ... but that's a comparison for another time). At heart she's an uncomplicated teenager but is instinctively drawn to action and conflict, befitting the warrior heritage that she gradually (re)discovers. Her unflinching moral stance (""I do not stand by in the presence of evil"") is refreshing. The whole plot motors along in a satisfying way, finishing up on a path that is an obvious setup for sequels.So why do I rate this only 7/10? This isn't intended to be a bad rating, it's just because -
The plot and message aren't exactly deep or new; we've had this kind of storyline many times before. A hero (in this case a partly-human one who rather incidentally happens to be a girl; her gender is not the point) comes to terms with her immense inbuilt capabilities, takes on a series of villains with emerging confidence, grows as a person with accompanying pain and loss. The technical rendition is in a sense the driving purpose of the movie, and that's OK. It just doesn't cut any deeper.How many future-dystopian cities do we have to sit through? Iron City is not too much different from Blade Runner or a dozen other descendants. Can't we have a setting that's some sort of balance between ugly dystopia and fantasy utopia?Many plot elements just happen with little continuity or logic (there is a sensible overarching plot arc, but I'm talking here about scene-to-scene details). This is actually a problem borrowed, but not fixed, from comics and anime, which have that issue as well.Similarly, a fair bit of background goes unexplained. How did Alita's brain survive intact for 300 years? Why was the Martian-colony alliance attacking Earth? How did Earth society get organized around those levitating cities in the first place? And so forth. But all of this is easy to ignore as we go along for the ride.Finally, I enjoyed the sly little lead-in -- the ""20th Century Fox"" logo morphs into a dark, eroding ""26th Century Fox"" version of itself as the action starts in the dystopian Iron City where everything plays out.",Alita - Battle Angel

The only thing in here way is a group of people that don't like Alita.Alita: The Battle Angel was a fun action-packed thriller. It wasn't by all means a perfect movie but it did its job in entertaining people for its runtime. I thought in general the CGI was good. Alita looked great for almost the entire movie. There was a scene when they were in the water that didn't look too good. Also a scene at the end. You will know what I am talking about if you have seen the movie. I thought the acting was good. Christoph Waltz is a great actor and he should get so more love. They did a great job adapting the film to live action. I never saw the anime but I thought it was pretty clean. The soundtrack was excited too. Also the slower scenes were emotional all because of the soundtrack. The other things I didn't like that I didn't say earlier was there were some flashbacks that I thought were pointless. I didn't think they had to show it. As you saw in Jaws they didn't need the flashback to make it scary and not make you want to go on a boat. Too much films use pictures for flashbacks instead of just saying them like in Jaws.Overall, I thought Alita: The Battle Angel was a fun movie to watch if you like Anime and maybe sci-fi.",Alita - Battle Angel
248,eelen-seth,Vivid sci-fi epic that lives up to its potential while leaving you wanting more,8,12 February 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel takes place 300 years after the Fall - one of those sci-fi apocalypses they don't tell you a lot about, so the big reveal at the end surprises you. When we first meet Alita (Rosa Salazar), our heroine doesn't even know her real name. She is discovered in a scrapyard by Dr. Ido (Christoph Waltz), a surgeon who mainly works on cyborgs and humans with metal parts. Suffering from amnesia, Alita quickly realizes that she can assassinate anyone who crosses her path like its her destiny.Iron City, a near-dystopia right underneath the aerial city Zalum, is an overcrowded metropolis. Most of its inhabitants dream of ascending to the supposed paradise above them, but the only way up is by becoming the final champion of a dangerous sport called motorball. Most of its competitors are here to score points to get to that number one spot on the scoreboard, and are willing to kill for it. The motorball sequences are thrilling and fast.Alita discovers her hidden abilities by accident and wants to start using them more so she can remember who she really is. In brief flashbacks, slowly the bigger picture becomes clearer as we progress through the story. Her past and what exactly is going on up there in Zalum, are the two main mysteries. She is something else, something different and in many ways superior. But she's also capable of human emotion - love hurts.This is the first leading role for Rosa Salazar (who's most recent role was in Netflix's Bird Box), but her performance - which is completely motion-capture - is aside of Andy Serkis, one of the most impressive I've ever seen. She embodies the character and you can't help but feel and root for her. Supporting cast includes Jennifer Connelly, Ed Skrein, Jackie Earle Haley and most importantly the always sophisticated Mahershala Ali who only has a small role, but an important one, as the bad guy who's possessed as a vessel by the mostly unseen villain.Producer James Cameron, who has been wanting to direct Alita for the last 20 years, also co-wrote the film. The reason why he didn't direct this one is because his Avatar-sequels are taking up all of his time.Robert Rodriguez has showed us potential with Desperado and Sin City, but after going quiet for 5 years (his last film was the unsatisfying sequel to Sin City), he's back and better than ever before. ""Alita: Battle Angel"" is a vivid sci-fi epic that lives up to its potential while leaving you wanting more.",Alita - Battle Angel
249,hoernkeem,"Alita: Battle Angel review (2019, Robert Rodriguez) Superlative special effects, but languishing story",6,11 February 2021,"Alita: Battle Angel (2019, Robert Rodriguez)
I think 'Alita' is a bit maligned due to poor box office performance, but overall I thought this was quite a good science fiction action film. I was worried about it a bit with it being so visual effects heavy up to and including the main character being a vfx character, but Alita and the world around her is stunningly rendered and realized. The story itself sets up well if it is not completely delivered on during the course of the film. The world they inhabit is Iron city. It is an industrial, dystopian wasteland that feels genuine and lived in. Dr. Ido, played by Christoph Waltz, stumbles across a partial cyborg on a scrap heap that he repairs and dubs Alita. Alita awakes with no memory and with Ido's help along with newly made friend she begins to learn about the world as well as who and what she is. Very quickly we realize that she is not normal as she can maneuver and fight with sublime skill. In the sky above Iron City exists a supposed utopia in the form of floating city Zalem. Many have dreams of escaping to Zalem, although getting there is somewhat of an impossible task. As I said the basic story here is good although there is a bit of convenience in how Ido comes to have a body that the cyborg Alita inhabits. They also too quickly try to wrap her story into a love story and while it works alright I think the story may have been better suited to leaving the love story angle on the sidelines. The fight sequences are very well choreographed and look exceedingly good especially considering most are almost entirely vfx sequences. There is one major glaring flaw to this movie and that is it has eyes on a larger story (as in more movies) and thus this film ends with a whimper. It is relying on additional stories that may or may not happen in the future to complete its narrative, and while I don't mind dreaming big you still have to have a story that has a complete narrative structure otherwise you are going to just leave the audience with an empty, hollow feeling which is quite a shame because there is a lot in 'Alita' to enjoy.

understand their children. And the puppy love between Alita and Hugo remind me the school time which everyone had happen. The fighting scene consist kung-fu martial art which make you glue tight to yr seat with full bladder and cross fit Yr leg. This is not a movie that make u laugh off Yr seat but will leave a shoulder updown with sweet smirk master lip. Alita influence those around her, the most is Hugo who want to make use of her at the start but feel guilt at the end and chose to follow her. and I think the best performance for this movie is Rosa Salazar who bring Alita to life.

253,EasternZZ,Good movie with some very terrible cliche romantic dialogue,7,16 February 2019,"This movie has some of the coolest ""anime style"" fights scenes of all time. The very first fight scene in the alley is incredible, and there is a fight scene in a junk yard that is pretty amazing too. The acting by Christopher and the girl that plays Alita are good, and the special effects are once again incredible.Bad thing is that this movie is very long, and the pacing is bad. When it feels like the movie is about to end, something new comes up and another 10 minutes go by, it feels like the movie is ending, but nope, here comes another subplot.The absolute worst thing about this movie is that the dialogue is pretty cringy, and I actually twisted and turned at some of the TERRIBLE romantic extremely cheesy ""love"" dialogue. How many times do we have to see a person say ""because.....because I love you,"" right before their death? Jesus Christ man, that was bad. Made me cringed in my seat. The romantic plot seems like just a tiny thing, but towards the end it takes center stage, and we are supposed to believe that Alita is willing to sacrifice herself for this guy that she has only know for like one month maybe (she doesn't, but she is willing to). There are just scenes that do not mesh well together, how an evil person suddenly becomes good out of the blue, or how Alita sees this guy and suddenly is in love with him. It happens so suddenly. and she is a robot, he is a human. How are they supposed to have sex?!The story is pretty thin, Alita wants to recover her memories while this evil guy you know nothing about wants his goons to kill Alita because she is the last of her kind. It doesn't get much deeper than that, and at the end you realized that the movie doesn't really have a real plot. Characters do things simply because they wanna go to the Sky City, that is basically it. No real development besides Christopher Waltz and Alita.Here is something that I laughed at hard, a character dies in the movie and everyone is sad, then he gets revived and everyone is happy, then he dies again. That was funny, he got revived only to basically die in the lamest way ever.If there is a sequel, PLEASE DEAR LORD DO NOT ADD A ROMANTIC SUBPLOT TO THIS STORY. Make it a straight up revenge movie, no cheesy love.Honestly, the action is a 10/10

He puts her back together and treats her as his daughter..Really good science fiction flick. Would have enjoyed it a lot more if I'd been forewarned that it was part one of a series. Cos: it doesn't really end. With a little research I could have discovered this. I've not read the source material but I do know that Alita was originally a Manga series. (Japanese graphic art novels.) It seems Cameron is bringing the first four books to the cinema.In eastern stories it's a tradition that any hero is the last practitioner of a secret, killer martial art. In Alita's case this is Panzer Kunst which means Tank Art according to the online translator. So that's OK. She also, predictably, has no memory of her past which means we can go on a voyage of growth and discovery together. So that's OK too.The story is set in the South American, Iron City in the shadow of a gigantic floating station (space elevator technology) three hundred years after a great war. So: post apocalyptic dystopia. There is a blend of architectures, super cyberpunk characters, ruins and fragments of forgotten technologies. It looks great. The CGI is fantastic.There is plenty of action blended with decent character development. The story evolves slowly and I was wondering where it was going. I only realised the story was going to another movie when that titles came up.We get introduced to the brutal spectator sport of Motorball. The carnage is more important than the score. I could have happily watched more of that. The winner gets a ticket to the space station, but that's another film.For me this film lost a point in the last two scenes where it spoils its own conclusion and then sets up the next chapter.Do you need to watch it in 3D?

And this is exactly the case of 'Alita: Battle Angel'. Can't say whether it's the story or the storytelling but it looks bad.I have to say that given the production budget, I have expected more from the CGI either. And same goes for the fights, which were well executed but lacked originality and intensity. Such problem often occurs when the lead character is much stronger than her opponents or just when the outcome is foreknown.The major exception is Alita. Awesome acting, awesome movements and her CGI. They really invested in her character.",Alita - Battle Angel
265,joshbarton15,One of the best looking films I've seen in IMAX,8,17 February 2019,"Went in expecting very little and came out having a helluva time at the cinema with Alita: Battle Angel, a film planned by James Cameron since before he even started on Avatar, which as we know in the land of Hollywood is a helluva long time. It took me a while to adjust to Alita's big-eyed look but once I got that out of the way, I felt she became such a great character to get behind as she pounds and smashes her way to the truth about her origins. Rosa Salazar grows much more into the role as the film proceeds, her confidence as an actress mirroring the growing strength of Alita, while the rest of the cast certainly enjoy themselves too, Mahershala Ali looking like a villain ripped right from a 90s action film and loving it. The film looks stunning as well, the visuals bringing the pages of the manga to life, particularly during the pretty insane action sequences that will surely see this film sweep visual effect awards when it can be nominated, and if it was eligible and hasn't been nominated this awards season, what a joke that is.",Alita - Battle Angel

I thought only the eyes were CGI.The story itself is ok, nothing special.One thing I don't get is how romance can form between a human and a cyborg. It is obvious the cyborg is not meant to procreate, by observing her anatomy when she was not fully clothed. So why would a man be interested in her? And why would she be interested in a man?Jennefer Connelly character is kind of wasted. It could be any actress and wouldn't make much difference.

Great acting of everyone involved (aside maybe from robbing teenagers). There were so many recent disappointments, such as Mortal Engines, Aqua-man and Captain Marvel, so I was so surprised to get this breath of fresh air.

That film was The Matrix. No I have come out of the theater with the same feeling of exhilaration. This film has a lot to share with Rodriguez first work in comic book world, Sin City: They are both very loyal to the source material, and they both went for broke, overloading the viewer with several storylines that took a few books to develop in the source material. This was the movie's only mistake, as it didn't give any of the characters room to breathe. The actors, however, pulled their weight. Rosa Salazar's breakthrough performance is the highlight, but Oscar winners Christoph Waltz, Marheshala Ali, and even Jenniffer Connelly were great, the later even with the little material they gave her. The comparison to The Matrix comes with the fantastic world building that would take repeated views to sink in, the fantastic, almost groundbreaking visual effects, and the breathtaking action sequences.

271,domtaylor,Its stunning visuals can't help the fact that its narrative is a complete and utter mess.,5,14 February 2019,"The animation is excellent and some of the action sequences are entertaining, but the narrative of 'Alita: Battle Angel' is, quite frankly, a mess. It's got a very strange structure and pacing that makes it very hard to be invested in anything that's happening. A lot of things occur, but there's never any feeling of narrative movement. The main conflict is unclear and the overabundance of characters makes it very difficult to understand who each person is in relation to the plot. In the majority of cases, characters are introduced, have a few scenes and leave, having made no impact on the wider narrative at all, leaving you wondering why they were even included in the first place. It also makes a really bizarre decision, once it reaches its logical narrative conclusion, to add a very rushed extra ending (which doesn't just wrap things up but actually introduce new elements) that condenses what could be at least 30 minutes of entertaining footage to around 10 badly edited ones. Initially, I thought that this section - despite how bizarre it felt - would end up being the 'sequel-bait' and that that's why it is so rushed, however at the end of it pretty much everything (except from one loose-end signalled after a bad time jump) is wrapped up so they even missed the opportunity to leave things more open for a potential sequel. It's not just its bizarre pacing that lets it down, though, as it's actually quite boring for a lot of its runtime, filled with on-the-nose exposition and offers nothing new to the genre. It's a shame, too, because it's visually stunning and, with all the talent involved, had the potential to be a lot better. 5/10",Alita - Battle Angel

They've pulled one of the best films this year with incredible visual effects and CGI work that give this film a beautiful setting and background.The visual effect of Alita (voiced by Rosa Salazar) we're incredibly done giving detail in her eyes which made her character on screen look more like an actual human actress. Her character and acting is what made this film, they give her a human soul and a purpose with the writing which is so well done, it gives the audience an emotional journey of a young woman trying to discover who she is.The love interest side of the film is so done right it doesn't feel forced as well which along with its action sequences as well as it supporting cast was nothing short of perfect. The story does a great job of not revealing too much to earlier as slowly building up characters so you understand the story and draws you into every moment, this is matched by the awesome fight scenes and great formidable villains of the film adding to incredible film.This is one of those films that deserves a sequel and to be a successful film as of what they've realised here is one of the best live action anime films, with a damn near perfect if it was for slight pacing issue that doesn't really affect the film but is noticeable.Does it live up to the hype? HELL YES this film live up to the hype this is a must to watch on teh big screen hopefully were see a sequel come from it because it so needs it.Dislikes: The only flaw I spotted as ive said there was a slight issue with pacing, not that it affects the film in any way but was noticeable.",Alita - Battle Angel
275,rabbitmoon,"Simply not engaging, the worst kind of screenwriting.",3,14 February 2019,"Alita feels like a 10 hour TV season that has been fan-edited into 2 hours. If you were a fan of the season, you wouldn't mind, because it might be fun to just chop around between episodes you remember loving.As a film though, you don't have this reference, so there is no clear arc to be aware of in the background. What you suspect would be a whole majestic episode about Alita being taken to the sunken ship, and discovering the suit is cut down into a few significant but flippant minutes culminating in a character saying ""that can't be good"" as she walks out of the water. Every potential story is treated like this, casually chopped to pieces and inter-spliced with the other.As a result, you can't engage or care about any particular element. You won't get those 'Iron Man' feelings of Alita finally emerging victorious with her battlesuit, because the build-up and empathy just isn't there. You won't feel the philosophical soul of AI or Ghost in the Machine, because there is no room for her confusion or self-awareness to breathe. You won't feel any anxiety or tension in the fight-scenes, because you've seen the slick-CGI-pre-vis'd beyond all credibility so many times before you know there is nothing really at stake.You've seen every element before, but delivered with more story-telling skill. If you have any sense of taste, judgement or cinema whatsoever, you'll be distracted by thinking what this project could have been, if someone had actually ADAPTED the source material rather than been intimidated by it and thrown everything at the wall to see what sticks.Its cheesy, corny, bland, vanilla, generic and predictable in all the ways you deeply hope we've moved beyond. Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey feels wildly interesting and inventive in comparison. Its certainly more SPY KIDS (the sequels even) than Avatar (and I'm no Avatar fan-boy).",Alita - Battle Angel

277,pal05052003,Action sci-fi/ anime adaptation/ superhero story done right.,9,26 February 2019,"To me, Alita: Battle Angel is an action sci-fi/anime adaptation/superhero movie. I was initially freaked out by promotional photos of her huge anime eyes and the title sounded weird. Even, having James Cameron attached to the project as co-producer did not allay doubts. However, trickling positive reviews, and learning that it was directed by Robert Rodriguez, I was beginning to get interested. I mainly watched it to see if Hollywood could break the anime adaptation curse. After watching it, I was really amazed. First, Alita's oversized eyes did not distract from the but highlighted the fact that she was a cyborg; which made the character more poignant, considering her innocence and human reaction. This is no doubt because of Rosa Salazar's amazing performance. Second, there are many entertaining villains. The bests were Ed Skrein's cyborg bounty hunter Zapan, and Jackie Earle Haley's imposing Grewishka. Though Alita is a much better fighter, both actors exude an air of menace in their own way, providing a credible challenge to Alita, Skrein's Zapan is s formidable fighter but also very smart. Haley's Grewishka is much larger than Alita and provides a menacing presence. Mahershala Ali as the boss villain is also great and how he switches from Vector to Nova is seamless. Third, all action scenes are packed with emotions. The trailer shows stylized fight scenes but when watching the movie, there is a clear reason behind the actions, and every strike or high flying move is an expression of Alita's feelings. Fourth, this story has actual character development. Throughout the movie Alita evolves as a character and as cyborg. Her motivation drives the story, and only through Salazar's brilliant performance was this movie able to deliver on so many levels. To me the movie starts off like the Bourne Identity meets AI meets Running Man. If you have seen these movies you will get what I mean. What makes the movie great is how Alita can be very innocent and vulnerable while having the ability to dispatch any threat easily. Besides all the action, the movie has some truly heart wrenching moments too, and the movie leaves enough questions for us to want more while feeling satisfied with the ending of the first part.
God, I hope this movie succeeds because I want to see the sequel. I actually enjoyed it more than Aquaman.",Alita - Battle Angel

Packed full of content, yet there is hardly any substance. Cliche romance story about teenagers who fight against the baddies. Nothing more, nothing less.Characters 3/10: Inconsistent characters. Villains don't have personalities. They just fight or otherwise exist so that our main characters have reason to exist. Alita is generic teenager. Love interest is a combination of cringe and your typical teenage girl's crush. Majority of characters don't think or follow any logic, their decisions are just tools to move the plot towards preferred direction.Visuals 6/10: Without a doubt the strongest part. Unique world is captured well in camera. Fight scenes are decent, same with the overall design.Sounds 5/10: Nothing special. Nothing stands out. Follows the average audio that everyone expects from modern movies.Acting 5/10: Pretty much the exact same as with sounds. Decent cast picks, but no one shines above the rest with their acting or persona.
Overall, those who have any capabilities for critical thinking and come with some type of standards won't find many praise-worthy things from this movie. It's watchable but seriously lacking flick and clearly below average quality movie due to its poor characterization and script which practically anyone who has even mildly functioning brain could have written. 4/10.",Alita - Battle Angel

There are a few unnecessary filler romantic and noir scenes, but they are forgivable due to the incredible fighting scenes, editing, special effects and gymnastics. The story is incredible, with the repressed memories alluding to the protagonist's past.

283,residentgrigo,Better than (nearly) all US manga adaptions but still underwhelming,6,10 February 2019,"This is almost the best US life action adaptation of manga/anime to date but i was never bored with deliberately trashy Death Note, so it still somehow takes that ""crown"". Cameron ultimately sunk too much money into this project over 2 decades to do an actual adaption at this point. This film could first of all loose about 30 minutes and don´t get me started on the changes they made to Alita´s adoptive father Ido to make him more relatable. Basically everyone got reduced to a cliche. Gone is the R-rated content, the moral ambiguity, the slow roll out of the lore and so on. Everything is spoon fed and over explained to guarantee that every single market and demographic imaginable can follow along. The endless expositions is rather clunk too. The same goes to the occasionally bewildering sequel/prequel hooks. The strong visuals and some of the performances ultimately save the film, as a lot of passion went into this production. The often complex choreography and the mo-capped facial expression stand out too. The films further managed to nail the manga´s ultra detailed and out there look.Alita: Battle Angel is obviously twice the film Ghost in the Shell 2017 (the horror) or Fist of the North Star 1995 (shudder) are, so the standards for US adaptation are clearly moving forward but don´t expect anything more than a sub-PG-13 B-movie with a 200 mil budget. The classic manga frankly deserves better and i say that as a fan of the adult targeted Rodriguez films. I will continue to wait for at least a 26 episode anime that adapts the original 9 volumes run. This film is a solid stop gat to that day but i don´t think that anyone will cry out for the full trilogy the producer keeps bringing up. I would watch a less cookie cutter and edgier sequel though.

285,mitchell5954,Best Live Action Anime Adaptation I've Seen,9,19 February 2019,"Alita Battle Angel is the latest live action anime film, this time under the hands of James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez. So, the film at least has a budget behind it. Is the film good, or does it join the long list of terrible live action anime adaptations. I'm pleased to say the film is good or, dare I say, great. It's not perfect, but it's certainly better than the critics at RT are making it out to be. If you like Battle Angel, or anime in general, you should definitely see this.Battle Angel was originally a manga from 1980s, which I've admittedly not read. In 1993, the year I was born, a two part ova was made which I have seen. The ova covers the first two volumes of the manga from what I know. The ova is good for what it is, but sadly the series never continued, until now.When I heard James Cameron planned to make a Battle Angel movie back in 2010 I was really excited, despite me not liking Avatar. For nine years I've waited for this movie. Battle Angel is one of the few anime of its kind that can work in live action. In fact, it's already been done before. The film Elysium was exactly what I thought a Battle Angel movie would look like in live action.Though, I was cautiously optimistic for a few reasons. One being that live action anime films don't have the best track record, (to put it nicely) especially ones made by in America. The only one I think has been good was the Ghost in the Shell live action film, and many even disagree on that. Also James Cameron's track record over the past two decades hasn't been too hot (same goes for Robert Rodriguez). I love most of Cameron's early films, but Titanic is a mixed bag, and I'm not a fan of Avatar at all. The film also experienced heavy delays having originally supposed to debut in 2017, but was pushed back until this year. All these were big red flags against the film, but luckily it was worth the wait.The plot is the same as the ova. The story takes place in the far future in Iron City where the societal outcasts live. Above it is the floating city of Salem where the rich and powerful dwell. A scientist named Ido discovers an incomplete cyborg, with a human brain, in the trash dump and decides to repair her, giving her a new body. He names the cyborg Alita. As Alita explores the world around her she meets a boy named Yugo who dreams of going to Salem. Anything further would delve into spoilers.Is this film as good as the ova? No. It's even better. This movie is everything the ova is and more. It's a much more fleshed out story, though still incomplete. Alita and Ido are much more fleshed out here as characters. The ova was much more violent and grizzly (like most 90s ovas) but that's easy to look past. The film was violent enough. The film also goes into the lore surrounding the world and Alita's character that the ova never touched on. I'm assuming these are things revealed later on in the manga past the ova. Alita and Yugo's relationship is given much more time to bloom which makes their love story more impactful, especially in the end. I'm actually surprised they kept the ending from the ova. I thought they would've altered it for sure.The film looks really good, especially for live action anime standards. It doesn't look as visually stunning as Avatar, but the effects are still above average. The original ova looked good for the 90s, but the animation looks dated now. I've waited to see this done with state of the art effects, which James Cameron always does well. The action is spectacular; definitely superior to the anime.There are a couple issues I have with it. One isn't an issue if there is a sequel to this, but that's on shaky ground right now. Firstly, Yugo isn't as fleshed out here as the anime. That's the one thing the film does worse than the ova. They have his prime goal of going to Salem, but they omitted his backstory entirely.Secondly, there's this big villain named Nova who is not very fleshed out either. I suppose he's the main villain of the manga series. His entire is story is being saved for the sequel, and as a result the movie ends on a cliffhanger we may never see resolved. The movie is not doing well in the states at all. Hopefully it will make enough money worldwide to justify a sequel, like with Pacific Rim. Otherwise, this will be a read the manga sort of ending, which sucks. It's frustrating enough when anime adaptations do that. I've wanted to read the manga for the longest, but never got around to it. If this film doesn't get a sequel I'm going to have to check it out to see how the story ends.Overall, Battle Angel is a great, fun move, and possibly the best live action anime film yet. If you love anime you owe it to yourself to see this, even if you're unfamiliar with Battle Angel.",Alita - Battle Angel

292,Michael Kenmore,Rejected snail mail to Mr. Cameron on why the film is fatally flawed and tepid,5,14 February 2019,"(As the established movie reviewer, I urge you to ignore these highly rated reviews here, that are obvious plants with the notation of the only one single movie review within the username's account praising this particular movie. Here's my postage mail to Mr Cameron via his production company Lightstorm Entertainment that was rejected as returned to me unopened and unforwardable.)""Dear Mr. Cameron, et al, as the acting producers of the film Alita: Battle Angel:I am an ordinary moviegoer, and many years ago - 20 years prior - I have read the original manga series of Battle Angel Alita as translated to English and released by Viz in the 90's as well as viewed the OVA of the same title, which was not quite good.I saw the sneak preview of Alita: Battle Angel (abbrev: ABA) on the evening of January 31st. Enclosed is the proof of the ticket as redeemed by the pass voucher for myself and my attorney friend, who loves going to the movies as much as I do.As your fan as well as the manga series, I wish to offer the constructive feedback regarding the quality of the film.While I think you and everyone did a good job on ABA, I have a concern about the structure of the film, especially the last 1/3 story portion of the movie.The movie began very well, then it ""deflates"" after the latter half, that lends to the excessive subplot crossovers.Moreover, this excess story crossover lends to the ""condensed"" plotting that felt out of place and redundant. I know ABA condenses the first three volumes of the manga. Maybe it's the script problem that decide to rush to wrap up toward the conclusion. Maybe it's R.R.'s freestyle energetic directing style that could not overcome how ""generic"" the rushed nature of the last one-third movie felt.Moreover, the characters ""Vector"" and ""Chiren"" are somewhat underdeveloped in regards to the backstory that seems inexplicably absent or underdeveloped in characterization.Consequently, I felt let down by what felt like the rushed portions in the myriad of subplots that lend to the underdevelopment of certain characters other than the main protagonist Alita.The actress Rosa Salazar did an excellent job portraying Alita. However, there was too much emoting that seems saccharine and, therefore, that detracts from the story.I offer the simple suggestions to improve the first film, which obviously opens the door to the sequels if the movie will be a box office success.Fix the {muddled} latter half of the film to be ""less condensed and intertwined with subplots"" by inserting the edits to give the viewers the ""breathing space,"" with the scenes added - if retrieved as cut from the theatrical version for pacing and story flow reasons - to explain the backstory of Vector and Chiren rather than leave it ambiguous and underdeveloped that might leave the viewers dissatisfied.As for the proposed sequels, trust the emotional impact of the story - as adapted from the manga - to touch the audiences, while simultaneously refraining from the saccharine element of Alita with frequent tear-shedding, which in the first film seems rather redundant and over the top in manipulating the audience, which seems almost dishonest.Based on my impression of ABA at the sneak preview in IMAX 3-D (despite the printed movie ticket that says ""2D""), while overall it's good, I noted the fatalistic flaws of the completed theatrical version that could harm the box office potential that depends on the word of mouth - not just the superfinicky movie critics.The late great screenwriter William Goldman said, ""Nobody knows anything,"" regarding the movies' potential to be the box office blockbusters. In this case, Goldman's wisdom applies to ABA, which concerns me greatly that it could be a box office flop (according to The Wrap's recent article) which would terminate the sequel planning. (...)If ABA does not do well at the box office, then there are the myriad of reasons. Cinemascore is your first answer to evaluate.Your film Titanic is one of the rarest movies to have scored ""A+ rating."" Second answer is to ask the fans and friends for the input what particular flaws that might undermine the quality of the movie. This is to suggest the resolution, if the deleted scenes will reinsert to resolve the story and aesthetic editing problems. Or, the pick-up shots (of course, with the expense added) to further develop the characters and to lighten the frenetic pacing of the last one-third of the movie, toward greater impressions that would materially help the box office net gross potential of the planned sequels to recoup the production and marketing expenditures.Expanded cut of ABA -- to be released later in theater (if the theatrical cut of ABA succeeds) or on video - with the suggested resolutions would give the fans and casual movie viewers the satisfactory story resolution to make the sequels more anticipated.I wish your film ABA a good success based on the word of mouth. And it's one of the very last films distributed by your long-time producing partner 20th Century Fox prior to merging with The Walt Disney Company. (...)Best wishes for ABA's B.O. success despite its noted flaws.""",Alita - Battle Angel

294,SimonD1900,Visually delicious,7,1 March 2020,"I have to say visually this movie is stunning. And it has an interesting and entertaining storyline. Which is pretty straight forward and constantly moving in a steady phase with a few flashbacks. It's set far in the future, so far that in reality anything would be possible, we could never predict what the world will look like in 500 years, then again probably not like this, but who knows? But we don't get so much information about what has happened to the world. Only that once there was a big war. And now people live in a city called Iron City and above is Zalem, the Sky City, howering above it. Everybody in Iron City thinks Zalem is the place to be, it's this mysterious place were the elite is living.Sidenote:
You kind of wonder if it was from the manga that this movie is based upon, that gave Neill Blomkamp the idea for Elysium? Either way, the idea and concept, of a unreachable higher place everyone wants to live in, is something everyone today can relate to. We all dream of being rich and vealthy, we all think there must be something better, that others have it better then us and it's all about achieving, to get there to that place, to be at the top. The grass is always greener on the other side. I mean not everybody thinks like this, but many do and I think we all can relate in some way to this thought or feeling anyway.In Iron City, there is a doctor and engineer (Christopher Wallts) who finds an android girl in a scrap yard. She is completely broken down but has a human brain and has fallen from Zalem. He takes her back home and fixes her, she comes alive and she is like an innocent child almost, with no memory of her past. He becomes her father figure and care taker. And I have to say that Christopher Wallts gives a good, emotional and charming performance in this movie.But it is at this point we are presented with this movies big protagonist, Alita (Rosa Salazar). First I have to say that Alita is to date the most well made and intriguing cgi character, that has been played by an actor with the technology of motion capturing and face rendering. I would say second place is Gollum/Smeagul in Lord of the Rings and then Neytiri in Avatar. Rose Salazar does a wonderful job here and she manage to give life to Alita, in a very charming and emotional way. And she looks like a real life manga character, a kind of different, freaky but cool look. And everything about the cgi is great looking, to the facial expressions, to the hair, body movement and lightning. Looks good. She looks good.As a character Alita is an extremely positive person. A bit naiv and innocent but full of curiosity, joy and lust for life. She quickly falls in love with a young boy (Kean Johnson) who is a good guy but at the same time a bit of a bad boy in the neighborhood. He dreams of going to Zalem one day and is into the sport Motorball, which is a crazy and violent game they have in Iron City. He becomes interested in Alita when he learns she is from Zalem. And he invites her to his life and friends. Kean Johnson is one of the pretty much unknown actors in this movie and is given a big role for this movie, since the love story is a big part of the story and Alita's journey and character development also. And I have to say, he isn't terrible but he can't quite carry it.Now, there is many other things going on in this movie and I won't go through every detail. Mostly beacuse I don't want to spoil it for anyone that hasn't seen it yet. But I will mention that there is some other more known actors in this movie, like Jennifer Connelly and Mahershala Ali. And they both give solid performances, even though they are not in the movie that much and their characters are only briefly explored. Which is a bit disappointing and something I think the movie suffers a tiny bit beacuse of. Then again, I guess they just didn't want to make it a 3 hour movie, which is their choice and somewhat understandable. You could actually asume they had to make a lot off choices when they were conjuring the plot up, but who knows?Alita: Battle Angel, by James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez, works like an action packed entertaining spectacle that almost always moves with a steady pace, even though the pacing has some hickups along the way. It's a sci-fi/fantasy with perhaps some new elements to the mix, but still a bit predictable with a well know formula. The protagonist Alita is the mayor part of the entire movie, it's all about her and she is a strong and very likeable character. Visually the movie is fantastic to look at.But it falls a bit short in character development and story telling. It brushes over information about the world and characters so briefly that it becomes a bit too shallow. It also has points in the plot were it doesn't make sense and the movie becomes a bit stupid. I could actually give one example without spoiling too much: At one point they all of a sudden can talk to each other via some sort of radio communication in their heads, but moments earlier, there were a problem they couldn't do just that. No explanation given. A couple of other few things like this happens, when you kind of go, what? How? Why? But it doesn't ruin the movie or take away from the actual expirence this movies is trying to give its viewer. Which is a visually expirence of action and entertainment. Which I think it succeeds at.And indeed, Alita is the strongest part of this movie, hence it has a pretty fitting name. And she is the only character that really is explored, that we really get to know and also see strong emotions from. Henceforth, she carries the movie completely. And does so very well. She gives a flair and pulse to this movie that otherwise would be kind of stiff. But she is a bit like superman, completely unstoppable and fearless but at the same time innocent and absolutely good morraly. But I think that actually is cool, I've heard that some complains about this fact, it's like if Neo would understand he's the chosen one in the beginning of Matrix. But I actually enjoyed Alita being unbeatable, it's just fun to watch her kick some behinds. Beacuse her ""weakness"" or more so vulnerability lies in her emotions and compassion. Which makes Alita a very endearing character. But I hope, if they make a follow up movie, she gets more of a challenge next time. And perhaps even gets challanged mentally in the way that's she perhaps has to explore some of her dark sides even.Anyway, this is far from a perfect movie. And somewhat with lesser depth then one would perhaps prefer. But I still think it's well deserved of 7/10. It's in many ways a visual accomplishment with and amazing world and a fabulous cgi character as the lead. And just a fun watch.If they will make a second one. I personally will definitely pay to see it in the theater. No doubt",Alita - Battle Angel
295,CriticalOfEverything,A very love it or hate it film.,4,12 February 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel has a clumsily put together story that is very by the numbers, badly written characters and CG that isn't very special, not bad but not good but surprisingly not even mediocre. This film is definitely a fun action film, I'll give it that, but it doesn't come close to being as great as the source material. You'll either love this film because of the action, or hate it/dislike it due to the inconsistencies in storytelling and characters. I'm down the middle with this, but definitely leaning a bit more towards the negative side of it, watch this if you want, but it's not a very special film. It's just mindless fun and that's fine, but mindless fun also needs to be competent in what it wants to be, which is why movies like Kingsman and John Wick succeed and this doesn't.",Alita - Battle Angel

and I have to say I was bored for the first hour or so because nothing happend it was mostly talking and it had less then 10 min of action in that hour also i didn't really care at all for any of the characters they were all boring and as for Alita not enough story for her we see mabye 4 flash backs but we really nedded more to get a better picture of who she was and how did she knwo who do unlock the door in the ship or navigate also there are a couple of time she nearly gets killed being stupid and not listing to anyone who are trying to save her.One more thing we could have used a way better store for the father and mother who are just there for the sake of being there
and the action that was there we didn't get very much of it and there are no emotions for anybody in the film since they weren't built up enough to care

300,margulanabutrlov,''Alita: Battle Angel'' Review,8,21 March 2019,"Robert Rodriguez and James Cameron worked with Peter Jackson's visual effects wizards on this long-gestating manga-based action thriller.
Twenty years in gestation, James Cameron's long-cherished manga adaptation Alita: Battle Angel finally reaches the big screen with help from director Robert Rodriguez and Peter Jackson's digital effects team. With that kind of cinematic pedigree, backed by a reported $200 million budget, this kick-ass cyberpunk adventure seems to be aiming for the same blockbusting box office heights as the Hunger Games franchise. But a lumpy script, muddled plot, stock characters and tired genre tropes may dampen its commercial breakout potential beyond its core sci-fi action-fantasy demographic. While not exactly a misfire, Rodriguez and Cameron's joint effort lacks the zing and originality of their best individual work.
First alerted to Yukito Kishiro's original manga comics series by Guillermo del Toro back in the late 1990s, Cameron initially announced plans to adapt Alita in 2003, before the phenomenal success of Avatar took him down a different path. Fitful spells of preproduction followed, with Cameron still attached and apparently unwilling to yield control to another director. However, Spy Kids and Sin City creator Rodriguez finally came on board in 2015. But Cameron remains hands-on as producer and screenwriter alongside two fellow Avatar veterans, Jon Landau and Laeta Kalogridis.
Alita takes place roughly 500 years from now, in the dusty streets of Iron City, a ramshackle junkyard metropolis huddled in the shadow of the flying citadel of Zalem. Ever since a vaguely explained apocalyptic war centuries before, traffic between the two cities is now highly restricted. A kindly doctor who specializes in repairing half-human cyborgs using scavenged parts, Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) stumbles across the battered shell of a former robot superweapon, nursing her back to life and christening her Alita (Rosa Salazar) after his late daughter. A born-again innocent initially unaware of her bloodthirsty past, Alita soon starts emoting like a normal human teenager, even developing a crush on handsome young robo-junk dealer Hugo (Keean Johnson).
Alita opens strongly with a razzle-dazzle rush of inspired design flourishes and suspenseful clues. With Jackson's Weta Digital handling animation and visual effects, the first act is a sumptuous sensory experience shot in warm colors and radiant, super-crisp 3D. Many of the film's 1,500 CGI shots are magnificent, from the superbly detailed wide-angle cityscape vistas to Alita's kick-ass confrontation with the monstrous killer cyborg Grewishka (Jackie Earle Haley), a kind of Transformers version of Popeye with swollen metallic arms.
But the film's biggest CGI challenge is blending the digitally morphed, motion-capture version of Salazar's performance into an otherwise mostly live-action cast. Superhero and fantasy movies do this all the time, of course, and nobody has done more to perfect this technology than Cameron or Jackson. But the risk with Alita is the ""uncanny valley"" effect, first identified by Japanese robotics scientists to describe that unintentionally creepy moment when artificial humans start to look too similar to the real thing. With her saucer-sized manga eyes and stylized doll face, Alita sometimes seems to have stumbled on set from a Pixar production. Even using cutting-edge effects at such a high technical level, this Mechanical Pixie Dream Girl still looks jarringly artificial in places.
Proud Mexican-American Rodriguez adds his personal mark from the first frame with the Iron City production design, an agreeably funky steampunk barrio with Spanish-language signs and architectural nods to Latin America. The paternal relationship between Ido and Alita is also full of alluringly strange echoes, with distant traces of Frankenstein, Pinocchio and Pygmalion.
But all this promising material unravels in the film's second half, when the plot becomes bogged down in clunky exposition, illogical sideways serves and action-heavy carnage. Alita's half-remembered past life as a cyborg soldier is too poorly explained to make much dramatic sense, as is her driving urge to escape Iron City for Zalem. Her sappy romance with Hugo quickly becomes a dreary slab of boilerplate young-adult soap opera, peppered with excruciating lines like, ""We don't belong anywhere, except together."" It also does not help that Johnson is a charisma vacuum of white-bread boy-band blandness.
Departing from the original Japanese manga, Cameron and Rodriguez make Alita's unlikely ambition to become a Motorball champion central to her character development, largely because it gives them an excuse to mount one of the film's most kinetic and bombastic action set pieces. This sense-battering robots-on-wheels sequence is an impressively complex spectacle, but essentially a heavy-metal orgy of digital effects with minimal dramatic point. Imagine a stage production of Starlight Express directed by Michael Bay.
Crucially, Alita contains scant traces of the warmth, wit and punky attitude that characterized most of Cameron's early work, and which has underscored every previous Rodriguez movie to date. Indeed, besides a couple of leaden one-liners, the screenplay is strikingly low on humor. Naturally droll, wry, subtle performers like Waltz and Ali are obliged to operate in muted one-note mode. Another oddly lazy touch is the background chorus of minor characters who look like refugees from '80s music videos, with their piercings and tattoos, wild Mohawk hair and artfully ripped leather jackets.",Alita - Battle Angel

305,Benslie,Had the potential to be better,6,18 February 2019,"First of all, the set design and cinematography in this film is stunning and reminds me of Blade Runner. The sets look like actually things from a dystopian future. The lighting in each scene, especially the night time shots is beautiful to look at. Now the story felt like three completely different films that was mixed into one two hour and two-minute film. From the first scene to the last it never felt like the same film and this at sometimes caused the film to halt a stop. Sometimes the story would magically connect to the main story but most of the time it was three different stories that didn't connect at all. You can easily tell that all the actors and actresses were giving it their all but some of them just ended up not working for me. This could be because of poor casting or they just didn't try as hard in some scenes. One person who didn't work for me was Keean Johnson, who plays Hugo. I just didn't really care for him but I will give him a break seeing how he has only been in two other things. This film is obviously heavily relied on special effects so they need to look good and they did in certain scenes and moments but in others, I cringed obvious it was. Also, this is just me being me but Alita's eyes scared me in a majority of the film. The pacing in this film felt really slow but I'm just going to blame it on the film that doesn't know what it wants to be. The music in this, which is composed by Junkie XL, is great and I can easily see myself listening to it while I'm doing homework. This film is classified as a romance on IMDB and really I think if they cut the main relationship it wouldn't harm the film in any way. There are plot twists in this film and you can easily see them coming from a mile away and I only say that because the characters drop so many hints about it that once it's revealed your like yeah I know. The writing in this film is dull and really there is nothing to it. A lot of it is just cliched writing at it's finest. The movie ends really abruptly and with a hint to a possible sequel idea. Finally, the action in this film has been done so many times that you can watch any action film and see some similar things in it. There was probably only one fight scene that stuck out to me as being really well done and original. But other than that all of them are just copycat scenes at best. In the end, Hollywood should learn to stop making movies off of mangas and anime, in general, you are curious or want to see a beautiful looking film this is for you. If not then just skip this.",Alita - Battle Angel

My chief gripe is that it is ever so clearly setting the stage for a sequel. Making it just half a movie. And as a result there's way too much filler material. To the point that the editing doesn't even seem so great. Anyone agree with that? On the flip side, we get some decent character development - over a running time which seems much longer than two hours.I doin't even mind that this film is quite derivative. Others will say it pays homage to films such as Robocop and Gladiator. There is one great scene involving cyborg dogs. As I said above, there are other scenes which are just unnecessary.I liked Alita herself. Good performance from the lead.

310,andrewmerritt-31652,Good adaptation of the graphic novel,8,4 November 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel stars Rose Salazar, Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly and Marshala Ali. The story centers on a female cyborg, which is brought back to life that can't remember her past life and so she begins her journey to discover her true origins. Alita: Battle Angel is also based off of the popular graphic novel series called Gunnm and is directed by Robert Rodriguez. I knew nothing about Alita: Battle Angel or that it was a graphic novel until one day I walked into a Barnes and Noble and decided to buy the first volume in order to get a crash course on Alita: Battle Angel. So when I saw the movie in theatres I found myself comparing and contrasting the movie from the graphic novel series. I'm not usually the one that says that the movie is better than the book or the book is better than the movie although there are some instances where that is the case. And as far as turning anime shows or graphic novels into live action movies, it wasn't bad, but it could've been a lot worse like the Death Note movie on Netflix. Do yourself a favor everyone, stay far away from that. Trust me, you'll thank me later. But moving on, Robert Rodriguez is a fan of the graphic novel and it shows that he took the time to take the popular graphic novel series and turn it into something that made him proud and would make audiences proud. What I liked about this is the movie doesn't follow the graphic novel page by page, but takes a random page and sticks it into the film as a nod to the novel. Some of the visual effects look amazing, especially on Alita as I felt that the visual effects department focused more on Alita than they did with the rest of the characters. However the movie had a hard time on where to find an ending as you think the movie will end there, but it keeps going and going making it feel like a three hour movie even though its two hours. Also what was amazing was Motorball, which is almost like a twisted version of Basketball meets Nascar and I wish that the movie focused more on this instead of it being half of Alita discovering her past and half of it being about Motorball. And some of the scenes feel very anti-climatic as Robert Rodriguez had an idea on how to build a climax, but just left it behind that it became awkward. Overall, if you're looking for an entertaining movie, than I would recommend you see this in theatres, but for the people who have read the graphic novel series you may like it or you may not. You be the judge of that.",Alita - Battle Angel
311,nodlimax,Messy story - fantastic visuals and fights,6,13 February 2019,"The headline pretty much sums up my feelings about the movie.The visuals really are amazing. The Cyborgs look very realistic. I never had the feeling that someone in the CGI department messed up in any scene and damn this movie has a LOT of CGI in it. It still looks great.And the fights are also really enjoyable even though they are very one sided. After a while it just lacks and serious threats. Even the main threat in terms of physical abilities is not really a real threat to the main character. That drags the movie down a bit in this regard. However it is not the main problem for me.The main problem are the messy story and some of the characters. The story lacks focus and tries to push to much stuff into a single movie. I liked the Dr. Idos and Alita as characters. However even they had weak points in the movie. Especially the speech Alita gave at one point in the movie in a bar came out of nowhere and was hilarious for all the wrong reasons. The romance was extremely weak. Both characters had no chemistry together and it just got annoying halfway through.Some of the acting when it came down to side characters was also pretty weak.

319,eparazak,"Alita: Battle Angel's has all the elements to be great, but the final product falls flat.",5,20 February 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel was brought to us by director Robert Rodriguez and producers Jon Landau and James Cameron. All three of them have worked on some great stuff in the past such as Titanic, Sin City and Avatar and I was wondering what they would do with this. This movie is based off a manga that I've never picked up, so I went in blindly.As my review title suggests, this movie has all of the elements needed to be great overall. The characters are compelling and memorable, it introduces many interesting concepts and sets up some interesting lore about Alita and the world as she goes out and discovers it. The action scenes were fantastically choreographed. Not to mention that the effects production design were very well-made. These elements and more should have made this movie amazing, but it sadly doesn't.My big issue with this movie is with how it is all executed. The story, to be blunt is all over the place. It juggles four major plots around: Alita discovering the world around her (1), an organization that is hunting her down (2), her relationship with a boy she meets named Hugo (3), and finally, Alita figuring out her hidden past. (4) All four of these plots intertwine within the movie and eventually come together by the end and when they do, it ends up becoming disjointed. I do have some other issues with the movie such as the villains being generic and a pointless decision being made within the last 5 minutes, but that does dive into spoiler territory.If you're a fan of the manga series this movie's based on, chances are that you'll like Alita: Battle Angel more than I did. Frankly, this should've been great, but the movie's execution was just lousy in the longrun.5/10",Alita - Battle Angel
320,Martinito_08183,"It does have ups and downs, but overall it's a good film.",7,15 July 2019,"The famous filmmaker James Cameron wanted to make a movie based on the popular manga from the 90s Gunnm (aka Battle Angel Alita) from the writer Yukito Kishiro for so long and the film went into development hell for many years and the reason is very obvious: he was involved with the making of Avatar, the Avatar sequels and because of them he doesn't have time to do something with Alita (because Fox / Disney want to make a Avatar franchise and to milk every penny out of it) and now with the collaboration between him and Robert Rodriguez to help with the development, they managed to make probably the best manga adaptation to date, even thought it's still very flawed in many places, it's still an achievement, since the previous attempts failed so hard and now, they got it right this time. Here are the things that i liked and didn't like in my opinion:The positives:
I found the story very fascinating and interesting and since i never read the manga, i can't tell if it's very accurate or not, but i'll say that i was never bored and i wanted to know what's going to happen. Unfortunately, it may be very clichéd for many people and i wouldn't be surprised if many filmmakers took inspiration from the manga and took many of the concepts and using them in many of today's film and for that reason many of the ideas are unoriginal and overused, which is unfortunate, but it didn't bother me at all.Alita, Dr.Ido, Zapan and Grewishka are the best characters in the film and the ones, who are given more screen time. The relationship between Alita and Dr. Ido was the strongest part and i was afraid that Ido will not be in the film all that much, but thankfully he plays a very important role for the main protagonist and he does appear in many scenes. Zapan and Grewishka are the main villains of the film and having valid reason of why they hate Alita and want to kill her.The dialogue for the most part is very well-written. There are some very cringeworthy dialogue, especially when Alita gives a speech to all Hunter-Warriors in the bar, but you can understand why it's there, since she has a mind of a teenage girl.The visual effects are mind-blowing and impressive at the same time. You can still tell that almost everything is CGI, but every visual effect studio, who were involved, brought life into the world of Alita. In the beginning Alita's eyes may distract everyone, but after that you wouldn't even notice at all.The sound is also fantastic and the sound team did a great job. Everything sounds great, even watching it in IMAX and again with headphones was still superb.The acting was great by almost everyone, but the one, who stands out the most was Rosa Salazar, who manages to give life to Alita and making her very likable and of course Christoph Waltz is great, even being perfect for the role.The cinematography was very well-handled and every shot looked great, even the action scenes are very well shot.The negatives:
The music is composed by Tom Holkenborg (aka Junkie XL) and just as expected, it's so forgettable, even unnoticeable in some moments and the only track that was memorable was the ""Motorball"" track. The song ""Swan Song"" by Dua Lipa is mixed for me: sometimes i do like it, but the other times i don't like it.There are some weak characters like Vector (who is probably not a character at all, since he is a puppet and being controlled by Nova) and Dr. Chiren (the one, that has the smallest amount of screen time), but the worst of them all is absolutely the character of Hugo, who was written so poorly and when he's on-screen, the parts that he's involved are the worst of the film.When the story is involving Vector, Dr. Chiren and Hugo are the weakest and sometimes the worst moments in the entire film and i don't like what they did with Alita in the ending that i wouldn't spoil, but it does involve her and Hugo and is handled so poorly and i thought the chemistry between them in the whole movie didn't work at all.Mahershala Ali and Jennifer Connelly are fine. I think the direction and their scripts were weak and are given nothing to do with the material, but Keean Johnson (who plays Hugo) is the one, who is the worst. He's just not good actor at all and his script is very mixed for me, that has some good and also very bad lines.There are some moments when the CGI is not involved on the screen and is only live-action, the cinematography is very standard or should i say: very bland.Overall the film has ups and downs and the final product is still good, even thought i don't think that everybody will like it, but it does deserve the praise on the things that the film does right. And after seeing it for the second time, i'll be glad to see a sequel, but James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez (if his involved with it) must see what actually worked and also improve on the aspects, that didn't work at all and probably will get a better film in the future, but for now we have to wait and see.",Alita - Battle Angel
321,Kirollos-Noah,"They finally made it, and it's great!!!!",8,1 April 2019,"Alita: Battle Angle is directed by Robert Rodriguez (director of Sin City), screenplay by James Cameron (Avatar, Terminator, Aliens and Titanic) and Laeta Kalogridis and it's based on the graphic novel series -the manga also has the same name- by Yukito Kishiro. Starring Rosa Salazar, Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein, Jackie Earle Haley and Keean Johnson.When Alita (Rosa Salazar) awakens with no memory of who she is in a future world she does not recognize, she is taken in by Ido (Christoph Waltz), a compassionate doctor who realizes that somewhere in this abandoned cyborg shell is the heart and soul of a young woman with an extraordinary past. As Alita learns to navigate her new life and the treacherous streets of Iron City, Ido tries to shield her from her mysterious history while her street-smart new friend Hugo (Keean Johnson) offers instead to help trigger her memories. But it is only when the deadly and corrupt forces that run the city come after Alita that she discovers a clue to her past - she has unique fighting abilities that those in power will stop at nothing to control. If she can stay out of their grasp, she could be the key to saving her friends, her family and the world she's grown to love.I read some of Alita's books, and I really liked them.. so when they announced the movie, I was so bumped up, then I lost hope to see this amazing idea comes to the big screen, and now, they finally made it!!! And it's so very good!!! Enough with the introductions, let's get into it...I really loved the movie, for the most part, it has lots of stuff to love actually, it's a sci-fi, action movie.. with some romance, it's so easy to love, especially with the fans, I think this movie gave every fan of the manga what they want! The CGI of this movie, for the entire runtime is just flawless, Alita's face is so close to the manga, it's the closest anime/manga character adaptation I ever seen! The action sequences made me on the edge of my chair, I mean it gave me all what I wanted. The performances are not that great though! Rosa Salazar as Alita is just perfect, I loved her, also Christoph Waltz as Ido, I love him as an actor and he did some great job as Ido. Jackie Earle Haley is also good as Grewishka. Jennifer Connelly on the other hand is not good, at all, I didn't enjoy her performances at all, Keean Johnson is also bad, as well as Jorge Lendeborg Jr. I'm not gonna talk about Mahershala Ali, because of I'm so conflicted about him.
The story of this movie is also great, I really liked it, it's surprisingly fun and adventurous!The screenplay on the other hand is the most disappointing thing through the entire movie, James Cameron did some amazing movies like Avatar, Terminator and Aliens.. he did some amazing job with these movies, but with Alita: Battle Angel is not that amazing! There is a scene of Hugo and Alita while eating chocolate, suddenly Hugo explains Zapan to Alita for no reason. Also the romance between Hugo and Alita is rushed, and no so heart-warming. There are some other points, we'll get to that point in the spoiler-review, because I have lots of stuff to talk about, but I don't want to spoil anything to you, guys.. I just want you to watch it blindly.
The screenplay is my biggest flaws with this movie. The movie is still also suffering of some issues with the narrative, that we'll talk about them in the spoiler-review.The OST is just.. EPIC! Junkie XL did amazing job again, as he did with Mad Max: Fury Road. Alita: Battle Angel is super-epic and.. great, still suffering of some issues, but still a really fun movie to watch, and satisfying. I'm gonna give Alita: Battle Angel a B+!And as always, thank you, guys for reading and supporting my work, really appreciate it, and if you liked it you can click on my name up above and see all of my reviews.",Alita - Battle Angel
322,Kirollos-Noah,Spoiler review,8,21 April 2019,"This review will contain some spoilers, if u didn't watch Alita: Battle Angle go and check the spoiler-free review.If u read my spoiler-free review so u know that I loved this movie so much, and that I had some spoiler things to say!Most importantly is Nova, played by Edward Norton.. the reveal of Nova was so surprising, not because it's our first look at Nova himself, because we saw who's playing him, it's Edward Norton! The entire movie we only saw him through two characters, we knew that this is him by the color of their eyes, when it turns to blue, it's Nova who's talking, Mahershala Ali did not use this very well, he's a very good actor, but in this movie, not that good. I said in my spoiler-free review that I was very conflicted about him, now I can say that he's not good in this movie, just like Jennifer Connelly, which is the worst performance in the entire movie! Also her character is super-weird, I mean she suddenly became a good person and died with honor! JK, I didn't like her at all!Dr Edo, played by Christoph Waltz has a little issue, and it's the way of his narrative, he's so calm, very very very calm! Even when Alita broke his dead daughter's body, he did nothing but giving her the body she wanted, he didn't go like "" She broke my daughter's body, the only thing that reminds me of her is now gone! "" Nope, he didn't do that!And now Zapan, he became a villain because Alita humiliated him in front of the Hunters, I mean this is definitely not a reason to turn anyone into a villain, am I right?In any case, Alita: Battle Angle is a very good movie, it has some very good things and some flaws as well, I gave Alita: Battle Angle a B+!Thank u guys as always for reading my review, and if u liked this u can click on my name up above to see my previous and coming reviews!...

324,willians_franco,Waiting for an Alita 2,9,31 July 2019,"Excellent action movie. Good computer graphics, good story, a good script, good acting, good special effects, etc. The fight scenes are excellent. The movie is very busy and full of nuances. No wonder he won the best action movie award. James Cameron, after Avatar (2009), was able to produce an exceptional new movie. Today's Hollywood trend is to produce heroines as a way of meeting the globalist agenda that preaches feminism as a solution to the world. Therefore, more and more movies will feature female characters, preferably as superheroes. This is one of them. After watching a lot of crap out there (like Captain Marvel's gutter), with mediocre scripts and tiresome and repetitive stories, I finally found one that breaks the mold. And maybe it runs away from the standard exactly because it wasn't produced by Marvel. Congratulations to James Cameron for toasting us with this work. Alita: Battle Angel can capture the viewer's attention for the entire duration of the tape. A curiosity: Alita's computerized image is much more beautiful than the actress Rosa Salazar herself. I highly recommend it to everyone and hope there is as good a sequence as this original.",Alita - Battle Angel
325,ElliesWonder,"A feast for eyes, I wish I could love it.",7,25 February 2019,"A feast for eyes, CGI work great in every fighting scene. I wish I could love this movie. I heard a lot of compliments about the movie, but unfortunately the movie only presented a brainless story.Everything is so predictable. A cyborg girl built with go-beyond technology. This setting takes away all my worries because she'll almost Invincible. I didn't see any obstacles other than her romantic relationship problem. I wish I could see more story from her mystery background rather than her soapy romantic story.The plot is not attractive - a typical story that lower class challenge the power holder - it appears trite and insignificant to me, especially I'm not a huge fan of the cyborg-punk setting.PS. After reading the reviews of the Movie vs. Manga comparison. I found the original manga sounds much more interesting compared to this movie.",Alita - Battle Angel

327,davet-15275,just lacked something !,7,23 May 2020,"Watched this as nothing else on , not a fan of cgi super hero films , but this was not to bad , if you dont expect anything then you tend to enjoy it , it had reasonable acting and story , just went a bit awry in places but its definately worth a watch",Alita - Battle Angel
328,benprichardsdotcom,Only 20 minutes admittedly,3,15 April 2019,But that was enough for me to know this film is no good. I'm a lover of sci-fi but not au fait with Manga or the source material and particularly averse to cliches.,Alita - Battle Angel
329,DunkelheitVZ,very close to being the ideal movie for me,9,7 March 2019,"Whatever you take out of this review, please go and buy, watch, enjoy the movie. It is really outstanding and feels very fresh in the world of Superhero movies.
But why not 10 points?Obviously the makers of this movie have a sequel in mind, but when they went down the route to make a sequel a must-have, they should have gone slower.Alita loses her innocence very fast. When she was repaired + recreated, I wanted to see the world through her eyes, her reaction to everything while slowly discovering her personality and her past.
Very, very soon in the movie though you get to know that she is from Mars, that she is a fighter cyborg and everything really trumps her personality. Before getting to know the fighter, I would have wanted to get to know the teenage girl.Another point is that they did not need to introduce Nova so early in the movie. Vector would have been a great antagonist for the first movie. There was so much going on:
her love storyhow she loses her great lovethe bounty hunter jobher relationship to Idofinding the marsian fighter bodyhow she fits into the universewatching Chiren changeI think this would have been really enough without focusing on Nova. They could have hinted at him in the very end with some subtle clues, but doing it this way, the movie felt rushed.
I say this, because this could have been a hour movie with half the story and it would still have been amazing. I am not saying that this makes the movie bad, it is just a pity that they did not use a lot of the material for a longer movie or a 2nd one.Other than that I lost myself in a very immersive world with amazing characters.",Alita - Battle Angel
330,Phil_M_A_Kerr,Uber-Cyber punks with nice skin.,10,16 February 2019,"Why did it bug me that Alita's love interest, Hugo, had much softer skin than she did? Dunno. They made a cute couple, regardless.
This is a good movie.
Saw this in 2D on a medium screen then in 3D in Vmax with Atmos sound.
The occasional 'flatness' of the 2D version, like the first shot of Ido walking left to right across the screen in the junkyard, was conversely eye-popping in the 3D version. Also, many of the somewhat cluttered visual moments in the 2D version were somehow simplified and made much more sense in the 3-dimensional version. Cool.
Surprisingly the 2D version resonated emotionally a bit stronger than the 3D and this could have been that it was my second viewing or it could have been that I was distracted by the spectacle of the classy 3D work. Bit of both, methinks.
Everyone does well performing such strange characters although Jennifer Connelly is a standout. Could be a generational bias on my part.
Quite a dark movie in its themes, and hyper-violent as well. I struggle with the juxtaposition of innocence and hyper-violence in many modern comic book movies. I think it is a generational thing TBH.
Recent similar films have been Ghost In the Shell and Ready Player One. This one is just as busy in plot and shot composition. The visual palette is often lighter and more natural than the other two, though, and this was a pleasant surprise.
Sound design was good but I was hoping for a bit more imagination in the cityscape scenes with the strange industrial-sized mechanisms working away in the background - but you couldn't hear them at all.
Great fun and definitely worth it in 3D with Vmax/atmos if possible. But if you can't get to a mega-screen, watch it in 2D and you won't be disappointed!",Alita - Battle Angel
331,aramsdale,SIMPLY TERRIBLE,2,11 February 2019,"Christoph Waltz - what were you thinking?!
Just terrible.
I don't know why I stopped to the end when I should really have walked out.

Fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ride.",Alita - Battle Angel
333,peter-laganis,Finally...,10,16 August 2019,"... we got a movie that perfectly captured the essence and atmosphere of a manga.
I didn't expected it to be so emotional and intense as Yukito Kishiro's but the result of direction, writing. acting and CGI was impressive.
Hope this won't be an isolated case as there are many other japanese gems that deserve some great movie as well.Personally I would prefer those (more original) gems than a bunch of repetitive, flat and predictive superheroes or mutants... ;)In the end:
A different original, intense, atmospheric and emotional action movie.
Hope to see the sequel as the story gets even better ;)",Alita - Battle Angel
334,c-kelsall,Magma-hot Manga-shot,10,12 February 2019,"Wow, this film blew my socks off. From the trailers I wasn't expecting much, partly because I'm not familiar with the source material and frankly Hollywood doesn't have a great rep when it comes to adapting this kind of thing from overseas cultures. I'm happy to say I couldn't be more wrong. I took a chance on the heady combo of Cameron and Rodriguez, and it really paid off.
Rosa Salazar was perfect as the kick-ass cyborg warrior from a bygone high-tech age, salvaged by the compassionate Dr Ido (an ever-excellent Christophe Waltz). In fact, everyone in the cast performed admirably, with respect to their character types. Okay, it's not Shakespeare, but it's an action movie, not a meditation on the human condition. It does have a heart, though, and an epic scope without dragging its feet.
The only slight criticisms I'm going to level at it are that it was a little predictable in places, but not in a way that bothered me, and that it was blatantly set up for a sequel, but I can't wait for that, so that has to count as a strength rather thsn a weakness. Not sure how long it's going to be before I watch this again, but soon methinks.",Alita - Battle Angel
335,umimelectric,I wish this were a Netflix series for mature audiences,8,30 June 2019,"Enough has been said about the film, so I'll just add that if this were a TV series targeted to adults then I would watch the hell out of it. I almost think that in the right hands it would be better as a series than it is as a film. It's predictable at times, but overall a lot of fun. 8/10",Alita - Battle Angel

337,Jack_C_,Fantastic concept ruined by teenie booper romance,6,16 August 2019,"I liked most of the movie, but I also got to see it from my wife's perspective. She's been a lifelong fan of the comic series and fast forwarded through most of the movie.James Cameron took out a lot of the action and philosophy from the comics. It felt dragged out with unnecessary and unbelievable teenie booper romance and side characters we cannot care less about.It could have been so much more. Elysium and Matrix this is not. Let's hope the sequel is tighter.",Alita - Battle Angel
338,J-bot6,Disregard the negative reviews and see it for yourself,8,28 February 2019,"Wow, am I glad I decided to get a group together and go out to see this. My original plan was to stay home and not go out into the cold. But then I did a quick web search and checked to see what the audience opinion of Alita was (as opposed to the terrible things written by the 'professional' critics). I had read the first couple of volumes of the 1990s manga back in 1994. Hence I was going in with some knowledge. Regardless, my expectations were average (neither high nor low).Like many manga, Alita's universe is richly-developed and massive. Thankfully, this movie goes out of its way to clearly present a big and detailed futuristic world. The sheer amount of work put into the live-action/CGI composites is stunning. People familiar with VFX can see the money on the screen. But for me, visual effects are not enough to make for a good film. And in part due to the brilliant and emotive portrayal of Alita on the big screen, this movie really gets its grips on you. Alita is a joy to watch and listen to. She's splendid, and every scene with her is a welcome one. It's nice to see a movie with a non-pretentious and earnest character finding her way in the world and standing by what she believes in. The actor chosen to play Ito was a wise choice too. In fact, he looks almost exactly like his counterpart in the anime and manga.Of course, this movie also includes all the action you'd expect to see. And the action is both furious and easy to decode. Clearly the blocking for the action had a lot of thought put into it. It's also apparent that a number of sequences were lifted from the pages of the manga. And good on the filmmakers for being faithful to the source material.If action and drama are still not enough for you, there are flashbacks and discovery scenes in this movie that work well to add a sense of mystery and intrigue. These were welcome and something that manga and anime usually drop in during the latter parts of their stories. In this case, there's only about two hours to get the information across, so they're very quickly integrated into the story line. Personally, I don't mind the accelerated speed that the scenes were presented. Unfortunately, a number of viewers nit-picked this and were hoping for a lot more time to be spent on each theme or revelation in the film. I think this 'need' for extended scenes may be the result of story arcs being expanded for an entire season when in the 1980s, the same amount of material was presented in only two episodes. Audiences seem to have become used to the slower pace. Ironically, modern audiences seem to also want more action. I can see the task of providing both as being a real challenge for modern film-makers.Ultimately, I think the right decisions were made for this live-action interpretation of Alita. Sure, there are a few scenes that I would have liked to have been shot a bit differently (like the scene with Ito's daughter). And yes there are a few bits of dialogue that are a bit weak or awkward. Then-again, most of that can be forgiven since -- at the end of the day -- this is a movie that is based on a comic.The cinematography is good. The editing is excellent. And the soundtrack matches the material nicely. There's a musical sequence near the beginning that was truly emotive and refreshingly different than what I've heard in film scores in recent years.Ultimately, I recommend this film. It's worth seeing on the big screen. Although I'm not a huge fan of 3D, I have to admit that it makes good use of it. There was even a scene in which it appeared as if Ito walked from the aisle in the theater and onto the stage in front of the movie screen. A cool effect for a cool movie.",Alita - Battle Angel

Alita is a overly simplistic story with a ton of flashy escapist effects. Acting? It's fine, but I doubt anyone here could actually ""act"" for more than 30 seconds, let alone hold their own in a stage production.This is our lot now: over-produced, glossy eye candy for people that just can't think anymore.Save your money and TRY watching it on video without turning it off.",Alita - Battle Angel

347,KIDOLOHKEN,Great characterization.,8,5 August 2020,"If a human actor does it as it is, people might say ""There is no such a woman"", but when a CG woman does it, I felt like there is a cyborg with such a character. Moreover, she is unique and human. I thought it was a wonderful character setting that could only be made in this movie. Of course, the character setting of the original work is wonderful. But the character was written in a different way in this movie and she shone brightly in the movie. I don't think this movie would have been interesting or not at all if it didn't have the character.Overall, I thought it was only 1/10 as interesting as the original manga. The good thing about manga is that it's a big romance and you can enjoy a long story in a way that only manga can. In the movie, it's inevitably dead. It's a pity that it ends up looking like a summary of the story. Also, in the original story, the theme of this section, which was used in the film, was good. It's a drama that sincerely addresses the theme of ""living with death"", which is almost forgotten by people today. That was the biggest attraction of the manga, but it is not depicted at all in the film. Or the film doesn't go as far as the manga does. I think that after Avatar, James Cameron couldn't write anything of high quality anymore, so he's running away to the hit line.
But it wasn't bad. No, it was pretty good. This is a rare film in the sense that the original work is still good, so we can expect to see the second part.",Alita - Battle Angel
348,dagallop,A stunning reminder of how CGI has come along!,8,26 July 2019,"I confess this was a prompted viewing based on the persistence of my 15 year old - everything Japanese is amazing - daughter. So, my personal expectations were exceptionally limited. However, I also was unaware that this was a Rodriguez direction and a Cameron screenplay (well at least a contributor). And, given the fact that I had low expectations, frankly I was 'blown away'!
The cast, including brilliant acting (as ever) by Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly and Rosa Salazar was supported by some shining performances by Mahershala Ali and Keenan Johnson. It's impossible to say much more about the rest because I couldn't tell if it was their acting abilities or the CGI experts! One name to bring to the fore is Idara Victor who had a limited role but was very convincing with her robotic arm!
You can't comment on set's. lighting or continuity because I am sure that almost everything was CGI and the greatest portion of this movie was filmed against a green screen! The soundtrack is amazing, please make an effort to see this in a good theater because some much will be lost without a great sound system (most TV's just won't deliver!).
Left me wondering how long the wait would be for part 2!
Synopsis: absolutely worth a watch, especially if you like comic book adaptations and/or Japanese comic book heroes. It isn't blood thirsty, most of the time it's some sort of robotic fluid, can't imagine anyone being offended by WD40 being sprayed around! Would have been a 9 but some of the actors seemed to fail to embrace the future CGI that would be wrapped around them!",Alita - Battle Angel
349,rskolek,Awesome movie!,9,11 July 2019,"Awesome movie! The middle part is somewhat confusing, but Alita has more than enough heart and soul to make up for it.",Alita - Battle Angel
350,BiiivAL,panzerkunst,8,7 March 2019,"For zero and tenths, we have seen such a number of attempts to adapt anime for a Western audience, that each new project in the nineties (albeit a cult) opened from the depths of the work is perceived as being prejudiced.
Fortunately, 'Alyta' is completely different. About this we are immediately informed by familiar names from the poster - Rodriguez and Cameron. The first is the main thrashmaker in the world, Tarantino's best friend in every sense. The second is a Canadian genius, each project of which makes one draw attention to himself, even a producer.
'Alita' is a huge and developed world of the future with the good old idea about the inequality of two cities. One soars in the sky, the other rusts on the ruined earth. It is here that Dr. Ido finds a broken cyborg, recreates it and gives the name Alita.
Scenally the picture does not sag and, in general, goes smoothly along the manga with deviations into other volumes. The adaptation of the original source is always thin ice, but Rodriguez almost cracked it. He is trying to organically compare the different events of manga. And it turns out. And I understand why the director mixed different events not in chronology. This adds to the entertainment, and goes much better for the audience.
The original manga pro masters of panzer kunst were distinguished by magnificently traced fights. In this film you can rely on. Beautiful, juicy and not at all brutal battles cyborgs - it just does not seem boring.Especially when the company in such a cyberpunk adventure you make up Christoph Waltz, Mahershala Ali, and even Edward Norton. Look for him, he is somewhere in the film.'Alita' is a very simple, but pleasing to the eye and not a brain-diluting attraction, which is carefully related to the original. After all, Rodriguez himself loves everything connected with this world.",Alita - Battle Angel

Now that I've re-watched this movie, knowing what I was getting myself into, I kind of admire it now. The special effects are still the best of the year, the romance in the movie is not as terrible as I remember and actually quite sad when you now where it ends up, and Alita is a great character. It also doesn't hurt that this is pretty much the only blockbuster this year that isn't a superhero movie or sequel. I'm glad I gave it a re-watch.",Alita - Battle Angel

356,rustonreviews,"Looks amazing, but...",4,16 February 2019,"Yukito Kishiro's acclaimed cyberpunk manga series Battle Angel Alita serves as the source material for this massively hyped (not to mention long awaited) Rodriguez/Cameron collaboration. The year is 2563, and a catastrophic war has left the earth ravaged. Zalem, a magnificent city in the sky, looms above the citizens making do with what remains of the earth below. Dr. Dyson Ido (Waltz) is a cybernetics surgeon who scavenges the vast scrap wastelands for spare parts. It is there where he discovers the devastated remains of a female cyborg. Returning the wasted remains to his lab, he rebuilds the cyborg and names her Alita. Alita soon learns that she herself originated as a weapon of incredible power, thus kickstarting her quest to discover her true identity and her place in the world. Complicating matters is her romantic involvement with Hugo (Keean Johnson), who holds a few secrets of own.I have a great admiration for James Cameron, and Robert Rodriguez has made some great films in the past, so their collaboration had me instantly interested, though I have never read Kishiro's original manga. As expected, Alita: Battle Angel is a film of incredible spectacle. The level of world building achieved here is fantastic, and the visuals are without a doubt the strongest element of the film. Alita's creation through motion capture is also exceptional, and it's staggering to see how far motion capture as a craft has developed over the years. Cameron is a filmmaker obsessed with pushing the limits of what can be achieved through technology in film, so it's no wonder he was drawn to the world of Kishiro's manga.My problem with Alita is that it all rings hollow. Although the CGI is amazing and the action sequences are fun, the central problem is the script. The storyline (which is a combination of several books in the series, so I've heard) is all over the place and never feels completely focused. It's messy, and it's difficult to invest in any of the characters as there isn't any real direction in their story arcs. Things just seem to happen without much of a cohesive direction, and it never feels as though the film is building towards anything. The relationship between Alita and Ido falls completely flat, as does the criminally dull romantic sub plot that had no real purpose being in the film at all. What's largely frustrating about the whole thing is that all the key ideas and themes are present (the nature of A.I, how technology will inevitably one day become an organic part of us ect...), but it is as though neither Cameron or Rodriguez were interested in exploring them to their full extent. Instead, what we get is a brainless action flick with little emotional substance at its core. Fun to look at, yes, but hardly engaging on an emotional level.Alita: Battle Angel gets my admiration for its technical merits, but unfortunately, I found its story and characters boring and empty. Its final scene indicates there will be a sequel, as there was so much plot left over that wasn't explained or tied up by its stunningly anticlimactic finale. In the end though, its visual excellence doesn't make up for all its storytelling shortcomings.",Alita - Battle Angel

The entire movie they are trying to get to a certain place, but they never manage to get there. Ever.
2. The main badguy is never defeated.
3. The main heroine's love interest is revived from death, only to be killed AGAIN just a few moments later, and this time he stays dead! Like what the hell was the point then! >_<Those are my thoughts.",Alita - Battle Angel
359,gazzalodi,James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez are usually better than this,2,4 July 2020,"The story is seriously lacking in this one. At one point I thought we were just going to do a straight origin story that would end with Alita getting her berserker body and have one badass fight to set up the series. Then we get the whole awkward Hugo multiple deaths that really didn't do anything for me. They could have just left him out of the script completely and it wouldn't have bothered me at all. The only people I felt vested in were Alita and a few of her fellow soldiers in the flashbacks. In the end there is no emotional payoff just a set up for the next installment. Not something I'm going to spend theater dollars on for sure, I'll wait for the buck ninety-nine dvd rental if it happens.The CGI is kinda bad considering who all was involved in this. I get the eyes, and they were weird but cool. But Alita's hair was just a mess. It moved like slow motion jello and at times, say the monobike scenes where it moved very awkwardly compared to how Hugo's hair was moving at the same time. The motion capture of Alita's mouth and a lot of her movements appeared to have been sloppily done and 'fixed' in post production as well. It looked like CGI and motion capture took a huge leap back for Cameron.If this was coming from some second tier start up it might have been five stars, to forgive the bad CGI moves, and just focusing critique on the bargain basement story but personally I expect Cameron's CGI-fests to be seamless blending with reality (which several characters were, but unfortunately not the lead).",Alita - Battle Angel

361,Abranth-d,Possibly Hollywood's best attempt at an anime adaptation,7,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of Alita : Battle Angel . So Alita stars Rosa Salazar as a cyborg in a dystopian world with no memory of her past. This movie's biggest words in marketing are "" From the producers of Titanic and Avatar "" not ""director of "" not "" writer of "" but just producer , so I thought this movie was gonna be a letdown since it gave the vibe of an other attempt at Hollywood making live action anime movies and I was proven wrong. It has a very linear story and sets up characters and explains the world in a matter of minutes through characters and not by some narrator. The cgi in this movie really impressed me , it was like video game cgi but with you being able to differentiate. The action sequences were well crafted and had zero shaky cam and top notch cgi to go with it . The supporting cast were great especially Christoph waltz as Dr Ivo. I think this is the first time Hollywood has successfully adapted cyberpunk anime or any anime for that matter into a cool movie. Despite all the kick-assery I felt the music score should've been better . In the end Alita : Battle angle was a surprisingly cool action flick with likeable characters , anime eyes , video game action ( mostly like mass effect on Earth meets mortal Kombat ) , one suit of armor and obviously better cgi than Doom Patrols cyborg.It sets up an ending for a sequel in a really cool way and I will watch it , cause this movie didn't forcefully set up a sequel like what every other studio is trying to do these days .",Alita - Battle Angel

363,JaikrishnaVS,A likable movie with certain obvious flaws,7,15 February 2019,"The movie left me with mixed opinions. One part of me absolutely loved the VFX, the heroine and bgm. The whole premise was pretty new to me due to my ignorance of the 'Manga' world. I certainly understand what the craze is all about. However, when a movie ends with more questions than answers by the end of it its obvious to leave you a bit flabbergasted and that is precisely how i felt.If you are a fan of 'manga', it probably is a no-brainer but for the rest of the world this movie is going to evoke a mixed response. You will be Wowed by the heroine, doctor, VFX and action but would be left questioning some of the cliched roles and characters including that of the villain and 'hero'.All I can say is that, there is a better chance of you liking it than disliking it.",Alita - Battle Angel
364,flowirin,Best Sci-Fi since Avatar,10,6 March 2019,"I loved this movie. Saw it in 3D. no expectations, but had seen a couple of spoiler free positive reviews. It was on at my local so I decided to give it a shot.I'm so glad I did. It is a beautiful movie. Took a little bit of getting used to those big eyes, and read a little like a Young Adult book (i don't read manga/anime), but I generally like reading YA scifi since it is more story driven with less complicated emotional nonsense.And that's where this movie excelled. A story that kept progressing. A straightforward arc for Alita, with a cute departure into infatuation that would have been offensive if it hadn't fitted so well.Loved the action scenes, loved the badassery and loved the humanity. the 3D was really well done too.So if you haven't, go and see it.

365,verminhater,Top quality scifi action film,9,11 February 2019,"The obvious comparison is Avatar. Whilst the story and some of the acting on Avatar sucked this most certainly does not. There are a number of reviews saying the story is somewhat lacking but I'd refute that. It's no John Le Carre complex thriller but by the standards of modern blockbusters it certainly holds it own. At no point was I thinking the story was an issue. The acting, which must be extremely demanding without the cgi in place for the actors to react to is first rate. Rosa Salazar really brings Alita to life and even the teens keep the almost now obligatory teenage angst out of the movie to it's credit. They come across as normal teens not the usual caricatures of them. I wish they'd have lingered on the emotional turmoil of a human brain in a cyborg body a little like Ghost in the Shell did, but in this universe it's an accepted procedure now so it's understandable they didn't. What you do get is lots and lots of action, lots of interesting villains and a definite sense of wanting more. If Avatar is worth 4 sequels this is worth twice that. The two hours flew by and I was thoroughly entertained. Many films don't reflect the trailers and you get a sense of being cheated. Not so with this. If you liked the trailers I expect you'll like the movie.",Alita - Battle Angel

None of that here guvnor. It actually reminded me of Terminator/Chappie and her character resembled Rami Malek in a few scenes. The storyline is good albeit a little predictable. The action scenes aren't overdone. I like the dystopian experience a movie can offer and found Ready Player One to be a big disappointment but with Alita it was nicely done.

368,FabledGentleman,"Great CGI & Heart pounding spectacle, but not enough time for story",6,5 February 2019,"In short: A gorgeous movie with good acting and lots of missed opportunities.Widely known as James Cameron's dream project, ""Alita: Battle Angel"" is a long awaited movie that was in the works for over 20 years. I was one of 450 lucky people to see this in an exclusive early IMAX 3D premiere, and i bought tickets the moment it was announced. I have been waiting for this movie for over a decade, so my hopes were already really high, question is, did it deliver or not?Spoiler: It didn'tIt was always Cameron's plan to direct this movie himself, but his Avatar projects got in the way. I'm a big fan of his work, and always have been, ever since i saw ""Aliens"", ""The Abyss"" and ""The Terminator"" in the 80's i have been a die hard fan. And in the 90's and beyond he just kept on giving with his movies ""T2"", ""True Lies"", ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"", the man really knows how to push boundaries.Every time Cameron makes a movie, he does so with such passion and invention, he changes the entire movie industry for decades to come. That's why, when he decided to give this project to Robert Rodriguez, i got a bit anxious, but he also gave Rodriguez some 600 written notes that described his ideas and vision for the film, which made me think that Rodriguez would do his best to fulfill Cameron's vision.Rodriguez has made some pretty good films in his career, and some really awful ones. He most certainly does not have the visionary scope that Cameron has, nor has he ever worked on a movie of this scale before. The closest is ""Sin City"", which was groundbreaking when it released, it's also what i would consider to be his finest piece of work.You see, ""Alita: Battle Angel"" has some issues. It could have been so much more, the script by Cameron was there, a great cast was there, it has James Cameron and Jon Landau as producers. So what exactly was missing? The problem is not really what was missing, it's what little is made of what it had, And this is the core problem with the film.I can't imagine Cameron himself would compromise so much of the deep story just to give us some action scenes. He always makes sure the story builds properly, so that when those defining moment arrive, we feel and we connect with the emotions of the characters, but that does not happen much in this film.The movie commits the cardinal sin of including too much, too fast, we have seen this countless times over the years, think ""Spiderman 3"" for example. There are too many characters that needs attention and too many stories cramped into a short time. I understand that the studios wants to get off quickly and go off the rails as soon as possible, but when they don't commit to really get to know the characters, and to dig deep into the story, it feels like just another average popcorn flick, and this wasn't suppose to happen here.This movie needed to establish the universe of Alita, establish the characters, and not be in such a rush to get to the ""fun stuff"". They made the decision to explore the universe deeper in the ""maybe to me made"" sequels, which is a really bad move. And it goes to show they targeted young kids, who don't care about story as much as adults, instead of focusing on a more mature audience, which the original manga was meant for in the first place.But that being said, the movie isn't bad, just disappointing. What the movie DOES have however, is monumental off the rails jaw dropping Special effects. The CGI is phenomenal, and the animations are spectacular, the special effects alone is indeed worth the ticket. You haven't seen CGI like this before, this is a new landmark.Some action scenes in this movie are an absolute thrill to watch, absolutely brilliantly executed. My favorite is a fight scene in a bar that just shows that if they had taken their time, this movie could have been a very enjoyable ride.If you have seen All of James Cameron's movies, like i have, you have noticed that he always include strong female characters, and this movie is no different. This movie might have the strongest female in any of his movies yet. This is the story of a cyborg girl who's found in a scrap yard, who doesn't know who she is, but has strong powers which she discovers as the story progresses. Her past arrives as flashbacks, and slowly she evolves into her new self as she discovers things about herself and make decisions on what she wants to become, and what she wants to achieve. A story about being alive, learning who you are, and what your purpose is. A moral tale of right and wrong, good vs evil.Making her eyes bigger, was a very bold and risky move, and it sparked quite a bit of controversy. But it was the right move, an absolute right move. Now i can't even visualize her without them. The eyes are the gate to your soul, and Alita, she has a very beautiful soul.But as i mentioned, there are some problems with the film, and arguably those problems could have been solved, maybe if the movie had been one hour longer. Or just have skipped events like motorball and leave those things for the sequels, or leave out a few characters, and let Alita have only one enemy at once for example. God dammit, i wish the industry could just lean back some times, and let things just evolve naturally. This movie needed that, the story is full of heart, but what does an emotional story accomplish if we don't have enough time to feel?But, none the less, what a great performance by Rosa Salazar, who brings so much life into the character. She is basically the reason this movie stays afloat. The other actors have way to little time to develop their characters properly which just makes them all feel hollow for the most part.6/10 - Fair",Alita - Battle Angel

371,Chiller7,A superb adaption of the best manga ever,10,16 February 2019,"As a longtime massive fan of the Battle Angel manga (a.k.a. GUNNM), which I consider a masterpiece and my favorite comicbook of all time, this movie gets full approval from me. This is a superb adaption that largely faithfully recreates what made the original manga great, a perfect coupling of badass sci-fi action with a story that's full of heart. It's clear that the people behind the movie, notably James Cameron who made sure to secure the movie rights himself because he loved it so much, are fans of the original work as well, considering their care in preserving what made the original manga work so well.This movie looks great, from the well-shot action scenes - with, thankfully, none of the disorienting rapidly-edited shaky-cam that plagues too many action movies these days - to the superior quality CGI that seamlessly blends what's real with what's not. Director Robert Rodriguez handled all this well.I love that Alita is a character who defies the conventions and clichés trending now in recent movies, as embodied by the currently popular superhero genre, because Alita is not some defender of justice who simply fights the bad guys for the sake of the innocent or anything like that. It's more like she doesn't really know what she's fighting for and that's what makes her such a compelling, complex character.I love that this is a movie that dares to take itself and its own themes and story seriously at a time when the most popular comicbook-based and/or sci-fi type movies are afraid of taking themselves too seriously these days, as most prominently evidenced by Disney's Marvel & Star Wars movies, with their constant stream of silly humor, like they're winking at the audience every few minutes, reassuring us they're not taking themselves too seriously. I'm glad Alita: Battle Angel does not adopt the silly tone that's become standard today. Unfortunately, it's this reason that I'm afraid the rotten critics with their rotten ratings are being unkind to Alita, like how dare something in the lowly sci-fi genre aim to be something greater than it deserves. If you like the critic-friendly Disney style of treating everything like a silly lighthearted joke, feel free to side with the rotten critics, but if you can appreciate a story that dares to be serious, give this movie a chance. You will love it.",Alita - Battle Angel

374,mr_sharma,Pretty Ordinary,6,17 May 2020,"As in it looks pretty but is just plain ordinary.This film had so much potential. A lot of green screen, CGI and VFX were thrown at this. But the ultimate outcome is, ""yeah and?"".This is a top notch star cast who, by the end, look like amateur dramatists. James Cameron producer. He's also The co-writer. His writing partner has a good pedigree too (minus Terminator: Genysis) and Roberto Rodriguez directing.Starts off well with the world building but by the third act, the characters do some really uncharacteristic things and whole thing just gets into an methodical look at how make sure all loose ends are neatly tied up. It's just too clean and sterile, from a story telling perspective, and doesn't make sense.I honestly couldn't care less about any of these people because the whole thing is forced. The ""falling in love"" is forced, the villain(s) are caricatures by the end, fight scenes are forced....there is nothing new or interesting in this from a story point of view....and by the end, you realise the biggest ruse of all...this film is set up for a sequel (at the least)....so it's not like it's a full story.The whole talk was about the leading character being a ""virtual"" actor. Which is fine by me and that choice to use a cgi character Is good considering that this film allows for that leniency. She's Alita. She's a battle angel....of which why she's a battle angel isn't really fully discussed. But then some other characters are CGI'd and others have human actor faces....why? I don't understand why do that. The CGI faces do look like CGI and yeah sure they are very good but still they look like CGI faces.Ultimately, it's pretty ordinary story dolled up to show off cutting edge CGI and that is also, in the rapidly moving day and age, pretty ordinary too.Watch it if you're on your own on a evening, with a beer, where you just want to see pretty pictures and switch off your brain.

Battle Angel Alita is actually a series I know very little about, but from what I have read this film is a lot more faithful to its source material than most adaptations, changing only a few things to better fit the structure and pacing of a film whilst retconning a few elements to make the overall product feel a bit more thoroughly realized. Part of this review is based on what my roommate has told me about the comic and how he feels the film stacks up, and from what he says it seems the original is a bit dated and a number of my gripes are that not enough was done to make the story more substance over style or to flesh out characters more, especially the love interest character who is apparently abysmal in the manga.The main characters, Alita and Dr. Ido are fantastic and are the main crux of the story. It's refreshing to have a character like Ido who appears suspicious but doesn't maliciously hide information from Alita, and Alita's naivity and juvenile nature are adequately explained even if she is a bit frustrating at times. Ido is an incredibly reasonable person and I felt myself sympathizing with him a lot throughout the film. Alita is incredibly overpowered, but fortunately her charming and heroic personality allows her conflicts to be enjoyable all the same. Alita is the most powerful, but she is constantly biting off more than she can chew, allowing for actual tension in the action sequences despite the fact that you know she'll make it through by the end of it. The comic relief at times is impeccable, especially in the pub scene where Alita gives an inspirational speech to only be ridiculed immediately. In this sense, the spirit of the manga is also retained as in many aspects the manga was a comedy-drama. Desty Nova seems to be quite overpowered in this iteration and seems to have less character depth than in the manga, but I'll have to wait for the sequel to really determine how much of a mistake this change is. He just seems like a generic all-powerful villain by the end of this first film.The visuals are surprisingly refined given how odd I found the first trailer. The main reason I was so excited to see this film was to laugh at the bizarre anime eyes and all the mistakes they would make like in Ghost in the Shell, but I found myself getting past the odd visuals within the first ten minutes and was able to enjoy the film for what it was. It is a bit of a style-over-substance film, but there is enough character and enough of a story with twists and turns and conflict to keep it engaging even if only at a primitive level. Alita: Battle Angel might not make you think quite as hard as the original Ghost in the Shell, or the anime Ergo Proxy, but it is entertaining nonetheless, and its polish allows it to be very easy to digest and combined with the superb pacing there's not really any particular moment in the film that stands out as filler.I would recommend Alita: Battle Angel. It feels like what Ready Player One was to most people, though I hated that film and enjoyed this one a lot. I wouldn't quite say this is a great film, but it's quite a well conceived product that pays enough respect to the source material to justify its existence.",Alita - Battle Angel
385,keyope,"Visually stunning, but very dull",5,6 August 2019,"This movie looks wonderful and I liked the characters Alita and Hugo, however this film has no suspense or tension. It's well shot and each scene on its own is okay, but I just didn't care about what happened.The script has just borrowed ideas and scenes from lots of other sci fi films like The Matrix and I Robot, but where those films had elements of mystery and a story that unfolded gradually giving the viewer pieces of information gradually, this one just meanders along, switching between so-so CGI action scenes and boring exposition scenes. The script is just bad. In order to get from one action scene to the next, characters just phone Alita up and say stuff like, ""Hey Alita something bad is about to happen a few miles away, can you get there?"" And then the film cuts to the scene in question, Alita shows up and the action happens.There are lots of bad guys but their motives are virtually non existent. It's just ""Kill Alita, or Hugo"" Why? ""Because, the boss says so"" And who is the boss? Dunno.A series of action scenes involving Alita beating up the same characters again and again doesn't make for an entertaining film. And a villain who doesn't show his face or reveal his motives isn't interesting either. Total waste of some decent performances from the lead actors.Disappointed.",Alita - Battle Angel
386,ksdouglas-23618,R Rated Astro Boy,6,28 July 2019,"I enjoyed this movie for what it is: a high octane CGI cyborg fight fest. The story was predictable, your typical dystopian lower class vs the upper echelon who keep their foot on the ill-well little people of society.The effects are amazing and the lore behind the story is well integrated.I found the main heroine way too naive when in fact she's a hardwired super Speznas SEAL Ranger cyborg warrior from space. I found the MC innocences was used mostly to push an insta love subplot that really could have been handled a lot better IMO.The plot isn't anything spectacular and the action scenes playout like video game cutscenes from the PlayStation 2 era. Alita: Battle Angel is basically a amalgamation of other films rolled up into one. You won't have to try hard to find the similarities. Right away there's Astro Boy, Mortal Engines, The Iron Giant, Blade Runner, and basically every YA novel featuring a teenage girl protagonist and the ""bad boy"" hunk bro love interest.The story ends without resolving any of its major plot beats, and the movie was like watching the 1 season of a Netflix TV show. There are lots of interesting ideas at play here, but I feel the execution could had been handled a lot better. There will be a sequel, obviously, but I don't see how any hype will be generated for it.",Alita - Battle Angel

I had low expectations for the film, but it turned out to be really cool. The plot is pretty solid. Acting is actually pretty good too! This movie will actually to the future. I actually felt like I was a part of the movie... like actually living in it. It is great!",Alita - Battle Angel
389,travisvincent,Great visuals and decent story,9,23 February 2020,"Alita is a beautiful visual experience, the storyline while a bit confusing is predictable. You don't really need to follow the story to know where it's going but it's a great ride. The action is top notch and the visuals as mentioned before, are amazing. This looked and felt like a James Cameron film and seeing how he's attached to it makes sense. My only complaint was the end made it seem as if it was setting up for a sequel and I'm tired of every movie attempting to be a franchise, though I know this is based on books. However it's not a flaw and I would definitely see a sequel if one were to appear.",Alita - Battle Angel

Although some tonal issues are present and the movie tries to promote too many endings, Alita's battle sequences and overall story manages to overcome those issues.",Alita - Battle Angel

Fighting sequences are very good visually but its somehow mandatory for CGI movie. This film (for me) has a felling like ""lets try this technique to shoot a movie..""

393,mistela67,Enjoyable movie,8,25 February 2019,"For all of you that are hestiating seeing this movie, I would encourage you to see it. The pace was very nice, the action superb, the acting was good enough, and overall, it's an entertaining movie. It gets a bit melodramatic, but that's not a bad thing with this sort of movie. I never really felt bored watching Alita. As long as you let yourself be carried by the narrative, you'll enjoy it. Delve to deeply into it, or try to find points of critque, not so much. Recommended.",Alita - Battle Angel
394,feritciva,seriously are you all kidding?,1,23 February 2019,"This movie's nowhere near Terminator I/II or Avatar or any other action/sci-fi films. It is even not anywhere near new Terminator movies. I seriously cannot understand some of the reviews here. People, have you not watched a decent movie? Every scene - but every scene - is filled with the most boring & annoying cliches here. No characters, no plot, no sub-plot.Seriosly are you all kidding??",Alita - Battle Angel

My only complaint was that it felt a little long, but that's probably my back problems speaking and not a issue with the movie.The story and characters felt fresh, acting was spot on.

399,jtags-84059,Absolutely Entertaining,10,27 February 2019,First 10 I've given and I didn't think I'd be handing it out so soon. This movie is so good I'll be going back for a second look which is something I've rarely ever done for a movie. I have to admit also I went in blind with no expectations and no idea that this was a Manga adaptation. I thought the movie was excellent in all areas. The visuals and graphics were amazing. The human actors were very good and the interaction with the graphic robotics was amazing. I also loved the story line and the way the main character was developed from scratch literally. It is definitely a character you can identify with and cheer for. Someone who see's and tries to do the right thing even when it looks naive and impossible and fights to the last breath. It reminded me of the Wonder Woman movie character which I also liked. I guess because it was from a Manga they tried to pack a lot in their but everything made sense and you weren't left with any gaping plot holes or questions. In fact the movie although it seemed to end unfinished you felt it was still complete but looking forward hopefully to a sequel.,Alita - Battle Angel
400,dlracer2,It's all about the visuals,3,3 August 2019,"To say that character building is rushed would be an understatement. There are some interesting scenes that were borrowed from genres like Total Recall, Terminator, Blade Runner, Rollerball, I Robot, Minority Report, and some other things. Acting was really not spectacular. Jennifer Connelly was especially disappointing.Just vapid, empty story telling that desperately tried to make an emotional connection with the viewer but failed.It almost seemed to be a fourth wall of self awareness the movie had of being pathetically desperate to strike an emotional chord.Characters that are well written have reasons to do what they do. Our characters simply are because action must happen. Par for the course for today's typical brand of schlock to make a buck because people go see garbage with big explosions and disconnected action because they are shallow and vain.Skip Alita, watch The 5th Element or the original Total Recall again.",Alita - Battle Angel

There is a lot to like about this movie. The cast in this movie is great each person gives a great performance. The cgi and visuals in this movie are visually stunning and deserve awards. The action in this movie is great to and is well shot and well choreographed. The story in this movie is well made and the script is well crafted. The character development in this movie is done very good. The movie has great music. There is only one problem I have with the movie and that is the villain because the Villain in this movie is very under developed which sucks because he could of been a great villain.

403,Rifat_Rock_Don,Amazing sci-fi movie,9,16 July 2020,I don't know what to say... This movie is perfect as an Action-Sci Fi movie!. Not t00 much drama. Just enough. Cool action/fighting scene. Fights are not too long. Short and sweet. I guess people who rated this so low.. they don't even like a Scifi/Action genre or don't know how to enjoy this ty pe of movie. CGI is always very smooth except at the near ending scene where they going up on the pipe. Real face of his boy friend with cy borg body looks disappointing.not neat at al..

There are still many shortcomings in the plot, but the technology is already very good. CG performed with real people, but there was basically no sense of disharmony.

405,Rainbowbeany,Alita chapter 1 volume 1,6,15 February 2019,"Quick review. Alita is a bunch of movies compacted together to make the first chapter of the movie you really want. It has flairs of Blade Runner, Wonder Woman, Frankenstein even John Wick at one point. The action and special effects work! I applaud the visual effects, they are truly state of the art. The stand outs in acting were Rosa Salazar and Christoph Waltz their performances were the glue of the whole movie. The action was fun and helped me enjoy the mashed up craziness. If you like avatar and movies with a TON of cgi this is the movie for you! If you wanted to see a satisfactory ending to this, don't hold your breath. The next movie looks promising if they ever get to make it.",Alita - Battle Angel

Now I am frantically searching for some IMAX shows nearby, feeling sorry how could I miss this since so long.The cinematography is just top notch. The CGI and visuals are stunning.
Looks like James Cameron was not just the writer of this movie, the frames have every signature of Cameron all the time.And man, how much I loved Rosa Salazar here. She is the future star to look for now. And so good to see Christoph Waltz in a sci-fi movie like this. He is an actor who suits in every role so perfectly.This is one of the rare movies I would eagerly stand by for the sequel. Can't wait for Edward Norton joining the party.",Alita - Battle Angel
407,pdqpaul,Not good,2,4 December 2019,"I'm sorry, It takes a lot for me to give any movie a really poor rating, and two stars for this movie, I think is more than generous. I just purchased this movie, only because the previews looked great, usually I would never spend more than a few dollars for a dvd, but I really thought I like this movie, I'm really disappointed. it just entirely drags out way to long, and the every action scene is must have been in the previews. the plot wasn't even that great, they could have made it much more action, and a whole lot less talking. so disappointed. I just wasted money buying this movie. The concept, was okay, but the whole movie could have been much better. again. so disappointed. and anybody that reads my reviews, knows that I don't give this poor review unless I really think the movie is terrible. so disappointed. just long and drawn out, half way through I just started fast forwarding a lot.",Alita - Battle Angel

Even those in minor roles become embedded into the story due to their unique visual qualities.A multitude of good actors, a little bit of love and comedy with a heap of action balances out the story to present it as a nice little package.I would not normally promote 3D because I feel that it blurs the action and darkens the screen. However this movie was perfectly adapted to 3D and I never found the effect to be a hindrance in any way. I experienced this in Vmax at Pacific Fair.",Alita - Battle Angel

That was a great performance.Keep in mind that I am a heavy manga reader, this without a doubt allowed me to suspend my disbelief.Nothing left to say except watch this film and judge for yourself.",Alita - Battle Angel
410,craigthomas90,They held back.,7,26 February 2019,"It's a solid film that possesses more romantic fuel than I expected. It feels as though so much of the story was suppressed due to the fact the studio heads wish to build a franchise;This cheats the viewer. It's insulting and presumptuous. The goal should always be to make each, and every movie the best it can be; if a film performs well, then sequels can be discussed. With that said, the love interest seems rushed, forced, and cliche. The CGI is solid but not the best; Star Trek(2009) computer generated images are far superior and that was 10 years ago. The 'game' played is undeveloped, and just thrown on the screen with as little background as possible(A cue from Harry Potter wouldn't have hurt). The major take away is the feeling that this film, seems imcomplete for the benefit of a sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel
411,tlooknbill,Most advanced 300 year old technology & all it can do is fight? REALLY?!,5,20 February 2019,"Went to see this just to find out why the character had bug eyes as I was told the plot would reveal and it didn't. Others said it was Cameron's homage to the large eyes drawn in the Manga cartoon animation style. This movie has so much eye popping CGI any resemblance to Manga was totally lost on me. I never watched the old limited frame rate animation back when it was popular in the '90's and I'm a cartoonist.I did go see it for the CGI artistry which was VERY good and realistic but the overall look with its thick halo edge sharpness and overly contrasty color grading made it all seem like an animated Brothers Hildebrandt illustration. I think the Sony 4K projector I saw it on might have needed some recalibration. Not sure.The plot points made by ""KingofyourCastle"" review is spot on in that there's too many contradictions in Alita's motivations driving her character as an innocent caring teenager but yet can commit such brutal acts without second thoughts makes me not care about her.I was left feeling why should I care about this world she occupies? Nothing makes sense in the plot. It comes across totally constructed like some hologram to allow her to demonstrate her martial arts prowess.It's a beautiful looking movie depicting a world I don't really care about. Avatar I did care about and thought much better than Alita.",Alita - Battle Angel

Like Ready Player One, Alita: Battle Angel shares the same genes as those movies. It's already coming to an end of a decade, the beginning of the spectrum successfully wowed people merely with dazzling images and outstanding camera tricks but as viewers see this over and over again, they are numb by that so-called 'WOW' aspect. Hollywood may not acquire the thinking, but viewers want something more than 'just' CGI. Can and will Alita: Battle Angel surpass audience and critics' expectations?The dystopian city is engaging to see as it manages to explore for the first 30 mins of the film, with groundbreaking motorball sport, new gladiatorial arena, visually striking neon-coloured lights and inventive vehicles.Alita undoubtedly keeps the movie going by concentrating on the character development to drive the plot forward. Of course, it is imperative to possess the former however, it gets too dependent that the audience feels as if the movie is void of storytelling because of the meticulous details of the robotic-machinery cyborg's life.Alita: Battle Angel truly deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects. The attention to visual details on Alita's figures is precisely well done as it blends the real-life human feat. CGI vessels into a character played by Maze Runner and Bird Box's actress, Rosa Salazar. What's spectacular is the audience will feel the humanity side of Alita as she makes careful nuances of expressions on her robotic face.It does not deliver an action-packed showcase but every time Alita knocks down on enemies, she punches just the right angles to amaze you with her slick choreographed attack movements that neither bores or disappoints viewers.Leaving the viewers bewildered, Alita: Battle Angel puts away the spotlight for introducing the focal point of an antagonist, instead we are provided by a foggy gallery of villians with each of them serves different agendas that lead back to square one, Alita.Humorless script as it is, Alita stays away from the typical sideline jokes but one will wonder hilarious things that may be bared as plot holes unless are answered such as, 'Will Alita get pregnant after an intimate relationship?', 'How does she have intercourse?' and etc.Most of the roles here are wasted due to the tremendous amount of time is sacrificed for Alita's story. Mahershala Ali's fails to show off his true villain, Lana Condor's only on the screen for a line of dialogues, Jennifer Connelly's chemistry with Alita and Ido is unbearable and Baby Driver hot girl, Eiza Gonzalez's character... erk... just shoot me already.A few scenes fail to impress the viewers, as the contents may be lame or tedious albeit they move the story forward.Verdict: Alita certainly captures the eyes of every beholder in theaters by the stunning and mesmerizing visual experience but the crew's lackadaisical attitude may drain down the greasy malfunctioning plot and it surely targets to produce half a dozen sequel after this beforehand predecessor or the least, a set of 'bermuda trilogy'.",Alita - Battle Angel
415,waterman1976,Stunning in every way,10,27 December 2020,"What a beautiful movie this is. It pulls you in directly from the beginning and takes you on a fairytale-like journey. But don't get fooled by the big puppy eyes of the beautifully cgi'd lead. It tells a dark tale with pretty decent violence and (I don't have children) I'm not sure from what age I would want them to see this. But it is a story you would want to show to a younger audience, because of its backstory of heriosm, love and hope for a better future. But besides all that, ABA is mindblowingly beautiful. The story is good, the script is good, the cast with Waltz, Salazar, Connelly and Ali is great (Connelly always brings this magnetism to the screen and Waltz as a caring guardian is great) and the world they live in is stunning.

Sorry but the reliance on CGI has deflected the movie from all the things that would turn an okay movie into a great one. Yes the robots were impressive, but there was no real character development, no real context or back end story. There was little in the way of a story being developed but perhaps they are thinking of making a follow up to fill the gaps (of which there were lots).I sort of feel I wasted a couple of hours of my life watching this.

420,TheConnoisseurReviews,Visual Treat,7,20 February 2019,"""Alita: Battle Angel"" is a fun and entertaining time. It has a lot of incredible visual effect and amazing fight sequences. The characters are fun and charming, especially Alita and Dr. Ido. I think the cast adds a lot of life to the character that otherwise could have been dull. I think it does falter on the narrative side of things. The story itself is too simple and very predictable. I could see every plot point and character motive coming from a mile away. It's a basic dystopian society with a tyrannical leader that can only be overthrown by ""the chosen one"" story. However, I feel like there is more to the it than just that, but the film doesn't spend enough time developing the story beyond what we get. On the brightside, James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez have crafted an incredible world that's filled with so much life and imagination. The world building is very real and it made me want to see more and more of the geography that was crafted for this film. I'm sure in a sequel, (fingers crossed) they can expand on it even further. Even though the story is weak, I feel like the world building and the characters are worth your time. This is definitely a event film that should be experienced for it breathtaking visuals and action. I give it 3.5/5",Alita - Battle Angel

I loved the trailer and the whole look of the movie. I just wanted to see more of Alita and that world. Visually, it's amazing. I don't know what they did, but they avoided the uncanny valley, maybe because the cyborgs are so different from a human, while they feel they could be human.Yes, Alita is great, her personality is great but everyone else is just so stupid. And the way the society works or even how the cyborg work is a total mess. Maybe with a more in-depth explanation, I could have bought into their sci-fi magic but at its core, this movie is very shallow. And that is too bad because I could see potential in every scene.This is not only a tech demo. And yes, I love cyborg fights and visually impressive things but I couldn't stand that this movie doesn't' just start with the expectation of cool cyborg fights and more fights. I could clearly see there was some thought involved but they were too afraid to push the boundaries and instead just went with the coolness factor without any more thought. Such a disappointment.I didn't read the manga so I don't know about what they got right or not but as a self-contained story, this movie doesn't work. Maybe after I've read the manga and I see the story, I could watch the movie just for the special effects and appreciate it.",Alita - Battle Angel

What can Alita ever be when motherhood has been denied to her?Anyway, if we succeed to steer our minds away from that sad aspect of the film. Its a great movie. Fun, charming, visually stunning, heartwarming, cute and exciting. Some of the sport-fight scenes are just super wow. This is the best screen adaptation of manga I have seen.

Example, ""In another scene, after a devastating battle with a big bad cyborg, Alita must trade out the delicate, girlish body the doctor had built for his daughter (not weird-at all!) for a warrior-grade bod that adheres to her, um, vision of herself. That vision includes a corset-sized tiny waist and an athletic set of breasts that defy gravity."" Ummm, so a normal-sized, normal proportioned body with B-cups that ""defy gravity"" (ummm, her body is metallic after all are now signs of the patriarchy? Give it a rest, please.This is a fantastic film, amazing fight-scenes as we've come to expect from this action film director par excellence, and it did exceptionally well with the source material. And, btw, who doesn't like chocolate?

Alita looks as good if not better than any movie ever made. Top notch. All the characters are great, but Alita herself is spellbinding. Innocent, naive, sweet, heartfelt, determined, and relentless. She is a character that you can instantly fall in love with. The story had a lot to cover in the time that it had, but was very nicely done and well paced. The acting was awesome all around but especially with Alita. The critics flat out got this one wrong and this is exactly what a movie based on an anime should be.

430,pinkled5,"Wonderful Characters, Unfocused Story",7,18 February 2019,"Alita did what a good movie should always do...make you care about the characters. I was smitten with Alita from the moment she was activated and I grew to care more about her and her relationships with the other characters as the movie progressed. The action sequences were also well done. Unfortunately, there's not a clear plot here. This movie didn't know what it wanted to be about, whether it was Alita discovering herself, her budding romance with a human, her passion for MotorBall, her relationship with her ""father,"" or defeating some nameless enemy. If it would have had a stronger plot this movie could have easily been a 9 or 10 for me, which I do not give out easily. Unfortunately, its stuck at a 7, which is still pretty good, but it could have been so much better.",Alita - Battle Angel
431,zeionara,League of cyborgs,7,19 February 2019,"The movie seems like a very nice creation in it's genre - it doesn't make you bored, but unfortunately doesn't present an original form of cinema art in the same time. On the one hand, it is much better than other recent pictures having similar genre (Aquaman, for example), and on the other, it could be made much better if requirements covering searching for new ways of ideas expression and opening new edges in cinema art were given more priority than creating something which will be accepted by the vast of community.
But, what is simultaneously authentic, ordinary and unexpected is that thread of action could be compared to developing a character in some RPG. At start you have a weak person which becomes stronger and well-weaponed in time, what I have not mentioned in movies that I've watched earlier. If we talk about visual component of the movie, it is well enough with it's own original shape, which, however, stays in the realm of picture common for movies like this (the same is about sound and music). Though I can't say that movie doesn't left after this an original (the same is about sound and music). Some moments were outstandingly cute and beautiful.
What about not very good in this movie - actions are surely not always comprehendible and sometimes decisions of characters seem at least strange. Despite movie has been created on the base of anime, the original plot has been significantly changed in direction of making scenes more full of actions, what is common for many other pictures - not in direction of making movie look more selfsolid. Concept of some scenes have been already used in many other pictures, so it is not interesting to see it again even in other form.
As a result - I would recommend the movie for watching only in case you have got a strong desire to watch a movie only in genre of action/adventures/fighting, in other situations there could be found other pictures that more worth watching than this (but possibly, you're already tired of searching for some good movies - that too could be a reason for taking a pause and watching this movie just to catch up with what is happening on a good side of popular cinematography).",Alita - Battle Angel

Nope.It was worse!I've said it before and I will say it again: Anime will never work as big budget Hollywood blockbusters! No matter how much money is thrown at it or who is directing, producing, or starring in it!The fact this film has both Robert Rodriguez and James Cameron attached to it and it still managed to suck - is proof of my statement!Those of you who have seen the original Anime film will know that it is dark, bleak, depressing as hell and very R-rated!So what does Hollywood do? Slap a PG13 on it and make it a love story, ffs! 🤦

440,Yrrepk,92% -- The Greatest Anime Movie,9,13 March 2021,"This is one of the absolute best movies that's been released in recent years. For one, it probably has the best CGI ever put to screen. Not only is the action and world design incredible, but Alita's design couldn't be more perfect. It's very ""human-like"" but there are features (eg, her eyes) so that it doesn't go near the ""scary"" territory.And for those complaining about the story, note the following: Animes are almost always far longer than a two-hour film, and the first arc (or few) are designed specifically to (i) introduce the characters and (ii) provide said characters with motivation for future arcs. This movie perfectly introduces each character in a thoroughly entertaining two hours, and it does a great job of preparing for a sequel(s). There are 9 volumes of the Manga and this movie only covers the first two, and good animes typically get a lot better the deeper you get, so let's just hope Disney allows the creators to make this into a 3-4 movie series.Also, the critics managed to give this a whopping average of 53%. Take this as confirmation: there's never any scenario where you should find yourself reading a review from a ""critic"".",Alita - Battle Angel
441,TheJediWay9,Very Surface Level,6,15 February 2019,"""Alita: Battle Angel"" is the new sci-fi epic from director Robert Rodriguez and is written by James Cameron. It features Alita (Rosa Salazar), a cyborg who is picked up in a scrapyard in the futuristic Iron City by Doctor Ido (Christoph Waltz). He repairs her but she has no memory of where she cam from and she believes she came from Zalem, the city in the sky so she tries get there but runs into trouble along the way.The more and more footage I saw of ""Alita: Battle Angel"" from trailers, behind the scenes, and TV spots, I was really looking forward to it after initially thinking it was gonna be some sci-fi throwaway movie. I also had no idea that it was based on a Japanese manga of the same name until I had seen the movie. I left the theater a bit disappointed. I felt as if the movie was a bit uneven. There's no doubt there's a lot of good in the movie, but it leaves a lot to be desired. It's a very surface level movie, and given the talent in front of and behind the camera, that's not good when a movie like this costs $200 million to make. I didn't find myself invested in any of the characters except for Ido. Even Alita doesn't have much character development. She doesn't learn much about herself throughout the movie, though she is a likable action hero and is easy to root for.The central romance set up in the story makes no sense. The entire thing feels like a distraction. The movie is entertaining enough where most of the flaws can be passed by, but then it cuts back to this romance and it feels so tacked on. It was an element of the movie that didn't have to be there. The villains were also very weak. Vector (Mahershala Ali) is very weak. He's a corporate baddie with sunglasses and a business suit. THAT'S. IT. The henchmen are no better and this film cannot figure out which henchmen/bounty hunters it wants to focus on. Three times, THREE, Alita fights the same character. It felt like I was playing Super Mario 64 and I had to defeat Bowser three times. The screenplay became so muddled trying to balance all of these villain elements out.The biggest issue I have with this film is the fact it is sequel bait. The entire third act is all set up for a sequel that we don't even know will happen. I get it's based off a manga and that there are big name filmmakers working on this project, but you can't bank on that to deliver a sequel. The film has to make money, earn good word of mouth, and get a least decent reviews. It seems everything in Hollywood movies nowadays is just there to be setup for sequels.There are good things in this film too. The visuals are SPECTACULAR, some of the best visuals I've ever seen in a movie. And it makes the action set pieces standout a lot more, which are very entertaining and fun to watch. Though I wanted more of this sequence, the Motorball sequence had me on the edge of my seat. There is also an action sequence towards the middle of the film that I really enjoyed. The film offers entertaining sequences where you can sit back, relax, stuff your face with that buttery popcorn, and have a good time. It is also a movie that sets up its world very well. The rules, laws, background, all of it, is very cool and very well done. But unfortunately the movie as a whole is just middle of the road. It has lots of surface level stuff, and that's a damn shame.I am going to give ""Alita: Battle Angel"" a C+.",Alita - Battle Angel
442,SeriousMayhem,Not as good as it could have been.,6,21 July 2019,"I expected a lot after seeing the trailer, but I was pretty disappointed.In the first half hour a bunch of characters are introduced to us through a series of random events. Strangely enough, none of these characters are developed at all and as such I never cared about any of them.There's even a ""romance"" that starts and develops so silly and cringeworthy, I'd just rather forget about it entirely. It's like a 12 year old made it up.A big portion of the movie is just ""stuff happening"", for no apparent reason. Some actions scenes to show off the CGI, it's all there (and the CGI is amazing) but it's mostly meaningless filler.Lacking flow and fluidity, the story plods along all over the place and suffering from hiccups. The main story only picks up with about 20 minutes to go, and leaves us with a cliffhanger.. which isn't really a cliffhanger at all but moreso a ""we decided to stop the movie here, cya for part 2 suckers!""The movie has a clear desire for wanting to deal with concepts like emotions. And while it largely succeeds in that when it comes to Alita, it's glaringly obvious that this movie in its entirety has a clear lack of emotion and soul.Something similar is going on with the worldbuilding, which is extensive and actually quite good when you sit down and think about it. Yet, it doesn't convincingly manage to get that across on the screen at all; it felt like a lifeless world to me.All in all, not an unlikeable movie. It's just not as good as it wants to be. 6/10, and that's barely.",Alita - Battle Angel
443,sasquach1,Laughably bad,4,18 February 2019,"4 out of 10 just for the CGI. Story and dialogue are poor at best. There are dramatic scene where I laughed, as well as others next to me.

444,warren-87235,Forget the glut of bland superhero movies... just watch Alita!,10,14 February 2019,"Since Titanic and Avatar, I've stopped expecting Cameron movies to be great, but having seen this on 3D Imax the other day... let's just say he and Robert Rodriguez won me over again! Alita is the best big sci-fi action movie I've seen in a _long_ time. In an age where we're just seeing the same plots recycled again and again with interchangeable, soulless super-heroes, I enjoyed the hell out of this. I'm not saying it was perfect, but I was pleasantly surprised. I could have sat in that cinema for another couple of hours, without any worry of boredom. I can't remember the last time I watched a big effects movie and felt so completely lost in it.Although I was aware of Battle Angel Alita, I've never been a massive Anime fan and never read or watched the original anime, so I had no preconceptions or expectations going in. Many of the plot themes and ideas may have been done before(**cough** Rollerball - amongst others **cough**), but you can say that about almost any movie. The real question is whether those ideas are packaged in a new engrossing story with interesting characters and the answer, in Alita's case, is a big yes.Rosa Salazar is brilliant as Alita. The level of emotion she gets through the mo-cap is astonishing, and quite honestly puts many live action stars to shame. The large eyes may stem from honouring her anime origins, but you soon forget them, and only see the character. Not only that, but in the context of the story and her past, they feel quite logical.There's a hefty dose of Robocop to her story, in a good way, whilst her character has a sincerity and (non-annoying) innocence that all combines to make her a sympathetic hero that you want to see succeed. So from my perspective, I can't recommend Alita enough! This is the kind of blockbuster I hope is successful, because I truly want to watch the sequel.As with so many big-budget effects movies, I went in hoping for the best, but expecting yet another 'all-flash, no-substance' movie, like so many of the Marvel films. I was happy to be wrong for a change.I can't wait for the 3D Blu Ray to enjoy this again, and especially watch how it was made. I may even have to see it again at the cinema, before it finishes its run... It's been a while since I could say that about a big blockbuster!",Alita - Battle Angel
445,Fourstrawberries,Hollywood redeems itself - an epic superhero movie...,9,25 February 2019,"Action, love and romance all done right. Normally the emotional side of a movie is so badly done, it provides a useful interlude for a beer. It doesn't much worse than the ""Twilight"" series. But cynical me was swept along by this truly epic movie, even shedding a tear at one point.It was wall-to-wall CGI, but it's hardly noticeable as you are sucked into the world of Alita and taken for the ride of a lifetime.Of course, Hollywood scriptwriters stick to one plot, and this one differs little from any other. They picked up the screenplay for the ""Hunger Games""' and chucked it at Cameron. But the director has taken this tedious storyline and breathed magic into it, bravo! They left the ending open for sequels, but I'm not sure it will stand a sequel, let alone several. See it on the big-screen if you can, to get the best out of it.",Alita - Battle Angel

447,taz1004,Pure Entertainment. Don't expect a lesson in life.,8,19 February 2019,"Critics are very harsh on this movie whereas public is exactly opposite. The criticism is mostly on the story whereas praise is on the action. Well... this is an action movie. Just don't expect life altering philosophical discovery and you'll enjoy this movie far more than the critics.The story is old. And reason why the story seems mix of variety of movies is because those variety of movies took it from Alita. But regardless of who started it first, story may seem nothing new to someone who's not familiar with the original. And the development of the story seem rushed at times. And this is mostly because the movie allocated quite a bit of screen time on Motorball. Which isn't included in the original anime. But ironically, Motorball sequence is the best part of this movie. I'd sacrifice any of the romantic sequence for the Motorball action. This IS an action movie.Acting for the most part was good except Hugo. Hugo in the original was almost mad about Zalem. Which makes you understand his behavior and obsession. In this movie, he seems like a kid wanting to go to Disneyland. Jennifer Connelly's role was under played. These two are probably what many of the story complaints are about and I agree to some degree but it's not enough to ruin the movie.Just like Ready Player One, this is just an entertaining movie.

So from an asthetical point of view it works.However - the below world feels very, VERY small - more like the ""planet of the week on Star Trek"" - with only very few and small detailed locations. We have the tavern thing where the bounty hunters hang out, the clinik and 2 or 3 generic streets. We also have the Arena where they do this inline-skating thing.We never see the above city.The doctor character is OK - but not really explained sufficiently. That means, i have no idea what he is all about. Mechanic? Junk yard guy? Medical doctor? Bounty hunter?!? or something other.
We get Alita, who just does not fit in. No one else has such huge manga eyes, despite there being tons of robots.Oh, and there is also this woman that seems to know the doctor ... that is never explained.The ""love-story"" is about as idiotic and fleshed out as the love story in the Star Wars prequels .. maybe worse. The dialogues are cringe-worthy at times ... and the delivery on par with the quality of a never ending telenovela.Visuals are sometimes amazing .. sometimes aweful. While Alita looks pretty good most of the time .. some flashback scenes look like they are straight out of a (fairly old) playstation 3 cut-scene. The wider city shots are awefully under-detailed.And at no point it becomes clear under what ""rules"" the world works. Who dies? Who is just ""damaged"" and quickly repaired?

456,politicidal,The best live action manga film yet. A wild and entertaining sci-fi thriller.,8,19 December 2019,"ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL delivers slam bang action, cutting edge visual effect,s and remarkable world-building skill on the part of director Robert Rodriguez.In fairness, he also had a little help from Hollywood legend James Cameron as producer as well. Up-and-coming actress Rosa Salazar shines as the all digital heroine Alita, a petite yet powerful cyborg unearthed by a kindly scientist (Waltz) and raised in the futuristic dystopia of Iron City.Salazar displays a wide range of emotions as the immediately endearing Alita and the visual effects work on her expressions is impeccable. Christoph Waltz plays a rare heroic role as her father figure and mentor who sometimes gets on the action himself. Supporting work is provided by a solid cast that includes Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Edward Norton, and Jackie Earle Haley in a scene stealing role as a monstrous deranged robot. Unfortunately, there's a love interest thrown into the movie for Alita and the actor playing him is badly miscast.The visual effects are astonishing. The motion capture on Salazar's character Alita is one of the best realized CGI models ever. The details and subtle changes in her expression and movement is top notch. The other robotic characters are remarkable in their design but still have a sense of weight and mass.The storytelling combines elements from different genres from cyberpunk to detective fiction to teen romance to even sports tropes. This results in an undeniably strange, silly, dark, and weird plot that has the time to address class division and the transhuman experience when it's not engaging in robot duels and deadly blood sports.Robert Rodriguez's direction and the surprisingly tight plotting does get a lot done under two hours. But the last ten minutes do try to wrap everything up too quickly and some characters get undeservedly short-changed. Still, that Rodriguez and Cameron succeeded at translating so much of a manga to live action this well at all is commendable.",Alita - Battle Angel

460,michaeljpfitzgerald,Hubris hurt this film.,3,2 February 2020,"You wonder if Rodriguez and Cameron have *anyone* in their lives they care enough about to hear when they've made a mistake.Robert and James: 'I know, we'll use millions and millions of dollars, and the cutting edge of human special effect technology, to give our heroin big dumb googly eyes, for some reason!'
Everyone, impossibly: 'This is good, definitely don't just use the face of your charming lead. It will be good to force every actor to interact with an empty set, or motion capture prosthetic.'This reminds me mostly of an extremely high budget, somewhat confused Power Rangers film - not knowing the source material, it's hard for me to imagine the manga being as popular as it was with roller ball being the primary vehicle for advancing the over all plot - such as it was. As such, the awkward teen romance-from-nowhere feels correct, even if it has no roots - which I lay at the feet of everyone basically having to perform solo. If they'd just let the kid...act, it might have felt like these characters were in the same space, talking to eachother, and it sort of didn't.As such, all the relationships just felt...weird, and off, and convenient.Rosa Salazar works her butt off in that sound booth, though, and her intensity is one of the really lovely things about this engaging, but messy movie. She does a wonderful job, and I look forward to seeing her in other things. Skrein is the only other person who really feels like they are up to much - everyone else is lost in the jumbled story, and the green screen monologues.

461,TMAuthor,Excellent World Creation and Special Effects,7,23 October 2021,"If you're a science fiction fan or fantasy, you should definitely give this a watch. The visuals are excellent.The acting is generally good, particularly by the leads, Rosa Salazar and Christopher Waitz. Mahershala Ali and Jenifer Connelly perform in roles that are either underwritten or cut down during editing, so kind of wasted. The villains are all pretty entertaining, but the youthful friends that Alita meets along the way are one dimensional and the story suffers as a result.The biggest downer, and why I only rated this a 7 is the ending. It feels like the story is just getting underway, a teaser intro to the ""big bad"" and Alita coming into her own and then...roll credits.Definitely was set up for a sequel, but the weak box office likely doomed this to a very good first film in a failed franchise attempt. Too bad because it's filled with promise and Rodriguez is a very good director.",Alita - Battle Angel
462,yeolit,"Great movie, plot and execution",9,2 March 2019,"Visually stunning, with great acting and sound effects.Alita: Battle Angel belongs to the cyborg category, where most people seem to have some robotic attachment to their bodies, if not all. Which means that it looks visually unique compared to most other films out there. But more importantly, the plot never truly lets up, and is very consistent and smooth.There are a bit of plotline which are not fully explained, especially towards the ending, which suggests that there could be a sequel, but yes I agree that if they were to put that segment in the movie would either be too long or too rushed.I love how Alita's flashbacks add a lot of context to who she is at appropriate moments, rather than serve like a filler or fill up a substantial portion of the movie, like some other shows.Possibly one of the best action movies with good storyline in recent years.",Alita - Battle Angel

468,Erlik_Han,Fantastic dystopian sci fi action movie,10,28 August 2019,"I dont understand why people are hating on the script. The romance part was a bit ""tween movie'esque"" but other than that it was a fun, action packed sci fi story. The acting was great, the sci fi dystopian atmosphere was absolutely fantastic, the action was very well done etc.There was one small jarring thing about the main character Alita, her eyes. I know this movie was based of some manga, but her eyes were gigantic which was a bit strange because every other character had regular human sized eyes. Also# most faces weren't CGI. Although the animation / CGI was absolutely fantastic, and there was very little ""uncanny valley"" effect, it was still there because of the difference between her cgi face and the other character's real faces in combination with her large eyes. I think if those were a bit smaller (they could have still made them bigger than normal) it might have been a bit better.
I kinda wish the movie was 3 hours long, they would have had an extra hour to develop Alita's character, the world and even the romance stuff (the romance felt a bit rushed and tween'ish)I am excited to see a sequel or even a prequel. Overall I'd give the movie a 9/10. But I gave it 10 stars because it deserves a higher score than it currently has.",Alita - Battle Angel
469,jditch,"Here's why Alita is a good film - But if you didn't like Avatar, then it's not for you.",8,5 February 2019,"Screenplay Co written and adapted by Avatar creator, James Cameron and Sin City creator Robert Rodriguez. Alita is a deep film that covers a wide range of themes such as female empowerment, personal growth, sacrifice and loss.The world is wonderfully imagined. Its also incredibly beautiful. In 3D, Alita looks amazing, she's vibrant and full of life, her skin looks so natural. Some people are moaning about the eyes. But those people are missing the point that Alita isn't human. Battle Angel borrows from other sci-fi stories in places. But this is a 20 year old graphic novel series. You can't expect total originality here. But like it's cousin, Avatar, Alita manages to carve out an interesting new world for itself, which in some ways is similar to its protagonist.The film had drawn some criticism for Alita's portrayal, as overly sexualized. I would argue those critics have entirely missed points made in the film. Or perhaps they haven't even seen it yet. Without giving anything away: calling Alita out for having an unrealistically small waist and big eyes is like moaning that the terminator sets an unfair standard for men. They're not human!Whilst I really enjoyed Alita, it could have, should have, been two films. There's so much going on that at times, some scenes can seem insignificant on reflection. In the grand scope of the story some moving moments are lost. Some feel a little rushed.So overall, a good film. Personally I loved it. Visually it's stunning. If you love sci-fi, if you liked Avatar or if you're a film lover, go see it! But watch it in IMAX 3D or at least 3D. Most films aren't worth it. But like Avatar: This isn't just 3D, this is James Cameron 3D. It's made for 3D.",Alita - Battle Angel

Minor spoilers...unfortunately, it's sometimes great fun, really enjoyable, but also, it has some major flaws that i can't forgive. i mean the action is fast paced, enjoyable to watch, but there are holes in the story and stuff i would like to have adressed (transhumanism, not a word about it, they turn a human into a robot/cyborg/whatever without even asking him first for example), and then the ending! what a rip-off! i feel like they hope for Alita 2 or something, because it just stops. like in a bad videogame where suddenly the credits roll and it's over, and you are like ""what?"".. i guess there would be so much more to discover and talk about, but this film falls very short in this regard. it's forgettable pop-corn action for the masses.",Alita - Battle Angel

A lot of things make no sense at all. To add insult to injury the end is a huge cliff-hanger.If you are a sucker for CGI, you'll be amazed.

(Guy with the robo-dogs??)
The story fails because it is pulled in so many different directions, just when I think I know what I'm watching, the movie shifts gears dramatically.
Is this an action film? A sci-fi epic? An angst-less teen love story? Or a sport movie? And what was the bloody point of her playing 'roller-derby sportball' anyways??

The cinematography is filled with a beautiful world view and I can tell both Robert Rodriguez and James Cameron did their best to show a Japanese adaptation( it's a Manga for those who didn't know).

It is absolute nonsense, what story there is, is generic nonsense.

481,sagniknath,Screenplay could have used more revisions but the action scenes and Alita herself make for an entertaining joyride,8,18 February 2019,"Let's get to the point real quick: This is not what I would call a milestone in anime adaptation or even an amazing movie. The main drawback is the rather flimsy plot structure where basically a certain sequence of important events would happen being initiated almost by chance. Basically, to execute a plot point, they would establish a very convenient scenario and then later on, almost randomly they would bring that plot point back to coerce an action scene. It was very lazy writing.NOW, with all that being said, this movie certainly doesn't deserve a ridiculously low rating of 60% on RT by critics. I mean seriously, I am beginning to wonder whether they saw the theatrical cut I saw or maybe an entirely different film altogether. For one thing, the fast pacing and highly energized action scenes more than compensated for the screenplay's flaws. And it's not a disorienting mish mash of bloated CGI, which I observed in Ready Player One.. I could actually follow what was happening on screen. It was evident that the utmost care and devotion was given by the filmmakers to the action scenes. Even when some of the CGI felt a bit crude, the pacing ensured that it appeared as a minor artifact. And finally, I really really loved Alita . Both the actress Rosa and the VFX/motion capture team did an amazing job in bringing her to life. She genuinely felt like a person I wish I knew in real life and could bond with. Rosa herself exuded a warm tender personality that really helped elevate Alita's charm and appeal. In the end, I really for once hope this film makes enough money to get a sequel. I would rather have this than another Star Wars spinoff or Avatar sequel (groans)",Alita - Battle Angel

They've taken a serious and dark anime and turned it into a love story for kids. A 170 million dollar CGI movie with absolutely no soul whatsoever.Great cyberpunk has always had a deeper layer. It's not always intellectual, but at least it tries to be. Alita is a popcorn movie for people who can't walk and chew bubblegum at the same time.There are so many scenes where they expect, us the audience, to say: COOL.Instead we're just sit here waiting for the story to begin. Most of the time I found myself saying: Meh.Just look at the city and compare it to something like the original Blade Runner or even the Battle Angel anime. The sets feel claustrophobic, menacing, and crushing. The atmosphere is never ending.The sets in Alita feels like an open world RPG. It's sunshine and yellow/brown colors all around. The night scenes looks like something out of a pinball arcade, and the technology looks straight out of spy kids.
This movie deserves a sin for making me remember Sylvester Stallone in spy kids. I thought I had scrubbed that memory out of my skull, but this horrible piece of junk managed to drag it all up to the surface again.Why couldn't they just have left this alone? Why did they bring it back from the scrapyard over and over again? Please stop kicking the poor memory of the amazing Gunnm, it's already dead. This is just heart-ripping bad and painful to watch.Go back and watch something like the original Ghost in the shell anime. That is how you do cyberpunk. You build a world not only with architecture, plot and technology.

It is however quite too joyous for its setting with overstated teenage elements, a somewhat predictable and unfocused storyline and a far too bright palette for a cyber-punk representation of a technological dystopia. The elements of a coming of age rising heroin story are all there, from the surrogate father figure, to the romantic first love, and the ladder of increasingly powerful and menacing antagonists. Nothing innovative or provocative, yet sufficiently entertaining. The world-building alone helps saving what would otherwise be a pretty average experience.

496,gelmcchristop,An original atmosphere - with perfect execution,10,19 March 2021,"First of all, the film captures an entirely new perspective of a futuristic society. Instead of the gloomy darkness of an industrialized world we've been watching for decades, it actually gives us a better look beneath the grim surface of things, particularly how human emotions continue to evolve even under such circumstances, beautifully represented by the warm atmosphere of the daytime, while the shifts to the night sequences serve their purpose perfectly in presenting evil and conflict, pointing towards great directing and cinematography.
The visual effects, probably the best asset of the movie, are simply out of this world. The blending of the (many) CGI assets works its way smoothly towards developing immersion to the universe of the plot, while the interaction between real and fake has probably the best one i've personally watched in a feature film (i still remember the days when i thought it impossible to wipe a tear off a cg character's face without vaporizing any emotional value).
The plot, acting and especially choreography were remarkable, while action sequences, combined with the uncertainty of the outcome carefully developed by the script, actually gives the viewer a sense of uneasiness. Not that i claim myself to have been a manga specialist, but what i watched has definitely evoked my interest in the genre.",Alita - Battle Angel

I saw Alita in 3D and thought the visuals looked great with the battle scenes not becoming too blurry and a 3D mess.I think the great material at hand here likely stops the film from becoming too generic and cliché as it will surprise you!

Previously I had not liked this type of merging because of the unreal feel of the symbiosis and even cartoon-ness of the look. This film is so well done that I was not initally sure that it wasnt actually Rosa Salasar herself physically playing the role and only those gorgeous eyes completely gave it away. After that I just really really enjoyed the whole spectacle. Cast was excellent and nice to see Mr Waltz playing a rare nice guy for him. Ed Skrein supported well as did Jackie Earl Haley although he was a little less himself than normal, Watchmen was his finest hour so far. Didn't give it a ten because the plot was not quite up to the visuals and the ending sucked (not because of deaths but because it didnt finish) Unfortunately I don't think we'll get a proper ending in a sequel because of the money disparity between cost and gross which is a massive shame because this an outstandingly well done movie. Personally I cannot understand why it isnt a massive hit because its definitely way better than some of Marvel and Dc offerings and had it had their name up front it would have wowed the Cinematic world.

501,sadako11,Highly entertaining but with one big flaw...,7,11 February 2019,"I must say that I enjoyed the movie.They combined the OVAs, the first two Gunnm volumes:
Vol.1- Idos's, Alita's and the hunter-warrior introduction,
Vol.2- Hugo's story
and a bit of the third (Motorball).I thought that the big-eye issue will bother me but after a couple of minutes I got used to them and frankly she looked cute with them.The main issues I found is that the movie feels overstuffed, but my biggest complain with the movie is Hugo and his portrait.Hugo is not supposed to be the coolest kid on the block wearing leather jackets and a six pack.The original Hugo doesn't have time to go to the gym or to play motorball games with his friends or look handsome.
The original Hugo is a shady hard working crummy kid that lives in a disgusting apartment in the slums. The original Hugo is a more interesting character for Alita to fall in love.Their romance in the movie felt forced and quite sappy.
Hugo replaced Ido in some scenes with Alita that in the manga and OVA were supposed to be Ido's and that kinda bothered me a bit.But if you overlook the issues you will be highly entertained. Rosa Salazar is great as Alita and like everybody keep saying the fx the action sequences and the world are very very good. You can see that the producers and director put a lot of heart into the film.",Alita - Battle Angel
502,pinemaples,"Finally, an anime adaptation done right.",9,17 February 2019,"Western-produced anime movies don't have the best track record. They have largely been hit-or-miss, ranging from decent attempts like Speed Racer, to controversial fare like Ghost in the Shell (which I actually really enjoyed), all the way down to dumpster fires like the infamous Dragon Ball: Evolution. I had mostly settled with the idea that the best we'd get was the overlooked and under-appreciated Tom Cruise vehicle Edge of Tomorrow, loosely based on the manga All You Need Is Kill. Now, a new precedent has been set.
Alita: Battle Angel is a sci-fi cyberpunk story based on the manga series Gunnm (not a typo), also known as Battle Angel Alita, written by Yukito Kishiro. I can't speak for the source material, as I hadn't even heard of it before a few months ago, but this movie is an absolute gem. Director Robert Rodriguez is largely known for grindhouse flicks like From Dusk Till Dawn and Machete, but his past efforts have certainly given him practice in delivering quality action sequences, regardless of a film's budget. However, money clearly wasn't much of an issue in this case, and it shows; producer James Cameron (who also shares scriptwriting credit) has obviously taken what he learned from Avatar to craft some of the finest CGI sets and characters we've seen since we first laid eyes on the world of Pandora. As far as visual imagery goes, the only - ONLY - thing that could constitute as something resembling a flaw is the face of the title character herself, Alita. I feel like the phrase ""uncanny valley"" is a little trite, but I was frankly baffled that they had decided to borrow the big eyes that anime is known for, as it makes our lead look more than slightly alien. Then again, maybe that's just part of the fun and the point of her character in the first place. Regardless, it honestly ceased to bother me a mere few minutes into the movie, and I even started to get kinda attached to the look.
A very large part of that selling factor is due to the headlining performance of Rosa Salazar. Despite being hampered by a few early lines that couldn't escape their inherent narm, Alita's charming innocence more than measured up to her clear prowess as a destructive force of nature... in the best way possible, of course. The title of the movie says it all.
On the other hand, most of the supporting cast was only adequate, with the notable exceptions of Ed Skrein (who could expertly mix ""smarmy"" with ""intimidating"" in his sleep), Jackie Earle Haley (he was born to play the bad guys), and one other actor in particular: I don't think Christoph Waltz knows how to phone it in. He's like Morgan Freeman - no matter how good or bad the movie is, he's always a highlight. It was fun to see Mahershalalhashbaz Ali play a villain, but he just wasn't given enough to do, and Jennifer Connelly was even more underutilized. Keean Johnson's role as the love interest/occasional sidekick Hugo wasn't bad (certainly not like Kit Harington trying to play Vincent in Silent Hill: Revelation), he just came off a little dry.
Complaints aside, the acting is certainly serviceable, and while it tells a great story, it also functions to link together each new high-speed spectacle. Robert Rodriguez and James Cameron's powers combine to form some of the most consistently impressive and individually unique fight scenes that I'm not sure I was aware were even possible in a technically-live-action movie. These sequences somehow feel like large-scale setpieces while still meeting the audience on the personal level we need to connect with Alita and cheer her on. The meaty 2-hour runtime ensures that not only do the mechanical melees get the love they deserve, we also quickly grow to love the battle angel and the beautiful war-torn future world she inhabits.
While Netflix puts together their Cowboy Bebop adaptation and the live-action Akira production floats around in limbo, I hope that studios look to this for guidance on how to finally do it right. Whether you're an anime fan, you enjoy the rare good cyberpunk movie, or you just like good action, you owe it to yourself to watch Alita: Battle Angel.",Alita - Battle Angel
503,abhijith-alpha,"Brilliant visuals, good world building marred by sloppy narrative, pacing issues and an inability to focus on which part of the heroine's journey is to be focused on.",6,10 February 2019,"The dialogue is hammy at best, but it does show the difference between the best and the rest. Christoph Waltz and Jennifer Connelly eke out every sincere bit of emotion possible from the screenplay, while Keean Johnson and Ed Skrein come off as bland. Waltz as the Anglicized version of Dr. Ido from the Japanese manga comes across exactly as you expect a mentor/father/conscience comes across, treating people-machines, repairing cyborg components and a bunch of other compassionate stuff for free. Rosa Salazar, who I loved as Brenda in the Maze Runner series, has the most of the screen time, and carries it as well as we can expect. I had difficulty judging her acting performance since she has been completely modified into the sleekly fleshy yet wondrously animated cyborg Alita. Jennifer Connelly (where has she been all this time?), given the little screen time she has, makes a mark as the ambitious Dr. Shiren. Yet another wasted actor is Mahershala Ali, swaggering through the screen whenever he is on it, showing glimpses of the complex character that Vector, uncrowned King of Iron City and all around douchebag, is. Keean Johnson plays the pretty boy love interest, who is given an interesting character arc but is not given enough time to flesh it out. Ed Skrein is who you go to if you spent all your money on visual effects and don't have much left to hire Jai Courtney. But given the role of a Hunter-Warrior and a dispensation to not stretch his limited acting skills, he does the job. I do wish he wasn't given so much of screen time to do just two things by the end of the movie.The narrative is the problematic issue. The world building is great. This is where you observe James Cameron's influence. The Fall, the great battle between the Martians and the Earth is alluded to, and the flashbacks, while pretty short, are intriguing. Iron City is definitely and interesting place. Reminded me of the small travelling cities in the recently released Mortal Instruments. Zalem, the last floating city, floats imposingly and menacingly above Iron City, taking their resources. In return for what I can only guess. Zalem is for the privileged city, Iron City is for the rest. The most important form of entertainment in the city is Motorball, a fascinating combination of rollerblading and American Football. The official Motorball competition is run by Vector and the Final Champion gets to go to Zalem.When the movie opens, Dr. Ido finds Alita in the scrap yard and rebuilds her back. She forms a father-daughter connection with him, starts to interact with other characters in the city and even finds a boyfriend, Hugo. The movie can't decide if it wants to concentrate on the mysteries of Iron City; a shady place which is being manipulated by higher-ups in Zalem; has turf wars between the Hunter-Warriors and the policing machines; the human-cyborg competitors in the Motorball, the underground business of scrap market and components; or if it wants to concentrate on Alita's journey. After seemingly deciding to concentrate on Alita going by the screen time allotted to her, there's still confusion regarding how much of her story will be incorporated in this movie. The source material, I'm told, is rich enough to have a five-part movie series. Yet, it felt like this movie rushed the story and used up what would've taken two movies at least into one. What happens is that it looses narrative focus. Important information is thrown around without the importance that it requires, and characters make decisions that takes away the enormity of these moments. I found myself investing in these characters but not their decision-making. It's a problem with the editing and the screenplay on the whole. Robert Rodriguez is a good director, but he certainly has his issues with controlling the end product, which we can see in his other movies.Lets hope the sequel does it better.Directing: 6

Based on the marketing strategy at the time of release, you'd think this was the anti-Captain Marvel, and at the highest level the plot was a little better and more coherent. A little. But these two movies are nothing alike.Alita came off as a YA novel adaptation vs. comic book/manga. And if you're unfamiliar with the story, you probably won't be too engaged in this CGI-fest. I wasn't.It reminded me of Speed Racer in both the look and the issue of source material. If you grew up watching the SR cartoon, SR was a fun, live-action movie. I thought it captured the anime style very well and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, I dont have that at foundation for Alita and the film does not hold up well without it. I got very bored at times and the action was all CGI so no better than a lot of video games.The yes didn't bug me, but Waltz's hat did for some reason.",Alita - Battle Angel

515,Tastentier,A manga come to life indeed,4,17 April 2019,"If someone had told me back in 1984 that James Cameron would one day produce another Terminator movie in which the killer android sports the unnecessarily sexualized frame of an adolescent girl with creepily big manga eyes and is controlled by the brain of a female teenager, I would have slowly backed off, excused myself with the words ""my, would you look at the time"", and avoided further social contact with this person from there on in. But apparently, this kind of thing is perfectly acceptable when Japan's comic book industry does it first. Not only that, we must pretend that it is a work of art on par with Blade Runner instead of trashy, lurid pulp.The good news is that Cameron, Rodriguez et al have succeeded in adapting a manga to the big screen. This movie is the sum of everything I love and hate about the manga and anime genres: Whimsical playfulness, beautiful backdrops, and sometimes amazing worldbuilding on the one hand, and stupefyingly simplistic characters and plot lines on the other. The lead character is devoid of personality aside from her childlike wonder that is jarringly contrasted with her outbreaks of ultraviolence. The villains are even more paper-thin, utterly stereotypical and evil for the sake of it. A brute, a mad scientist, and of course the queer-coded dandy who is very concerned with his looks (which leaves a bad taste of the homophobia that is so sadly common in the Japanese entertainment media).Alita did manage to draw me in a few times, but immediately lost me again with its video game CGI, mindless dialogue, and overlong, excessively violent combat scenes. Far too many times, there is not a single human actor in sight for ten minutes at a time, which makes this supposed live action film feel like a console game cutscene. It worked in Avatar thanks to the incredible realism of the CGI, but I'm afraid that this one won't age nearly as well.
Tl;dr: Style over substance, and even the style is of questionable taste. Has its moments, but insults the viewer's intelligence. Add an unresolved plot that sets the stage for an even worse sequel, and you end up with a movie best watched at home on the TV screen (if at all).",Alita - Battle Angel

526,metztex,Nicely done film with strong story,9,19 February 2019,"Minor Spoilers, no major plot sequences discussed.First of all, don't listen to the ""critics"" when it comes to this film. They tend to have issues getting the point with films like this. That is all I will say about that.Now, if you liked Avatar, Ready Player One or similar films, you will like this one. The main difference with this film is its' origin story. While I don't know much about the original Anime series (perhaps maybe I should delve into it some), my current impression is this film appears to follow the original plots fairly well as this film had at TON of Japanese Anime themes.In a nut shell...this film places a young girl's/woman's mind (I would estimate the age between 17-22) in a cyborgs body with extensive military combat training and a strong instinctual sense of right and wrong. Consider this back drop against the normal yearnings/desires of any normal 17-22 year old woman. That will give you an idea of the tumultuous conflict dwelling within her. Place all that beside three major influences. First, the individual that gave her a second chance at life and attempts to protect and nurture her as he would his own daughter (in fact, he views her as his daughter reborn in many ways). Second, the villain, which overtime, Alita discovers is the one enemy she seems to have been specifically built to counter. Third, and probably the most powerful, is the love interest, a young man starting down the road of criminality and actions that are definitely morally and ethically wrong when he meets Alita. He soon discovers that Alita, is ""more human than any human he has ever met"". This discovery to him, appears to awaken something in him that is powerful enough to turn away from his current track at tremendous cost to himself to be with and/or follow Alita's chosen path. His action, may arguably be what galvanizes Atlia to her chosen path without looking back.Bottom line, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It is the best film I have seen since Rogue One without the glaring character flaws that trouble a few of Rogue One's characters. In this film, each character stays true to their character throughout the film.",Alita - Battle Angel
527,Habibi-Universe,Great Visuals And Wasted Potential,6,5 March 2019,"I just came out of the cinema having watched 'Alita: Battle Angel' and I am a little bit conflicted about this movie. Going into the motion picture I did not expect a fantastic movie due to mixed reviews by critics who praised the action and the great, stunning visual effects while also being let down by poor dialogue, bad romance and an underwhelming ending.
First and foremost, the protagonist is the female cyborg Alita (played by Rosa Salazar) who is created by Dr. Dyson Ido (played by two-time ""Academy Award Winner"" Christoph Waltz) in the year 2563.
Let's talk about the things I liked in 'Alita: Battle Angel'. The strongest aspect about this movie are by far the breathtaking, beautiful visual effects. The CGI looks fantastic and is heavily used in the worldbuilding and the fast-paced impressive action sequences. The choreography of the fights was pure eye-candy for me. Another strong point is the character Alita who is beautifully portrayed by Rosa Salazar. She does a great job at making the character feel human and at the same time, making her distinguished and unique. Her human sides come across when she feels happiness and love, but also grief and vengeance. These character traits help the audience connect and identify with her and care about her. On the other hand she also has inhuman characteristics, such as a robotic body and astonishingly powerful fighting skills. I also really like the design of the very likeable and adorable Alita.
Two-time ""Academy Award Winner"" Christoph Waltz plays the very interesting and mysterious Dr. Dyson Ido who has a bigger impact on the story than I initially thought due to his own small side story that focuses on his motivation for creating Alita and why he cares about her so deeply.Let's now talk about my problems with the movie. Starting with the concept of having cyborgs in this world is a really interesting idea that is also executed well enough in the movie. In this futuristic world there are a ton of ""genetically modified"" people however this brings up an issue in the character-driven storytelling. The heroine Alita is supposed to feel very special and unique due to her scientifically engineered body and her overly large eyes. However she doesn't seem to be all that after all, e.g. she isn't the only modified individual walking down the street. Furthermore the movie misses out on a big emotional gut punch unfortunately; when a character is cut in half, he is still able to survive if he gets the same medical treatment and modification as Alita did.
In addition I have two main gripes with the villains:
1) There are too many villains/antagonists that the movie focuses on. Unfortunately there is not enough focus on each villain because the movie jumps right onto the next one. They feel very convoluted.
2) These are only one-dimensional villains who are not very well fleshed out.
The only positive thing that I can take away from the ""villain issue"" is two-time ""Academy Award Winner"" Mahershala Ali's performance as the villain Vector.Sadly, the emotional scenes fell flat for me. Personally, I don't think Hugo (played by Keean Johnson) was as bad as people say. In my opinion he was OK, however I would have preferred not to have a love interest which seems to be very cliché-ridden in these types of epic adventure stories.
Finally, I have to talk about the abysmal ending (without spoiling anything). It is so unfortunate that they decided not to go for a simple ending. Instead of having a nice conclusion of the story they went for an unsatisfying one with a total lack of innovation and creativity. It is such a shame that the ending sort of ruins the creativity of the movie. I cannot believe that they thought this ending was a good choice. When the credits started to roll, I sat in the movie theater with an open mouth in complete shock. I have probably never seen a more obvious set-up for a sequel than this one.Overall, I mostly enjoyed the movie (except for the ending) and I think it was solid. I am not sure whether the studio is going to green-light a sequel to 'Alita: Battle Angel' or not because the movie is currently underperforming at the box office and is really struggling to reach the break-even point. Personally, I would really like to see a sequel happening because I can see this turning into a successful and beloved franchise. Despite the flaws, I would still recommend this motion picture to you as this is very different to others and that is why it feels so unique. 6/10",Alita - Battle Angel

I went to see Alita on opening day at the Regal 4DX experience in Times Square. This is the top way to view the movie with moving seats, water sprays, fans, smells pumped in and 3D glasses.Opening scene: random guy searching through what looks to be the world from Wall-E. Scrap metal and robot parts everywhere. What he's looking for and why he's looking for it, we'll never know. It's not discussed in this film. Random guy finds a robot torso with lifelike face still attached. He takes it home.Frankenstein scene: for undisclosed reasons many humans are missing an arm so they have a bionic arm, including the nurse who assists the doctor in building Alita. Why he's building her, we'll never know.Cut to scene showing kids playing motor ball at a skate park. Boy notices Alita has robot arms and instantly recognizes her arms as being the work of Dr. Ido. Why? How does he know this? We have no idea and will never learn. Boy invites Alita to play.Random ""meat"" boy pushes Alita and she falls on the curb during the game in what would have instantly cracked a human skull. Immediately Alita becomes amazing and scores for her team, despite never playing or seeing game played and no rules being mentioned. Alita now likes boy who invited her to play.Dr. Ido is a robot bounty Hunter in his spare time. He gets a bounty for cyborg heads. For some reason, robots kill humans. Also, for unknown reasons the boy Alita likes cuts the mechanical arms and legs off of cyborgs for some reason when there is a literal junkyard of spare parts everywhere.Boy Alita likes gets money for cutting off robot parts and he is saving up to go to the old floating city. Why? Who knows. We never find out why it's so important to go back up to this city.Dr. Ido had a crippled daughter who was killed by a cyborg looking for pain pills. Dr. Ido's wife left him. She also wears a bindi for undisclosed reasons. Nobody else but the chief bad guy wears a bindi.Alita and boy's friends find a spaceship in the jungle that works with Alita's brain. She used to be a space warrior.Dr. Ido's ex wife is bad but helps Alita save her boyfriend by attaching his head to her mechanical heart until he can be attached to a cyborg body.Story is incredibly disjointed by having incomplete storylines about a floating city, a previous battle called the fall, a game called motor ball, why humans are killed by robots, why robots are jacked for parts, why there are bounty hunters, why Alita randomly falls in love and appears in the window of her live interest and tries to give him her heart so that he can sell it to afford to go to the floating city. How did she know where he lived? Who knows. Why does he want to go? Who knows. Why did she fall in love with him? Who knows. What is his back story? Who knows.If you're looking for a gripping story or just the semblance of a storyline, this isn't it.",Alita - Battle Angel
531,Grismar,A good movie that could become great if it is followed by a worthy sequel,8,21 February 2019,"It's telling that I wanted to see the sequel the second the movie ended. In part it's because the movie really misses a final act to give you the satisfaction it is building towards, but primarily it is because the movie has built a world and characters worth caring about and that makes you wonder.I can see this story going places and the movie worth every dollar the tickets costs you to see it in the cinema. The visuals are ground-breaking, the acting on point and the beats of the story keep the movie moving forward.It could have done with a bit more layering, a bit more meat to hint at the history or philosophy of the people that went before, considering that this movie is set 500 years in the future. And the story is very straightforward. In a way I feel that this makes this movie an excellent movie for all ages, but the violence is probably a bit too much for that in places, even though the truly graphic is avoided through clever shooting and the fact that we're watching cyborgs most of the time.It's an 8 out of 10 because to be more, it would have to be a good movie all by itself. As it stands, I sincerely hope the 'foreign' (i.e. non-US) market likes it better, because I'd love to see the same team take the story forward and make an even better sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel
532,ravs05,Alita: Battle Angel and 4DX Rreview,9,8 February 2019,"Ok, you have watched the many trailers, read reviews of all the critics, checked the ratings and still deciding whether to spend your money and time on this film ... well let me see if I can help you make that decision. I am an avid movie lover and will watch anything which is rated 5 and above on IMDB, not necessarily all of them on the big screen (thanks to Netflix and Amazon Prime), but movies is my deep rooted passion.Going to big screen cinemas has become less and less off-late, thanks again to the many streaming sites and those giant 65 inch OLed televisions .. why do something by going out, braving the weather, queues, parking charges and annoying fellow viewers when you can do it at the comfort of your own home right .. well not all films but sometimes, big projects like this make sense to view in the gigantic screens with sound and smell effects (more on this later) and immerse yourself into this magic. I tend to do this for all the big ones, the last one was Infinity War and then next one might be Capt. Marvel.So, I booked myself a ticket on the second day of film's release and it wasn't a normal ticket. It was one for the 4DX screening in the UK. I have never tried 4DX for a full length film before, so thought why not and what better film to try this on than Alita: Battle AngelLets talk about the movie first. This was a script which the great filmmaker James Cameron was trying to develop for the good part of a decade but seems like he fell in love with Avatar soo much that he doesn't want to make any other movie apart from sequels and prequels and spin-offs to the Avatar world. Hmm, that's really sad as you don't want one the very few sure-shot directors to get stuck on just one film right? Anyways, more Avatars is what we are gonna get. So he passes on the script to the able hands of Robert Rodriguez. Strange choice, I mean, I simply love the Sin City films but no others from his list tick the boxes for me (esp. Machete films!!). And then a mammoth budget of 200 million allocated, this was going to be something to watch out for.Then comes the first trailer and we see those huge eyes. It looked wrong to see it come to life, I mean on the pages of maga comics, they look fine but realistic gigantic eyes look weird and alienish. Then slowly, we got trailer after trailer and action sequence after action sequence. Things started to look cool and those eyes, they didn't bother that much. So, I was all set to watch this exciting spectacle on the big screen and to be honest, I really enjoyed it. (apart from the 4DX).What we see is a world as beautiful as Avatar's Pandora, even though it is rusty and dusty at places, the detail is simply amazing. Reminded me a lot of Ready Player One. The story sets off right away and Alita comes to life, thanks her mentor, father-figure, Doctor Ido. Right from the get go, you cannot help but fall in love with Alita. She is adorable, naive and represents everything good in a very bad and crumbling world. They way she looks and learns about things is simply adorable. I was counting the moments until she gets into gear and my god, when she does switch on, she really kicks some serious ass. The action sequences are really the second best thing after Alita's characterisation. There is a bit of exposition, like others mentioned, but I did not mind it too much and it never broke the pace of the movie. I genuinely wanted to learn about this world and rules. The love story felt decent as well and was very much needed for that emotional connection with the characters. Through the course we learn Alita's roots and her true purpose along with some interesting characters which culminates in setting up the base for sequels.Lets list the positives, Alita's characterisation, those amazing action sequences and the near perfect CGI. All this really provide what us film-lovers are looking for. And at end, it really does satisfy our senses.Lets dwell into the negatives now, the story feels bit inconsistent at times. Feels like it could have done with a better screenplay. Then there is that Deja-Vu feeling that you have seen it before. I mean, the manga comic which the film was based on was first published in 1990. It truly was path-breaking at that time and inspired several film-makers to already adopt its concepts, like Matrix movies, Astro Boy, Ghost in the Shell, Ready Player One and even Neill Blomkamp's Elysium. Had they made this movie in the 90s, it would have been the first but now, it comes too late to the party and makes you feel that you have watched similar moves and setup. And then finally the trailers!! Seriously, what is with it now-a-days??? Every action sequence has already been shown in the trailers. Oh, not just the trailers, but they released extended scenes of these action sequences just before the film's launch. This is really so stupid. Why show the film completely and expect audience to still go to cinemas and watch it?? The worst case recently was The Tomb Raider film. There was not a thing left which was not already shown in the trailers. I know it is getting harder to bring audience to the cinemas but still, you don't have to show everything. Thankfully, watching the action sequences as whole in Alita were much more satisfying that the cuts shown in trailers.Lets review 4DX now. It sounded cool when cinema halls were trying to provide audience with that extra bits to improve the experience and make them go to cinemas more often. Some made the halls bigger, some added reclining comfy seats as standard and Cineworld (UK) added 4D experience to full length movies. Its the same 4D concept which you would have experienced if you have visited any theme park. Its that theatre where they run a short film for 20 minutes where the film is in 3D and the seats move and rubble along with bubbles, water and scent sprayed at you in context with the film. Felt cool right, for those 20 minutes. The same thing is going to be done to you for most of the 2 hour plus duration of the film! Seriously, this 4DX belongs in that theme park and should not have been brought into mainstream cinema. Even before watching I had my doubts. Initially, I was a bit excited, but after the first seat spin, rubble, smell, strobe lights and water spay, I felt that was enough! Every time an action sequence was about to start, I wished if I could turn these effects off as it was jarring and distracting. Really, that 20 minute animated short is perfect for these 4d effects. For mainstream cinema, this is really, really distracting.So finally, Alita is amazing film with few narrative and timing issues but you will still have a great time, lost in the extravagant visuals, amazing action scenes and those big blue manga eyes!",Alita - Battle Angel
533,joshuarob-33141,FAKE REVIEWS,1,20 October 2019,"This movie is CGI nonsense, to see 10 out 10 ratings and reviews stating ""best movie ever made"" is a flat out lie. We live in a world where the shining, shawshank redemption, schindlers list, and saving private Ryan all exsist, which means by default alita battle Angel is NOT ""the greatest movie ever made""Stop fake reviews.",Alita - Battle Angel
534,CitizenKaneAAAAA,i've been waiting for years!,6,5 February 2019,"I've been waiting for this film since forever! i remember that James Cameron was going to helm the directing part and even planned some sequels, but after years of development it goes to Robert Rodriguez, but James is still the producer and writer. and the result is: kind of disappointing, not too much, but it because my hope has died ever since they announced James isn't going to be the director.starting from the writing, i refuse to believe that this is Cameron's final draft or maybe there are major changes (and maybe major cut down) by Rodriguez and the executive producers (they are not Cameron and Landau btw). i'm pretty sure that Cameron knows this material is not a 2 hour worthy, it has more stuffs than Avatar and Titanic to be properly explained. the plotting and character development felt extraordinary fast, the dialogue felt so cheesy at some point (not too much) but heaven knows both Titanic and Avatar didn't have the sharpest dialogue either but at least they never out of place, with Alita it was a bit confusing and unnecessary.The visual is great but nowhere near Avatar, Titanic, or Terminator 2. I remember that people weren't so pleased with Alita's look when they released the first teaser, thinking that it's too weird, the eyes too big, but seeing the final product it's very satisfying. the visual effect is as great as any other WETA product. it might get a chance on best visual effect nominee on oscar next year.my biggest dissapointment is the writing and directing, Rodriguez could make some time to let the character developed, to explain some thing with extra care, to pace the film more rhythmically, and the exec could just not worry so much on runtime. The film lacked soul which is odd because Alita is a cyborg with a big heart.",Alita - Battle Angel
535,sagar-swapna,An extra 30 mins could have made the difference,8,19 July 2019,"Alita needed extra 30 mins to build the emotional connect with Hugo, Ido and the audience. Her introduction to the iron world and her adapting to it was too fast. Dialogues were cringy, character interactions were not well written not even a single line to remember. What steals the show is the presence of Alita she looks amazing the vfx team did an excellent job building her and other cyborg characters. The fight sequences were amazing. They could have had a proper ending rather than building it up for a sequel. They should have gone all out. Still a good movie I hope they have some good character moments in the sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel

537,zentist-563-976986,"Alita is one bad girl, but the romance was weak point",7,18 June 2019,"The movie was very enjoyable. Lots of action, convincing digital effects and a likeable heroine. However, the underlying story was unoriginal and the romantic sub-plot totally unbelievable and probably unnecessary - hence the 7 rating.
I don´t know if the romantic sub-plot was an integral part of the source anime but whenever the dumb boyfriend appeared my rating for the movie dropped from a 9 to a 4. If it was part of the original source then I think they should have reworked it so it fitted in better with the rest of the movie.

542,nirome,Action packed Sci-fi extravaganza with a heart,8,8 March 2019,"Adapting manga material or bringing Japanese comic book characters to the big screen has never been Hollywood's forte( Dragon Ball, Ghost in the Shell), to name just a few. But it seems that this time around they've come up with the right formula. Not only did they get the best possible producer behind it all, James Cameron, and the best creative team, but it seems that Robert Rodriguez has managed to resurrect a somewhat defunct directorial career by jumping on the success wagon for this one. If there is one thing that can be faulted in this whole production is the conscious attempts by both screenwriters and director to cram too many themes and story arcs in one movie. They would have been better served by dividing their writing material into separate movies. That being said, the arc of the main character, Alita, is followed through nicely and made engaging by the mo-cap performance by Rosa Salazar. The actress manages to convey all the emotions needed in this virtual character and provides her with a physicality, that is both brutal and graceful. All of this, of course, with the help of state-of-the-art CGI. Physical and virtual surroundings are nicely rendered and costume and production design help bring forth the illusion of being immersed in this futuristic landscape. Casting choices on this one are very good, especially Jackie Early Haley as the vicious and sadistic Grewishka and the always reliable Christoph Waltz as the soft spoken scientist and Alita's surrogate father and Keean Johnson as Hugo, Alita's love interest and a major player in one of the most heartbreaking moments towards the movie's final act. Beyond that, and having so many story strands to get around to, the rest of the cast, solid though they may be ( Jennifer Connely's Chiren, chief among them), sadly don't get to shine that much. What really stands out here is the fight and action sequences. The Motorball tournament sequence and above all, Alita's fight with Grewishka at the end of the second act are the stand out action set pieces of this movie and where the use of its 3D comes in handy the most. That is another feature that makes this movie quite unique. The intelligent use of its 3D (was natively shot in 3D), enhances the viewing experience. Given the chance, go watch it in IMAX 3D. I had to settle for Real3D. Go watch it regardless. It's a very engaging and solidly put together movie.",Alita - Battle Angel

This movie started out as 8 out of 10 stars, but after a while, it all got to be a bit too much - a little too long, a little too exhausting, and a little too high concept. But I'm glad I saw it.

545,eclarkdog,Entertaining but emotionally vacuous,6,2 February 2020,"First, let me say that I was not familiar with this manga going in. In fact, I'd say that although I've seen a few anime works in my life - now 50 - I would not say I'm particularly a fan. Secondly, younger folks may write-off the opinions of folks my age, but should keep in mind that people of my generation grew up on edgy sci-fi and animation....we are certainly not oblivious.Alita is an entertaining movie. It has a solid foundation and incredibly realized and original world. Alita herself, with that off putting eyes, is a nice protagonist, and I actually found myself getting used to the eyes - and actually her overall facial expressions really - to the point that I soon did not think about.Interestingly, I recall the trailer for this move what seemed a good two years before its release...I can't recall what movie I was seeing at the time...I think the first Star Wars of the latest trilogy...so 2017. The trailer stood out to me specifically due to her look...it was something new if not a bit off-putting and I think this is a reaction others had as well. That stuck with me, and as a movie buff overall, it did not fail to register with me that the movie just seemed not to get a release. A trailer of an apparent blockbuster shown around Christmastime usually means a summer release the next year. I don't know the story on ""Alita"", but that did not happen, of course. The fact it was released in a February slot some two years later seems to me to imply that the studio basically dumped the movie with low expectations.I did not see it at release but just yesterday on HBO. I was intrigued to watch it because of its dubious history of development/release, and yet what I saw as generally favorable reviews here.""Alita' is worth a watch. As said it is an interesting world and presents a lot of potential. But that is the big problem as well, as I think the creators relied heavily on that using the first, and probably likely the last, entry as more of a showcase without doing enough world and character building to satisfy the many folks new to the story. There are so many aspects of the story here that are not fully realized, and many questions raised that are not answered. That is probably fine for folks that are fans of the manga that can fill in those gaps on their own and just enjoy seeing their beloved manga being brought to life on screen. However, for folks like me it ultimately left me unsatisfied at the end though entertained for the most part during the course of the movie. I just assumed we would get some answers.The movie clearly ends with just about every question unanswered, with clear designs on future releases. We don't ever really get to know the main antagonist of this story at all. Even the motorball competition is never fully realized - there is no closure or completeness to that competition. But the real quicker here that I think hurt the movie the most is being able to connect on an emotional level with the characters. it hard to fully explain this idea without spoilers. But in part, I will mention a quote from the director I read here, something to the effect that ""alita's big eyes and her origin are explained in the movie"". I did not find that to be the case at all. We are just given glimpses of her past in flashback, but we are not really told exactly what that is all about. Who was she really in the past when she was apparently fully human. What was ""The Fall"" all about, and why was X fighting with Y?Still, ""Alita"" at a basic level is an entertaining dystopian action sci-fi flick. My guess is that, like me, you will ultimately be unsatisfied at its conclusion, especially if new to the story. However, as other reviewers have mentioned you can at least relax and enjoy the ride.",Alita - Battle Angel

Nah, the problem start in the second half. They focus on the romances and take the battle at the same time which is out of place and bizare. And it's just getting worse until the end.

548,agentk-77301,"Mixed feelings, but definitely not a waste of time.",7,6 January 2020,"I'll clarify by saying this - I read the manga first. The first section will be the comparison to the source material. Skip to the latter section for the review of the movie itself.While this movie is good and stands on its own two feet quite good, it lost the gruesomeness and edge the manga had.
First, Ido. One of my favorite characters in the manga. They over-humanized him, and as result, it chipped away from him as a character and simplified him.
In the manga he still was the kind doctor, but had more of a ""mr. hyde mr. jekyll"" complex. Yes, the money was good to keep the clinic going and cheap/free, but he had no daughter and the deeper reason he did all of it - was for fun. For his dark desires. He vented his stress, his inner demons, his sadism and itches towards bounty hunting. From an esteemed doctor up there in the sky, to a small clinic filled with psychos, degeneracy, stupidity and violence. Who wouldn't do the same? Who wouldn't grow inside of him such urges? Oh and he had no wife and the character ""chiren"" didn't exist. She serves nothing to the plot of the movie either.
Now, why did I rant on him? Because I felt the movie took the edge of everything. Zapan, Grenishka and even Hugo himself were wayyyyyy more up and intense, and more interesting too.""Hurr hurr so why give the movie a 7 if you dislike it altogether?"" Because I don't dislike it. Yeah, they took most of the edge of, but kept most of the ideas. Also the action was absolutely GLORIOUS and quite similar to the source material (the source material being more gooi and gory. A LOT more.).Now, for the movie on it's own -Action -
The action was, as I already said, glorious and spectacular. It felt kind of unnatural and quirky, but later it was choreographed perfectly. Intense, explosive, sometimes felt real. The bar fight was great.CGI -
Surprisingly good. Sometimes even an absolute eye-candy, especially in the action scenes. I expected Alita's face to be a lot worse since they basically declared her eyes are gonna be anime-ish but it was less than I thought it'd be. (in the source her eyes were normal tho. Her lips were big, not her eyes.)Plot -
Good. They didn't change too much and kept most of the major points. The themes fitted and the characters drove the story more than the story drove them.Characters -
I'm very mixed on this.
Chiren was unnecessary and her whole story arc didn't make that much sense.
The nurse was unnecessary and had no personality.
Vector was kinda boring too. Just a puppet. In the source material he was so much more interesting and active.
Alita was mostly like her source material, they nailed her character.
Ido.... Check my rant in the first section. But as what the movie offers - I feel his backstory was a bit too convenient, and that he later folded too easily to help her play motorball.
Hugo felt too much of a pretty boy and ""exposition with legs"".
Nova - I just hope that in the next movie he eats pudding.Overall, Alita and Zapan were pretty great (except for her cringey ""hero speech' which sucked ass). Ido, Vector and Hugo were mediocre. Chiren and Nurse could have been deleted without changing the plot.
And sadly, they removed a bunch of characters from the source material. And good ones at it.Music -
It's fine I guess. I didn't notice anything spectacular, but it was good and fitting. Nothing out of place and nothing to bum you out.",Alita - Battle Angel

It really is a beautiful film visually, so yes, I'm impressed.Problems with the film are that the story could have been more, idk, better. I do understand that when world building there are information dumps that have to happen. If the film makers had taken the time to do these dumps properly, it could have been a more satisfying film.

The only negative i have is that Alita is basically this fighting/battle machine and at times i didn't really like her fighting style. I found she spent a lot of time jumping around or dodging attacks. I wanted to see some had-to-hand or close combat. Basically wanted to see her kick some serious a**.

And she even says ""he's mine"" in a thundering voice referring to her boyfriend.Another movie where tiny girls are stronger than everyone else, part of this new millenial, politically correct wave of movies.Movie is enjoyable, though.

559,davidvpcol,What was that ending??,7,20 July 2019,"All that build up, and ends in nothing. This almost 2h movie could have been resumed in a 20min short film. Disappointing. I am very disappointed. We didn't deserve the worst ending for an awesome build up and story. Finish it!!!!",Alita - Battle Angel

If you care about the writers and director respecting your time and giving you a story, you won't be happy at all.Alita: Battle Angel has a lot of story arcs, and literally none of them lead to absolutely anything. They're all forgotten as quickly as they're brought up, which gives us a film that feels like a super long character introduction and background that just randomly stops. None of the action or pay off you were hoping for comes through, at all.If you respect your time, give this one a miss.",Alita - Battle Angel
561,PossibleOptimism,Empowering and Epic... Loved it!,10,29 September 2019,"From the start of Alita, you're dropped into a world of the future, but it's already been here a while. For that I felt like there was a prequel I was missing but soon I didn't care-- I was wrapped up in the characters and the story. The cinematography was excellent, acting and stunt performance (real or cg)--top notch. The cg character of Alita was incredibly realistic, even the over-large eyes made it better. These were likeable characters overcoming challenges in a world which was hard to understand. Action, heart, pain, romance... what more does a movie need?",Alita - Battle Angel

564,YaumingYMC,Seamless,9,18 February 2019,"I read the manga awhile ago - and totally fell in love with character in Book 2. It is pleasing to see the story come on screen. I have to say I was put off by the CGI face which looked fake in the trailers. But after watching it - her face looked ""natural"". The CGI level is so good that it mimics the human expression extremely well. I'd watch it again.",Alita - Battle Angel
565,maue-19674,Surprise of the Year!!,9,2 April 2019,"I am more of a sci-fi fan than comic-book, so I went to see this Film with really no expectations - and was COMPLETELY taken with the entire thing! I expected the effects to be top-notch (they were) but the real surprise for me was the wonderful main character herself - from the moment she opens her unique eyes you know you are watching something special. Rosa Salazar gives an amazing performance - Alita comes to life - she is vulnerable, naive and EMOTIONAL and very Human, even though she is a Cyborg. Her performance drives this film - with excellent support from Christoph Waltz as the person who 'discovers' her and becomes her 'Father' figure. The action and Fight sequences are superb - much better than ones i have viewed recently but the real star here is the main character - a REALLY strong Female lead who has genuine human flaws. I managed to catch this in IMAX 3D and it is even better in this format - the visuals really impress. This movie deserves a sequel - and judging by audience reactions to Alita Battle Angel - I am not the only one who found this a superb Science Fiction action film - with a surprisingly moving central character. In it's own way this is already a Sci-Fi Classic.",Alita - Battle Angel
566,socrfan-60834,Good but could use some tweaks.,8,30 July 2019,I like Rosa but at times her character's lines sounded a bit campy. The story line felt rushed and the scene where she offers her heart just seemed stupid. The downer was the fact that they can't seem to make a movie without including a love interest to the point its feeling like a cliche. That's not to say I didn't enjoy the movie because I did and to say the special effects were stunning is an understatement. Hopefully if there's a sequel they'll make it more adult oriented.,Alita - Battle Angel
567,theroscoevine,Really?,5,16 August 2019,"I'm a bit shocked by the positive reviews on this one. It really wasn't good. The story, including the characters, was very corny, the acting was so-so at best, and the only redeeming quality was the action scenes, but even they really weren't above and beyond any of the other current robo-centric actioners out there. I can't say I was disappointed, though, because I thought the ads looked terrible, (seeing the ads was when I first found out about this movie and it was also then that I got my first glimpse of the extremely off-putting manga eyes), so the movie didn't exceed my expectations by anything. ALL parties on this one have turned in FAR superior work.",Alita - Battle Angel
568,junk-mail-me-here,Shockingly good,9,8 January 2020,"TL;DR Really glad I saw this totally excellent live-action sci-fi/cyberpunk movie and would VERY VERY MUCH LOVE TO SEE A SEQUEL!!!!This movie needed better marketing! I don't mind animated storytelling if done well (Ghost in the Shell, Appleseed Alpha, The Animatrix, Heavy Metal) but I don't consider myself an anime fan and don't read graphic novels/comics. The name Alita Battle Angle sounded pompous and over the top and the visual marketing materials did not interest me. I wasn't sure what Alita was but it didn't seem like something I'd like. Boy was I mislead!It went on sale so I took a look and realized that Cameron, Rodriguez and Connelly were involved so decided to give it a try. Wow. Its not styled like anime, its good sci-fi live action with just a hint of anime - which totally worked. The story was cyberpunk (my favorite genre actually) with a hint of added sci-fi (mars, moon war). This is EXACTLY the kind of movie I like - but you'd never know it from the marketing!",Alita - Battle Angel
569,mike_moor,All flash and hype but no soul,3,13 July 2019,"These days the novelty factor of elaborate visuals and special effects are wearing thin. This is the strong point of this movie but without a soul it's like watching a robot do its thing. It makes the plastic world of Hollywood look even more plastic.The visuals and special effects of this movie is great, even breath-taking. The story, not so great. If only the story was as great as the visuals! Instead there is not much of a story. A good story being told is a story where you care about the characters. A good story is a story where the plot is not predictable. In this movie it felt like watching a big mac being produced on an expensive assembly line. Perhaps the blandness of the characters ruined the story or vice versa. No substance. Big hat but no cattle. All flash and hype but still felt like a waste of time.",Alita - Battle Angel
570,tsroque,Great Movie!,8,15 February 2019,I was actually worried if I'd be turned off by all the CGI but I ended up enjoying this movie. There were a lot of different side stories in this film that didn't need to take place like the doctor and his wife and the boyfriend actually being a body snatcher. Those were distractions. The storyline was good enough without all that.,Alita - Battle Angel
571,kersus,Astro-Girl,7,8 July 2019,"This is a good film adaptation of Astroboy modernizing it with current sensibilities. Yes it may be based on it's own Manga however this story IS Astroboy just with a girl. The supporting cast is even very much from Astroboy.The visuals, effects, pacing are all fantastic and in many ways this is a top flight film however it is also a little like have drunk sex. It seems like a good idea but doesn't really get anywhere and in the end you're not really sure what happened but you feel like you kept running into a wall.This is a film worth watching once. It isn't quite as good as some of the animated re-imaginings of Astroboy however it's a nice step in that direction.Special shout-outs to Jennifer Connelly and Jackie Earle Haley who were both top notch.",Alita - Battle Angel

577,tom-43722,Passionate,9,10 March 2019,"If I could describe this movie in one word, the title of this review would be it. James Cameron, Robert Rodriguez and Rosa Salazar's passion for this project shows in every scene of this movie. With Cameron's unfortunate habit of procrastinating for years on end before finally getting a project done - in the case of this movie it took him two freaking decades - it's good to know that he uses those years to ensure he's made the best movie possible.Rosa Salazar is a fan of the manga and it shows. Every time she's onscreen, she's throwing everything into this movie. Aside from the fact that she can't actually bend her body in the way that Alita does after barely surviving her battle with Grewishka (which isn't her fault because even with training, that level of flexibility is extremely rare), she was perfect in this role, able to mix a hardened warrior with a curious teenager. While Rosa is 33 and Alita is over 300 it's easy to forget both the age of the actress and the age of the character because she has such a youthful personality when she's not kicking ass. Plus, despite her incredible combat abilities, Alita wasn't a Mary Sue and thank Jesus for that. Granted, she saved her boyfriend a few times and combining that with her incredible fighting skills might make people worry that she's going to be another girl power character who will always pull through. But no. She doesn't. She was literally torn to pieces in one scene and had to be rescued (although it was pretty darn cool to see her continue fighting with only one arm and no other limbs) and the end of the movie, her attempt to save Hugo failed and he died. That scene made me cry despite some of the more corny scenes used to build their relationship, such as when she literally offered him her heart. I think part of what sold it for me was that Hugo's nickname for her, ""Ali"", is not only a cute nickname on its own but is also the nickname of a character I've written. It was such a sweet romance between two teenagers that I felt genuinely sad when he fell to his death.Hugo was pretty likeable despite his tendency to rip cyborgs apart to harvest their body parts. He backs out of this when he falls for Alita and I liked his black skinned friend, Tanji because although he thought Hugo was wussing out and even fought him about it, he ultimately proved himself a true friend by sacrificing his life to give Hugo time to escape from Zapan. Speaking of Zapan, there wasn't much to him aside from him being incredibly vain but Alita never took him too seriously, handing his ass to him on a plate, slicing off part of his pretty boy face with his own sword and keeping said sword for herself because he was unworthy of having it.Grewishka was given a bit more of a backstory as we learn that he was ""adopted"" by Nova in a perverted reflection of Alita's adoption by Ido. They were even picked up in a scrapyard but while Alita is found in a setting sun at the beginning of the movie, Grewishka shows her that he was discovered in darkness beneath Iron City. Also, while Ido treats Alita like his own daughter, Nova, through his puppet Vector, treats Grewishka as nothing more than a weapon. Nova comes across as an otherworldly presence in this movie, amplified by the eerie blue eyes that appear whenever he's possessing Vector, but he appears briefly as a physical person at the end of the film. He's a mad scientist, not a god, but you'd be forgiven for thinking that some kind of evil spirit is possessing Vector because that's how it comes across.Christoph Waltz did a great job as Ido and although I was personally more invested in the romance, he's given time to shine as Alita's adopted father. The decision to have him name Alita after his murdered daughter instead of his cat was a welcome change as it adds a lot more weight. Although it would have been interesting to explore the more creepy relationship he and Alita had in the manga, that would have made the movie less accessible for larger audiences and needed more time to be fleshed out so just showing a father and daughter relationship was the right decision. However, the weapon Ido uses as a Hunter Warrior seems too bulky for him to swing around with great precision, a stark contrast to Alita's agile and precise movements.Then there's Jennifer Connelly, who's still looking pretty damn good for her age. While Doctor Chiren isn't a particularly big character, there's enough development for her to make her seem human without taking attention away from Alita. Indeed, Chiren's last few scenes show that, deep down, she's still a mother but she forgot that after she lost her child. With an imposter AKA Alita taking over the replacement body her ex-husband made for their daughter, she understandably wasn't happy about it but in the end, her maternal instincts came through and she decided that ascending to the sky city of Zylem wasn't worth the price. Unfortunately for her, she backed out of the deal too late, resulting in a rather gruesome fate which I won't spoil here.And of course, as expected from a James Cameron movie, the special effects are spectacular. Alita's motion capture combined with Rosa Salazar's performance is so well done that Alita's cyborg body felt like it actually existed in this reality. Her big CGI eyes never bothered me, though granted, I have a thing for big, expressive eyes. I was actually more unsettled by the blue eyes Vector had whenever Nova took control of him. Alita gets flashes of her past in the movie and it's strongly implied that she was created for the specific purpose of destroying Nova, who is said to be immortal, but there's still enough left unexplained to keep him a mysterious being. In fact, he's so mysterious that they got a big name to play him and didn't advertise the actor in the marketing or even put his name in the credits. That's how close they kept this secret to the chest.The only criticisms I have of this film are that Nova hasn't been dealt with, which means it relies on at least one sequel to finish the story, and the ending was rushed. You barely have time to absorb Hugo's death before Alita is pointing the Damascus Blade up at Zalem. Aside from that though, I can't find anything wrong with it. They managed to squeeze a lot of story into just over two hours and the only time I felt like it went too fast was at the very end. Any other flaws I tried to complain about were just projections I put on the movie instead of problems with the film itself. Nitpickers might complain about corny dialogue but that complaint holds no weight because the movie is aware of the corny moments and uses them to its advantage. The most notable example is after Alita's speech to the Hunter Warriors. They subvert the cliche of having the main character inspire people with a speech and force Alita to actually show the Hunter Warriors what she's made of. Another example is when Alita breaks the tension after offering her heart to Hugo and the two of them chuckle about how ""intense"" the scene was.We need a sequel. Robert Rodriguez is primed and ready, Rosa Salazar would no doubt be ecstatic to continue playing Alita and although James Cameron often takes years to get movies done, he's not concerned about pleasing corrupt and greedy executives and is always pushing himself to put out high quality work. All they need is the money to fund it. Ignore the critics. They're just afraid that this movie will take attention away from Captain Marvel. Support this movie because unlike Captain Marvel, it deserves every single penny you spend on it.",Alita - Battle Angel

583,charliegeeza,Good but should have been a classic,7,1 July 2019,"Let's start off with what it gets right. Alita is amazing. The sets (or CGI scenes) and world in which the film takes place is spectacular. The story is intriguing and drip teases the history behind it to the point that you want to know more. There's plenty to like about Alita: Battle Angel, and it's unlikely you'll come out disappointed with the experience.However, it's a long way from perfect and that's where the frustrations lie. To start with, the film feels like a lot was left on the cutting room floor and a director's cut will flesh out some of the characters to make them seem more rational. In particular, Chiren (Jennifer Connolly) seemed relegated to being a plot device and her actions never quite made sense because her motivations were not really delved into.As amazing as Alita was, the other cyborgs failed to escape the uncanny valley feel with the superimposed actors faces never quite seemingly moving with the fluidity that Alita does - in a way her success makes their issues stand out more.There was just something missing from the narrative. Grewishka is little more than a cartoon villain, and his relationship with Cherin and Vector is barely touched upon yet he seems to have no problem smashing through their windows. It doesn't click at all. There seemed to be 3 parallel storylines (Grewishka, the motorball, and the Hunter Warriors) and the division of labor between the Hunter Warriors and Grewishka meant that neither were adequately developed nor understood. Sometimes less is more and perhaps focusing on a narrower storyline would have helped.At the centre of the story is Alita's developing relationship with Hugo. It works well until right at the very end, where yet again the character does something that, albeit set up by an earlier statement by the Hugo that he would try to ascend to Zalem, seems completely irrational. His original intention was set out before he falls in love with Alita and they agree to go together, yet he goes on his own without any warning. Again it seems that perhaps some scenes setting up his statement of mind (perhaps some kind of struggles with his new cyborg body) were left on the cutting room floor. It's moments like this that confused me and left me feeling frustrated once the credits rolled.As it is, I will certainly watch a sequel and hope they make it. It is still a very good experience just not a masterpiece.",Alita - Battle Angel
584,bobnet84,Salazar and Waltz are amazing. Spread the Word.,10,23 February 2019,"There has to be a sequel. Tell your friends and family to go see this. Marvel seems to suck the air and dollars out of the cinema these days. If, you want fresh new ideas than we have to support it. Go see it again. Three times even. Rodriguez pulled off one of the toughest jobs ever in this Masterpiece.",Alita - Battle Angel
585,Raxing,A very mixed bag.,6,19 August 2019,"I have been a fan of Battle Angel Alita for a long time. I have read a large portion of the manga and watched the anime. When they announced that this movie was actually going to be made after being on hiatus for over ten years, I was excited but also not excited because I know how poorly made most adaptations of manga material end up being.This movie was overall better than I expected but it definitely missed the mark. They had to resort to telling you things are true but kind of showing you the opposite. They really did not do alot of characters any justice either. The earth is supposed to be a place where the people on Zalem throw their trash but they portray it in a very romantic light with beautiful scenery, lively people, etc. but then tell the audience that it isn't great. That is a contradiction.The movie ruined so many characters.The romantic portrayal of the scrap yard made Hugo seem like an idiot that wants to leave it for no reason instead of an ambitious kid that is willing to do anything to change his circumstances, to get out of the scrap yard and up to the utopian society in the sky. Hugo is also said to be hard working but he is hardly ever seen working. He seems to just play games and hang out with friends all day. That does not add up.The movie does not do Hugo justice.Desty Nova is hardly in this but everything they did in this related to him is not in the manga or anime and is lame asf. Why change a character that was destined to be a fan favorite into a generic bad guy? Desty Nova does not control Motorball, the factory etc. What the heck.They also decided to make Vector into a puppet by having his body get taken over by Nova. WTF? What is wrong with the idea of Vector having his own motivations, desires, etc? That was a terrible decision.
OK that was kind of a rant but I think I have written enough.",Alita - Battle Angel
586,BlockLike,A happy fan of the original,7,8 February 2019,"The moment I heard this film was in the works I got excited.I am a huge fan of the original. Especially as it was only a 50min mini film that was supposed to get follow ups. Sadly it never did.The good thing about this film though, it contains much more of Alita's origin and back story from the books that wasn't covered in the original film.There are a number of scenes that are almost exactly the same, which pleased me a lot!The CGI and special effects are some of the best I've ever seen. It truly is a glorious thing to watch.When the action ramps up, it becomes a high octane roller coaster experience. At numerous moments my hairs stood on end.My gripes are the pacing and Hugo.At moments (luckily not many) the whole feel of the film flattens and becomes boring. During those scenes I was just twiddling my thumbs, desperate for the next scene to arrive. But it didn't happen too many times.I really didn't gel with Hugo at all. He ended up annoying me and his character wasn't portrayed that well.However, it had a lot more good than bad and overall I really enjoyed it.A solid 7/10",Alita - Battle Angel
587,jadongarcia,Not just a visually stunning film but a film that features much more of a prominent hero than most superhero films.,8,3 March 2019,"Ill be honest this film looked down right ridiculous when I had first seen the teaser a year ago, I thought it would be another cgi bloated film, but then I saw more and more footage of it and seemingly began to invest more in this film. I was fully aware that this film wasn't getting very much hype like most action & adventure/sci-fi films do. But I was willing to give it a chance no matter what.I had seen the film on opening day in Imax 3D, I wanted to experience this film's effects to the fullest extent. I walked out of the film extremely satisfied with both the visuals and the story. There was one dilemma with this film but it is totally understandable and that is the fact that it felt fast-paced but not to the extent that it was rushed. After watching numerous reviews about this film from not only viewers of the film but the fans of the manga, I've learned that they basically crammed 4 of the 9 volumes from the manga into the first film and I am well aware that there is indeed a sequel on the way. It might not be as successful as other adaptations like Watchmen for example, in which I thought was hands down the greatest comicbook adaptation of all time. But as a non-manga fan, I truly loved this film for the amazing visuals done by WETA and the stellar performance by Rosa Salazar. The best parts of this film were definetely the flashback scenes, they were so well transitioned and I got chills in each one since Gelda was played by Michelle Rodriguez in which I thought was a perfect casting choice.Now to elaborate on my headline, Alita was indeed from Zalem, although she couldn't remember anything until towards the end, but she was basically send down from a higher or more superior society to basically stand up to those corrupt individuals such as Vector, Grewishka, and Zapan and eventually Nova, as she conversed with him through Vector.I totally look forward to the sequel, I saw this film again the following weekend and I just want to say that it deserves to at least be seen before its hated on for whatever reason or disliked by anyone, the official ""critics"" are just trying to censor the media I believe this film was great if not perfect because there just simply aren't many films out there that you can simply label as ""perfect"". But well done to the cast and crew of this film, I was left with wanting more and more as the film approached its cliffhanger so go see Alita:Battle Angel right tf now in theaters before its released to purchase online.",Alita - Battle Angel

589,lmathc,The Sci-Fi Achievement of the Decade,10,11 April 2019,"I went to Alita: Battle Angel expecting very little. I have never been a huge anime fan and I was a little put off by the trailer. Regardless, I went to the movie. By the time the credits rolled by, I sat in stunned silence. It was SPECTACULAR. I could not believe how much I was swallowed up in the world that this film creates. The effects were phenomenal. The action sequences bordered on perfection. And the soundtrack was masterfully composed.And then there was Alita. I did not expect to love this character as much as I did. Rosa Salazar absolutely steals the show with a performance that makes Alita seem so real it's almost scary. She is a brutally strong warrior-cyborg but still flawlessly conveys an innocence and naivety that makes her incredibly relatable. I wanted to stand up and cheer during her triumphs and was about ready to cry through her heartbreaks. I cannot think of another movie character that commands such respect and empathy. She is a heroine in a class all her own.Other characters also bring life to this cyborg world. Cristoph Waltz as Dr. Ido is a very believable father figure to Alita, and Mahershala Ali is a menacing presence as Vector.No, this movie is not perfect. It has its flaws as does any other movie, but the great parts of this movie are so extraordinary that the mediocre ones become irrelevant and are almost instantly forgotten. Alita: Battle Angel combines the action and intensity of any great sci-fi with heart and character never before seen in this genre. It is, simply stated, a masterpiece.",Alita - Battle Angel

595,jhawk-06372,I don't understand the hype,7,28 February 2019,I never liked anime as it all reminds me of cheaply made sailor moon when I was a kid and don't really see much talent in poorly drawn characters with exaggerated facial features like the eyes. I also think the movie would be ten times better if they had of just went with real life characters not trying to combine the two worlds.I mean Superman and Spiderman were comics first but the movies didn't use animation to represent those characters. Overall its a snorefest there is action in it but the story which is way too long focuses more on the love aspect of the story. I've never read the comics so the character had little definition or meaning to me so I would say watch any other movie that has a female protagonist before you waste your time on this one.,Alita - Battle Angel

598,abasu0819,A visual spectacle with a great old-school story!,8,17 October 2019,"The live action adaptation of a classic Manga (and Anime) named ""Alita: Battle Angel,"" directed by Robert Rodriguez, is definitely not like one typical messed up Hollywood remake of other Japanese franchises. It's very neatly produced extravaganza with a humongous budget of $170M (provided by 20th Century Fox & James Cameron). But money definitely can't make a film perfect, it's the director who does & in this case, Robert Rodriguez left absolutely zero spot to complaint.The story, however might be slightly different from its source, is nevertheless one great treat to watch. Even though it mostly follows the basic idea of any other superhero films, what makes is so special is its brilliant pacing and great casting, apart from fine direction of course. HOWEVER, if there's no sequel to explain a lot of opened opportunities to be explored, the film won't probably recieve its deserved conclusion.Talking about the brilliant performance of Rosa Salazar (enhanced by CGI) as Alita, I can't deny but only accept her magnificent performance. Supported as greatly by the likes of Christopher Waltz, Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein, Jennifer Connelly & others, the film was very much bound to leave no spaces for catching up flaws in this perfect casting. But what made them even better is the amount of screentime each and every characters got and how they developed a relationship between each other. Besides, the major characters and especially Alita herself had great amount of character development. It's no secret that it's very rare to see character development in superhero or sci-fi films as it's mostly about booms & bams but in this case, I'm impressed by how the character of Alita, a girl whose past was bound to be her destiny, was handled.Dialogue writing also was one key reason behind the fantastic performance by cast but what mattered even more was the CGI & VFX department. I'll be lying if I say the department let me down. Right from the beginning, the CGI & VFX were as good as you'd see in any modern day superhero films. Especially how Alita was so lively (and lovely) is a wonder for a studio, not so well known for visually spectacular sci-fi films. Galore of crunchy fighting sequences deserve even more praise.But as I said, at the end, if a sequel is not made, the film will be a complete waste. Though, that won't mean the film is bad to any extent. In fact, it's one neat film which no sci-fi or superhero film lover would want to miss at any cost. Regardless if a sequel is made or not however, the fact will remain the same that it deserves a sequel, nevertheless, for the films' own credentials, not for the sake of having it or the unexplained past of Alita and many more subplots it left behind. A thoroughly enjoyable two hour long extravaganza - Alita: Battle Angel!",Alita - Battle Angel

601,ksmart73,Don't trust the critics.,7,26 February 2019,"This is one of those movies that for whatever reason the critics have decided to try and throw this under the bus. I hate film critics. What's they saying? Those who can't make art become critics.This is a great feature film. Ambitious, action packed, and great performances all around. I genuinely hope we get a sequel because this was a fun ride!",Alita - Battle Angel
602,rigoletto339,Fast-paced manga action,6,17 February 2019,"This should appeal to Anime and Manga fans - but I haven't read this one. I did notice few similarities between Alita and Astroboy (from the 60s & 80s). In both, a humanoid robot is built - Astroboy, by a scientist in search of a lost son, Alita, by a doctor in search of a lost daughter. In both, the hero/heroine becomes aware and tries to remember his/her origins. In both (at least, in one Astroboy episode) there's a competition between the hero/heroine involving giant powerful robots in a sports arena.
Most interesting, in both there's a Dark Figure, looking down from above.
But maybe that's common to a lot of anime.""Alita"" will certainly appeal to Anime and video game fans.Rosa Salazar is the heart and soul of this movie. It's fascinating to me that not a bit of the real-life Salazar's body appears in it - but every move, every emotion comes through clearly.People have wondered about Alita's eyes - but anybody who knows Manga knows about that. The only thing is, shouldn't everybody else have the same treatment?The final scenes hint very strongly that there will be at least one more Alita movie. It usually works out that if the first make enough at the box office, they'll do another. It's been a bad month for movies, but Alita beat out the Lego movie, so maybe there's hope.",Alita - Battle Angel
603,depicco,Just .. wow!,10,3 March 2019,"The joy after coming out of the theater was turned into bitterness just a few minutes after. How is is possible that a piece of crap like Star Wars 8 (or 7) still keeps a high score yet a movie like this does not? Are they so low that those cretins do not only keep inflated the scores of garbage but do they also pay to trash the scores of other movies? I see no other reason; after all , the 'profesional' reviewers that score this one low are the exactly same that score those other ones high. But not all those cretins' fault. I just went to watch this movie because a friend of mine invited me, but not for the posters, neither the trailers, neither the publicity (or lack of it) lead me to have the slightest idea how was it gonna be; also, at first it didn't help to know this was directed by Robert Rodriguez (the content is what matters, so why spend money or effort in decent effects or more than basic CGI), but the hand of Cameron Diaz also shows; it turned out to be a mix of the best of each one, with more than impressive scenarios and effects, good acting and a plot that will grab you till the end (not really end, there is a cliffhanger). Absolutely worth watching and hoping that it will be released in 3d when it comes as home video",Alita - Battle Angel
604,moviemonki,Comes off as a middling Y.A. novel brought to screen.,6,8 September 2019,"Hard to rate film. Work and care went into it. Visuals, while never quite real, lend a unique fairytale quality. But exposition and cliches litter a script which functions as a summary of several books. None of the characters stand out beyond their role in the narrative. And the film becomes more emotionally untethered as it goes. I too often asked, ""Why is this character doing this?"" in the second half of the film.",Alita - Battle Angel
605,Victreebong,"If this is how we get to a live screen Akira, we have nothing to fear.",10,16 February 2019,"Alita could be the tipping point from mediocre American anime adaptation to most ambitious undertaking in big budget film making. This movie was in the veins of Avatar. THIS movie is how I envisioned Ready Player One would wind up.Let me just start off by saying this has not one but FIVE Oscar acknowledged actors in it, with three wins and two noms! And they're not even the lead character!! Rosa will be 2019's breakout star this year thanks to Alita who seamlessly displays range through mo-cap technique. And while I'm boasting over performances, Ed Skrein has been under the radar since Game of Thrones. But in this, he goes above and behind his bad guy role in Deadpool with a villainous role that makes him as memorable as Stephen Lang from Avatar.The story is one we know too well: amnesiac wakes up to caretakers only to find out they're the chosen one to end a multi-century long war between classes. If that spoiled anything for you, don't play Zelda, Final Fantasy or watch any fantasy movie from the 80's. The difference between Alita and the usual chosen one trope is that Alita is a young (old) lady and she just wants to be a young lady. This is a beautiful love story with a father figure mixed with choosing your own destiny.Where this movie shines is in the in-betweens. Alita remembering who she is, realizing what's around her, and over coming adversity. Make no mistake, Alita is not bulletproof. The first scene is of a destroyed female torso, and she's partly synthetic. Her emotions are just as fragile as she's a cyborg (aka human and machine), NOT a robot. It's those moments of realization and especially the emotional ones that make this a blockbuster. She's sensitive, cares about how other people see her, empathetic to animals, and curious about new things. For a battle hardened femme fatale, she's an awfully big sweetheart. And it won't surprise anyone if I say that she also has a love interest.But for all the action and anime fans out there like myself, this movie is a masterclass attempt to behold! The spectacle in Alita Battle Angel is gripping to say the least, and this was the best use of 3D tech since Gravity. Metal, shrapnel, braided cables, kicks, explosions, sword slashes and impacts are brutal and well executed. Without spoiling things, my favorite scene is during a sports event in high pursuit that leaves you glued to what's going to happen to who next.This will be a movie that sticks with me awhile. I loved Wonder Woman, and I'm afraid Alita has also cast a spell on me. I recommend Alita to anime fan and casual moviegoer alike. Also, I'm anxiously awaiting the sequel announcement!",Alita - Battle Angel
606,j-tochtenhagen,"Great visuals, otherwise a mixed bag",5,20 August 2019,"No doubt, the visuals are a joy to watch. I really enjoyed the first half of the movie but then it somehow falls apart. It seems all too generic and recycled from other movies and plots. The worst part is, that the main plot is just not compelling enough, there's no real tension here and some characters totally fall flat.There is almost no depth in character and the movie just feels like an episode, which in fact it is. I know a little about the comics and they do not promise any better movies coming from this franchise. It may work in the comics but for a movie you need more.",Alita - Battle Angel

608,utdaxiao,Kind of Ghost in the Shell ???,7,25 February 2019,"When I saw the beginning of the movie talking about brains implanted into mechanical body parts, Ghost In the Shell directly came into my mind. The anime, not the movie. Differently from Ghost in the Shell, Alita has a more positive and less melancholic touch. Alita is innocent and able to find human affection, while Major's ghost live in solitude in her shell. Although having a positive trend, the movie also shows some potential realities for a dystopian future, such as stealing body parts of other people, bounty hunters, oppression, poverty, bread and circuses, etc. This contrast gives the movie a good balance.But, Alita cannot escape from common cliches. She is a kind of a hero because she is, such as Frodo, Harry Potter and Ash Ketchum. This trend is so 1990s, and very exhausted in my personal opinion. It doesn't destroy the movie, of course. After all, we are all living on nostalgia of the 80s and 90s, aren't we? Also, the cliche of the cyborg who loves a human being is present in the movie and, as she lost this love, gives her motivation power and determination. I'm sorry, we've seen this a lot and again we can't escape it.To add up, the movie has a moderate-slow pace, that could be a bit faster than it was. Some of the story was unnecessary and takes a long time to find her origins. It could be 15-30 minutes shorter. Also, the CGI was very impressive. At first, the 3D experience looked very real, and I take my hat for the production and design team for that. The face expression in Alita was so so realistic and natural. More towards the end of the movie, I believe the CGI lost a bit its impressive power. I don't know if it is that I got used to it seeing it, or if less resources was directed into it.To sum up, it was movie that delivers what it wants. A bit lengthy, a bit cliché, a bit of ""steals the idea from Ghost in the Shell"", but it delivers. I recommend watching.",Alita - Battle Angel
609,rolando19552001,Alita Battle Angel,9,20 February 2019,"Alita Battle AngelThe film is a well aesthetic produced and innovating work of art that makes you be glued to the cinema screen as the 170 million dollars budget that the film is said to cost. The story is a story of coming of age of the title character that must remember who she really is after centuries of being in derelict scraps fields and thus this is where the story of the film begins. There is the search by one of the doctors Ido played by Christopher Waltz with candor and good sense in the scraps fields and then there he found the remains of what had been an ancient and powerful fallen warrior. The remains of the cyborg, mainly her cerebral head and her powerful engine and anti-matter heart who gives her extreme power source and strength. Ido managed to remade the cyborg with a new body and thus the newly made cyborg returns to life at earnest and becomes with the stylization of Ido´s late daughter in which Ido lost her in a tragic event, now the cyborg would have the same name of Ido´s daughter in Alita, in Spanish it means little wing, and the cyborg Alita would also share the same father.
Now that the plot is taken care of, the action when it come at you it comes with great battle sequence that are well made. There are a plethora of stylizations in the Alita´s world, bounty hunters, hunter warriors who seek criminals. Alita´s many conflicts made her weary and she always in danger but most importantly the ones she loves are the most vulnerable and thus this is how we get to the tragic figure of Hugo a symbol of both optimism and belief in good seeing how Alita truly is like the title character an angel fallen from heaven. Hugo a cyborg parts scrapper and scavenger finally seeing Alita´s great heart and great human presence, even more than a flawed human, Hugo finally changes his ways but unfortunately for both Hugo and Alita, there had been an enemy in the coming of age of Alita, an evil, insidious bounty hunter Zapan who somehow managed to frame Hugo with an intolerable act, homicide in the Iron City and Hugo must die. Alita is heartbroken when Zapan with a edgy sword that he does not deserve manages to inflict irreparable damage to Hugo who in his last words said that Alita changed him and Hugo did this because he loves Alita as the Battle Angel is lachrymose and in deep despair and hurt. The former wife of Ido, Chiren played by Jennifer Connolly finally seeing this heartbreak between cyborg Alita and her dead Hugo, Chiren choses to help Alita and Hugo and somehow manages to construct a new cyborg body with Hugo´s head and brain and memories. Alita now a Mars Berserker, she a powerful warrior seeks justice aganst Vector a man controlled by Nova, an evil dictator of Zalem, the city over the sky of Iron City. Alita also fights Nova´s Champions by the evil behemoth Grewishka for the third and last time. But Nova would not rest until inflecting more damage to Alita as the now cyborg Hugo somehow still is conveying into the lie that Zalem is an arcadia and utopia and seeks to rise towards Zalem and then the denouement betwnee the once star crossed lovers finally meets its denouement when Nova in a possible cameo by James Cameron, it is not clear if he is truly there under the shadows and the shade. Hugo is once again with a defensive ring that ravages Hugo´s cyborg body and once again the lachrymose and always human Alita tries to save her lover Hugo with one hand in the air and the other in the tube to Zalem, Hugo knowing that his metallic arm is quickly dismembering and seeing that finally their time had come to an end to be together once again Hugo and Alita returns their love vows and Hugo is his last words tells Alita thank you for saving the first time, although not this second time and thus this is how Hugo meets his second and last death. Three months later Alita number 99 Battle Angel is ready to become the Champion of Motorball the tournament. Alita knows that if she becomes champion she can go to Zalem and meet Nova and try to defeat him. The film of James Cameron is a work of patience, and also for many scenes a great work of art, reminding of how James Cameron made Avatar, the film is well centered in the title character in Alita played by actress Rosa Salazar who after having roles in both Maze Runner sequels in the Scorch Trials and the Death Cure, Rosa Salazar truly makes an entrance to the grand stage with an A list turn and star turn as Alita a cyborg full of love and empathy for all and a sacred duty to help others and do good and vanquish evil. Also the good song of the film, Swan Song by Dua Lipa is heard at the credits, good accompanying song and music video. Bravo to Rosa Salazar and James Cameron, the latter as producer as both steal the show and makes us all the rest of us anonymous sitting there in the cinema chairs.",Alita - Battle Angel
610,naren-reviews,Robots + Visual treat + Story + Action - Romance,9,19 February 2020,"I had zero expectations as I knew no background of the movie when I clicked on it on hotstar (India streaming site). Well, the movie reminded me with something which I have seen in Wall-E animation movie when it started - a scrapyard. But, the movie slowly started building the main character Alita, she knew nothing about herself when the movie started so was I, so the pace of the movie carried me along scene by scene with interesting stuffs. CG was too good. Alita seems to be odd at times showing her CG effects, but she is a machine so doesn't matter. My rating dropped one star out just due to the romantic part of the story, it didn't fit well, it was slowing down the story. Overall, good treat visually and feel good futuristic robotic movie with very good action sequences to watch.",Alita - Battle Angel
611,alex-799-908199,Better than I expected,8,16 February 2019,This is coming out of the cinemaFrom what critics had said about the cgi and the story line not being great or built up was a heavy hit. Yeah I can understand that the plot was easy to expect from the lover being a cyborg scraper to how she planned out during the film.The cgi was spot on to the point you couldn't tell the obvious signs of green screen or rendered locations.Fight signs and the gore level was more than I anticipated and can't wait for the sequel. It's nothing like a box office smash like any of the marvel films but it's out there as a contender for a very successful trilogy if the cards are set.,Alita - Battle Angel
612,plantsvszombiestim,Amazing visuals and wonderful lead,9,1 May 2019,"I had never heard of Alita before watching it for the first time. Rosa as Alita was simply out of this world. She connected Alita with the audience and made her seem truly human. The action sequences and the CGI was just as good if not better. I felt a strong emotional connection to Alita and was really drawn in by her story. This was the only movie I've ever gone back more than once to watch in theaters. I felt like I was a child once again and that's a good thing.It wasn't perfect but definitely worth a watch, the apparent cliches weren't cliches when this manga first came out, ; if anything other mediums might as well have drawn elements from the original manga, not vice versa. The plot could've been more developed and there could've been more character development for the side characters. Nonetheless, as I was watching the movie, I didn't see the ""big eyes"" and the flaws, all I saw was Alita fighting to discover who she really was and the adventure, heartbreak, and pain that would follow .",Alita - Battle Angel

One of the reasons I dislike this type of movies is that they look horribly ""cartoonish"".Alita didn't suffer from this drawback at all. If not for the big eyes and sometimes ""floating"" hair, I could swear everything was real. The CGI is exceptionally well done.What makes this movie more than a nice CGI one is the fact that it has a good story, good acting, a bit of mistery and some touching moments that make you root for the main character(s). All in all, one of the best science-fiction movies of the last years and probably the best manga/anime adaptation ever. Worth to see - can't wait for the sequels.",Alita - Battle Angel

The love of James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez for their subject matter--the cyborg warrior, Alita--shines through from start to finish. And Dr. Ido is peeeerfect.What will people who are not huge fans of the manga think? Don't care. Sucks to be them. This is a great sci-fi manga. And a great film adaptation of a sci-fi manga.I do predict that girls and young women will love this movie, and we will soon be seeing girls in Alita full metal armor body suits.

It looks at real problems, class differences because of technological oppression, and just really touches the human soul.The story keeps you at edge, on guard, sceptical all the time, worrying, but also hoping. It makes you wish that you could give your knowledge, hope, and creativity to those people, because they are not exactly bad - they are - but rather lost, or incapable of better.To see that even in dump like this hope and a desire for the better still hits his head up.. is just great, inspiring and really speaks of human nature.

The sound's pretty good too. The overall presentation of the film is a home run for sure.But there are a few flaws, including the script. For example, there's too many cliche movie lines such as: ""Who am I?"" ""I have to do this,"" and the dreaded ""Trust me!"" Also, many moments are predictable. You can tell when they are going to kiss, when someone is going to escape/get rescued, and when they are about to die. For the characters, they don't have enough meat on them for you to really get into it. And the ending may not leave you satisfied.All said and done, if you saw the trailer a while back and thought you'd enjoy it, you're probably right.

I loved the visuals first of all, great visual effects work and is fun to watch in 3D with well choreographed action scenes in my opinion. I think the acting was good all round, although don't know about the casting accuracy as don't know the source material. Rose was great as Alita In my opinion though she seemed a very human character although being motion captured and is a cyborg lol, she was so nice and likeable. Perhaps a bit too Mary Sue for my liking, although could be argued to be too trusting. The script is pretty solid aside from the predicted cheesy love stuff, that didn't really work for me. I overall enjoyed this and think it's worth a watch even as non-anime kind of person, as it built a nice world and narrative. Although I felt to me some questions were left unanswered and resolved about her past, but I guess they're hoping for a sequel judging by the end. Although I don't see this happening, as I don't think it'll fair too well in the box office and James Cameron seems so focused on the avatar stuff. I hope we see more though",Alita - Battle Angel

625,Sevenmercury7,"Epic, vibrant and colourful sci-fi with enjoyable 3D",8,22 February 2020,"Alita gets a thumbs-up from me, both the movie and the 3-D. The story is not as sophisticated as I was expecting, but it's well done and reasonably exciting throughout. Parts of it are horrific, enough to give younger viewers nightmares, while Alita herself is a peppy teen heroine ripped straight from a comic book. The world-building is epic, more vibrant and colourful than the usual sci-fi dystopia. The story takes some dark turns in the second half; the mix of techno-body-horror and pulpy action adventure won't be to everyone's taste, but I think Rodriguez and Cameron pulled it off. As advertised, the film does have a lot of heart. Alita is a perfectly realised and acted sci-fi robot heroine.I enjoyed the 3-D quite a bit. At no point did I feel truly wowed, but likewise I never felt cheated. There are strong sequences, particularly on the giant cable to the sky city and the brilliant Motorball circuits. Objects and characters protrude from the screen frequently, but the effect is subtle so they don't seem like pop-outs (apart from the metal tentacles that shoot out). It's a very good, varied use of native 3-D that, while not as striking as the best Marvel conversions, is definitely worthwhile.",Alita - Battle Angel

They had to bring them out when the kids were terrified because of the violent deaths of certain characters. Yes, this movie is meant for mature audiences. Definitely not for the faint of heart too.When I saw the trailer I thought I was not going to like it. I didn't even list it as one of those I wanted watch, but when my dad said he wanted to watch it with us, then I went along with them.There is no dull moment. It is well-written, well-acted, well-conceptualised, et cetera, et cetera.There are dramatic scenes, sweet moments, funny quips, scary scenes, lots of action, et cetera.2 hours and 22 minutes were well spent, and so worth the money.

I am a huge movie fan, but also a huge sci-fi fan (especially when it comes to dystopian future, cybernetics & A.I) + everything japanese... I love groundbreaking visuals & innovative concepts... So I'm always looking forward to this type of piece of art. I knew the original manga & anime. I liked it, especially its lore & universe. But in my opinion, this movie brings it to another level.I personally always choose to praise the things I like, rather than spending my energy by criticizing the things I don't like... So, I am very talkative about the things I love. At first (when I came out from the movie theater) it left me speechless, because to me, this movie has hitten the right spots. I love when I can feel the passion & artistic touch of all the talented people involved in such a creative enterprise (because blockbusters are more than just movies ; they hire thousands of highly-skilled people). And whether we like the story or not, it's a work of art anyway. The rest is subjective.By my eyes, I think this movie has the right combination of emotion & action, with both complimenting one another. It serves and thickens the plot... The whole experience is electrifying and mesmerizing ; the themes, mysteries, and the rich mythology around this universe, it beautifully highlights the ""chosen one"" hero that is Alita. It really has expanded the universe & all the designs that were originated by the manga & the anime. And I love when movies brings things to another level. Leaving us in beatitude, speechless, and quite simply craving for more ...PS : I liked the original material, because I think it's full of great ideas & themes. But I think it fairly deserved a live action version like this, with stunning visuals & powerful action scenes ! Which definitely is the case here !!!
Now I hope they're gonna make this movie's sequel ""Last Order"", and prequel ""Mars Chronicle"" !!................
PPS : And yes, Alita Battle Angel should be much much more appreciated and regarded as the groundbreaking piece of cinematic art it is, and also for the heart+soul it has.",Alita - Battle Angel

631,henryau-29344,So underrated...,9,2 April 2019,"Interested in a sci-fi flick with great graphics, action, character, and decent story? Watch this. Just do it. Whether you're a kid or adult with an ounce of patience for storytelling. There is so much heart and passion put into this film, and no wonder if you consider how it was James Cameron;s pet project 20 yrs ago and he made Avatar as a tech demo for this, and how Robert Rodriguez offered to trim his script for free just out of passion.The story might seem simple, but dwell a little deeper and exercise some empathy at the characters and there's much more layers to it. There's Alita with no memory and finding everything new and exciting while being a naive but idealistic kid, then realizing her potential in an unforgiving world. Hugo, was he taking advantage of Alita? When exactly did he reverse course? Is it healthy to form a relationship with some girl with no memories so quickly? What does Ido think of all this as his ""daughter"" is growing up? There's a lot we can all relate to whether as a dumb teen ourselves, or as an adult. And face it, how many of us dreamed of that perfect friend as a kid?The title character is the soul of the movie, and you need to put in some effort in empathizing and relating to her to understand her actions, instead of dismissing her has being cheesy/cringy. Every facial movement and line delivery from her actress shows her emotion. There's a scene with her ""dad"" where she doesn't say a word and cuddles with him, but you can feel what she's thinking. I've never been so focused on a character's expressions from any live action or animated character. That line from Hugo, ""You're the most human person I've ever met"" that some ppl found cheesy in the trailers? He wasn't lying. He and Ido do a fine job as well, with Ido being a great father-figure and Hugo being the more mundane kid enthralled by Alita - not everyone has to be so expressive and ""over act.""There's a lot of dialogue and ""exposition"" separating the action scenes and some ppl might not like that, expecting constant explosive action. But when the action comes, it's explosive and quite amazing how a little girl can rock so much with just her body and a sword later. No fancy guns, bombs, magic, or superpowers, just great choreography (no shakey cam at all, so everything is easy to follow, a rarity these days). And the dialogue is more believable than critics say - these are teens in love, one without memories and no knowledge of social norms. Watching Igo and Hugo interacting with Alita was engaging.Reading ppl put off by her bug eyes is a shame. I got over that within the first 2 min. ""Professional"" critics bashing the movie for being ""sexualized,"" cliche, heartless, having -terrible- dialogue/story, convinced me to put 0 trust in them. This being dragged into the Captain Marvel SJW socialpolitical drama online probably didnt' help either. This movie deserves a sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel

If she likes it, it's bound to appeal to many. And we both loved it. Not only does it have some extraordinary sci-fi elements, and intense action, but it also has heart and soul with believable characters, romance, and a superb adaptation of the manga.

635,mballardc32,A+ Visual Effects - C- Performance,7,15 February 2019,"Overall this film was a fun adventure film. Plot similar to Divergent and Hunger Games. Where the insignificant girl discovers her hidden power and chooses to overthrow the system and tyrannical hierarchy. And a pretty close story to Astro Boy. Where a boy robot with the mind of a human discovers life below the floating city etc etc etc.
Visual Effects were some of the best in the business. Making the fighting sequences and the flow of robotics look enthralling and natural. It was clear there was a huge focus on making this LOOK fantastic.
Acting was not so pleasant. The main love interest had the look but not the talent to pull of his role. Jennifer Connolly is a great actress, but not in this. Her emotionless delivery was hard to swallow. No matter what is happening, be it tragedy or sadness, she kept the same facial expression. Unmoved by the events that affect her. Most of the other actors were making me cringe. I reckon if given the right dialogue these actors would of flourished. Which brings me to another negative. The dialogue. Cheesy, predictable and boring dribble. And yet the script wasn't all rubbish. The gold planning of the script was splattered with sh** dialogue.
The plot was one that kept you entertained and caused a considerable amount of enjoyment. Some points were predictable but not enough to make me hit myself in the face.The visual effects carried this film that is for certain.",Alita - Battle Angel
636,javomed88,Great movie with poor marketing,8,18 March 2019,"This is probably one of the best sci-fi/action films I've seen recently. As anyone would expect from James Cameron, Alita is a game changer in visual effects. The film is very exciting, entertaining and visually innovative.Alita is having trouble to succeed at the box office not because of the quality of the film as such, but rather due to its poor marketing and the unappealing title. ""Alita"" sounds way too weird. Maybe the name means something to Robert Rodriguez, but it really feels wrong. ""Battle Angel"" sounds even worse. If the intention was to evoke to anime, perhaps they should have chosen a title (name) more in line with that.Regardless, I was quite surprised with this film. Many cyborg movies have already been made. However, Alita is genuine and heart-warming. I also liked the choice of a female cyborg as the hero (for a change). Given the box office reception and the critical response, I doubt Cameron will dare to produce a sequel... but you never know.I would like to see more of Alita instead of three Avatar sequels no one cares about anymore. Also, I really hope this film gets recognised for its visual effects. An Oscar nomination/win would be a good consolation price undoubtedly.Score: 8.5/10FJ Medina",Alita - Battle Angel

The movie kept becoming more intense, especially intriguing during the Wing Chun moment. To continue, in another instance, I really felt the inner emotions as she shouted the name like the moment in the movie Troy (whether that was intended I think actress Rosa expressed this perfectly), it was then I began to feel the depth and lengths she was willing to go.

639,nilsurban-50399,I was so wrong - this is actually a great movie!,10,15 February 2019,"Battle Angel Alita surprised me as one of the best story driven action movies of the past years and here is why:Story:
solid story-telling, no cheesy and time wasting flashbacks. Characters actions/choices are relatable and comprehensible and things do not just happen because somebody just did something totally stupid or unreasonable. Also the relationships between Alita, her ""father"" and boyfriend are built up well. Furthermore this movie was clearly made for a mature audience which is a great decision. Many movies like Star Wars and DC Hero movies have failed because they want to cater to kids, teens, families, men all at the same time additionally filling their movies up with bad/badly placed comedic elements. Alita, fortunately, has none of these flaws.Acting:
very solid acting from everyone, but the Oscar goes to Rosa Salazar who did the motion capture for Alita. She did an amazing job! When I saw the trailer and those big eyes I thought this could only go wrong but Rosa Salazar gave real life to Alita.CGI:
Fantastic! The design choices are impressive and the distinction between high-tech and low-tech battle equipment was nicely done. Movement is smooth and very realistic. Alita's facial expressions are, in my opinion, the closest to reality we can get thus far.Action:
Very well choreographed action that refrains from many cheesy slow-motions and keeps it down to the point. It is also well placed and not too scarce. Plenty of action well interwoven with story driving elements - good job!Music:
Elegantly placed and perfectly connected with each scene. Not as memorable as Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Star Wars or other Blockbusters, but it did it's job well.Score: 10/10 - can't wait for part 2",Alita - Battle Angel

I'm not even convinced it's not a secret Disney title. The only clue that it isn't is that they say the F word once or twice, but maybe that's just to confuse us.Set in an actual garbage dump more saturated with colors than a happy go lucky Pixar movie, sprinkled with pop music that doesn't belong in sci-fi, awkward and generic Hollywood style teenage love and drama cliches, and last but not least featuring multiple never ending scenes of rollercoaster-like fast paced action that feels like watching strobe lights accompanied by white noise if you are above 15 years old, we can safely say adults are not in the target audience for this movie.That's not my only gripe with this movie. While I'm totally fine with giant anime eyes, it's friggin' uncanny valley when it comes to live action flicks. To my surprise though it wasn't the googly eyes that made me the most uncomfortable, just try to focus on Alita's badly animated lips for a bit if you really want to be weirded out.

644,MJL_Uncensored,"The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly of Manga",7,15 February 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel is a visceral throat punch that delivers as an action film and struggles in the social commentary. It's the good, the bad, and ugly of manga, which is why I love and hate this film all at the same time.Let's start with the obvious, Alita: Battle Angel is visually one of the most amazing cinematic experiences to date. When James Cameron's name is attached to it as the producer, you can expect nothing less. So I didn't go into this movie hoping to be wowed by the CGI--I expected it. Combined with Robert Rodriguez's flair for action, you know this movie will get your adrenaline pumping. But in case you're living under a rock, the film is based on the eponymous Japanese cyberpunk manga series and follows the story of a repaired cyborg who has forgotten her identity as a warrior trained in cyborg the martial arts known as Panzer Kunst. She exists in the dystopian city of Iron City (Scrapyard in the manga), and it's world occupied by murderous cyborgs that are hunted by bounty hunter cyborgs called Hunter-Warriors.First, the good stuff. This movie kicks hard! I saw it in IMAX 3D and every punch, kick, or stomp by a Centurian was felt. The sound design of this film is as impressive as it's visuals and provides the sort of visceral intensity that makes every act of violence into a crucial storytelling mechanism. It's violence that you never get numb too. Each fight feels like there are stakes involved, even if you already know that Alita can overpower anyone. The story moves at a decent pace, so you get enough exposition to know what's going on and the right amount of action to keep it from dragging.The bad stuff is minor when it comes to this film, but it can't be overlooked. The acting sucks, and not because the actors suck, but because the dialogue sucks. I doubt Denzel Washington could bring life to this stiff sounding dialogue. And maybe that was the intent because we are dealing in robots, but even the human characters have to work through some pretty hokey dialogue.Then there's the ugly. At the heart of the story is Alita's problematic relationship with Dr. Dyson, a cyborg scientist who projects his affection for his long-lost daughter on Alita. The film's heavy dose of male-gaze is never creepier than when you see Dr. Dyson eye-balling Alita's new bodies. And yes, I meant to type bodies. Alita also falls in love with a teenage male name Hugo, whose side hustle as a cyborg parts trafficker makes it vividly evident that the men in Alita's life lack integrity. But that's the least of the films social critiques. Then there's the ominous way in which black actors are reduced to subservient roles in the movie too damn near ""Get Out"" style human hosts for a white man we have yet to meet named Nova. Initially, I thought my ""woke"" switch was on overload, but when Jorge Lendeborg Jr.'s (from Bumblebee) was told to ""get over"" transgressions from enemies from 300 years ago, it was clear it was deliberate. I don't know who Cameron is aiming for in his themes as he seems to attack capitalism and slavery while bathing in white supremacy themes. Since I'm not an aficionado of the source material, it's hard to pinpoint how much of this is Cameron's screenplay and how much of this is the source material. Lastly, while I love Rosa Salazar's performance, I can't help but wonder how much more accurate this film would have felt if an Asian American actress was given the role. Manga can be pretty homogenous, but to erase all traces of Asian culture from the film is disappointing.Like all good science fiction, Alita: Battle Angel challenges you to think about classism, and it's destructive effects upon society. Like the best action films, it gives you a hero to root for. And like the futurist world in which this story exists, Alita: Battle Angel has room to grow and improve but it's worth the investment to see where this franchise goes.",Alita - Battle Angel
645,roger_and_out,Another Young Adult novel made into a movie,6,12 July 2019,"Yep, think about all the tropes that makes a YA novel what it is - the cliches, the teenage innocence of a psuedo-relationship, the perception and attention to detail befitting of a person who knows nothing of the world. You know, a YA novel.If you like logic, a solid plot and realistically relatable characters who are not rude, egotistical, bad-boy-wannabes - this movie is NOT for you. Some reviews here advise to ""turn your brain off"" before you watch this movie, this is sage advice. Just bury your face in the butter-popcorn bucket and enjoy the pretty faces and fast colors flickering on the screen. If you DO manage to do that, this is a paper-thin fun movie, completely forgettable, completely redundant. If you paid money to see it, I'm sorry.",Alita - Battle Angel
646,metalgear800,Failed adaptation,1,18 May 2020,"I'm going to be honest with you. I first started watching this live action adaptation. About 45 minutes in I switched to the anime OVA because this live action adaptation is just so piss poor it's unbelievable. And I'm glad that I did.
The original work is set in a cyberpunk dystopian world where corruption and greed rule, a girl without memories learns about such a society and romance. That is the essence of the first two volumes of the manga.
Now, Iron City seems like a happy place filled with hipsters. It misses the character development that the original has and they left out or somehow 'censored' all the gore material. They even completely changed characters to become simple grunts with standard grunt-like-dialogue. These are only a few things on the list of what's bad and I could go on and on about it but there's just nothing good about it. They Americanized a beautiful dark love story of Japanese origin. And as always... Hollywood completely ruined it.
The worst thing for me was how they completely missinterpreted the original material and failed to convey the original setting, characters and plot. Lot's of things in the story just doesn't make any sense. They also got her crush completely wrong. His character is pretty much the opposite. Even though this movie is twice as long as the OVA, Hugo (/Yugo) never got the character development it needed. It doesn't help the romantic part of the story.
Typical is that there's more attention for flashy animation which in my opinion look horrendous and feels like filler material.
The original had interesting sound effects to set the mood but nothing of the sorts to be found here.
Also, there's your standard overcompensating scenes for gender propaganda / 'we try to avoid complaints from easily offended people' reasons. Somehow, the original work could portrait a girl like a badass without making itself look silly. This is yet another failed Hollywood adaptation.",Alita - Battle Angel

However, scientific aspects of the world appear quite controversial and unsatisfactory to consider it science-fiction: perhaps, it would have been better to set it all up in a purely fantasy realm as opposed to some kind of a futuristic reality of Earth.Additionally, the whole story is full of historical events and details, that are not entirely explained or any clarification is just skipped to not overload its spectator's brain. The movie should probably have been at least 1 hour longer to make the plot more coherent and digestible. On the other hand, this approach is rather predictable for a highly commercial product: make people interested in the idea to sell it later in several more consecutive episodes.In a nutshell, it is better not to expect any revelations from this work: it can offer all but nothing beyond its beautiful though hollow shell and breath-taking scenes of battles.

The characters are real - even Alita. You really do forget that she's CGI, even with the doe eyes.If you're looking for a great female role-model, look no further - she's not perfect, but does what she thinks is right. She's cute while badass - other movies that try to sell faux female-empowerment for the sake of it should take note. The difference here is that Alita is a well-written character from ground up, who happens to be a great protagonist, while others writers (usually directors who think they can write nowadays) think that so long as a female lead is strong, their job is done.The emotional parts actually felt believable, and actually got me in the feels, I'm not proud to admit.

656,SkyPowers,James Cameron Creates Another Franchise,8,29 July 2019,"It's a special skill in La La Land to be able to interweave great storytelling with astounding visual effects. With Avatar, he created an astonishingly fresh and original world. And ""Alita"" accomplishes that too -- which is so challenging as every sci-fi realm seems to have been mined to the point where nothing seems new anymore. Back to the story with a few spoilers. It starts out like a Pixar movie allowing introducing the main characters, Alita, the cyborg with a heart of gold (and anti-matter powerful enough to run a power a whole city) goes from super vulnerable to a character the audience instantly identifies with and delight throughout the film as she evolves, discovering who she really is and her amazing powers that make Iron Man look like an antique by comparison. Yes cyborgs are a sci-fi staple but you will just have to see and judge for yourself how they are re-imagined here. I got the feeling as the layers of the onion began to peel along with the twists and turns and surprises that the movie would inevitably end which would be disappointing, that's how much this film grew on me. But I soon figured out this would have to be a franchise tent pole and there would have to be a cliff hangar at the end, which there is. Yes the bad guys are a little cookie-cutter evil. Alita's boyfriend is introduced to us as the perfect guy next door but we later learn he that's this ""dreamboat"" is more complex than he first appears. There is one big plot hole that I won't discuss here otherwise I'd have given this a 9, but I was happy to suspend my disbelief.",Alita - Battle Angel
657,ssnake_z,Alita wills it,6,20 August 2019,"ALITA: Battle Angel
RATING: 3.2/5This movie's kinda weird cause it actually starts off pretty good, with a nice solid pace, and then at about the halfway mark the movie starts tripping over itself. The film is 2 hrs 22 minutes long, and it still feels as if entire scenes are missing from parts of the second half. It just tries to do way too much and almost feels aimless, to a degree. Like you're trying to figure out what the goal of the film is and when you finally get one, it changes... and then it changes again, and then it loops back to the first goal, and you're just left asking, ""What are you trying to do movie, what is the main character's goal?"" The film even feels as if it ends on the 2nd Act, or halfway through the 3rd Act, which is ridiculous considering how much stuff the film throws at you, and how long it is. This honestly should have been a 3 hour film just so they could tell a complete story. Instead, we get sequel baited and you're just left feeling like ""Okay, I guess I gotta wait till the sequel to see how this all plays out"" and that's just unacceptable.Anyways, Alita is a pretty good character. She really does carry this film, so kudos to the VFX Department on making a CGI character seem so realistic, as well as the lead actress. If I have any issues with her it's that she's a borderline Mary Sue, like she can do anything and everything. The movie tries to play it off as if she's just an every girl, but that couldn't be further from the truth. She's literally on another level than everyone else and once this is established, trying to pretend as if she's in any real danger is kind of a joke. There's one fight that happens towards the middle of the film that kind of breaks the movie, and any sense of danger you may feel for the character. Her interactions with the world around her are good too because like the audience, she's seeing and experiencing everything for the first time. The one problem with the world is that everything is so bright and sunny that it doesn't feel like anyone's really suffering in this dystopian cyberpunk world. They tell you that everyone wants to live in the floating city in the sky because it's so terrible on the ground, but you never really see it. The streets are crowded in the day with everyone just living their lives like nothing, no suffering. The city literally contradicts the story's narrative.As far as everyone else goes, outside Christoph Waltz, they're all pretty much wasted here. Jennifer Connelly had a role that could have been compelling, but she's not given much to work with despite her goals and backstory. The Male love interest could have been any generic guy, since he doesn't really bring anything to the table. Mahershala Ali feels neutered as a villain, utterly wasted. Jackie Earl Haley makes for an interesting villain, but the way his story arch goes, he might as well be generic villain number 7. Ed Skrein is probably the only other real standout as an antagonist, but that's only because of the charisma his character oozes. And that's the main issue right there, I literally just listed off 4 villains, and there are still more in the film. With this merry go round of villains, nobody gets enough screen time, so none of them really get fleshed out properly.Honestly, the longer I think about this movie, the lower the score goes so I'm just gonna quit here. The action is good, the first half is good, the special effects are great, but don't go in expecting a complete story. Alita almost single handedly will's this movie into being better than it should be, but at the same time, the audience member next to me still fell asleep, so there's that. The 3D was great at the start, but as the movie went on, it kinda just got less and less until it faded out. If nothing else, you should have a good time with the special effects and the action scenes, but just remember, it's almost 2 and a half hours long, so be prepared",Alita - Battle Angel

660,octagonproplex,SO WHAT'S THE WRENCH IN THE MACHINE?,9,18 February 2019,"Okay, now pay attention and I will tell you (without spoilers) exactly what is wrong with ""Alita: Battle Angle"". It's not the dialogue, because that was fine. It's not the love story either, because I'm a sap anyway so I relate to Alita being one also. The two hour and change run time was a breeze, so that's not its issue either. No, if you want to know what precisely is my problem with the film - the thing that prevents me from recommending this movie whole heartedly to everyone. Well, I'll tell you. Here it is: what's wrong with ""Alita: Battle Angle"" is nothing. That's right - not one single thing. It's very good. I give it a solid 8.5 out of 10.Don't look to my review if you need a plot synopsis or cast and character rundown - I'm writing this on IMDB which means that info is readily availible without me regurgitating it.Now before you ask why not a 10/10 rating if there's nothing wrong with it, understand - an 8.5 means it's incredibly deft and proficient. a rating of 9/10 would make this a masterpiece in my book. And masterpiece status can't begin to be fairly assessed until after some time. Understand, I give 10/10 to something that resonates in the core of my soul after a decade of reflection. That top rating is reserved for art so deep and moving that it fundamentally transforms your perspective in a profound existential way that can never be shaken off. Therefore 9/10 is about as high as a movie of this subject and genre could possibly hope to achieve from me. And 8.5 means it made all the right moves. But no, it's not ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Apocalypse Now""!So why the half point shaved off then? Well, I suppose to save that half point as something for the sequel to aspire for. Or maybe because the movie isn't an hour longer to more fully flesh out the supporting character motivations. But really - I'm well indoctrinated with how stories work, so I can infer more backstory from what's already there by cross-referencing its classically familiar form. I think there's very little to be gleaned from inefficiently bloating the run time to unnecessarily justify itself by stopping the momentum to guide the audience through autonomous scenes of slow growing aquantances and acclimations. The entire benefit to utilizing classical archetypes is so the audience can quick reference the equivalent by assumed association, without holding their hand and patronizingly spelling out the reason for every little minute nuance. The entire anthropological history of mankind is a broken record on repeat, so it's no cheat to play the tune we all dance to. To gripe about that is to gloss over the engrossment and completely miss the point. Stories are a reflection, and classical stories are infinity mirrors - the deeper you go the more you notice the pattern remains the same. Movies such as Avatar and Alita play upon that foundation and give enough to fuel the journey without needing to stop to define what an audience should already subliminally comprehend.Alita is our subjective surrogate through the narrative, therefore we don't need to understand much more than she herself does. We get to share her wonder and naivete, her infatuation and heartbreak, her indignation and resolve. That's the meat and potatos, and it's all laid out for pleasurable consumption on a nice shiny dish with the properly sharpened utensils. I don't need the ingredients explained to me - it went in warm, taste just fine, and slid out smooth. Maybe it wasn't exactly all derived from the freshest organic grocery, but I'm satisfied.As for me - being thoroughly steeped in narrative language - I sort of appreciate that the film trust that we can connect the dots without needing to watch every line being drawn. Therefore I'm content with its entire tenure as well as how it ended. But I guess the one thing that could have helped some of this film's needy nitpickers feel more satiated would have been an additional 10 minutes or so just to more profoundly seed how vital and vicious the sport of motorball is in encompassing the aspirations of its competitors and the surrogate hopes of their fellow subjugated spectators for the fulfilled class ascension to the nearly mystical iconic city of Zalem (literally that seemingly unattainable iconic haven in the sky which oppressively casts its looming shadow upon our story set within the dingy bottom dwellers of Iron City). I would bet a scene was shot with Jay Courtney's major leaguer, were he converse with the curious Alita about just how real the stakes are, and maybe instills some advise and warning. Really build up her climatic entrance into the grand arena with more breathy anticipation and nervousness, so that when (*MILD SPOILERY*) she does the unexpected spoiler thing - it would register her priorities even stronger and lend to a more enthralling resolution (*END*). Also, I suppose some additional scenes to further establishing the reveries, revelries, rivalries, rapport, and repartee between characters could have helped more firmly cement relationship dynamics. I wonder if such threading does actually exist, but got excised because of the already lengthy running time? Personally, I had no problem inferring from the breazy pacing, because it's playing upon those classical tropes we should all have a shorthand with. But I can understand how the naysaying novices might perceive that briskness more like a sampler tray rather than a four course meal. Nevertheless, I think this movie is quite wonderful. If an extended bluray edit happens to appear someday to put even more meat on its bones - then I welcome that as well. The film as it is has a comfortable pacing that doesn't lag, and does a fine job of establishing the world and characters just enough to coherently orient the viewer while leaving deeper questions availible for future examination.I'm really impressed with how well director Robert Rodriguez was able to tone down his usual fantastically flippant frivolity on frugal finances, and ably adapting his acumen to commission achievement of writer/producer James Cameron's pattented plausible world building, controlled geographic clarity and nuanced detail with gorgeously exorbitant refinement. I think it's easily the best thing Rodriguez has done - probably because he did less of it himself - and instead finally decided to mature into the lesson that professional film directing is judiciously delegating a vision to departments more expertly capable to each specific task. Music composer Tom Holkenborg (aka Junkie XL) continues to prove he's a legitimate top tier talent, with some evocative character motifs (even if one of them does closely resemble Nino Rota's classic ""Romeo and Juliet"" love theme, albeit with a different orchestrational complexion intentioned more toward the intimate wonder of discovery and empowering developement rather than the wistful romanticism of Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 Shakespearean tragedy). Along with some quite gorgeous and even delicate signatures and swells, Holkenborg's musical prowess most emphatically impresses in a rousing rollicking adrenalized tour de force movement to equal the visual realization of the climatic future sport motorball competition sequence (basically ""Death Race"" meets ""Rollerball"") - which it should be noted is merely an opening act preliminary league tryout to a much grander pro main event level that we'd presumedly see fully explored in the proposed Alita sequel. The set and costume designs all feel authentic to this uniquely distopian cyberpunk Central/South American ""Iron City"" (a retconned Panama). ""Matrix"" Cinematographer Bill Pope provides naturalistic beauty for the lit photography, and Weta digital piggybacks on his work to render a new high water mark in vfx for their work on the fully virtual humanoid titular character as well as seemless integration of computer generated imagery with live action. This adaptation of the well loved Japanese graphic manga accomplished precisely what it set out to: It kept my glad attention, sure-handedly ushered my entry into their skillfully crafted foreign future by acutely utilizing archetipical touchstones, and left enough open to anticipate for potential further expansion.Nothing wrong with that. Bring on the sequel!",Alita - Battle Angel
661,tronba,One of the best manga adaptations to date.,9,16 February 2019,"I had low expectations going into this movie. The main character is CGI and manga background had me worried. I love manga and anime, but the movies with that background have mostly just been okay until now.It is a great movie. Rosa Salazar's Alita feels real, and the world is stunning both in its beauty and visceral horror. The movie looked great in 3D.The only caveat i have is how the end kind of hits a barrier. This far but no futher. It's clear that they wanted the possibility to make more movies about Alita. Something that i wholeheartedly hope they will do.",Alita - Battle Angel
662,imperator-ming,Opportunity wasted,3,24 March 2019,"Apart from the scriptwriter, everyone really tried their best to turn this into a half decent scifi action flick, but they didn't stand a chance.

663,pthef,Good movie!,8,15 February 2019,"Went to see this movie earlier this evening. Parts of it reminded me of the dystopian classic ""Rollerball,"" but with really good special effects. The big-eyed anime worked to give this movie flavor. I genuinely enjoyed this, a classic good-vs.-evil dystopian sci-fi with the door left wide-open for a sequel that I'll be certain to watch. Rodriguez did a great job of this one, but I expected no less of him. Was fun seeing Christoph Waltz (who was soooo evil in ""Inglorious Basterds"") as a benevolent and loving figure. It's worth the time to go see it, through and through.PH",Alita - Battle Angel
664,p-26680,"Abysmal Plot, Dialogue, Direction",4,9 July 2019,"It's unfortunate but Besson's only film I have truly enjoyed was 5th Element. He was seemingly able to tie most of the elements of picture making together in 5th Element. But for some reason he has been unable to achieve the same since in his English film makings.ESL
One thing which stands out in his English speaking films is his lack of comprehension of basic language interaction skills between characters. I believe his principal language (French) and its grammatical syntax prevents him from making essential dialogue appear anything les than contrived. And the same could be said for an English (or any other language) speaker attempting to accomplish the sitter nuances of the French language. It's very difficult for an individual who's principal language isn't the language used in the film. If the director truly misses the nuances of English communication he or she will have difficulty hitting the mark.The Kursk suffered from the same story telling fatigue. The dialogue just doesn't always click - missing the emotional aspect from script to actor to director to scene. It's lost somewhere in translation and becomes contrived.Alita is more of the same. The voicing, tone, pitch, pacing of the entire cast is mindful of a dubbed movie; awkward and unconvincing.Visually stellar, although familiar, Besson does paint the sets with very similar style which also becomes somewhat tiring in his sci-fi films.",Alita - Battle Angel
665,axeman_z,Part of a good movie,6,9 March 2019,"If you want to see a visual spectacle of a movie this is it. It is filled with action, wonder, and a story that was merely okay but was so close to being fantastic. I am not even talking about if it followed the source material closely because they obviously did their homework. But man, the story just fall apart halfway through the movie. It was building, you were learning about the world, starting to like all the additional characters and her character development, and then it just slowly starts to fall to pieces. I think this movie is definitely a movie specifically made for the general audience and not a person who watches anime or read manga regularly (again, no beef with how they interpreted the book), it is just how they told their interpretation of the story that was simply nonsensical. The movie would have been just fine if after she learned about who and what she really was and just jumped directly to the end, that is how weak the last half of the movie was. If you are in it for the visual spectacle and don't really care about the movie then go check it out, your eyes will thank you for the treat. Your brain however might start doing backflips and start reciting mathematical formulas.",Alita - Battle Angel

Not only that, but the cliches used are so staid that the very instant the Dr refuses to attach Alita to her ""magic"" new body you already know that she is going to shortly be ""killed"" then brought back, then get the new body, then conquer the person who beat her before...yawn.Still, this does seem to be a kids movie (which I didn't realise before starting it) so I guess I should cut it some slack for being well executed and entertaining enough to sit through despite the rubbish plot and multitudinous cliches.",Alita - Battle Angel

Alita has a strong warrior build but yet she has emotion and compassion unlike Captain Marvel. The CGI and VFX are extremely well done. The movie storyline itself was very compelling and something you wont see in movie storytelling often. The musical score at parts by Junkie XL reminds of the Tron legacy score and is very good to listen too during some of these movie scenes. Ending sets up a sequel which I WILL DEFINITELY see!!!Pros: Great actors!
Amazing cgi and score!

The characters are fun and likable. Visuals are stunning.. and a nice blend of detail and style with hints and nods to various films like Akira, Matrix, and I forget the others right now.
This film has heart. That's the main thing. It could always have more, but for an action film it has a healthy dose of emotional connection and fun and humour.

I watched this movie with my wife and a couple friends and while the consensus was mixed everyone enjoyed it. While I think different ages will enjoy it for different reasons, I think anyone can find something to like about it.The technology of the cyborgs is pretty fantastic and impossible to believe, eating without pooping, no need for breathing, human brains that are far far far more durable than realty. This unbelievable nuance helps the silliness and the fun. The over the top cliches and corny dialogue make for lots of laughs (albeit unintentional). The CGI is top notch, its certainly not low budget.I went into it expecting something like Pacific Rim 2 (which has very similar silliness and dialog), and it delivered the laughs and entertainment I had hoped for.",Alita - Battle Angel

Respect to the digi-wizards; her eyes/emotion combination: that's a new standard!Her version of Alita, makes me forget all the little discrapencies in the story. A story which is very familiar, just like Avatar and Titanic, but memorable because of the performances.Rodriguez has a different approach to the material than Cameron. Rodriguez works with what he has and Cameron invents a new filmlanguage. Some hardcore fans wanted Camerons version/vision. I am one of them. But look on the bright side; at least there is a movie now. We waited 19 years for this. (Comic fans even longer) Rodriguez is the next best thing, in terms of an own vision.

688,deepak-zeest,Another pet dream project of a Hollywood veteran - awesome action and fight sequences!,9,13 February 2019,"The movie which is based on the Manga series Gunnm or Batlle Angel Alita seems like another pet dream project of a Hollywood veteran (Cameron). Although it has been directed by Robert Rodriguez, the movie's style and the dreamlike world which has been created, is reminiscent of other recent Hollywood fixtures such as Ready Player One by Spielberg, or Tomorrowland by Brad Bird or Cameron's own Avatar.The story of a cyborg who turns out to be the chosen one may not seem too original, but the execution of the movie and the final product is pretty mind-boggling. Alita (Rosa Salazar) shines as the quintessential cyborg who is struggling with her own identity and where she fits in this human-robot world. Her grit and drive for what's right carries the movie entirely.The visually stunning graphics, along with extremely exhilarating action sequences makes for a great watch. The story which seems pretty straightforward, is still streamlined and does not interfere much with the watching experience and bog down the viewers.Christoph Waltz delivers yet another endearing role, along with Keean Johnson who makes for a pretty charming love interest.The major concern for the movie is that there is no intimidating villain as such who seems a great challenge to the protagonist. Grewishka is just a big junk of trash for a villain, Vector is just a tool, and Nova along with all his mystery still does not seem to be a villain to look forward to. Add to that, the awkward sword-raising ending where things are left incomplete and open for Nova the antagonist, it is pretty evident that another instalment of the movie is due. This disqualifies the movie as a good standalone watch.Watch this movie for its awesome action and fight sequences dipped in beautiful CGI. Waiting for the next part.",Alita - Battle Angel

691,terrsgc,"Excellent movie, way better than I expected.",9,17 February 2019,"I saw the trailer for this movie and thought, ""That might be good."" But, the trailer didn't truly ""grab"" me. I debated whether to bother, and the deciding factor was I'd built up a lot of free movies in my movie club, and this was the only thing that even slightly interested me for the last couple weeks. I went in expecting an okay movie relying a lot on effects and with some ""relatable"" theme based on current issues without any real understanding of them. Instead, I got what might well be one of the stand-out movies of the year for me. It was exciting and kept moving, and it did what it was supposed to do. It entertained me. It probably won't win any Oscars, but I would think it won't be a box-office flop.The movie is set in some distant future with an entirely fictional history that doesn't try to preach to us about the mistakes we are making today. The issues of this future time are nonetheless easily relatable, and I found no difficulty at caring about them. The main characters, especially Alita herself, had surprising depth, and I had no difficulty identifying with them. I found this especially surprising given the source material was manga comics. Some of the villains were somewhat cartoonish, but that seemed to only enhance the movie-going experience. Yet, at least one of them had quite a bit of depth to her. It was very satisfying to watch the overly evil ones get their comeuppance, while the more relateable villain was reasonably intriguing. They kept the true ""big bad"" relatively hidden and mysterious through most of the movie, and left Alita mostly dealing with his puppet minions, but he managed to connect into the movie here and there, tempting you to come see the sequel to see what he is really about. I sure hope there's a sequel. I won't be debating whether to bother seeing it.",Alita - Battle Angel

What surprised me (before I knew who the director and producer were) was that the film actually flowed really well and had a great story with lots of heart and some very emotional scenes.That said, there were a few things that bugged me about the film-namely, some awkward/cheesy scenes in a few places that didn't quite match up to the rest of the film, Nova's character design (Ed Norton looks really bad with that hair and outfit, though I'm told that it's very true to the source material), and the other big-eyed characters aside from Alita all look extremely cartoonish and unrealistic (luckily these background characters only ever show up in very brief flashbacks).But the rest of the film is such an entertaining and enthralling experience that the few flaws are very easy to overlook.",Alita - Battle Angel

The story isn't anything new, typical story for a hero and protagonist but it definitely plays well with the source material. The acting is good, the action is good, the pacing is good. I did not have an issue with the pacing and that's a good sign for a 2 hour film. The action was always a great set piece and addition to the story, especially development for Alita, which shows her strength as the protagonist. I enjoyed the acting, it was good in general. The thing to watch out for in Alita is definitely the world it created, the action and the usual hero story. I give it a big 8 out of 10. Definitely looking forward to a sequel!

696,whocares-96237,10 minutes in and ...,3,24 February 2019,"Really wanted to get a ""feel"" of what others are thinking so I decided to read some reviews...instantly I noticed the nearly 100% amazing reviews in the default sort order.
I started searching by 1, 2, 3 stars in that order, then sorted by newest and wow, what a different picture that painted...why suppress bad review, so much for honesty!My impression wasn't that it was so much like Avitar (although its close) for me it was more like watching something like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, where the animation or in this case CGI is really fake looking!
Mind you in Avitar they were all real or all CGI at the same time, depending on where they were in the movie, in Alita like WFRR it was intermixed and really sort of fake and awkward all the time.The contrast is always present and visible, and cannot be escaped, which does not allow the viewer to forget that this character isn't really there. Add to that the fact the voice didnt seem to fit either. They so easily could have worked out a real person with some sort of special effect that would have in essence identified the character as a cyborg.To me its a shame they wasted this effort when they had a great opportunity for a potentially interesting movie.Ultimately what is worse than the movie for me, is how the stellar reviews on this site are most prevalent, and the sub-par reviews seem to be buried...its a bit obnoxious at best.",Alita - Battle Angel
697,Rach_rates,Pretty good,10,10 April 2021,"This movie was all action, which was great to watch. Cyborg warrior dystopian type of movie, got me hooked. I would watch a part two! I love seeing familiar faces in this movie. Great job!",Alita - Battle Angel
698,arskhemnanilack,Alita: Battle Angel - 7.3/10,7,31 March 2019,"The movie provides solid CGI, insanely stunning views and environments that truly feel alive which also awffectuvely plays part in this movie. Theres not quite much good to say about this film after that however. It provides a relationship, features and attempts to implement it strongly into the story but it doesnt work whatsoever. The relationship between the two felt fake and very useless, this would not have been such a big deal if the movie had not tried to implement and make it so important constantly. The relationship doesnt allow this movie to show it's true potential, the incredible journey of a girl who thought she would never come back to life and when did, went through alot. Many characters are barely developed and dont quite ever feel important. The movie feels hectic because theres too much going on, scene after scene bad it doesnt make much sense. If you're going for action, you would have an incredible time because it effectively provides powerful and stunning action scenes.",Alita - Battle Angel
699,mind-wax,Unsuccessful CGI botches otherwise good story,6,1 March 2019,The greenscreen usage showing its seams too frequently in this film and the unfortunate unbalanced uncanny valley effect of the main character Alita seriously distracts for an otherwise well told story and well directed film. The anime basis should have been more deeply embraced with more stylistically cartoonish CGI as seen in other modern animated movies released this year (ie Into the Spider Verse) or abandoned for more seamless hyper realism (ie Elysium). I do still look forward to more Rodriguez big release movies though..,Alita - Battle Angel
700,iamdk369,Unusual movie with a usual storyline.,7,14 January 2020,"The story line was a usual cliche like The Iron giant or a more recent one, like that of Real Steel. The visuals were not that pleasing apart from Alita but then, her character was not enough to go along with the reality around, the texture could have had more precise.
Movie was not boring, and was enjoyable even for story line didn't create curiosity even though there were attempts to create it.",Alita - Battle Angel
701,AmigaWolf,Alita Battel Angel is the True Female Hero that's a role model for girls,9,8 March 2019,"What a great movie, with a strong women in the lead role, that is not political correct, she Alita is great, good dialog and acting, and seeing her be this great person that does not judge people but helps them when they are in need, the story is good and not told many times in this kind of way.I love the daughter father relationship, i love the way she reacts to everything if it's the first time she seen or touch or smelt or taste anything, i just love her reaction to everything.And wow, the fight scenes are one of the best, Really well done, they really thought hard about that, and the special FX are also fantastic, also really good, sometimes mind blowing, i LOVE that they followed the original Manga version, and that they changed Alita face like in the Manga, with big eyes and so, also because James Cameron loves the Manga, and put more Manga stuff in it because of that, you can see that James Cameron has a hand in this movie, even if he did not direct it.If you love the Manga version or just Manga, or love a good Sci-Fi movie, then go and see it, you gone love this movie, also because there is no political nonsense in it.",Alita - Battle Angel
702,Neucosa,Entertaining battle sequences and setting with bad writing and plot,4,24 August 2019,"The story portrayed in the movie doesn't make much sense.
The science doesn't make much sense.
The characters never develop.
There's quite a few superlative adjectives describing each other's characters.
So there's that - not very interesting at all if you take the fight sequences away.The fight sequences are somewhat entertaining and that's the bulk of why I gave it 4 stars. If you just want to watch it for some pseudo futuristic dystopian set battles between cyborgs, then have at it.If you want something more substantive, stay away.",Alita - Battle Angel
703,Dimakovtun,Outstanding,10,9 May 2020,"I am a rare movie-goer. Mostly it happens when there is a good company to join, but otherwise, I have no troubles waiting for a year. Also, I've never heard about Alita anime/manga. BUT. I like sci-fy, and screw me, if James Cameron is not an Elon Musk of cinema industry. He invests into movies that he considers worthy, even if it means years of preparations, going over the budget and cutting the edge of technology.
Alita is a brilliant example where a weird story of Japanese manga meets the Hollywood to show a graphic style never seen before in action-movie.
YES, Alita has large eyes. YES, it's intentional. NO, she's no human, and doesn't pretend to be. So throw in dumpster all the ""uncanny valley"" arguments. They could literally plug a real actress to make android look like 100% human instead of making extra effort to do otherwise.It's a world humans that have little left of humanity, and an android that was built after humans long before the apocalypse.The story is pretty much the same as in the Anime movie, but actually IMHO better (especially with Professor's role, IMO). There is little to complain in terms of adoption quality.It's the only movie in my life I've gone twice to the cinema.
Would like to see the sequel, but that's unlikely due to the moderate box office.",Alita - Battle Angel

I've been waiting for Alita to hit theaters since the first trailer came out last year, and it didn't disappoint: she is simply adorable, and to accomplish something like this with a CGI character is an incredible feat on its own. But on top of that there's a good story, some of the best action scenes I've ever seen, and what's also great is that it feels like an actual movie, as opposed to a bunch of action scenes stitched together.
I'm not giving out any spoilers but I'll say this, Alita is now one of my favorite heroes of all time, it got me excited and with misty eyes throughout the entire flick and I left the theater with a smile on my face, can't wait for part 2! So, I'd have to say that it's as good as it gets.",Alita - Battle Angel

707,foxcool,"One of the greatest manga, cyberpunk, action movies yet.",10,9 February 2019,"Edit.
I went to watch it a second time and got an epiphany during the martial art practice scene; the grace and strength of her movement is a celebration of the human body and our ingenuity of pushing the limit that is our form.Her body maybe entirely machine but her story explores innocence, growth, curiosity, love, determination and will; which celebrates our humanity. It shows us we're more than just flesh and blood. Brought a tear to my eyes.This movie is so beautiful.//original review
The story is engaging but the true masterpiece is the action and screen play, Alita's action scene got so much attitude that it screams ""badass"" as loud as a Tarantino movie.The way wingchun is incorporated into the character is just genius, where other movies hide their flaws in cheap cuts and wonky cameras, you can see every move in crystal clarity.I've enjoyed everything about this movie and can't wait for a sequel, you probably will too, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!",Alita - Battle Angel
708,nick-kelly-104-817149,"Great CGI, not so great movie",7,6 April 2020,"I'm a bit divided on this film, the world-building, special effects and CGI are really well done, but the story is all over the place, disjointed, illogical, daft in places, and ultimately empty and pointless.There is no real story arc and characters are not very well established or developed during the film, things just happen seemingly for the sake of it, certain plot points conflict with eachother and others make no sense, its like half the story has been chopped out and you have to (easily) fill in the blanks or just go with the flow and disengage your brain to all the contrived plot points, and certain conflicts in the writing and script that don't follow on from eachother. It seems to have been made to achieve various special effects with a plot shoe-horned together afterwards. The romance doesn't really work and is just another cliched plot device, I think the movie would have been stronger without it.All in all its an entertaining film, especially in 4K/on a large screen. The CGI and special effects are extremely well done, and the battles are engaging and worth watching. The sound and music are OK they're really just in the background and don't catch your attention apart from some weighty sound effects during the battles which add to the atmosphere.There are much better sci-fi films than this, its a shame as there is so much premise in the concept, I think if the story had been stronger or better developed it could have been so much better. It seems to have been chopped up and dumbed down too much for a sci-fi film for my liking.",Alita - Battle Angel

The main character was believable. Her love interest was not a complete idiot, unlike so much of main stream media today; a bit misguided maybe, but not a complete nimrod.

A regular TV will never do this justice.. watching it in IMAX was absolutely insane! I was sucked into the screen, feeling joy for the world and characters. Sure, some critics might not like the fact that it builds up to a sequel.. but I know why they did it, because this world needs to be explored to understand it all, it needs time. What I dislike more than a movie building up for sequels, is movies ending too soon without ever getting to properly see the universe and the lore that it has been building up, only to suddenly come to an end. That is why I forget most movies just a few months after watching them.. because there is no real substance, most movies never get the chance to fly, and are shortened down to 1,5 or 2 hours instead of the 3 hour mark it could have been. Since they did shorten this to 2 hours, I sure hope we get sequels to tell us more, not having to guess would be fine, thanks.. We still know so little about her past, and what will happen next..",Alita - Battle Angel
717,Gagarr,Truly enjoyable,9,29 March 2019,"I just saw it for the second time before it leaves the theaters as this is a movie that plays great with the big screen. There are too many compliments I could give this film so I will highlight the best. 1. Story is compelling without overdramatizing, as the characters are natural. 2. The technopunkish civilization with a bit of steam is quite strong, but doesn't consume the narrative. 3. Acting is first rate, with a shout out to Idara Victor who spoke volumes in a facial expression.Alita sequel is second only to the coming Avatar sequels on my MUST SEE list.I hope they take their time and do them right.",Alita - Battle Angel

An absolutely superb film.I live for these magical creations. Such a marvellous time we live in that these films can be made in all their splendour.The cast was truly excellent and played their roles with the exact amount of sincerity required to suspend belief and yet not steal the limelight.Side note: Too many Metacrtics make their living from writing disparaging and contentious reviews, and too many for my liking gave this a poor and wholly undeserving rap. I'd love to see them try and create something so ambitious, to write a storyline, script, screenplay and bring it all together. Zero chance, they ain't that good. They make their living from manufacturing complaints.This film created a welcome world where the imagination runs free and the magic of life reveals itself...a masterpiece in my view.

720,Waiyan-1999,Already cult classic but with some mistakes,8,16 February 2019,"The biggest let-down from this Robert Rodriguez/ James Cameron latest film is set-up for sequel because it wasn't done right and by the end I don't feel satisfied. The film is full with some cliché and typical block-buster stereotype moments, dialogue deliver from some characters made them sound a bit cheesy (notable from Hugo, Alita love-interest)
Plot is a bit convoluted for me, after the film I had to look up to Wikipedia to fully under the whole thing but all these negative things can't bother me enough to not enjoy the filmCGI effect are stunning and worthy of it's nearly 200 millions budget, along side with Star Wars Episode 9 and Avenger: Endgame this is high contender for next year Virtual Effect Oscar.
Initially I am uncomfortable with Alita eyes in trailer but it turned out to be pretty fine. Fight scenes and battle sequences are awesome enough but imo it can still be more entertaining than thisThe cast is pretty solid, Rosa Salazar as Alita is definitely standout. She got fueled by star supporting performers like Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly (can't believe this woman is nearly 50, she is so hot!), Mahershala Ali (if they are gonna do Black Panther 2 should have casted this man) but both Connelly and Ali characters felt too wasted in the story and Edward Norton appeared for like 4 or 5 seconds, it is good to see that he is back in businessIt's a thing with cyberpunk movies I supposed, got mixed reaction from critics, bombed at box-office and become a cult film then Alita is definitely one of them and once again we gotta respected Rodriguez/ Cameron for their heart and passion behind this project",Alita - Battle Angel
721,alextalent,Highly recommended despite Hollywood adding their clichés and tropes.,8,19 February 2019,"Great actors, legendary backing producers, decent source material and the budget most movies can only dream of.Does Alita fullfil it's potential? No. The actors arnt given a script deserving of their talents, it's a very stereotypical script. The source material is used well but could have had less of the Hollywood pacing and design, the special effects was probably the best I've ever seen ... Yet Alita had a weird mouth which was slightly out of sync with the rest of her face and the racing scenes were unanimously a waste of money - you could have cut them out of the movie and my rating of the movie wouldnt have changed.All the flaws of this film are so obviously Hollywood's fault that it's hard to reduce my rating of it, at the end of the day no other movie has pulled off a live action adaptation of an Anime before. And if you consider that then a rating of 8/10 is very reasonable.If Hollywood could allow themselves to stop with the awful forced romances, surprise bad guys who are not that surprising , doubting the hero's intentions for a bit, doubting the hero's friends intentions for a bit, moral objection scene, hero losing everything scene, hero winning everything scene, hero surprising everyone by kicking ass scene, hero giving a badass speech in a situation that wouldn't ever happen scene etc etc then we might actually have a 10/10 movie.",Alita - Battle Angel

All I can say please don't ruin the sequel.I highly recommend this movie any rating less than 8 is pure hate, did I just rhyme. Am I a poet and didn't even know it.

All characters are so two-dimensional. No depth whatsoever!
And why was the face of Alita looking like some animation from the first Toy Story?
Sure, the fighting and action was great CGI, but that didn't help at all. If you can't tell a good story then special effects are nothing but fluff.

I somehow managed not to see anything related to the movie other than a very short teaser more than a year ago. So I went in to see this with no expectations other than knowing Robert Rodriguez and James Cameron with behind it.The movie does a fantastic job of world building. We see the world through Alita's eyes, discovering it as she does. (Her character has amnesia.) Note to Rian Johnson: This is how you subvert expectations. Despite her amnesia (or perhaps because of it) Alita has an enthusiastic desire to see and learn everything with no sense of distrust or fear. More naive than innocent. In some ways,The story of this movie is more of an origin story, setting up Alita's character and world-building than telling an epic tail. In some ways, it's what the Phantom Menace wanted to be (but of course the Phantom Menace failed). Take these random characters and throw them together with someone who will change their lives and maybe one day the world.Alita's doesn't try to be a badass. She just is one because of the strength of her convictions and desire to do the right thing. It's awe-inspiring as she grows in her abilities and determination (a growth we actually get to see, unlike a certain Anakin Skywalker). There are a couple moments in the movie where the entire theater applauds her actions.It's not a perfect movie, but it's a great movie. I wish we had more movies like this. The only real flaw of the movie is that we don't yet know if it's going to have a sequel. It certainly deserves one.",Alita - Battle Angel

731,LinaInverse23,"A wonderful film, although not thought-provoking.",8,10 April 2019,"Alita is a wonderful film full of vibrant colors and gorgeous scenery; the world Rodriguez created here is a marvel. Those who have seen the anime the film is based on will no doubt be disappointed as the critical thinking and ethical questions are now gone.
The film has been dumbed down so that all audiences may now enjoy it. This is both a curse and a blessing- the film benefits from the fast pace and action driven story, and falls short of greatness as it lacks some character development. The issue is Alita was developed fairly well, as the audience can connect and feel emotions for this girl, even though she is not entirely human. The other characters, unfortunately, do not get the same treatment. Since there is no emotional investment in the other characters, the audience does not care who lives or dies; even though the film is wonderful, it is not truly magnificent due to these reasons. Go see it for a fun night out, just don't expect something like the anime.",Alita - Battle Angel

735,unrealmuscat,Underrated movie,9,3 May 2019,This is better than the majority of Steven Spielberg movies. Similar to Spielberg production but more for ado/adult audience than children. No nudity scenes but a lot of gore like most of the Robert Rodriguez/Cameron's action movies. The scenario is new enough to give it a high rating and praise it. I don't really understand the low rating. Maybe many viewers just don't like a movie with a ending that is not really an end. I think it is just great how this first chapter ends even if it is not really logical. We don't know the full story so for now we can't argument on that..So in short ... an underrated movie everyone should see. Nice blended 3D animated characters with real life characters. One of the most advanced in that genre today. Very impressive.,Alita - Battle Angel

Not that it was bad, don't get me wrong, it just seemed a bit rushed in the beginning.

The movie was action-packed, had good acting, and a nice plot. The action was second to none! Intense fight sequences and special effects.

Unfortunately, this doesn't speak to well of the source material. The Japanese often comes up with interesting ideas and ask philosophical questions that makes the viewer at least a bit smarter after watching. Not so in this case. A lot of interesting subjects could have been explored here, but instead we got this banal and sentimental love story and generally a film that feels like a foreword to the real story.I really hope the sequels start owning up to the potential hidden here, but I doubt it.

741,magnusmax,Alita: Battle Angel Review,8,26 February 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel. First, interest in the film seemed non-existant. Then the release date drew nearer, some reactions appeared, and ""Alita's"" hope for an appreciative reception surged... only to result in a fairly lacklustre opening weekend in the United States. Thankfully, Alita's chances for a sequel are being multiplied in China, where she's off to a Twentieth-Century Fox record start. Unlike some other despicable cinematic universe-building introductions which I'll spare us all the pain of recalling to memory, ""Alita""'s material-rich base supports a franchise - and deserves one, too. Alita herself is a charismatic, unique character whose presence certainly does loads to ensure the movie's success. In our contagious enthusiasm for the passionate lead and her cause, we find ample room in our hearts to negate any other blunders for which the critics sadly have denounced it four times out of ten. (on Rotten Tomatoes) The high level of positive audience feedback - on Rotten Tomatoes currently 94% and IMDb 7.6 - signals a far fonder reception among more plebeian markets! I encourage anyone who loves a good action movie to give of their time and money (in IMAX, preferably), so the team responsible for ""Alita"" has a chance at producing a follow-up, for which so many are now clamouring, and for which you will too.I want to dial in for a closer look. Let's begin with Alita. Notwithstanding WETA's unprecedented visual effects work on Alita, which give the bizzare and fantastical a face and manage to anchor it credibly in an alternate realism, such that we accept her without qualm or disbelief, the heartfelt performance from Rosa Salazar makes the movie what it is meant to be, dispelling any doubt we may have, and securing us firmly to her intentions, her path, her mission, her driving personality. And before anyone criticizes her eyes, know this: The amount of detail concentrated in a single eye surpasses all the detail contained in Gollum's whole body more than one hundred times. And the thousands of man-hours that made this movie are visible in every frame of ""Alita"". The 3D I witnessed it in made it all the more engaging a spectacle. But back to Alita herself. As a character, she displays many different emotions - all sincere and truthful at the time - but varied all the same. This leads to a very intriguing and dynamic personality, yet while at times also feeling contrived or a little too sudden or random. For the most part, though, Alita's motives are clear and the audience finds itself vouching for and desiring the ongoing intactness of her integrity and morals. I can't repeat enough my satisfaction with Alita's realization, being at once refreshing and exceptional. She's the reason a sequel will be made.Without a doubt, Alita outshines her associates - but she is far from the only well-fashioned character to be found in Alita: Battle Angel. Her CG-aided counterparts prove worthily appalling obstacles to our heroine, and the clashes between the two parties are the source of the high-octane action that makes this exhilaratingly lawless spectacle what it is. The quick imaginations of James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez flash through the raw, horrific designs and provide us with all the ghoulish foes we could hope for. On the human side, we have an ensemble of talent that is varied and unique. Some have criticised Keean Johnson's Hugo as ""the weak link"". I don't totally agree, although it is true that he's unable to rival Alita's vibrancy and matchless singularity. The characters and the world they live in leave the audience intrigued and craving for more, as many specifics of the realm we are introduced to and how it functions remain mysteries - just a little shadowy and unattainable. To its credit, ""Alita"" stockpiles its resources and resists the urge to squander every feasible ounce of narrative worth from the source material in order to produce one unwieldy whole. (I'm looking at you, Mortal Engines) By the end, the audience is convinced it needs to know the rest of the story - it needs a sequel. (Almost) entirely satisfying in itself, ""Alita"" plants all the seeds that just beg for a follow-up. In fact, Alita's character arc relies on a second movie!""Alita"" has been very successfully adapted from a wildly alternate world and system to the one we know in the form of Yukito Kishiro's 1990s - 2000s manga series, and bizarre and unearthly as it is, after a slight adjustment, we don't question it for a moment. Instead, we have a terrific blend of the source material and something entirely new. The violence is toned down, plot elements cut out or added in, and a more human balance reached. Still, the compromise does entail darker things that we are used to, given its rating. The action does result in plenty of violence, if not at its original R level intensity. The whole movie - with some brief exceptions - is clouded by darkness and grime, adding to the well-founded feeling that crime and injustice run rampant in every crevice and down every shady alley. It's mechanical and dusty - a fitting setting for the events of the film, which grow more painful and emotionally demanding as it progresses. Like Gotham City, it often seems an environment most in its element in the middle of a storm.In closing, I'd like to make a criticism or two. The movie's run-time felt to me considerably longer due to the stop-and-start nature of the cycle of events. I coudn't help thinking it a tad repetitious. Also, the film is burdened at times by awkward lines and some clunky narrative writing. The material is fantastic, but I feel it could benefit from losing some baggage somehow - the pieces are in place, yet not entirely fusing. The end is indeterminate, with a halting series of fragmentary climaxes leading to a cliffhanging finale. This, however, is nitpicking. Complaints such as this probably explain professional critics' dismay, yet any issues the movie faces are outweighed by stark opposition in the guise of a rare, well-told teen romance, an excellent cyberpunk and manga adaption, and a superb action-packed ride. For a movie that at first glance would seem effects-obsessed, it manages quite capably to encapsulate a tale of both tremendous ""coolness"" and heart-felt sentiment. I'm pleased to report that like a growing number of films WETA has had a hand in creating, this one ensures story goes hand-in-hand with the novel medium it is told through. There's always more to say about Alita: Battle Angel - but I've said my fair share today. Generally speaking, those who see it, love it. Be one of those people!",Alita - Battle Angel

745,godzigodzigodzi,"action-packed and amazing CGI, but storyline a little bit too fast and obvious",6,12 May 2019,"I watched this movie without watching any trailers first (unless the scenes included in Swan Song music video count) so I don't have any expectations except hoping that this won't end as a cheesy romantic movieFirst off: ethereal visuals! I think there's an undeclared standard of visual effects for these types of post-apocalyptic, futuristic movies and Alita exceeds it. The combination of real life shots and CGI is really seamless. Everyone's performance is also breathtaking and the combat scenes will leave you sitting on the edge of your seat.But the story.. I was digging it until they blew their plot before even reaching the middle of the movie, making the ending quite predictable for me. It also feels a little bit too fast, and they made the ending so painfully cliffhanging and obvious that they will be making a continuing sequel of the movie.Knowing that this was based off a manga series that tends to be complicated and plot-twisty, I feel like the storyline itself has a lot of layers to be revealed in future sequels, which could make Alita its own franchise. What about the past of Dr. Ido and Dr. Chiren? The secret of Zalem? Why is there such a huge difference between Iron City and Zalem? Even Alita's past hasn't been fully explored yet. They could've slow down a little bit for this ~first~ movie.",Alita - Battle Angel

748,nathanmcdougle,Should be better than avatar but.....,7,16 February 2019,"Greed....Hollywood greed is what kept this movie from being a 10 vs a 7. Hollywood just assumes that I will watch all of the hunger games trilogy..... I did not. I watched the first one (at the theater), part of the second (on cable), and I've never seen the third.The latest avengers with the infinity gauntlet....it feels like it's almost two years have passed.....there no gaurantee I'm going to plop some cash down to see that conclusion in the theater as well.......and now to Atila....I wanted to see a movie and now what I have is half a story and I don't know when I will find out what the hell is going on. It could be one year, two years, or in the case of hunger games Never.Other than that it's a good flick u will be entertained, but you will not leave satisfiedWhat I do love about this movie as much as the action is the light exploration of sexuality from a human and androids perspective is it possible to love someone who we aren't sexually compatable with...can humans love machines and is a machine capable of love? And it's interesting to view alita as feminine when in fact her body isn't really a gender per say but this is how she views herself. I find that fascinating more than the story itself. Bicentennial man pulled that ""human"" perscpective off personally, but this is not that kind of a movie and isn't the primary focus but alas one can't help but think about it long after the credits have rolled",Alita - Battle Angel
749,sheepfood,Makaku,7,11 December 2019,"I am a huge(kinda) fan of the manga.
There are many many little things to like about this adaptation but one BIG thing to hate about it.The disappointing portrayal of Grewishka (originally called Makaku in the manga) is a deal breaker for me. Manga readers will know about this.
For people who doesn't know about the actual original character, you can read. Or search battle angel makaku got information.In the manga, the story behind him and his relationship to Alita is a heart wrenching and thought provoking one. Even after 20+ years since reading it and forgetting most of the details in the story, I can still always remembers Makaku.It's a huge disappointment that the movie portrays him as just another common villain (even the re-design of his look sucks).My score for this movie dropped from a 9(potentially) to a 7 due to this.Please go read about Makaku and I promise you'll not be disappointed.",Alita - Battle Angel

753,stopeeper,"Cool character, good CGI... and nothing else.",3,25 July 2019,"This movie had literally no plot, nothing of substance happened. And I would've been willing to overlook that, if there was at least character development. Say, nothing happens with the world today, but Joe becomes a better, stronger person. Or Jane has to overcome a life-punch thrown at her, a tragic loss. But there was nothing of the sort. Alita was a cool young girl at the beginning of the movie. She was a great fighter. And she was good-hearted, willing to put her life on the line in order to help the weak. At the end of the movie she's a cool young girl, a great fighter, and she's ready to fight the bad guys... yeah, exactly the same, with just a little vague back-story revealed during the movie. The support cast is extremely bland, you learn everything for them in the first 10-15 min of the movie.
There are some cool CGI fights. The world seems somehow interesting, but we don't learn much about it, just vague outlines. Oh, and there is a bad guy revealed at the end, for the sequel, because of course there is.",Alita - Battle Angel

I loved it.
It is STUNNING to look at.
Alita's design is gorgeous.
The characters aren't boring or cliche.
And they managed to produce a hero fable about a young girl without constantly reminding me about girl power etc.
Proving that when your characters are well developed and the script is strong enough, you don't have to resort to pandering to your producer's political vanities( which is something I can almost certainly predict about Captain Marvel. My gut tells me that movie's going to smell a lot like The Last Jedi 🙁)It's unfortunate Alita under-performed opening weekend. The film deserves bigger success.
I really hope we get an even better sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel
758,sarcasm83,Genuinely loved it,9,11 March 2019,"I'm not familiar with the character from the past and overall didn't really have an idea of what kind of a movie it will be, other than what I had seen from the few trailers I had bumped into. It wasn't even one that I was really planning to go see in the cinema at first, but boy am I glad I did.I really think the movie was paced beautifully, giving us just enough time to see the gentle side of her and moved forward just in time so the movie stayed interesting all throughout, with nothing really being overdone in my opinion. One of those movies where it didn't even feel like 2 hours went past.Some of the choreography and the scenes that showed the side of what she was in the past were INCREDIBLE. It's honestly too rare these days where I'm watching a movie and I can't but smile wide and get the shivers from how BADASS something was. At one point I even had this weird moment where I felt I'm almost tearing up about how damn awesome a scene was.
This movie had several of incredible moments. Pure joy to watch. An incredible character I absolutely couldn't help but root for all the way through.Overall just a very entertaining, great, really well made, fun flick. Definitely recommended :)I could say so much more, but prefer to keep this without spoilers, so I'll just wrap it up shortly. But so this won't seem like mindless praise, I can admit that the lovestory side didn't hook me in that much. It wasn't bad either, but if I HAD TO pick something that was a little more on the generic side, it would be that. However it's certainly not something I would've dropped from the movie. It's a great driving force for the character progression.",Alita - Battle Angel
759,estocade,"Think Avatar, but less dances with smurfs and more Romeo and Juliet",9,25 March 2019,"I loved Avatar, so that's out of the way.Everything looked real, even the unreal stuff, thanks to Rodriguez' and Cameron's unheathly obsession with detail. Great soundtrack too, almost perfectly placed.The violence... Not on the same level as manga, no fountains of blood, but, it was cleverly implemented, less gory more psychological if that makes sense. Some memorable scenes were less powerful than they were in manga, like the last scene with Alita and the boy, I expected more drama as per manga, it was a perfect opportunity to show real acting skill or lack thereof.The emotion, this is not a visceral scifi but emotional one, because... because Alita is essentially a child(who at some point breaks the character hmm they grow so fast), an here's my main criticism, I understand it was intentional to make everybody around equally ""animated"" to save Alita from the uncanny valley, and by jove she's alive! However, I can't help but feeling cheated in way, my advice is to trust the director and go where the film goes.Alita is very much into herself and with her warrior archetype kicking in things start to get kicked hard... sorry I was trying to be clever. Don't listen to me, go watch it, then decide for yourself, after all does it really matter what others think? Does it matter to me what you think? Thoughts can hurt you know.What I did was I let myself go and was on the edge of the seat the whole time, start to finish.

Everything is contained in the movie, and what differences there are (you can read them in other reviews) are easily overlooked due to the difference in medium.Stop wasting time on reviews and go see this before it leaves theaters.

The acting is pretty amazing by Rosa Salazar part, giving alita a really great personality, Christopher waltz, mahershalla Ali, and Jennifer Connolly are pretty good in the fim also, just the actor whom played Hugo, didn't convince me enough
The script is really good and tight, giving everyone a good backstory, and reasons for their actions, sometimes the exposition is kind of heavy, but it makes us understand the races and classes present in this alternate universe.

I like the comics that it is based on and we can all agree the the trailer fell deep into the uncanny valley. Now, that being said I really did like Rodriguez/Cameron's take on Alita. The transition of manga into ""real"" is jarring at first but as you get used to it you see the meticulous work that's been put into the visuals. Dare I say love, because there is a lot of stuff going on in the details here and it is good.Story-wise it's not amazing. The movie is stitched together from the vast base material and it's taking some very generous liberties at times. It's too over the top and cringe-worthy at times but that brings me to my main point. Have you read the original work and if so, how long has it been since you read it? Gunm (the manga) is decidedly silly and super over the top at best and that is a quality. It's been around for quite some time and have already inspired numerous sf-works. Rodriguez/Cameron know this and have to some extent made an adaptation for the fans. Will the fans get it? Perhaps not, but on the other hand everyone will get a lovely fest for the eyes with a not-to-bad story tied to it.Now to wait and hope for the sequel...",Alita - Battle Angel

Sadly it's dominated by an agonizingly cringeful teen love drama. No sooner does Alita step foot outside than she falls inlove with some stereotypical American jock who would be out of his depth as a bit part character in a teen soap opera. The story revolves around her saving him continually while the audience is all hoping he dies. It's bad, i've no idea what the writers were thinking, or the casting crew for that matter.

I'm even told that people should not care for a negative opinion, because obviously, if you like something, everybody should.Alita bored me from the start. There's an entire world behind this story that is not introduced in a compelling way. It seems based off elements you've seen in many franchises before, such as District 9, Elysium, and Blade Runner, but there's no heart in it, because there is no room for such a thing in a 2 hour film. Instead, the story is hopelessly predictable, every plot move is just dull, and even a very talented actor like Christoph Waltz is not allowed to be more than a cardboard father figure.The only things that save this movie are the visuals and the fighting scenes in particular. I'm a great sci-fi fan, but perhaps this is more for the aforementioned fans of the original anime.

Only few directors like Cameron could take this risk and bring this up with such a budget, and i'm gad he did.

There's massive setup here that goes on too long and its all for a fake girl that I dont care one bit about. There's no struggle or genuine emotion anywhere. I think we've all just had enough of the little girl character who beats up huge men scenario. The CGI just doesnt work wither. The eyes aren't right no matter how much CGI budget you have. Would have better to go with something really different or robotic or just use a real person 100 percent. I also prefer that basic physics be followed when everything else is suppose to be accurate within the story's world too. She can't kick the arm off of some massive robot that probably weighs as much as a truck. She's 100lbs... doesnt matter how strong her little kick is, its not going to do anything to the guy, ever.

780,dalcazar-1,"Made by a fan, for fans.",10,6 March 2019,"Disclaimer: My first exposure to Alita was with the anime many many years ago. I saw the Anime first and own almost the entire Manga series. The character of Alita has always commanded respect because of her determination and fairness. Nothing has been lost in translation, I'm a huge fan of this movie.I was afraid this movie would suck, they had every chance to ruin it like they've ruined almost every other anime adaptation... But it was glorious. They did amazing fan service by keeping almost the entirety of the story true to the original, with minor tweaks. If you know the source material, there are characters from the manga hidden just out of focus which are recognizable. They did take some creative license, but I think the changes they made actually benefit the storytelling and give the movie something new for everyone. I won't comment further on the story because I don't think I need to. The storytelling is extremely well done. They show instead of tell and feed you just enough backstory to tantalize you and want more, but they don't overwhelm you with info you can't digest.The character of Alita is jaw-dropping. They did an amazing job of bringing her to life, using every shot of her to show a small nuanced human expression, even if it's a sniffle in a gratuitous shot. Rosa Salazar, while not seen directly on-screen, did a great job of adding even more life to the character with her voice acting. You can tell she's not real, and they could improve a few aspects of the CGI, but the spell is never broken and no one really seems to care.The casting is great, not only because the talent of actors that they got, they're also the best possible match to the manga characters when it comes to looks. Waltz is excellent good as doc Ido and Mehershala Ali as Vector is spot on. Even the secondary characters add to this film. Toji is great. His disdain for Alita is palpable in every scene, and yet the delivery is always funny.Last but not least, it's refreshing to watch a movie that allows me to be transported to another world again. The 26th Century Fox logo takes you there right from the opening, and the spell never breaks until the end. Unlike so many movies nowdays that feel the need to bring up current social commentary and ruin the immersion. Hollywood needs to learn from this.",Alita - Battle Angel
781,skeecats,A great release around international womens day.,7,8 March 2019,"Yes she is a cyborg, but she has a very human brain.From the get go the main star is easily the best part of the story, she displays the best parts about feminimity: She is equaly vunreable and equaly as determined, adventourous and brave.She is the kind of character you could easily see being your friend. I could go on and on about how well the actress portrayed this character.The rest of the story is rather a generic action-sci-fi. It does not bother itself with being like similar movies which have a dark or sad undertone. This movie, because of the main actress maintains a very open-hearted optimism and positivity that shines from the main character.Because of the actress i would say it is an above avarage actiom flick, not quite enough to make it a classic but enjoyable popcorn movie nontheless. -7/",Alita - Battle Angel
782,WakeyBakey,"The whole movie is a ""I'm 14 and this is deep""-meme",5,30 June 2019,"As a 30 year old guy, who doesn't know the source material, I was clearly not the target audience.Why on Earth would you make a battle bot with the mind of a teenager? They even make the joke ""If there is such a thing as a healthy teenage mind"". Why would you put a potentially unhealthy young personality in one of the deadliest machines ever made?Other than that, it's cliche after cliche after cliche. We've heard all the one-liners before. We've seen the overall story before. We've seen the action before and the overuse of slow motion which doesn't really add a whole lot.The acting is good though, and the cgi is beautiful for the most part. So I'll give it 5 stars just for that.But yeah. If you're not currently a teenager, or have fond memories of the source material from your teenage years... You should probably skip this one.",Alita - Battle Angel
783,jamesmcconnon,Don't get the good reviews,2,16 March 2019,"The film looks great, but that's all it has going for it. None of the characters have a sense of humour. I don't think there was one joke in the entire movie. Everyone speaks fluent exposition. Didn't connect with any of the characters, so didn't care what happened to any of them. It does pick up a bit towards the end, but at it's best it's a third rate version of rollerball with too much cgi.Really don't get what people see in this, I was bored for most of it.",Alita - Battle Angel

The acting ranges from above average to very good.But. And there's a big but. The plot is lacking. It starts as one idea and ends as something completely different, with a cliffhanger nonetheless. I can understand why Alita would change her behavior so often; she couldn't remember who she was and was literally developing a personality in a matter of days. But why on earth were the rest of the characters just as chaotic as her? And there are so many details that make no sense. Why would an android eat? If they actually need to eat, how did Alita's brain survive without food for 300 years? And so on, and so on.There are a few truly amazing scenes, though, even inspiring, and for that reason this wasn't a complete disaster.In the end, I din't hate it, but I am disappointed.",Alita - Battle Angel

The way they built up the character slowly and methodically is well done. Visuals are amazing and really make you feel as if you're watching a real person, which makes everything else more believable. I was a bit skeptical of the action after seeing the clip in the alleyway, as it was kind of slow and dance-like, but the action in the movie is sharp and well choreographed. I'm glad Cameron was heavily involved in this and hope he continues to be in the sequels.",Alita - Battle Angel

792,goal-82068,Best Movie of 2019 So Far,8,15 February 2019,"I went into Alita without watching a trailer so I had no idea what to expect. Within the first 5 movies I was hooked. This movie was very very good, and so far is the best movie of a young 2019. The character Alita in this film is a work of masterpiece. The CGI in this film is some of the best I have ever seen. Every seen in this film looks so real and it engages the audience wonderfully. My favorite aspect of this film was watching Alita in action. Every action scene is so well done and I loved it. The one gripe I have about this film is the other characters. No one is bad, but no one else really stands out. Mahershala Ali, Christopher Walsh, Jennifer Connelly are definitely not bad, but they just aren't given much. However Keean Johnson and his characters love interests with Alita is not done to well.
Other than that though I really liked this movie. Alita is a movie in the future and the film brings you into this world and you feel like you are part of it.",Alita - Battle Angel
793,jackransom-69832,A Feast For The Eyes,8,7 February 2019,"Easily my most entertaining film of this year and probably my favourite so far. This is a film that is designed to be seen on the biggest screen possible, the visual effects are incredible, action sequences are unique and well choreographed. The movie is worth seeing alone for the 'Motorball' sequences. The acting is good all around, Alita is well voiced and motion captured, her personality is likeable and it's great seeing her go from friendly to unkillable badass. Christoph Waltz/Jennifer Connelly & Mahershaha Ali are all as good as expected and everyone is clearly having a blast. Yeah the dialogue is very cheesy at times, the plot skips around at a bit and loses some focus and the ending is a bit of a cliffhanger and hopefully this film is financially successful enough to get a sequel as it does deserve it. Go and see Alita on the biggest screen possible, it's a cinematic visual blast and well worth watching.",Alita - Battle Angel
794,gurunathankrishnan,"A mind-blowing action movie with a soul, loses track in between, leaves you wanting for more. You will neither get disappointed nor get over-excited. Waiting for the sequel!!!",7,23 February 2019,"Premise:It's year 2536. The whole population lives in two places: Zalem, assumed to be the developed city and scrapyard, a city living with ruined remains. People from scrapyard are not allowed to Zalem, an unwritten rule.A cybersurgeon Doctor Ido discovers a disembodied cyborg (with brain intact) in the scrapyard, fixes the body designed for his dead daughter and names her Alita. Alita, an amnesiac cyborg, tries to recollect her past, falls in love with human Hugo, discovers her true self in the midst of motorball game and bounty hunters. Who is Alita and where is she from and what's her purpose of life is what the rest of the movie about?What works well?Visual/Special Effects: It's cyborgs in the midst of humans. While special effects is no more a surprise in Hollywood, the work in this movie is stunning. Particularly Alita (the cyborg) is a visual treat - Be it her curious look when she is in discovery made or her anger when she is in action mode, her curious and expressive eyes will steal the audience's attention (not surprised given that James Cameron is the producer). You will feel like the entire movie happening in the X box game mode but in the midst of normal people.
Camera/Music: Both are a great plus to the movie. Such partially animated movies requires a great deal of camera work and it's mind-blowing. BGM will tune you to the mood of the movie
Stunt/action choreography: Action sequences were amazing and spectacular especially the Motorball game and thereafter. Watching in 3D version will make it more appealing. Children will especially enjoy the Motorball game sequence
What didn't work well?Screenplay: Though it's a 2 hour movie, romantic elements between Hugo and Alita drags the flow of the movie. The purpose of the movie is to set the stage for the sequel.
Sequel: I was not familiar with the manga comics based on which movie has been made but I was surprised that the film ends with a premise for sequel leaving you wanting for more!!! infact this movie sets the premise for the next action block and. This will be a let down for many movie goers
Overall a movie with a soul with spectacular visuals, in the midst of mindless comic action movie, gets lost in between for a bigger agenda in sequel!!! I loved her characterisation and the plot. It's worth watching once in theatres!!!",Alita - Battle Angel

This movie is a masterpiece by Director Robert, however he got some input on this films making from the legendary director Jame Cameron. Still he managed to showcase a astonishing cinematic movie.
First I want to share the emotions/motions captured by the Robert for Alita, it was awesome and looks amazingly realistic.

""Uneven"" describes both the story and some of the acting in this movie. It opens interestingly enough, but it becomes difficult to take seriously when the boyfriend-interest comes along--if he is a good actor, we don't see that here--as it does with the associated motorball sequence(s) that has the Bruckheimer movie feel of something that is supposed to be cool but isn't. Jennifer Connelly and Mahershala Ali also have to overact for their roles; one wonders why they agreed to take them. Then the movie feels like it is building to an inevitable and satisfying climax... but ends without doing so. I haven't been that unhappy with a movie ending in quite some time. Don't waste your time on this movie unless a sequel is made so that you can see it right before seeing the sequel.

There isn't anything original with the plot here and the characters are all bland and two dimensional and none of them stand out from any other generic interpretation of the same tropes that we've seen in countless previous blockbusters.
For years, Hollywood blockbusters have been ramping up the special effects and the visuals and sidelining storytelling and characters. And finally we reach the epitome of that style of film making.

The writing and directing seems like it was done over night especially the script. The director and writer were not capable of manufacturing drama which is what they did. When Akita has to decide Hugo's fate it was so rushed and the drama was not believable because there was no real drama. So just like anyone can be a rapper today or a social media narcissist, they can also write and direct and ruin films with potential. Started out as a fun ride but a horrible script and a lack of development makes this movie very forgettable. I give it a 5 only because the effects are cool!!",Alita - Battle Angel

Unclear timeframe makes some character choices weird or unexplained.I believe the actress of alita did a good job, but the design was too much and didnt feel real making it difficult to enjoy the acting.The cgi of the characters and the fight coriography was mostly pretty awesome though. I love these kind of movies so overall it was mostly enjoyable to me, though its clearly not a good movie.

813,DocDAT,One of the most frustrating movies I've ever watched,5,13 July 2019,"The first 45-60 minutes of the movie was awesome. I enjoyed it more than any movie I've seen in a long time. I read a lot of high quality SF and it was hitting many of the right buttons.However after a cringeworthy and not really believable scene, where Alita is literally offering her beating heart to the first young male she met after waking up, it quickly went downhill. By the end, I was pulling my hair out. I can't remember the last time I was this frustrated by a movie. The second half was as bad as the first was good. The last 5 minutes was just pure stupidity. So much wasted potential.Now, I'm not burdened by having read the original manga, so I don't know how much of the complete nonsense in the movie is caused by being restricted to the original plot. I'm not a big fan of manga, because it rarely makes sense and is usually style over substance. So I don't really care if the movie was ""true"" to the cartoon. There was clearly a ton of potential in the concept and it could have been made into a kick ass story if you were willing to ditch all the stupid stuff.The only story that really matter in this, is the background with the war, finding out what happened - and why. Like exploring how the victors of the war were actually the bad guys. And finishing the story by having Alita complete her mission.The romance was not that believable, but I could have accepted it. However the whole rollerball BS - especially at the end was a complete waste of time and made no sense at all. Why didn't she just continue running up to Zalem, after beating the cable defence thingy? Is the viewer supposed to believe that she would be let up there if she became a rollerball champion??! You'd have to be brain damaged for that to make sense. I get that the rollerball scenes made for good action, but action without believability does not make for a good movie.So for me the first half of the movie was 10/10, the second half was 4/10 with the last 5 minutes being pure drivel and pulling the total score down to 5/10.For good dystopic sci-fi with a believable and deep story watch Altered Carbon. But then it also had amazing source material...",Alita - Battle Angel
814,byrnensorg,OMG words fail me,1,17 February 2019,"Having seen this all I wanted to do was scoop out my eyes and place them in a blender. I put this movie in the category of ""it cannot get any worse than this"". I went with low expectations and even they were pounded into the ground... much like everything else in this movie. I remember a scene from The Science of Sleep where Stephane dreamed of a cardboard city, well this was the same except the actors were cardboard too, I had to fight the urge to put it in a recycle bin.The showing I went to had two people who were coming down from a high and I found them in the bathroom afterwards crying into the mirror this, I have to say, is not a good sign. I cared for none of the characters at the end and neither did the actors by the looks of it. It was a vacuous shell of a movie with a tenuous plot and a kind of on the nose homage to the gladiators of Rome, where instead of the thrill of the Colosseum you had a huge pile of mechanical and cgi crap and instead of a production team that actually gave a damn what they were producing was a huge pile of mechanical and cgi crap. 5 people actually walked out wincing, now this is also not a good sign. I gave 1 star for the end titles, as I was never so glad to see them and for the fact it was short.

829,skippytjd,Solid adaptation full of incredible visuals and great characters,9,9 February 2019,"Let's face it, live action anime adaptations are usually a mess. A terrible representation of the source material with filmmakers and studios so concerned with appealing to American audiences that they destroy the magic of the orginal work.Director Robert Rodriguez and producer James Cameron (who wrote the script with Laeta Kalogridis) do an outstanding job of bringing Yukito Kishiro's long-running post-apocalyptic manga ""Gunnm"" to the big screen.""Alita"" is the most faithful manga adaptation Hollywood has ever produced. While it is not the shot-for-shot translation of Rodriguez's ""Sin City,"" this movie weaves together the opening arcs of the series with some characters from the two-episode anime OVA, recreating many fan-favorite scenes while honoring the spirit of the original work as well as any Marvel film.For the majority of the population who has never read the cult-classic manga, it is a fun cyberpunk film, full of outstanding action sequences and a lot of heart.Weta raised the bar on their own work, and Alita is probably the greatest, most believeably realistic computer-genereated character ever created. Her eyes attracted a lot of criticism when the first trailer hit, but thanks to some tweaks suggested by Cameron, they now give her an endearing otherness. She fits into her world so well that even on an IMAX screen, you believe she was there alongside the human cast. The motion capture work is extraordinary in translating Rosa Salazar's facial movements, and most importantly in making Alita real, Salazar turns in performace with tremedous emotional depth.Salazar is complimented by a strong supporting cast including Christoph Waltz as Dr. Dyson Ido, the cyber surgeon who discovered her battered core in a scrap heap; Jennifer Connelly, as Ido's ex Dr. Chiren, who now uses her surgical skills to benefit Vector, a power broker criminal played by Mahershala Ali, who controls Iron City's most popular sport, Motorball-a no-holds-barred cybory roller derby.Cameron's fingerprints are all over the movie, as Rodriguez adopted Cameron's science-based approach to sci-fi. Where Rodriguez originally worked as a cartoonist, and brings that anything-can-happen sensibility to his films, Cameron is an illustrator, concerned with how everything fits together. Rodriquez's style explodes during the film's fast-paced action sequences-where we actually still see how things fit together as we see so many cyborgs get pulled apart.The film has a pace and narrative flow that set it apart from most American films. Alita is not only the title character, but her impulses drive much of the plot-and being an amnesiac cyborg, she is effectively a teenager, so her goals shift as the film unfolds. She wants to learn of her past, but is more concerned with living in the moment and rediscovering the world around her. While several characters are obsessed with ascending to Zalem, the elite floating city above Iron City, she sees beauty in her devestated surroundings, concerned more with making emotion connections and pursuing adrenaline rushes, whether hunting fugitives as a Hunter Warrior bounty hunter or participating in Motorball.While her world, especially at this stage of the story, shares tropes with other sci-fi tales, Alita is unique. While she is physically strong, her personality is multi-faceted and has quirks doesn't fit into a cookie cutter ""strong female character."" Watching her grow and evolve has kept readers enthralled for decades. This film is an excellent introduction to this dynamic character, her allies, her enemies and her world.",Alita - Battle Angel

834,skyhawk77,Good enough for James Cameron to produce but not Direct,7,4 March 2019,"James Cameron the most commercially successful Director of all time is the producer and writer of this film. He bought the rights of the comic book in the late 90s.James' first film is Terminator released in 1984. Since then he has written and directed only six other movies. In the same period Steven Spielberg directed 25 movies and Ridley Scott 22.This tells us James has only certain stories that he is interested in directing. He even said he is now only ""in the Avatar Business"". Alita: Battle Angel could have been directed by him but it definitely would have fallen short of Titanic, Avatar and Terminator 1 & 2 which is the reason he hired Robert Rodriguez to direct.James Cameron's signature is all over the movie making me wonder if Robert Rodriguez had a say. The action sequences are excellent, the best in a very long time just what you would expect from James Cameron. Unlike Michael Bay and other action directors who take one shot and divide it into several shots (fast cutting) in this movie each shot is elaborate.The story could be confusing. I did not get all of it. But it does add up.One thing that was un James Cameron like for this film is the absence of his triple climax which is even found in movies he did not direct such as Strange Days and Point Break both directed by ex wife Kathryn Bigelow. Just like many others i think the reason for this is to leave room for a sequel.I recommend this movie be seen in imax 3d because that is how it was intended to be seen by the filmmakers and producers. Watching in this format will get you the best movie experience in a long time.",Alita - Battle Angel

837,stevie-parmentier-360-779691,A very flawed movie that is nice to watch once and then forget,5,6 August 2021,"I didn't like Avatar. It was style over substance with such predictable story plots, clichéd characters and nothing clever or intriguing to keep me happy. I know I'm in the minority here and it seems with Alita, this is Avatar all over again ... but a little better ... and yet it's still highly mediocre.I won't go into the positives because everyone already mentioned those a million times over. What I don't see enough, is a bisection of what the movie does wrong so here goes:the movie plot is all over the place and tries to cram the plot elements of three movies into one. Is it a romance movie? Is it a ""loser becomes hero"" story? Is it a ""hunter is hunted"" plot? It's neither yet all of these. The story is a mess and none of these elements work well since they're awkwardly put together.The romance plot is absolutely terrible and yet is the biggest part of the movie. It gave me flashbacks to the terrible romance scenes from Star Wars: Clone Wars. It doesn't help that the CGI is not convincing enough and it's basically a real guy kissing a 3D model.the movie doesn't give itself any room to breathe. It's something Hollywood seems to have forgot but the best movies pace quiet scenes with action packed ones where the quiet moments caused character building. It's not like Alita doesn't try this, but usually those moments are used for the soppy romance story instead of scenes that would make the plot stronger.the characters nor the world are well fleshed out. You get a little back story about the past and why the world is the way it is but the movie glances over most of these. True, you don't need a lot of depth in an action movie but since this movie insists on tying a large part of its plot to the characters, it hamstrings itself.the pace is completely wrong. They should really have removed huge chunks of the movie to streamline and to add scenes that actually made sense. The whole scene in the bounty hunter bar was not needed and so were several other scenes that just made the flow of the movie even more a mess.There's many, and I mean MANY illogical elements that will make you frown even if you really try not to look too closely at the cracks. Perhaps by adding another hour of scenes you might be able to patch those holes but as it stands, too many elements make no sense which shows how lazy the script writers were.The very worst sin is the last 15 minutes of the movie. Without spoiling, they tried to cram a heap of stuff just to set the movie up for a sequel. Sadly enough, a sequel seems unlikely so we're stuck with the rather poor ending which really dooms this movie to mediocrity.",Alita - Battle Angel
838,luckybuccaneer,A surprising disappointment,6,21 August 2019,"This was set up to be be a movie I would love. Everything about it screams 'favourite'! Director, producers, cast, cinematography...all favourites.Yet somehow they missed the mark. It looked fantastic and the script, awful as it was, was well executed, but the story was just not there in any fashion. It moved from scene to scene with no real natural flow, and plot revelations were crowbarred in all over the place.Sure, I wasn't expecting an award winning flick, but from this ensemble I expected better.Personally, I think it would have been better as a mini series where Alita's character arc and the darker aspects of it could be explored. We were also only shown the surface of the world that was built and that should have formed a huge part of the movie. It looks amazing, but it was just...there...with very little explanation as to why and how.All in all I enjoyed it as a 6/10 is an OK movie in my book, I just wish it was more.",Alita - Battle Angel

Some scenes where notably hastily put together to push the story forwardThe audio volume. It is in some moments pushed to the limits.

Alita is just lovely, cool and different to all female hero figueres I know by now. The Set's are beautiful and the fighting scene's are awesome in a way you can follow and still see the detail's, although it's really fast.

The cast is excellent, with some cool villains and the Hugo & Alita relationship is something I bought into.But, the script is the weakest part of this film. I was baffled at the choices they made towards the end, and like I stated it starts slow and boring. The thing I hated the most about the film is the ending.

855,kantvors,Perfection,10,29 August 2019,"If there ever was a movie that did everything it was supposed to do perfectly, it's definitely Alita: Battle Angel. This movie has everything. It has a mesmerising setting, great characters, fantastic acting and performances, breathtaking visuals, intense action and choreographed fight sequences, touching moments and believeable romantic developments, engaging soundtrack, and most importantly, characters arcs exist! That is something many new movies completely forget to include. It feels so good you don't want it to end. I watched this so many times by now, but the most memorable was when I showed it to my family. The whole room was mesmerised, people of all walks of life and different tastes, all completely taken aback. My cousin asked me as the movie was ending, ""IS THERE A SEQUEL OUT?"" almost yelling at me, and that made me very, very happy. This movie really deserves a sequel. An actual 10/10, something I never thought I'd give to a movie before.",Alita - Battle Angel
856,chocoer,Wasted Potential,3,29 July 2019,"I spent the first moments of the film hopeful. Some cool visuals, good crossovers from manga, liked most the actors.Within 30 minutes it unravels. The screenplay constantly undermines itself. Tons of useless elements, red herrings, misdirects, sloppy world building, poor character development, and logical fallacies. It causes the story to just collapse in on itself. Rather than a cohesive narrative you end up with a string of moments that culminate in a horrifically dragged out ending. An ending that just sits there, motionless, leaving no resolution.What a waste.",Alita - Battle Angel
857,kumadan,https://kunalatthemovies.movie.blog/2019/02/14/alita-battle-angel-film-review/,8,25 June 2019,"Alita is a film 20 years in the making. James Cameron (who is the writer and producer of the film) bought the rights for Alita over 20 years ago. Originally called Gunnm, it was a Japanese manga (comic) which released in 1990. James Cameron fell in love with the comic and bought the rights and it became his passion project after Titanic. Simultaneously he was working on the script for Avatar but when Avatar released with huge commercial success in 2009, Cameron shifted his focus to make multiple sequels to Avatar, and Alita went to the back burner. Cameron didn't want this great story to gather dust and never get made, so he used his script and continued to produce the film, but hired seasoned filmmaker Robert Rodriguez to be at the helm and direct this project.
I was lucky enough to attend the premiere of Alita in IMAX. Firstly I have to say that this film is absolutely gorgeous and even more so in IMAX. The world they created in this film is magnificent, I was amazed by all the artwork and visual effects and set building done in combination to create a visually stunning city.
Peter Jackson's visual effects company, Weta Digital, were the ones responsible for this breathtaking world created on screen and the design of the titular character Alita. Initially when I saw the trailer I found the animation for the character to be kind of out of place, but while watching the movie it did not bother me one bit. In fact, apart from the world created the best thing in the film is the main character.
The film stars Rosa Salazar, Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly , Mahershala Ali and Keean Johnson. And starts with Dr. Ido (Christoph Waltz) finding Alita (Rosa Salazar) in a scrap yard whose brain is still active so he takes her to his home office to build her a body and bring her back to life. There begins a tender father-daughter connection, and probably the only emotional character relationship in the film that actually works. Waltz as usual is great, but the stand out performance is Rosa Salazar as Alita. Given that most of the action sequences and stunts of the character are done with CGI, Salazar did do all the motion capture performance and dialogues. She does it so well that you can't help but connect to this lost girl trying to find her place and purpose in this insane world. Unfortunately the film goes on to create a love story between Alita and Hugo (Keean Johnson) and this is where I felt the movie failed. The chemistry between these characters are not strong enough for the audience to be that invested. I won't go into spoiler territory, but the climax of the film falls a bit flat due to the relationship of Alita and Hugo not being as effective as the filmmakers might have thought.
The other problem I have with the film is the wasted talents of Jennifer Connelly and Mahershala Ali. Both these Oscar winning actors are great but in this film they just seem like random supporting characters that could have been played by any other less talented actor and it wouldn't have changed the film. Mahershala Ali (who has won an Oscar for his performance in Moonlight and is nominated for Green Book this year) is one of the most talented actors currently working in Hollywood. So if you are going to cast him as your villain, you have to make him a strong, menacing villain. But he is none of that, he just seems like a bland character who is more of a puppet than the actual shot caller.
The action choreography and the overall action sequences are elegantly done and captured. I am truly grateful that we did not get another quick cut action film, that cuts 50 times in a 2 minute fight scene. The framing of the action gave the characters breathing room and had the audience follow every movement and every detail of the world. This is especially effective during the Motorball scenes in the film. Due to the high speed pace of the sport, it was good to have clear visuals of what was happening. I was actually hoping there would be more Motorball in the film, because it was really impressive how the effects team executed it.The only other film I can compare Alita: Battle Angel to is Ghost in the Shell (2017) starring Scarlett Johansson. That is because both these films are based on Japanese Manga that came out around the same time, 1989/1990. Both these films have a female lead who is part human and part cyborg, both of them are sci-fi/cyberpunk genres. But where Ghost in the Shell failed, Alita: Battle Angel flourishes.
Alita: Battle Angel is pretty accurate to its source material and creates a strong female lead. The film shines as an example on how to make a Hollywood film from a Manga/Anime. We have had decades of failed films that tried to recreate the magic of Japanese Manga/Anime. With Alita there is hope, it is a huge step in the right direction. The film might waste some of it's characters and might use some cheesy dialogue, but it is a visual fest that has tremendous heart in it's protagonist and her mentor, Dr. Ido.Rating:
I am giving Alita: Battle Angel a 7.5 out of 10.
A fun film and a visual treat for fans of manga/anime and fans who generally like sci-fi action films. The film does fall short in terms of its villain, supporting characters and their performances. Luckily it has the well captured bond of Ido and Alita that keeps its emotional arc afloat.",Alita - Battle Angel
858,mats_astroem,Loved it!,9,15 January 2020,Watched this movie without knowing much about it. And I'm so surprised. Both the cast is really good as well as the story and the scenery is on point. This is one of the best movies I've seen this year and I encourage anyone who likes sci-fi to watch it. You'll love it. If you are the kind of person that is open to new ideas (given Alita is partially cgi) you'll love it as well. It's a well balanced movie with a powerful hero.Watch it!!,Alita - Battle Angel
859,dustingonzalez41,Loved it,8,23 August 2019,"Very enjoyable and the action got me hyped. This is everything Ready Player One and Ghost in the Shell needed to be. I have to agree the romance was a bit dead in this film. Hugo should have died they first time around honestly it would have more an impact on the audience because the second time I didn't care at all. Other than that, everything about the world and characters are great. I want to learn more about this world and Alita. Confused why some of the ""Critics"" say the ""special affects"" are bad, The visual effects* are amazing and clearly a stylistic design to have some things look a bit animated. The action is also just amazing.",Alita - Battle Angel
860,romanticinsomniac,"All Flash, and No Substance.",5,8 August 2019,"This movie is all over the place. There's not really any kind of character arc, nor is there a cohesive story. It just jumps from one over the top action scene, to the next. The only thing this movie has is goofy, bad, facial c.g.i. for the main character, and some genuinely decent c.g.i. for some side characters. I'd only recommend this movie to 12 year olds on a Saturday afternoon, with nothing to do. Adults, we want more intelligent fare, something like Blade Runner 2049.",Alita - Battle Angel

If you like action movies, again, you HAVE to see this in the theatre. Even if you are new to these genres, this is still an objectively excellent film by the highest of standards. Instant classic, 10/10.My final thoughts go to the filmmakers:Make. A. Sequel. And if you DO make a sequel, let me just say, it had BETTER be just as DARK, VIOLENT, and MATURE as the first. Hell, you can make it DARKER and MORE VIOLENT, give it an R rating even. I loved the violence.If you come out with a sequel that is less dark/violent/mature than the first, I'll be the first person to tear apart.

866,michaelschrute1,One of the Boldest Big Budget Films in Years,9,4 June 2019,"Probably the best anime or manga adaptation to date, Alita: Battle Angel sells itself on its protagonist's unique look, and while some may take issue with this, I'd argue it's a major strength.Nowadays the world of big budget spectacles is saturated with the MCU, the Fast and Furious, and other various franchises that have been around for years.It's beyond refreshing, then, to witness Alita: Battle Angel, a weird little cyberpunk tale of big eyeballs and futuristic bloodsport.The film isn't perfect -- much of its dialogue is corny to the point of eyerolls, but the superb acting performances are able to keep Alita's weaknesses in check.In the end, it delivers enough of its own unique thrills that all I can say is WE BETTER GET A SEQUEL. Or at least more movies like this.",Alita - Battle Angel

But first things first: ""Alita: Battle Angel"" offers pitch-perfect pacing, fantastic mocap, outstanding VFX and SFX, nicely choreographed action, fitting music, great camerawork, solid story and good acting. Actors have clearly been cast for talent and not for diversity. Also nice to see a movie with a strong female lead who doesn't rise herself by demeaning men. But the most amazing plus here is Cameron and Rodriguez left Alita at least somewhat sexualized. Not as sexualized as she was in the 1991 Manga (where she was renamed from Gally to Alita by Kodansha USA for reasons I stated in the headline), but as much as it is possible in late-2010s ""woke"" Hollywood.

Not this time! James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez made an outstanding work with Alita Battle Angel. They should work more together.CGI work done on Alita is incredible. It has so much life that it feels like a human, I remember having the same feeling watching Avatar back in 2009. Every detail, every scene, lighting.. 1000 of hours of hard work and love have been put into her and other CGI effects and it shows. Everything has weight, physics (even if imaginary) are consistent, visual effects aren't intrusive. I'm very quick to notice a slip and during the first watch, but this time the story and pace was so interesting and good it left me no time to look after those. Great job!Art design is incredible. It really captures the era. Characters have a steady development and the movie doesn't rush with too much information. I kept me interested throughout its entire duration, always on edge, waiting for what's to come.I'm still pumping a bit of adrenaline, but I feel like this is when I have to write this review. It's an amazing film, worth the watch on big screens. If I had any scepticism going into it, I have absolutely zero left. This is one of the best CGI anime movies Hollywood has ever done.

872,ItLookedBetterOnBetamax,Visual Masterpiece,8,3 March 2019,"This is the latest film in cinemas from James Cameron which brings to life the Japanese Manga of the same name. Together they were able to create a rich and diverse world in which the film takes place.Alita: Battle Angel follows the story of a cyborg nicknamed Alita who is found abandoned in a scrap yard in Iron City by Dr. Dyson Ido, who is able to successfully bring her back to life. Once revived Alita must start again experiencing the world a new and attempts to rediscover her lost past.Alita herself was a very compelling protangonist and it was a pleasure to watch her grow and develop from the scrapyard and learn to live, love, laugh and cry again. Alita was both a strong female protangonist and a sensitive soul trying to improve the lives of those around her. She demonstrated that you can still be a strong lead while showing emotion, and despite the fact that she was a cyborg she was the most human character in this film.Unfortunately the other characters were not nearly as well developed and often seemed hollow and boresome. For instance Alita's love interest Hugo seemed like a run of the mill young male character who's a bit of a rebel and shows Alita a different side to life. Characters other than Alita just seemed to disappear off screen for a while with minimal impact to the story. However luckily Alita herself was there to drive the story along and create compelling viewing. The range and interesting designs of the Hunter-Warrior characters present was a massive plus.Part of the issue with the character development was down to the at times mediocre and cliche dialogue which fell flat. Some more character development for the side characters would have gone a long way and made certain scenes more emotive. However I understand that the film already had a long run time and some compromises have to be made during production.Visually this film was very impressive. The world that has been created is full of life and stunning scenary; leading to some amazing scenes. However often scenes in the film were based inside rather dull and dark looking buildings and arenas meaning the audience didn't have enough time to take in and appreciate the whole of Iron City.In terms of CGI it was top notch, especially the animation of characters such as Alita which looked flawless. However an underwater scene with Alita looked noticeably worse than the rest of the film, and the combination of real actors faces surrounded by obvious CGI was quite jarring at some times. But overall incredibly impressive and exciting if this is the new normal for CGI.This film is absolutely packed with action. So much so that even when the story falls flat the audience is quickly taken to another action scene which helps distract from the often times mediocre dialogue and characters. The 2 hour run time of this film quickly passes as it is a quick paced film full of intense action scenes and combat, although there are some slower parts in order to give time to develop Alita.I think overall this film deserves the praise it is getting and I am always happy to support new film ideas and projects which is why I bumped my score up from 7.5/10. Compelling viewing in the cinema but whether that translates to home viewing when you no longer have the impressive sound systems and massive scene is another matter.The only question I have over this film is the ending. It seemed to be left on a cliffhanger which seems to suggest that a sequel was planned before the release of this film. This was a risky strategy as if the film bombed at the box office there probably wouldn't be one and the story would not have been concluded. Luckily it seems like the film is a reasonable success for Fox & Co. and a sequel seems likely which makes me happy.",Alita - Battle Angel

And get this - This movie featured one bada$$, no-nonsense female lead who didn't have to keep reminding everyone that she was, in fact, a girl. She didn't even feel that she was too ""strong and independent"" for a romantic love interest - and with a guy to boot! Yes, Virginia, female lead movies CAN be good!As for the movie itself, can I just say that the CGI was amazing. Every character detail is so realistic. Alita's eyes, if it weren't for the size, you'd swear they were real. I will say that the city left a little to be desired, though. There just wasn't enough detail. Same thing can be said for the character development. You really don't feel like you get to know anyone other than Alita herself, and even then, just barely. The plot was a little thin, too, especially for a two hour movie.You might wonder why I'd give this movie such high praise then? I really can't put it into words. All I know was that watching Alita kick some serious tail, fighting for righteousness was mesmerizing.

878,daddyxj-1,Alita: Battle CGI Eye Candy Angel,5,17 February 2019,"Ok, so we now have the technology for movies to create any characters and worlds we can imagine BUT at the sacrifice of a simple, decent and COMPLETE story. This movie did nothing but become a 2 hour world building 1st act because the writers had sequels in mind. The movie is mostly eye candy, it tries to be something more with a little romance in the film that comes with a twist toward the end but it just feels forced. The look and effects of the film are great but that's all the movie mostly is, eye candy. Rosa Salazar performance is actually very good as Alita I just wish there was a better more contained story built around her performance. I really think if they were trying to make this a trilogy than they should have gone with a more simple and contained story and not try to be so big right away. Give us glimpses of what this bigger world is but just keep the story focused on Alita's journey into self discovery and her romance with her human friend. But we get so much going on and action scenes that are just there for the sake of seeing her fight. I don't know anything about the source material but I do know movie story telling and this movie was all set up for a future sequel. I just saw what could have been a better more interesting movie. I felt the movie was all surface emotional when it could have gotten deeper with Alitas journey in self discover which opens her would to the bigger picture. This movie was too big and should have been a more simple and contained story then open to the bigger world in the sequel. Because as it stands I am not interested in this world and don't really care for the sequel because they did not make me emotionally invested in the characters. With the exception of the acting (which all the actors do a fine job given the dialogue and direction they have been given) the movie is a disappointment. I just wanted to more invested into this film but all I got was a sugar rush of CGI action set pieces",Alita - Battle Angel

I am not very happy, when I've spent good time and money, to find out that there is no conclusion. There are 4-5 plot points that are setup in the first 10 mins. None of them are resolved. That is not how you set up a sequel.Obviously I am not familiar with the source material. The fact that they spent $200m+ to create part of a story does not impress me.

Maybe the entire movie just happen for 2 weeks of timeline, like something keeps happening and you don't have the time to explain, and then boom all of the sudden Alita is there, and then boom the bad guy is present.The story, the concept, the idea are amazing, but the film didn't have the capability to tell it properly. The layers of the characters are so thin, some characters seems important, but we don't know much about their story and feel nothing attached to them.

882,waigo7,A person is required to fix third acts of all misfires,7,19 February 2019,"I have developed an impression that most of the promising but a bit disappoiting films have some problems at the climax of the film. It may be the pacing, unfulfilling conflict resolutions, near absurd use of deus ex machina etc.
My problem with the film was mainly this. Third act was a bit off. There is a Motorball showdown which is great, killing Vector was an interesting scene, Grewishka's death was too swift and they had to kill Hugo twice which was a bit much. Besides, all of these moments were done to set Alita's journey to Zalem which is set for a probable sequel. In the end, we have a climax with two parts one of which is a motorball race and the other one is all the killings. Although script made its best to intertwine them both, one cannot deny that it was stucked together too tight. This situation caused me to break from the films flow and made me anticipate any other upcoming canflict resolution (are we going to see deaths of other hunter-warriors who didn't help Alita)Film's setup was fine, a lot of elements were introduced very well, most of them were introduced visually first and explained later in an expositional manner mostly by Doctor character, which is important in fantasy or sci-fi genre. It has its good action moments with a little campy attire which I think can be attributed to director's B-film influenced style.Actor performances were mostly good. Jennifer Connelly's work was mostly holding an elegant posture while looking at characters or talking. Ali excelled at playing both himself and Edward Norton.Action was alright. I personally seek more these days because I watch a lot of blockbusters and most of them have action scenes so I am beginning to get used to all those cgi dependent wit a gazillion times cut scenes. So usually I enjoy more practical and well-choreographed ones.In conclusion, this film had the potential to be entertaining as Pacific Rim or an average Marvel movie but its problems in the third act hindered that a little bit.",Alita - Battle Angel

If you liked Wonder Woman movie, this is the next one with high-energy, feminine intensity, inetlligence and passion for using force to protect the weak and willing to use force to combat injustice.
DON'T LISTEN TO THE PROFESSIONAL CRITICS.
Alita was much better than the pro critics led me to believe.
Many critics reviewed it like a Fast & Furious movie: multiple action set-pieces jammed together until time's up. ALITA HAS AN EXCEPTIONAL SCRIPT AND NUANCED PERFORMANCES.ALITA IS NOT A ""BLOCKBUSTER."" Rather it takes the genre of the ScarJo Ghost in the Shell (2017) and aims it towards audience identification with an impassioned female hero, trying to make the world a better place, as in Wonder Woman.This is Jim Cameron and Robert Rodriguez at their best.
GO SEE THIS :)PS: The next Wonder Woman-like movie is likely to be Captain Marvel. The women are taking over because their value system is the antidote for how men have made a mess of things.

For me, I see the love, kindness, and passion of Alita and Dr. Ido. From these come their strength and courage.The father-(foster)daughter relationship between Dr. Ido and Alita is very touching. The love Dr. Ido had for his late daughter can now find a home in Alita, and through his kindness, Alita has a safe place to find herself, learn, and grow to become the special woman she always was. They help each other fill voids in their lives. There is nothing more special than the love of a daughter for her father, and this movie captures this feeling.The visual effects are absolutely incredible. I actually thought Zapan was ""wearing"" his armor, but in fact, his mechanical body was added as a visual effect (which I learned later).I thought the character development for the supporting characters of Hugo, Chiren, and Vector was better in the anime (Gunnm), which was only about an hour long. Adding 10 minutes to develop these other characters would have made the movie even better.I'm not exactly sure why, but this movie makes me emotional, and even brings tears to my eyes.

It has its overused bits like a clishé monolgue where one of the people is like ""oh no dont die"" and the others like"" live without me"" blah blah blah.

When watching it I got so scared when I realized it had probably been over 1 hour and 30 minutes, meaning the movie would soon end, and I had a million questions regarding Alitas background, the reason behind the war, who made the giant flying cities etc. I hope a lot of it will be answered in the next movie.

It has a badass warrior, it has interesting world-building, it has a formidable villain... but they didn't click together.The doctor that puts Alita back together has a typical sob story but I saw almost no emotion from the guy. Rosa Salazar's acting came through better on Alita's CGI face than this guy's acting!! In general, the character development was terrible - Alita goes from complete amnesia, heck, almost dead, to jumping into the world and trusting the first cute guy she sees. (That romance was forced too) There's no character development on the villain either, he's just some omnipresent bad guy in the sky, no motives for why he's bad.

Motorball, though really a side-plot, was an interesting diversion and made for some great action. And much controversy has been made out of Alita's animation (the character) and her oversized eyes but I felt that the actress portraying her (Rosa Salazar) does such a great job emoting that it accentuated some character-building scenes in some places, not inhibited by it.Unfortunately, it seems like it is expected to do quite poorly at the box office from initial projections (the cinema here was only half-full at opening night) which I think is a real shame, because after seeing it tonight, I would pay to see a sequel too. Which it sets up quite optimistically. My one (and only) major criticism is that it very much feels like a ""Part One"" rather than coming to a well-rounded conclusion, as though success was already assured and a sequel already green-lighted (and with the names attached to the project, I made the same mistake). I was pretty sure that the film was guaranteed to do well, and didn't even give thought to it being anything else. Now this will probably end up doing more harm if a sequel doesn't happen.I still hope that it will happen, but initial forecasts seem doubtful. And if there is not, will I look back at this movie as fondly, several years down the line?It feels like the producers may have cut themselves with a double-edged sword here...",Alita - Battle Angel

924,vomelun,"it is a great movie, that couldn't reach the masterpiece level.",9,29 June 2019,"I believe this movie would deserve a 10 if it weren't for the cheesy dialogues and the bad acting. I don't know if there are currently good teenagers actors but these ones were not up to the task. the CG was great. the story is great. the Alita s combat choreographies were amazing. just that not good acting.
I like the arc of the character. gave room for more. hope there will be another soon.",Alita - Battle Angel

926,johnnghome,Where can I find her? I have become her fan!,10,11 November 2019,"I never knew of Alita until this movie. Unlike a lot of CGI movies, this one feels so real and its storyline is brilliantly arty and doesn't finish in the predictable happy ending. One of the reason for the realness is that Alita doesn't jump, run, or fly in speed too incredible to be believed (like say Aquaman), nor has to fight enemies in unrealistic incredible swarm (again like Aquaman). As a story, its beauty is its simplicity and single mindedness without resorting to ""coincidences"" to patch up glitches in its storyline. Most of all, the movie takes a beautiful actress and transforms her into a beautiful cyborg with eyes that is so manga. Can anyone tell me where I can find her?",Alita - Battle Angel
927,lukecarlbrown,The plot is all over the place,5,25 August 2021,"None of it really makes total sense, it kind jumps from idea to idea and the writer never really just stuck to one plot. Very cliche in parts. I'm guessing a lot of money was thrown at this because the CGI and aesthetics are amazing. I mean, Christoph Waltz is in it too..In summary, the story is very shallow and lacking. It jumps from bounty hunter to hot wheel racers/beyblades, back to bounty hunter, back to a 300 year old space war, then back again to some love story that ends horribly, finishing on a beyblade hot mess that killing some end boss from 300 years ago who lives in a kind of Elysium. 5/5 for graphics but I would have rather have gone to sleep.",Alita - Battle Angel
928,NeoChrys,Enjoyable but definitely can't stand alone.,7,23 February 2019,"I had a good time watching Alita. It's a film with many good qualities but the weak story truly weighs the project down. Visually wise It has a spectacular worldbuilding ,the Iron City especially looks as if it was taken out of an anime, but it would have been nice if they had touched a bit more on the history of the Fall and the war between the social classes that I assume must be going on. The lead character is awesome, an adorable dork with a love for drama and serious rage issues, but unfortunately she's about the only character interesting enough for the viewer to connect with. Her story arch is truly a mess. She just starts doing one thing and then she gets sidetracked and goes on to do another thing and that happens again and again. Until the very end she has no clear sense of purpose and that hurts the movie a lot. I personally think they should have focused a bit more on the Motorball part of the story.
The romantic storyline i definitely didn't care for but I didn't find it unrealistic. Alita is a teenage girl afterall so it's not out of character for her to fall head over hills for the first bad boy character that shows her around and teaches her how to have fun. It's like... we know he is a loser and uncharismatic and has zero game but she sees him with her rose-colored glasses sooo...
Would have loved to see more Asian actors involved, please and thank you.",Alita - Battle Angel

934,sarahelizabeth-68258,Needs a sequel,9,9 August 2019,"This movie was absolutely recommended for those who enjoy movies like Mortal Engines. However, I definitely don't recommend it for young children because there are a number of frightening and intense scenes with cyborgs being cut apart or having their arms ripped off etc and a few scary death related scenes toward the end of the movie, one with blood. Other than that, the movie has a great female lead, lots of well-developed characters, an air of mystery shrouding the main character as she discovers who she is, and several heartwarming moments as well. The big criticism I have with this movie is this: I'm pretty sure they're not making a sequel because Disney bought out Fox, and the movie ends at essentially a turning point where a sequel is needed to continue. It's kind of like how The Incredibles left off right at a second villain and it was a cliff hanger? Only worse, because the end of Alita is like reading one book/watching one movie in a trilogy such as Divergent or The Hunger Games, but knowing there May not be a sequel or continuation of the film.",Alita - Battle Angel

936,liamsunderland,A really good adaptation!,10,24 February 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel, is about a 300 year old cyborg girl (played by Rosa Salazar) who cannot remember anything about her previous life as a bezerker during the fall. A broken Alita is found and rebuilt by Dr. Dyson Ido (played by Christoph Waltz) and spends the rest of the movie trying to figure out who she was whilst also trying to understand the new world around her. The movie is full of spectacular special effects that can put any modern movie to shame and the use of motion capture to make alitas' face more ""Anime"" or ""manga"" like is used to make her look more realistic. The fight scenes are especially good with the use of slow-motion cameras and is just satisfying to watch machines get torn apart.
Personally I loved this movie and have seen it three times as I write this. I hope it does well enough in the box office to greelight a sequel to the movie as the ending sets up for.

938,starfishb,"Beautiful graphics, technically accomplished, utterly derivative story",4,30 July 2020,"There's nothing remotely original about the plot. This is science fiction for people who don't have a clue what great science fiction is, written by people who also don't have a clue what great science fiction is. As spectacular as the CGI is, it just can't make up for the story, which is basically identical to Altered Carbon. A dystopian city, rich immortals living above, and most everyone living below ready to sell their souls to join them. Also it should've been called Alita: Battle Angel Part 1.

Loved the character, loved the idea, but the storyline just fell short. Strong performances from actors, amazing CGI, yet... and that's the worst of all things (thing I hate the most) no ending, no conclusion. It's a setup for more episodes.
F#ck that.
Do a TV series if you want to do sequels. I want to see a movie... beginning, story, and a damn conclusion. I don't want to wait a year for you to make a sequel.
I gave it a 7... a very, very weak 7 just because of the the SFX I had to elevate it a bit.

Did not expect much just because the character design and her appeared age on the poster.I'm glad that I watched it! It was a bit weird as it read like a cross over among cyberpunk, teenage heartthrob, dystopian wasteland, and arcade gaming?Nonetheless, Alita was an unique character. Innocent, ruthless, naive, but driven. A lot of things happened in a short amount of time, but I'm looking forward to the second segment if it ever comes out.I would say the acting was not the best and Hugo's action in the end did not have enough build up leading up to it. It might have made sense for the character if there was some more context.Also, the scores were alright. Would not say it was outstanding.",Alita - Battle Angel
943,thegazatron,Alita-l bit underwhelming,7,9 February 2019,"I have been anticipating the release of Alita since I saw the first trailer that featured a cover of Linkin Park's New Divide and after just seeing it I have come out a little underwhelmed. This could be my fault due to my elevated expectations but I think it would be unfair to apportion the blame solely on what I wanted from this film.Alita, endearingly portrayed by Rosa Salazar, is a well layered character and by far the most compelling aspect of this film. She has a good character arc but I feel a lot of the mystery of her backstory is either rushed or barely explored.Christoph Waltz and Jennifer Connolly are good enough supporting characters though while Connolly's character unfolds nicely I found Waltz's to not offer much for the calibre of actor he is. On this same trend is Mahershala Ali's character who is criminally underused.This is not the fault of the actors themselves as they are at the mercy of the narrative. Personally, I found the story to be very one dimensional and linear. Several parts are presented as plot twists when in actual fact they are unsurprising. It's very much an a to b tale and is my main disappointment with this film as this comes from James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez.However, the world is very intriguing and has once again been expertly crafted by Cameron. It's futuristic, colourful and technically looks amazing.I want to know more about this world, explore more of the Motorball sport and get to know Alita better. It's just a shame the story falls into the scrap heap.The story lacks but there is enough in this film to make me want to know more",Alita - Battle Angel

Not that it means Alita is a bad movie by any means, it just isn't a 10 movie.
PROS:
spectacular visuals, this film was made for big screen 3D projections, go see it in theaters for full enjoyment, after all James Cameron produced itCharacter of Alita, done pretty well both physically and in terms of motivation, you could empathize with her reasoning and actionsCONS:
for me, film suffered from lack of identity, scene after scene I just thought of wow, the script is similar to Elysium and wow, those visuals kinda remind me of Ready Player One; they should have told the story of this world a little bit better so we could attach morescript generally, there are some plot holes here, film requires you not to think too much about themacting, besides computerally rendered Alita which was done perfectly, other big names involved disappointed me a little bit, especially Mahershala Ali who just didn't bring his A game here, and it could be told the same about Jennifer Connelly and partially Christoph Waltz, all of them won Oscars and just didn't justify that herethe movie ends unexpectedly in the middle of action, clearly setting a sequel idea.It made me angry cause it totally came out of nowhere, me and my friend just looked at each other in disbelief.I recommend you go to this mostly for fun, just enjoy visuals, don't over-analyze script and you will be pleased 🙂",Alita - Battle Angel

The work they have done for this is insane, it all looks phenomenal. The performance capture of the actors is like AVATAR level good.Second, Rosa Salazar, I absolutely loved her performance as Alita. Truly a rising star!Its just a cool, badass movie. The story had me and the world building had me, everything had me.

951,DarthSidousofthenorth,visually impressive,6,28 March 2019,This movie looks visually impressive but I wish someone other than Robert Rodriguez made this movie. Everything in the movie is set up that if they had a better director this could be a 4 star movie but he is not able to deliver the goods. Rosa Salazar is amazing in this and is able to deliver the Alita performance. She handles the serious scenes and the action scenes well. But the whole movie sets up this film and there no pay off. The only show him at the end but there is no battle. This movie can work if the sequel but as standalone the movie sets this big bag villain but you need to wait until the next movie if there is one to see him. The movie tries to sell Mahershala Ali as villain but he is puppet being mind control. Keean Johnson is terrible he really hurts this film. He drags every scene he is in.

953,rishis-28921,Beautifully presented and Entertaining as Hell,8,4 March 2019,"I had low expectations going into Alita: Battle Angel, especially seeing as I'm not a fan of flashy blockbusters or of the films of Robert Rodriguez (Spy Kids, From Dusk till Dawn) and James Cameron (Avatar, Titanic). But those expectations were shattered, and then some.By far the most compelling part of this film is its unique visual style. The animation genuinely blues the line between animated and live action filmmaking. The action scenes are on point and are the best parts of the film. The performances are amazing, especially from the consistently great Christoph Waltz and the towering Mahershala Ali.However, the film is flawed. The script and the writing feels a bit strange, as if it has been mistranslated from another language. The dialogue is probably the lowest aspect of the film for me and feels clunky and awkward. Fortunately Cameron and Rodriguez know exactly when to fling the audience back into the action with a lot of gutsy standoffs and brilliant set pieces showing the best of their abilities. The story is still very dynamic and exciting.Another negative point is the ending, which very clearly baits a sequel. I would have been absolutely fine with this and I want to see the next movie, but the movie cut off at a strange point which felt like the directors saying ""eh, let's just stop there"". I can understand why the studio would want a sequel and I'm not annoyed that they've set this up with that in mind, but they were quite heavy handed in the way they went about it.Overall this film is definitely recommended for anyone who's willing to let the dialogue go and enjoy an action packed, fun-filled romp with beautiful visuals and great fight scenes. 8/10.",Alita - Battle Angel
954,jasonbrenner,Whoa. See it.,9,22 February 2019,"It is a truly enjoyable film, regardless of a few plot holes. The cinematography is brilliant. Knowing that this is based off of a manga, it probably has some shots from the manga which only adds to the cinematic experience. The cast, for the most part, delivered their roles surprisingly well. Yes, there is some cheese here and there but nothing like Star Wars/Trek. There is a mixture of sets, costumes, props, and CGI. Just the visual aspect of the film alone showed love from the filmmakers. You can tell they want you to not just be wowed but also have curiousity towards the film's setting. The story feels like it's been adapted from something lengthy and epic so in comparison, it feels like it could be rushed but instead, the story flow is pretty natural. There are occasional cliché moments but none are too terrible. Alita is an inspiring character. She is extremely fierce and has immense strength. The trailers don't do her justice.

Still, definitely worth watching! I was very captivated by the trailer right from the start and was very much looking forward to the film and it totally lived up to my expectation! It is very refreshing to see a young woman, an outsider, be the hero of the film. Despite being action-packed, the plot is surprisingly emotional and moving. I think the director was daring enough to slow down the pace of the film by introducing silence and long pauses at intimate and intricate moments, where you can see the characters deep in thought and the bond and relationship between characters develop and mature. The film also does a great job providing depth to each of the characters by showing glimpses of their back stories so you can better appreciate why they are the way that they are and why they make the choices that they make.",Alita - Battle Angel

974,rhu-84864,Boring and weird,2,11 November 2021,"The acting is very stiff and wooden by all the actors, who are forced I would imagine to act with tennis balls on a stick. Christoph Waltz, so dynamic in Inglorious Basterds, is inert and lifeless. Even the fat nurse, who should get in some lively comments, has all the presence of a dour mortician. Alita's face is straight-up creepy, your eyes never get used to that face. The storyline is all over the place. The ending is a real groaner, with one of the side characters having been reanimated only to make some dumb decisions and then eat it again. If I wanted to watch people make dumb life decisions I would listen to millennials complain about how expensive everything is, as though this is the first time in human history that things have been expensive. The end of the film sets things up for a sequel that I hope will never come.",Alita - Battle Angel
975,Landon1620251,Misunderstood.,6,13 May 2020,"At the time of writing Alita is the worst opening film for Fox in 15 years (originally written on February 17, 2019). I can see why but I'll also frustrated. An adaptation of a respect manga starring a CGI girl and Christoph Waltz and Mahershala Ali is not the kind of combination that is going to catch the dumb movie going masses. This is not an established franchise that has entered pop culture.
That said, I'm not going to say that this is a masterpiece, or that the film's major problems are defendable. I will say that this is the type of over-produced, CGI heavy, flimsy scripted kind of project that the masses normally cling on to.
There is a lot to love here, though. Without hyperbole; Alita: Battle Angel has the best character animation of any film I have ever seen. Despite Alita character design consisting of enlarged eyes, there are shots in this movie where you will think you are looking at a real person. This is aided by the number of action set pieces she is involved in.
Beyond that you also have very good acting across the main cast... with one exception. I have no idea who could have approved putting Keean Johnson in a major role in this film. He is the weakest link here and that wouldn't be the end of the world if it wasn't for the fact that his screen time almost matches the title character. You even have the classic example of Keean's character's voice cracking during an emotional moment (and why did they keep that take?). Take it a step forward with the lines he has to read are Twilight levels of awkwardness.
The music is... ok. I think its worst crime is just not being very remarkable.
Despite my complaints, I still want this movie to succeed. Most of the acting is right for this kind of movie, the fight choreography is consistently enjoyable, and of course the incredible character animation.",Alita - Battle Angel

I guess you gotta be a sci-fi fan to some measure, but besides that, plenty of fun all the way down to the end, where you may find these 10% of cliche. It becomes a bit too predictable, but at the very-very end only! Alita is brilliant, the tech, the fights, the overall emotional impact... all the ingredients are there in very good balance.

979,michaelcollins10-1,BIG SURPRIZE,9,22 February 2019,"I haven't seen the Animated series or movie or graphic comics for Alita. But I have been waiting to see this movie since I first saw the trailer.
I was extremely happily surprised that the movie was not a poor reflection of the trailer and has a good story line that isn't overly complicated or ridiculously simple. It is entertaining and (SPOILER), ends with a feeling that it could be continued.
The special effect are amazing (as expected these days) and not done over the top as some movies do because of lack of story. After a few minutes into the movie, it is easy to forget that a lot of what you are watching is CGI Animation.
I highly recommend this movie to any one who is even a little interested in Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Adventure or Action. And there is even a little bit of a Romance story in this too. Happily the only thing missing, is Horror.There is a high level of violence in this movie, so perants of children under 12 should see it first to make sure there kids can watch it. Saying that, there is almost no ""Blood & Guts"" as the violence is mostly with Cyborgs/Robots.",Alita - Battle Angel

The picture has a decent, if simple story, and a character that combines extreme competence (which no sane man objects to) with a fit beauty, and a pleasant, gentle, loving and caring character (which sane men adore). Yes, it is a cartoony illusion, but one that works on as many levels as you can shake a stick at; and I will take this fantasy ride over Angelina-Jolie-badass-spy-nonsense any day of the week or, for that matter, a year.",Alita - Battle Angel
982,andrew-659-152933,For manga purists only,4,16 February 2019,"Tried hard to like this but its very derivative and formularistic.I haven't read the source material but from other comments it seems like this is quite a faithful adaptation. Unfortunately this just makes clear how juvenile and 1st non-sensical most manga is. Old blokes swinging ridiculous rocket-assisted hammers, pretty boy rogues. Alita's eyes are a perfect example of this. They're directly derived from manga and anime tradition but when rendered photorealistically they're gastly. At a distance they're OK but every close up of Alita plunges the viewer deep into the uncanny valley.The dialogue is often really bad. Many of the protagonists are unlikable-it's not a good sign when you're happy to see the main character's love interest die. Both times.In the end I wanted to like it but it's just so boring.",Alita - Battle Angel
983,amandawillett0,Amazing...simply AMAZING film!,10,17 February 2019,"There are honestly no words on what I can say about this film, it's such a well packed film with amazing graphics, emotions and above all else ACTION! Idk if there is any Manga/Anime film that has been out on screen, but if Alita is the first one, then well it's off to an awesome start for it's industry. Alita brings so much tender moments where you can't help yourself to feel and encourage this young woman (aka cyborg).
I don't want to say much just because I don't want to spoil anything. But I will say this film is a MUST SEE! If not for the story behind it then do it for the sound effects and graphics. I for sure hope there will be more films for this character for it definitely has to have a continuation. Other than that well done of a performance by everything it had in it and may we hopefully see soon The Battle Angel rise again! <3",Alita - Battle Angel

987,zoe-anthony,What a film!,10,18 June 2020,"Wow! What a film! I love the fact we have CGI and real actors mixed together. It might seem offputting at first, but once you start watching I was fascinated by Alita and her story. When she is found she does not know who she is what she is doing in Ido's house. Ido rescued her from a junk yard and has bought her back to life. We have a few different storylines going on, we have bounty hunters, self-discovery, love and the all present world above them Tiphares.The only way you can get to their eden of Tiphares is if you compete in a game and win. This game is like Nascar but with people racing around at some blinking speed on wheels, racing as their lives depended on it, because you know....it does!The fighting in this film was just epic! I was blown away by it, with the mixture of CGI again it just added such an extra element to the fighting. They are just choreographed perfectly, the movement, the action, it was spot on, Alita is just badass. Ed Skrein was just comical and I loved his scenes.As always with these types of films, love does not always prevail, it makes people make silly decisions and it's no different here! I may or may not (definitely was!) shouting at the TV at one decision at the end, I just hope there will be a second film to rectify these mistakes. And THAT cameo was just brilliant! I really need a second film.I have not read the manga comics so this was a new story to me, but the concept was brilliant and the directors, from what I can tell, have done it such a great justice (Plus I do love a good James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez film). The town was just breathtaking when you took in the sights around you, the visuals just have blown everything out of the water for me. It all just worked.I definitely recommend this one!",Alita - Battle Angel

Fight scenes were fast paste and unique with alot of cool flashy anime like movements. Great story that never felt boring and had a great female lead. Alita is a strong female protagonist that kicks butt and manages to be adorable while doing it. Solid acting all around and the CGI looked great on Alita herself. It did look a bit blurry when ahe was in full daylight due to the rendering of the light rays, but overall really nice. The setting is interesting and there is a bit of mystery as to how did things get this way. Some suprise twists kept things fresh and there was even some humor. Overall really great way to start out the year! Definitely worth owning.",Alita - Battle Angel
992,Nestor_Sanchez,Great origin story,9,17 February 2019,"I went in the cinema with low expectations as Hollywood adaptations of Manga have a terrible record. But having Rodriguez and Cameron involved assured not just a visual spectacle and great action, but a faithful adaptation of one of the most beloved Manga ever printed. The story is convulted at points, having crammed a couple of the volumes into an origin movie with little character development and sometimes cheesy dialog but that does not take away from this jewel of cyberpunk Sci fi: the amazing world building, character design, incredible animation and efects (worthy of an Oscar) and the intense battle scenes overcome any lack of depth that critics will surely point. This is an origin story with a inconclusive ending on which Alita has to overcome challenges ahead while solving the pieces from a forgotten past.

Luckily I found Alita to be very entertaining as well as beautiful to watch.It is clear that this movie was made by fans of the manga. A lot of changes were obviously made but most of them were for the better, and the makers do not seem to have forgotten the orgininal at any point. The movie takes its plot from a very large part of the manga and this is where its major (and perhaps only) problem is: it sometimes felt cluttered, as if it did not want to leave out anything. I would rather see that they had cut one or two characters, or made the movie a bit longer.Regardless of whether you love the manga or have never even heard of it, you should watch it. It is definitely worth your time and money.",Alita - Battle Angel
995,maphy775,EXCELLENT Sci-Fi Action Thriller - spectacle worth watching!,10,6 July 2019,"Well balanced Science Fiction movie. Has everything in it - romance, fiction, drama, sport, life story. Truly amazing!Considering year of event taking place, this movie is more of reality can happen in few centuries time.There is a floating city above (a place forbidden to go) what makes you say ""OK, this is not possible"" classifying movie as a fiction - ""What holds it up there? Magic?"" And of course, many people being mechanically enhanced.
The rest is a bit of technological presence of normal level for the time.Main figure is a person lost in time, forgotten, fighting for her place under sky.
She is a cyborg (cybernetic organism, a human with many synthetic replacements) with extreme power and combat abilities, made with forgotten technology lost for 300 hundred years. Amazing how teenager looking girl kick ass bad guys!CGI is on high level and looks awesome. Main actors are digitally recreated to fit in movie environment. Everything looks smooth and realistic.I must admit the movie pleasantly surprised me in every way. Yes, plot has holes. Advise about that - stop analyzing the script and enjoy the show. This is spectacle long waited after Avatar and signed by the same guy - James Cameron!In comparison to other movies of the kind, this is how Automata (disappointing) and Ghost in the Shell (ok, that was something different) should look like! I like Marvell Universe but in comparison it looks like unrealistic rubbish to Alita. Honestly, I like Doctor Strange and Thor, but the rest is more of whole lot banging the same drum! Honestly, some of those I don't remember the story!!!Alita: Battle Angel has my full recommendation. It is one of movies I go and watch over and over again.

The advertising didn't do it justice at all and caused a lot of ""reviewers"" to run rampant with one and two star ratings before the film even premiered. I'm really hoping word of mouth and social media will attract a lot more viewers.I don't normally give 10's but I just couldn't find anything wrong with this movie. And you are really missing out if you don't get to see it in 3D!!! The filmmakers really paid attention to every last detail and have created a visual masterpiece.Now, the worry that I had going into it is that that's all it would be. A really cool visual experience. But the story was just wonderful, the acting great and it gives you everything you want in a movie. Good action, a love story, good humor and a fully realized fantasy world that totally works! I wish the advertisers had let us know. Rosa Salazar, the actress who plays Aliya really made an impression on me. She brought a really bright innocent mood to Alita who is kind of like a child with the wisdom of an adult. An easy character to fall in love with!Also, I should mention this is based on Japanese anime (cartoons) and they made some video games about it as well. I knew nothing about the history of the character, and when I hear ""partially based on a video game"" the red flags go up. But don't fear, you wouldn't even guess that was the case if you weren't told beforehand.Don't listen to the trolls and people who love to bring things down that unfortunately plague every review site.

1009,pianotm-58404,How lucky is it that my first manga becomes the first really good Hollywood Anime adaption?,10,26 February 2019,"This movie is nothing I expected and everything I hoped for. When I first saw promotional material for this many many years ago, I was unimpressed and a bit worried. Gunnm, or Battle Angel Alita was my first ever manga. Battle Angel Alita is the reason I read manga. I was hopeful that it was produced by James Cameron, but when I saw the set photos and read that it was being directed by Rob Rodriguez, and this was about four years ago, I was quite dismayed. I thought it was going to go the direction of every other Hollywood live adaption of an anime. Yes, it's based on the manga, but it's also blended very heavily with the 1994 OVA. The first antagonist that Alita faces in the manga is Makaku. In the OVA, the first antagonist she faces is Griska. In this film, her first antagonist is Grewishka (This is simply an alternate Americanized phonology of Griska.). Interestingly, Griska is indeed a character in the manga, but he's a rollerball player that Makaku murders and steals his body so that he can beat Alita. You see where that concept went in this movie. Chiren is entirely a creation of the OVA. There are also concepts which were entirely created by this movie: Alita finds the Berserker body, whereas in both the manga and OVA, it's Ido that finds it and this occurs prior to the beginning of the story; Hugo introduces Alita to Rollerball whereas the OVA never makes it to Alita playing rollerball, and in the manga, Alita isn't introduced to rollerball until later, as two examples of what this movie does that's new.I was not a fan of the OVA, so I was a bit disappointed to learn that this movie drew heavily from it. Every bit of that vanished when I actually saw the movie. Now, I'm going to review this movie in a way I don't usually review things. I'm going to describe the opening scene and explain why it's so important. So, this should have a spoiler warning, but here's another. It's not a serious spoiler, since it's the beginning of the movie and there were a few spoilers above, but this is indeed a full on spoiler. The above spoilers simply mentioned key moments. This one full on describes a scene. You've been warned.This scene occurs after the opening scene where Doctor Ido discovers Alita in the Scrap Pile. Alita wakes up, the camera focusing on her overlarge eyes. She sits up, seemingly excited just to be awake. She has new hands and she enthusiastically examines them. She stands up, performs a few acrobatics in front of the mirror, and then heads downstairs where she meets her savior for the first time. She doesn't know him, and she doesn't know if she's supposed to know him. He takes her to the kitchen where they sit down at the table Alita is introduced to the people and comes to understand her situation. Doctor Ido gives her an orange. She immediately bites down into it, and promptly regrets it now that she has a mouthful of orange rind. Doctor Ido is glad to see that her taste receptors are working right, and suggests she'd enjoy the orange better if she peeled it, takes it from her and proceeds to do so. When he gives it back, she tries it again, and it's so delicious! She asks Ido if he has a name for her.
He says, ""Alita."" She loves it! She asks if she can keep it, at least until she finds out her real name. The scene jumps to Alita having a wrap or a burrito or some kind of tortilla sandwich at an outdoor table at a restaurant and a cute little homeless dog comes up to her. Without a second thought, she shares her meal the dog, jumping right down into the street to meet him. As this is happening, a sentinel, a giant battle tank of a robot is walking towards them. A passerby, a handsome young man named Hugo pulls Alita to safety, but the hungry dog braves the danger to finish the meal Alita has given him. Alita, seeing the danger, leaps under the feet of the sentinel to rescue the dog. She doesn't have difficulty. She doesn't stumble. She isn't clumsy. She's a full on ninja. She glides around the sentinel's feet as if they weren't even there. Inhumanly graceful. Alien. Frightening. When she comes out with the dog, safe and sound, she introduces herself to Hugo and thanks him.In five minutes, you've just learned everything about Alita you need to know. With nothing but a naming, an orange, a dog, and a tortilla wrap, the story has told you everything there is to know about Alita. Take a moment. Think about every other character introduction you've seen in a movie. What is the next film you can think of that gave you a character introduction this perfect? I couldn't think of one off the top of my head. It took me a few minutes to remember that in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Saavik gets a character introduction this good. There aren't many. This is a masterclass on character development. Film schools should be showing this scene and having their students analyze it. This scene needs to be in a school course.The whole movie is like this. From start to finish, the movie effortlessly, and often without words, tells you exactly what's going on in Alita's mind at any given time. This movie is a masterpiece. It's been awhile since I've seen a really good movie with Cameron's name on it. Yes, it's a Rodriguez movie, but Cameron was one of the writers. This is just as much his film, and finally, after 25 years, Alita is a movie that can stand alongside the likes of Aliens, True Lies, and Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Alita is an 80s action movie if the 80s had hyper-realistic CGI effects. This is what you've been missing in movies for nearly 20 years. Why aren't people seeing this movie?",Alita - Battle Angel
1010,smrhamedani-28253,What a waste of HOPE!!!!,5,28 July 2019,"At first when I read the names behind movie, I was so excited. The story and trailers got me but when the movie started my disappointment started too.
My first disappointment was the cast.I hated most of them specially the lead role.Her voice and her face reacts didn't fit the role. Jennifer Connolly was so lost in the movie and did not act. Hugo has no complexity where he should have due to the role and so many wasted characters but hopefully Andy Serkis wasn't part of this movie.
Second problem was that how predictable was the movie going on. And even it wasn't in a fun way like many other action movies. The plot contradicts it self in many occasions and the way it continued was so lame. Although the action and visuals were good but it wasn't enough.
At the end when a particular event happened I became so excited for the last fight of the movie, but almost immediately after that the movie ended like the writers had no idea how to end this and they told themselves :"" OK. No one will understand. They're dumb. We will tell them that we were planning for a sequel'""

1011,videogamenews,Alita the mediocre angel,4,23 July 2019,"The old saying ""don't give America a Japan brand"" applies to this movie: like Ghost in the Shell, producers, directors and actors just couldn't capture the manga's magic.Putting aside the BAD character designs, the movie tries to remix the main themes of the original in the typical ""hollywood action"" way. Too many plot twists are shown and tied together without proper closure, so much so that the movie ends in a cliffhanger.It's sad that once again we see the same mistakes made with ohter Japan-to-US productions. Characters miscast or badly writtem, whole parts of the story completely changed etc. Either they made another movie or they could have stayed closer to the original. This is half Alita, half generic american action.If you never heard of the manga, you can still enjoy this film for the nice camera work, the excellent environments and some funny dialogue. But, as a whole, it's another failed adaptation by someone who never should have touched the original series.",Alita - Battle Angel
1012,luismconceicaoo,Alita: Incredible Angel,9,16 February 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel despite the weak plot but embedded is able to develop around its protagonist, a teenage cyborg without memories.The partnership between Cameron and Rodriguez demonstrates capable of bringing the ""animation"" and the most essential of the manga, in this case the battles that in one hand may seem exaggerated but they are fantastic and well choreographed resulting in immersive scenes that I believe in 3D will have been fantastic.The futuristic environment is well constructed by the narrative and by the camera movements mainly in the fights where it involves the rapid change of places. The special effects are the best of the film and we can count on an indication by the Academy. In short, the effects make the film visually appealing to the audience.The villain despite having a small part in the film, is intimidating through his mode and his goal. The other characters do their work on the plot, but Christopher Waltz is fantastic as Dr. Iol and his dedication to Alita and interacting as a father to her.The movie ends with a cliffhanger and I hope the movie gets a good box office for two more films to complete the trilogy that has the ability to be close to the Matrix for its special effects and battles.And I highly recommend watching the movie on the big screen and if possible in 3D to take advantage of the cinematographic experience.",Alita - Battle Angel
1013,ceejay_bordas,"Delivers on action and worldbuilding, but fails on the plot and character development",4,23 February 2019,"(NOTE: This is just an audience member's opinion. Feel free to ignore, hate, or read this review and express your own thoughts on the movie.)Alita: Battle Angel is a stunning experience to watch in the theaters, even more so if it's watched in 3D. The film's trailer was hyped and pretty good. James Cameron has brought his talent and skills with heart and dedication, like one of his previous works, Avatar. The world and Cameron's vision of how his movie is going to look like felt really believable and real, and I wish I could also say that for the plot and the characters.I haven't seen the original manga and/or the anime, but it looked pretty brutal. I think it would have been better had they given this movie a rating of ""R-16"" instead of ""PG,"" because the amount of brutal scenes this movie had made me question how is this movie ""PG"" and how the film could really benefit if the scenes were made to be rated ""R."" The action scenes really deliver and are actually entertaining to watch, but when the film takes a breather and shows scenes of its characters interacting with one another, things began to fall apart, for me, at least, as an audience member, not a high-profile critic. The characters make some inconsistent choices that don't even match up with how they are represented in the film. The dialogue is at times okay, and at times, downright terrible. Some scenes were just corny and/or cliché for me. I don't see any chemistry in the movie's romantic sub-plot, and the movie's attempt at setting up a sequel was just.. eh, okay.Overall, it's not really a terrible experience for most audience members out there, but if you go to this movie expecting something game-changing or breathtaking, you may just end up finishing the movie with disappointment in your face. Watch the movie if you really want to, because this is just another one of these films that you may really appreciate and don't even care about the critics' opinion on the film. Go ahead and have a good time watching this one. I know one thing's for certain if there's a sequel, and that is that I'm not going to spend money watching the sequel because I'll just wait for a digital copy to be released. 4/10.",Alita - Battle Angel

1016,CharlesAncelle,Refreshingly fun,9,15 February 2019,"The recent output from the studios has been divisive to say the least. It is undeniable that we live in the age of sequels, franchises and reboots and, an age where studios take almost no risks and apply the same overused formula to every movie to a point where their plots seem indistinguishable from one another. If you disagree with that statement, you will probably disagree with my assessment of Alita.Now Alita is certainly not fully an exception to the rule, it is after all based on existing intellectual property, it is gearing up to be a franchise of its own, and it certainly follows many canonical plot elements that we have seen many times in recent years.However, what is incredibly exciting about it, is that it does so in a way that feels fresh and new, rather than stale and vapid.I would prefer not to spoil anything, the trailers have been surprisingly good at not revealing too much of the plot so I hope we can all keep it that way. However here is a very basic summary of the premise: Set five hundred years into a future where humans and cyborgs seem to have a fragile coexistence in a kind of lawless town, Dr. Dyson Ito (Christoph Waltz) finds Alita (Rosa Salazar) in a scrapyard and reanimates her. She has no memories of who she was before being found, but she turns out to have an incredibly strong and independent personality, with a childlike innocence and yet a deep sense of justice and, last but not least, combat skills that are unheard of. Her journey is therefore one of self-discovery, as well as a struggle to defeat the forces that corrupt and destroy what she holds dear in this city.Now there are many aspects that make this film incredibly unique and unlikely in the current production landscape. There is something genuinely heartfelt and innocent about it, just like Alita herself. We go on this journey through her perspective, and both her personality, Rosa Salazar's performance, and her CGI appearance make her powerfully endearing from start to finish.
The film is filled with sweet and intimate character moments that allow it to breathe away from the otherwise intense, action set pieces that also turn out to be surprisingly fresh and new as well.Alita also explores the inevitable sci-fi theme of what it is to be human in a world where our bodies can be almost completely synthetic, and, unlike Ghost in The Shell which couldn't stop spewing out pseudo-philosophical garbage every five minutes, Alita does it subtly, keeping everything subtextual, letting us taking it in and focusing primarily on her own humanity and journey.Films like Alita are incredibly rare these days and they are constantly threatened to disappear under the pressure for studios to prioritize profits over everything else, so I would strongly encourage whoever is reading this to please go to the theater and support it so we can continue to enjoy these little gems every once in a while.",Alita - Battle Angel

Another showcase on the possibilities of new technology. Characters are well built.The story was enjoyable, even though so many have adapted the ideas in other films, there are still elements of originality here.",Alita - Battle Angel
1020,TonFisch,Enjoyable experience,10,28 February 2019,"Story made sense to me (in some movies, I get lost thinking about the how and why because of a plot hole in minute 4, did not happen with this one).Action scenes were solid.Acting (especially voice) was like I would expect the characters to behave.Visuals are 10/10.When I payed attention, Soundtrack was good.Should probably mention that I did not know the story before. I just went to the theater and watched the thing.Spoilers ahead:
Overall, the movie gave a warm welcome, a reason why this is happening and then put you on the back seat for a ride. Nice mix of darkness and light, of action and calm. The buildup was a bit odd. Sometimes there was some tension, then it got lost to be picked up again.
Tension build, story gave some depth without throwing questions it was not answering. Good times.
Then the beginning came into context, it would later be the final and ending (I like that. Story elements that get picked up again. Gives it a nice round feel).
Epic fight scenes, not sure if the soundtrack was any good here, had to watch an epic-scale bar-brawl.
And then it came to an end, a conclusion (with a murder or two wich I don´t get why they are important).
The movie did not drag out, did not overstay its welcome, did not loosen the tension completly, did not put obvious&obnoxious ""more in the next one"" questions.
I like it. Will buy the BluRay when it comes out.The only thing that was wierd was that I saw the beginning twice (yes, in the movie theater, twice. Projector was set to 2D making the image flicker. Got fixed in 10 minutes and after a reboot).",Alita - Battle Angel
1021,jbsmth,Disappointing,6,25 February 2019,"While I had high hopes for this James Cameron penned, Robert Rodriguez directed film, it fell short of my expectations. The special effects are visually stunning, but that wasn't enough to overcome cheesy dialogue and wooden performances from the non-CGI characters, and the fact that the filmmakers appeared to end the movie about 20 minutes before the climax started. The poor box office totals in the U.S. reflect the overall quality of this film, but it's doing well enough overseas that a sequel will surely be made.",Alita - Battle Angel

Common, on rotten tomatoes... the score is very low compared to what I saw on screen.The action scenes are so well done. So much detail went into creating this world that we could see and feel. All the mechanics in the movie looked real and I am glad that they took their time in introducing the entire world of Alita.I loved the relationship between Ido & Alita. It was a very warm relationship and refreshing to see on screen. I also liked the design of the cyborgs, everything looked so smooth and good.Alita was fun to watch, as the viewers gets to see her as a tiny innocent girl who wants to be normal. She is so sweet in some scenes... very cute. However, the viewers gets to experience her transition from being just a cyborg type girl to become a badass fighter who will not stand in the presence of evil, challenging any foe, whether small or big, into battle.What a fun experience! I loved this movie... as I watched it 3x in a row. Rodriguez was 100% successful in creating this world, originally created from a manga, to an anime... and then to this! Congrats, you made a fantastic movie and all Alita Battle Angel fans will gladly pay money for plenty more sequels!!!Again, the ""professional"" critics got it wrong.

The production is amazing and very realistic one of the best I've seen and as with every James Cameron movie I wouldn't expect any less. The cast is ok although it makes me wonder why an actual character with real eyes wasn't enough - it worked in Westworld but apparently not for the producers of this film. Overall the movie started very promising and was progressing fine until the story got sloppy and fall into very cheap film flows, the kind of stuff you see in cheap karate movies. And the ending couldn't be less disappointing by leaving the obvious expectation for a sequel - really? A whole new movie for climbing up the pipe to get to the bad guy? It could be a great movie but unfortunately it is not and it gets 7/10 only because of it's great graphics and the cast.",Alita - Battle Angel

It captures the fantastical setting very well it all feels very well thought out and it has the right amount of mysterious lore, not too much forced exposition.Alita is an easy to love character without being too cookie-cutter strong female lead, even though she plays a fish out of water cyborg she's still 3-dimensional and interesting. The CGI for her looks great it fits seamlessly into the environment it's the closest I've seen to someone doing justice to a anime character,The bad guys in the movie are pretty commonplace ruffians, but that's because the true antagonist only has a relatively small part to play in the movie. Hopefully we'll get to see more of the true villain in a future project.All in all I'd recommend this for even the most skeptical of anime lovers, full-disclosure I haven't actually read the gunnm manga but based on what I've read and seen in the anime realm I'd wager this was a good adaptation.",Alita - Battle Angel

It was good to see him reign in some of his trade-mark silliness.
The visual here are absolutely spectacular. The character designs are so well developed and rendered, you forget that its CGI.
I personally was wanting more when it finished. Yes, the story was a little clunky I felt it had elements of Pinocchio a Ghost in the Shell, but it had a lot of heart and I hope it finds an audience. I deserves to. 9/10",Alita - Battle Angel

Rodriguez this movie become fenomena...his vision and fantasy he put in the movie makes Alita: Battle Angel were fantastic & entertaining from the first minute to the last.

They managed to stay close to the source and deviate just enough to widen the story for a whole movie, without morphing it into something else.

And boy it was badass. Forget the cliched plots or dejavu storylines aside. Just by following the emotions between the characters and actions alone, keeps me glued to the IMAX screen throughout the entire film and begging for more. I don't know but i instantly fell in love with this virtual Alita even though she's unreal. I know critics can chide her for the fake big eyes, small chin, but this somehow makes her looked more innocent, lovable and synonymous with the character. I'm not taking anything off Rosa Lazarus i think she still resemble her very, only thing is the 3D Alita looks way more emphathetical.

I almost didn't think it was possible for Hollywood to actually read and follow the source material. Who knew some of them were listening? This was very well done with some modifications from the original, but you can tell they were fans of the series. Alita was made with a plain looking face on purpose. I'm fine with the changes they made to her mouth to make her look more human. I was concerned how the eyes would turn out from the trailer, but they grow on you in a good way. Alita is both lovable and bad to the capital ""A.""The only reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10 was the ending felt a little rushed, but other then that. It was one heck of a beautiful film. All sci-fi fans are recommended to go watch this film. This is the level that Ghost in the Shell should have been, but wasn't due to not following the source material. I pray that other film makers are watching the direction of this film. There is something to be learned from it.

I really felt they should have left Nova as just a quick mention here or there instead of him having a active role in anything. Vector was almost completely useless as a character so if they do plan on continuing I hope he was saved somehow because I love the actor and the character is supposed to play a bigger part.

1054,livitsanis,A Cyborg for Generating Empathy,10,30 April 2019,"When I first saw Alita: Battle Angel, I walked into the theatre with a somewhat cynical skepticism, not too unwarranted, given how poor prior Hollywood manga/anime adaptations have been. I came out of the theatre in a daze, not knowing exactly how I felt about what I'd seen. The only certainty was, ""I need to see that again"". The next day's viewing confirmed what was already becoming obvious: I LOVE this movie. It's part of my life now. Over the next several weeks and six more viewings, not a day passed without frequently thinking about it, imagining what happened in the past for its characters, what possibilities are waiting in their future. There was a total engagement with this world, an eagerness to probe further. That's a rare achievement indeed when so often with big Hollywood movies my memory of them flies away the moment they're finished.There are moments and images in Alita: Battle Angel that are burned into my brain. It's a wonderful, beautiful, inspiring, strange, fascinating work of pure cinematic gold. It offers a compelling, fully-realised other world, with tantalising glimpses of a larger canvas waiting to be explored. It has quiet, delicate beauty and loud, pummeling action. There's sweetness, pure melodrama, wild over-the-top violence, dark and disturbing concepts. This isn't afraid to play with its tone, shifting between moods precisely, while always being sincere. There's no cynicism here. They mean it, and I believe it. Every time I watched it I felt such deep gratitude that this film exists.While the film is a triumph of production design and visual effects, the reason it stands out so strongly and why it has inspired such passionate devotion is because of the emotional sincerity embedded within its story and characters, especially the magnificent titular heroine. Alita's producer Jon Landau was asked if he was glad it took 19 years for the film to be made, since the FX technology had advanced enough to make the film the way they wanted, and Jon was speaking my mind when he answered, ""I'm glad it took 19 years because we found Rosa Salazar"". Salazar is this film's irrepressible beating heart. Her performance is unlike any I've seen on film. This CGI performance-capture cyborg girl is more real, more honest, more alive, more unabashedly sincere than many movie characters played by purely flesh and blood actors. Salazar and the animation team should all feel deeply proud of what they accomplished here.",Alita - Battle Angel

The plot development I also really felt with this movie and there were also some surprises for me. The only thing I found a bit weird and sudden was the ending of this movie.I thought Alita was going to climb up to Zalem and avenge Nova (the villain) after what he did. But no, just acknowledgement by Alita and she continued with the ball game and became Final Champion. At least it's not cliché, that's all I can say.",Alita - Battle Angel
1065,Pugnisher,VISUAL SPECTACLE,7,1 March 2019,"Having seen the trailers and teasers play over and over, like a record on repeat - it almost felt like by the time ""Alita: Battle Angel"" hit theatres, audiences would be burnt out on the films appeal. The visuals looked fantastic. The world looked enthralling. The characters looked intriguing. And the cast looked powerful.All of these thing played out to their full-most potential here; bar but a few exceptions. It did not feel exhausted and repetitive as had been presumed originally. Instead, it felt new, bright and full of promise and potential.The visuals in this film are unbelievable. The immense attention to detail and realism put into even the most profound aspects of this film - aspects which would have ben forgiven for being 'fake-looking' - are not given such treatment, but instead, granted the same respect as the things that had to unequivocally 'look real' to draw in and ensure the attention and belief of its audience. Nothing is held back here. The world of ""Alita: Battle Angel"" feels as true to real as our own.Where the world is beautiful and broad, Alita herself is impeccably crafted. The same can be said for many other 'enhanced' individuals which grace this film with their uncanny appearances. Alita is alive here. You feel for her and at times, dare to forget that she, while not absent of feelings or emotions, is in fact not human - but a machine. And this is the very idea and message which Director Robert Rodriguez is masterfully weaving and crafting; appealing to the humility and humanity of us all.The battle scenes and action sequences in this film, much like every other visual medium to be presented here are phenomenal. Wide shots allow us to see all of the action we ever so much desire to be amidst, and close shots allow for a tight, personal, dangerous feeling when it is so required. None but praise can be said for such things.However, the story of ""Alita: Battle Angel"" suffers from Hollywood's desperate need to sequel bait. It leaves stories with open and unsatisfying endings; something that even a film such as this falls a victim to.
While the films story does leave much to be desired from the get-go, the ending detracts so much from the film that it leaves audiences almost wondering what the purpose of the film and world they sat through and became invested in was for to begin with. It's not done with respect or elegance, but rather, with brutish, clumsiness and a groan of Hollywood greed.The ending feels cut off. As if it had been filmed and there had been another hour of this film sitting somewhere on the cutting room floor, but instead, was rolled up and placed away to drag out another two hour movie which might bring in another multi-million dollar opening week when the filmmakers decided it was time for another pay-check.Such things can be said for a great many films which are far less entertaining and have had far less integrity and respect given to them by their creators, crew and cast. But for ""Alita: Battle Angel"", the story gripes and the obvious eagerness to spit out a sequel do not take away too severely from the visual spectacle of it all. If you're wanting a deep, multilayered, character driven film -- this will not quite hit the spot. But if you're ready to switch off, sit back and enjoy the visual spectacle of it all and appreciate the lightly dusted story which weaves its way into it all?You might just like this one.",Alita - Battle Angel
1066,AlbJohFan,Nice to see the media and websites aren't censoring reviews of this like they are with Captain Marvel (2019); this one deserves praise.,8,26 February 2019,"This is a movie greater than the sum of its parts - and they are good parts. The special effects are marvelous, and lend themselves well to the style of the manga this was adapted from. It's a blend of photo-realistic and stylized that catches the eye while making the characters and things in this world seem more than computer code or props. While the story isn't ground-breaking, but it's decent, exciting and a breath of fresh air.Alita herself is a well-rounded and endearing protagonist and a badass cyborg. The twist about how to get to the elitist city of Zalem is horrifying but that makes the triumph of the heroes even sweeter. I highly recommend this film and hope it gets a sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel

sequences, powerful performances and interesting plot setup are brilliantly close to its graphic novel roots, the muddled screenplay leaves the subplots uncleared.Maybe an imminent sequel needs to finish off this uncertain battle.",Alita - Battle Angel

Its not without its problems though as they tried to cram far too much into the movie making it feel bloated.

I saw the trailer and it reminded me of the Ghost in the Shell live action from 2017 which I really enjoyed watching. Well, I was not disappointed.This film had suspense, romance, passion and raw emotions that I was not expecting to feel. The character development was spot on and now I want to go read the manga because I want to know the whole story.

1073,theninjawonton,Better than expected,10,21 February 2019,"When I first saw the trailer, I thought it looked a somewhat dumb... Especially with the big eyes.However, seeing the film showed me how wrong I was.
The big eyes did not ruin the character nor the film, in fact it made me like Alita even more. The action was amazing no doubt, and the world as a whole was very immersive.I admit, some scenes/lines were cheesy, but nothing to ruin the movie.
The best part of the film was the character development of Alita. To avoid spoiling, I'll simply say you become emotionally invested in this character.Overall, you must see this movie! Alita is an amazing film.",Alita - Battle Angel
1074,theninjawonton,Alita is a spectacular and refreshing film,10,30 April 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel is the first of its kind. Rather than take the formulaic approach, the film takes risks; a breath of fresh air in today's movie industry.+Strong Character
Despite being 99% CGI from a technical aspect, and 99% machine/cyborg from a story-telling aspect, Alita is VERY HUMAN; one in which the audience can strongly relate to. She is a loving, compassionate, and selfless soul who fights for what she believes is right. Her journey throughout is phenomenal, and her character growth is quite possibly one of the strongest aspects of the film. Because of how well James Cameron, Robert Rodriguez, and Jon Landau nailed these elements, I personally found Alita to be an inspiration to my general life. Of course, this would not have been possible without Rosa Salazar's oscar-worthy performance; you become emotionally invested in her character.+ Very Immersive World
Iron City was magical. After leaving my IMAX 3D theatre, I felt slightly disappointed. Not about Iron City (which was AMAZING), but because I'd be leaving this magical make-belief world JC & RR gave us, and return to the boring reality we lived in. The city is very different from today's modern cities (e.g. New York, Seoul, etc...) and yet it felt very legitimate. Very real. It was truly an experience I won't forget.+ Amazing Action Sequences
The action sequences are very exhilarating. I've seen the film multiple times, and still I find myself at the edge of my seat, heart rate rising!Weakness
Cheesy dialogue. There are some cheesy lines in the movie, however, this does not discount the film's glory in any way.Also, for those who are still thrown off by her big eyes; give the film a chance! Within 2 minutes of seeing Alita, the big eyes became seamless and I ended up forgetting about it. Furthermore, it adds an entirely new level of expression, emotions, and depth to the character.Conclusion: Strong female lead relatable to all audiences, inspirational with a strong message for self development, an entirely new world worth immersing yourself in, and amazing action scenes.",Alita - Battle Angel
1075,jeffbrewer-90703,Fantastic Movie.,10,26 February 2019,It's been so long since I left the theater feeling excited about a movie I just watched. Great story and no politics. Hopefully we can get more movies like Alita.,Alita - Battle Angel
1076,Q-Panda,For fans only...but awesome for the fans,6,12 March 2019,"I'll start with the tl;dr: If you're not an anime or cyberpunk fan, this film will leave you cold. If you're not already familiar with the GUNNM/Battle Angel anime or the original GUNNM/Battle Angel Alita manga, this film will leave you confused.BUT. If you're a fan of GUNNM/Battle Angel/Battle Angel Alita, you will probably love this film.Alita: Battle Angel isn't just a great translation of GUNNM to live action-it's possibly the best live-action adaptation of an anime or manga title to come out of Hollywood. You can really tell that James Cameron (who wrote and produced the film, which he's been trying to make for thirty years) and Robert Rodriguez (who Cameron hand-picked to direct it once he accepted that he would probably never get to do so himself) have a great appreciation for the material and the story.The plot is a mostly accurate condensation/blend of the first four manga volumes. This does leave the ending as an obvious sequel hook, since the full manga is nine volumes. Again, fans of the material won't mind, but non-fans might.The main cast is pretty solid. Christoph Waltz is picture-perfect as Ido. Rosa Salazar does a great job as Alita. Jennifer Connolly and Mahershala Ali turn in good performances (as Chiren and Vector, respectively) but weren't given a lot to work with. And Jackie Earle Haley hams it up well as the film's ""heavy"", Grewishka. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is pretty much unremarkable and mostly unmemorable.My biggest complaints about the film are two. First, the pacing is horrible. The first two-thirds of the film feels like it's dragging whales, and act three feels like it's on coke and speed at the same time. I don't think this was a story problem, because the plot rolled through at a pretty consistent pace. I think it's more of an editing, and possibly directing, issue; scenes in the first part of the film get lots of lingering, detailed shots, while act three is full of quick-cut action. That's not just a matter of the difference between acts-there's plenty of action in the first two acts, and act three has its share of more sedate, dramatic moments. And the ending, while accurate to that point in the manga story, just kind of arrives suddenly, at a point where you feel like the film's about to go into a second, bigger climax, or perhaps an epilogue.My second complaint is the eyes. The Internet went nuts over the ""anime""-ing of Rosa Salazar's eyes when the first trailer showed them, and in the end, I think the backlash was warranted. Yes, there is a blink-and-you'll-miss-it in-movie explanation for why her eyes are so big, but they're still horribly distracting. Salazar's eyes are highly expressive at their normal size, so enlarging them just makes it creepy. It makes her look like a Pixar character dropped into an otherwise live-action film; you can't help but notice how non-human her face is in every lingering closeup. Given that her cyborg body is already CGI, it makes her feel a little less real. And Alita needs to feel real.My 6/10 rating is based on the film's overall appeal in general. Strictly for fans, I'd give it 8 or 9. But if the title itself doesn't already draw you to this film, you'll probably feel like you wasted two hours after watching it.",Alita - Battle Angel
1077,bfgthmas,Wow jus wow!,10,2 April 2019,"I had never read the manga or even heard of it but this is amazing the cinematography the fight choreographing the CGI and realism is all just mind-blowing the story is intensely emotional and the interesting is extremely good faces in lines packed with passion the writers and directors really outdid themselves there's not a dull scene in the movie if you ask me. I have gone back for multiple viewing.

1082,LilSpriteReviews,Fun SciFi action film!,9,13 July 2020,"SPOILERS AT THE END , will show warning before ****
I'll start off by saying, I had a great time watching this movie. I love the world it's set in, the vfx look fantastic, and for me the story is really interesting. I love the different attachments on each cyborg and the design of the each character including the main star, Alita. PLUS the motorball scenes are awesome and what I was hyped on seeing. I do not know the source material so I'm looking at it from a fresh perspective and I really enjoyed this movie. I loved the direction from Robert Rodriguez and am a fan of some of his work. Not saying this movie goes without any problems script wise. There are some cringy scenes/ dialog but I feel if you are looking for some solid entertainment and this interest you, then I highly suggest this movie.
SPOILERS STARTING NOW**First off Alita is a badass and pretty much runs through everybody in her way throughout this whole film. I do enjoy that, but I kind of wish she maybe faced a bigger challenge or someone that can almost match her in a way (besides the scene where she gets sliced down to just one arm and even then she does something to come out on top). At the same time though, I do like the backstory for her and understand why she is like that, she is very innocent as she is first brought into this new world but when the time comes explodes into the ultimate fighter. She is a really cool character. I really enjoyed that bar fight, gave me some western vibes with future tech and pretty much all the action is handled excellent. I liked Cristoph Waltz character and how he was secretly a hunter warrior, but also helps others by being this cyborg doctor as well. As I stated before, I don't think acting was real bad just some scenes with cringy dialog especially with Alitas love interest, but I think you can get past that because overall everything else is fantastic and left me wanting so much more. The big thing that kind of left me setback is Nova, it barely showed him till the very end and just ended with revealing who he was, which is a cool casting choice. It just built up to this one person who is in control of it all and I was just expecting something more than what we got at the the end for Nova. One thing it did do was leave it wide open for a sequel and I really hope they decide to continue this with making future installments maybe leading up to something huge. My actual rating is 8.6/10",Alita - Battle Angel
1083,knutsindre,An achievement,9,18 September 2019,"Short: Underrated. 9/10 for what is does in this space between animation and acting, and the world it builds. We've come a long way since Roger Rabbit.Long: This movie feels like a real technical achievement. Seeing it makes me want to know more about the locations and the history it beautifully renders. The light is just spectacular and adds so much to the atmosphere. The liveliness of the acting also truly flows through the CGI on Alita, and creates an amazing sense of watching something unique. You will suspend your disbelief and feel Alita is real, this alone makes the movie worth seeing. The other androids too are masterfully created.Beyond this, the movie is simply fairly paced and entertaining and tries to send a message about typical ""sexy-born-yesterday"" characters (I hear this is even more prominent in the manga the movie is based on). I'm not sure it delivers fully on this. This is the thing I wish is that they would have taken even more time to explore, along the relationships, people and locations. I wish the poverty they speak of was more explored as well.But everyone is a critic. I think you'll like this one however. Or at the very least be fascinated by it.",Alita - Battle Angel
1084,FredOnFilm,'A painful viewing experience.',5,11 February 2019,"In the year 2563, cybernetics expert Dr. Dyson Ido (Christoph Waltz) discovers the discarded remains of a female cyborg (Rosa Salazar) buried within an ancient scrap yard. Alita is put back together and awakes with no memories to discover that she is in possession of a set of extraordinary skills including enhanced athleticism and combat expertise. Based on the popular manga series, Alita: Battle Angel is the long-term passion project of producer James Cameron, who has been trying to get this film made for decades. With the recruitment of director Robert Rodriguez, I was excited to see the collaboration between two of my favourite filmmakers, despite my minimal interest in the source material. Alita: Battle Angel certainly has its moments, but to be quite frank it was a painful viewing experience that fell short of my expectations.During the closing credits, I was astounded to see both Cameron's and Rodriguez's names listed as co-screenwriters for the film. How is it possible for such talented filmmakers to lower their bar this far? This film features some of the worst dialogue I have ever seen in a motion picture. This is most egregious during the romantic scenes between Alita and her love-interest Hugo (Keean Johnson), a cringeworthy pairing that harkens back to Anakin and Padmé in Star Wars: Attack of the Clones. The portrayal of the film's villains is also unintentionally laughable at times. Look out for Mahershala Ali, undoubtedly one of the most talented actors working today, really phoning it in during one of the film's more weighty scenes. The narrative of Alita fairs little better. All the key story threads have been seen before and the plot ultimately ends up going nowhere. This is only worsened by yet another desperate attempt to forge a multi-film franchise. With the lukewarm critical response and modest financial tracking predictions, I sincerely doubt that we will ever see another instalment of the Alita series. Thank heavens for that.It wasn't a complete disaster however. I can't deny that this is a visual masterpiece that will make it worth seeing on the big screen for many. There are several action sequences throughout where these breathtaking aesthetics really show off the films $200 million dollar budget, most notably during the fast-paced Motorball scenes. The world-building of Alita is impressive and Cameron/Rodriguez have realised and brought to screen a terrifying vision of an apocalyptic future where law and order the way we know it no longer exist. The films remarkable budget has also enabled the producers to recruit no less than 3 Academy Award winners (Mahershala Ali, Jennifer Connelly & Christoph Waltz). Overall I would say the cast does pretty well despite the lack of any compelling dialogue to work with. The stand out character for me is Alita, who is full of heart and instantly likeable, despite her cybernetic exterior and enhanced fighting skills. The father/daughter relationship that blossoms between Alita and Dr. Ido is sweet and provides the emotional core of the movie. Unfortunately these highlights are few and far between and don't make up for the film's numerous shortcomings.Despite all this, I wouldn't necessarily want to discourage anyone from checking it out if they're at all intrigued by the film's premise. Fans of the original source material or of manga/anime in general, will probably get a better kick out of this more than most. Unfortunately this is a movie that just didn't work for me and despite its stunning visuals, left me flabbergasted that a studio would green-light such an appalling script when working with a $200 million budget.

Christoph Waltz is great as always, but especially Alita is truly wonderful, something i didn't expect after watching the trailer.

Walks right, moves in the action scenes perfectly, but close ups just don't cut it. Give her a more human look, as she is a cyborg able to fool people until they see her complete body with all things being mechanical. As a viewer we should be just as fooled as those she is supposedly interacting with.

The story build-up was incredibly slow-paced, and there wasn't really anything complex about it either, it was just a linear progression of how Alita was revived and how she got acquainted with the unfamiliar surroundings because she has amnesia, how convenient but a lazy use of plot-device.What bothered me the most about this movie is that it has the typical Disney movie vibe, overly simplified good vs evil theme, and an overly sentimental human element to go with overly dumbed-down plot of fighting overly dumb villains with zero character.This sad Disney-wannabe movie also managed to shove in a teeny-bopper love story which was just a distraction, and because of a ridiculous premise that Alita is a 300 year old cyborg but has the mind of a teenage girl, I simply couldn't identify her as real and couldn't connect.Besides from some landscape shots of the city, there's nothing amazing about the visuals either, the action scenes were nothing special as well, the height of the action came in a rollerball game basically 3/4 into the movie and by that time I was already zoned out, and to be honest it was no better than a movie I saw in the recent time frame, Ready Player One which as a whole was a lot more satisfying as a movie than Alita.And then there's the cringe-worthy ""Alita franchise wants a sequel"" ending, where she never even gets to confront the boss villain, basically screaming for a sequel. This movie really deserves 1 star, but I gave 3 because of the visuals and the soft spot I have for sci-fi.I think the source material was a bad choice, they picked the one that has female lead because girl-power is a hot trend but I've never heard of this manga which was supposedly the source material.For the love of sci-fi don't make Alita sequel, I don't care for it.",Alita - Battle Angel

1100,joao-silva-518-428051,Demasiados erros.,4,19 August 2019,"Disappointed.
The movie is fantastic, the balance between action scenes and calmer scenes is very good.
And they managed to insert a human-like character in such a way that she, Alita dissolves among the rest of the characters.
But, on the flip side of the coin, the production didn't seem at all concerned with making such a realistic movie as they were concerned with Alita's realism.
You can't see 8 minutes of a movie, without (huge) mistakes in the scenery, the behavior of the peoplegens, the dialogues and much much more.
There is nothing in this life that is totally perfect, but Alita is a great pity because it beats all records. Many bugs that could be fixed with photoshop.

Main heroine keeps her scars and damage through the whole picture and heartbreaking moments for the character is also mean _something_ to the viewer. Fortunately, the flick doesn't try to have overcomplicated story with some pseudo-philosophical subtext or political statement, it's just as much as it needed to be - silly enough, naive to some extent, but exactly how it needs to be.

Through conflicts she learns she is a battle warrior design for war. She needs to kill the guy who runs everything from the sky city. And that's it, the movie ends wanting you to go see the sequel. This whole thing was a setup for the next film, which could be a more interesting and deeper story if that sky city is similar to what I remember from the Manga.The dialog was terrible, especially with the scenes between Alita and Hugo.

It's a serial. You're watching a series. Part 2 coming soon. If I hadn't already thought I was wasting my time watching it, this hammered the point home.

1113,cellocrow,"Great, but needs that sequel to feel complete",7,20 August 2019,"I had heard enough buzz to gather I would probably get some enjoyment out of this movie. I was still shocked by how much fun I had, even though it was slightly cheesy, some of the character motives were unclear, and the romantic interest was dry at dirt. The plot took me by surprise multiple times, and all of the action sequences were fantastic! I also love how it (un)intentionally subverted cliches from the genre, letting a female lead shine and having a legitimate reason why she's overpowered.However, this movie is the epitome of why I hate that movie companies operate under the assumption there will be a sequel. Alita's ending was left way too open because Alita's story isn't over, but there's a chance it IS over if the sequel doesn't get greenlit. I've seen way too many franchises fall flat because of this issue, and Alita isn't deserving of that (compared to most of them), but I don't trust the sequel to happen since it wasn't a smashing success. I just wish they could have kept Nova more vague and that she think everything was over after Vector died, instead of Nova making his presence known. It's just frustrating to have an incomplete story.Regardless, I will be recommending my friends and family see this, because I was really impressed by it. I will also probably be buying this.",Alita - Battle Angel

The CGI is actually amazing, but everything else about this film is great too. Within the first few minutes I forgot about Alita's oversized eyes, and got sucked into this amazingly detailed and interesting world Rodriguez has somehow managed to bring to life. There are a few, brief moments that are a little too melodramatic, but the rest of the movie is so good, I really wasn't bothered by them too much. It's worth seeing for the action sequences alone, but there's much more than that to stay for here. Definitely give this movie a chance. You won't be disappointed!",Alita - Battle Angel

I went in with very low expectations and it didn't help. The movie at best is a very average action movie with great special effects. But as an adaption and as basic movie it's a complete mess.The plot of the film is this in short: Nova, the immortal ruler of Zalem, wants Alita heart, which for some reason is lost tech that he must have for reasons not said, and gets a rogues gallery to try to get it from her. Along the way Alita tries to remember her past.The film doesn't follow though with most of plot points it bring in.This film is loosely based or really a bad remake of the 90's OVA with scenes made up from looking at the trade paperback covers. The condensed original story of the OVA condensed again and major changes of original story lead the movie in to plot holes that can make you shake your head. This also leads the movie down to little to no cohesion and a shadow of the source.As an adaption, characters are changed both in age, personality, and there relationships. The characters are here many in name and appearance.The movie is hung up on Alita's past and showing it. The film is filled with celebrity camos mainly from Robert Rodriguez's other works. They seeming created characters and scenes just to have them.There some very cringe worthy and cliche dialogue throughout the film.This quot from major film review sums up the movie well:
""Alita: Battle Angel sheds (or ignores?) any need for coherence anywhere except in what's projected up on the screen""
I would stress the ""ignores coherence""The movie is PG-13 how they got that is a miracle. It must have skated by the graphic violence under ""fantasy.""People can like this for its visual effects and 3D. I can say its probably the best 3D I've seen in a film. But it fails as movie.

The cast is mostly great, the action tight and the world building spectacular.I hate 3D, and have ever truly enjoyed one film in the format: James Cameron's Avatar. For once, however, I decided to break my no-3D-rule and went for the whole IMAX 3D experience, wondering what Cameron & Co had cooked up in the kitchen since Avatar came out almost 10 years ago. I was not disappointed. Technically this is a masterpiece, and for once the format felt legitimate. This truely is a better way to see this film, with such a huge scope and (literally) multilayered world.See this film! Bring your friends/loved ones and buy the biggest bucket of popcorn you can get.

Robert Rodriguez created a dim, over-crowded post-apocalyptic setting that seemed to resemble more of a Battlebots episode at times than a potential realistic world of the distant future. Alita is extremely appealing to the eye, and it's fun watching Mahershala Ali play a villain, and some of the fighting scenes are exciting.

Dr. Ido (Christopher Waltz) does a commendable job how ever this movie does not bring out a great deal of his acting ability you would expect from someone so talented. The villain's themselves are not particularly memorable even though they are brought further by decent to good actors and actresses.I will say I think this film has something to work with and something to build on if they do decide to go ahead with a sequel, but in terms of the ""wow"" factor I may not even watch this again unless it's on Netflix.",Alita - Battle Angel

-stays true to the source material (a manga) making it the best live action adaptation of an anime or manga to date
-extremely likeable protagonist that really comes to life (Rosa Salazar killed it)
-Christoph Waltz played a really good father figure
-leaves a lot of mystery (room for sequels) without being dull itselfBad:
-Hugo was definitely miscasted. The only bad thing that stuck with me as I left the theater was how bad Hugo was portrayed.

1133,janichsan-1,Does the manga absolutely justice,9,14 February 2019,"I went to see ""Alita: Battle Angel"" with an equal mixture of anticipation and dread. The original manga by Yukito Kishiro is one of my absolute favourite graphic novel and past live-action adaptations of mangas often turned out to be terrible.But not in this case. James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez absolutely succeeded in adapting the manga in a fantastic movie.The plot is mostly a remix of the first two volumes of the manga, with a bit of the Motorball arc in volumes 3 and 4 sprinkled in, and a few moments taken from later volumes. For the most part, the adaptation sticks very closely to the original: they absolutely nailed both the personalities and the looks of the characters, and many scenes, action sequences, and dialogues are takes straight from the manga. Two major characters have been created for the movie: the former Zalem citizen Chiren (Jennifer Connelly) and the cyborg henchman Grewishka (an unrecognisable Jackie Earle Haley), who serves as one of Alita's major antagonists and essentially takes the role of Makaku from the manga. Two major changes from the manga are Doc Ido's (Christoph Waltz) background and the origin of the name ""Alita"": Alita was originally Ido's and Chiren's daughter, but was killed by a drug addict cyborg. There are a few other deviations from the manga, but these don't change much, or will affect potential sequels at most.Alita (Rosa Salazar) is one of the best digital characters realised so far. There are only a few scenes where the CGI looks a bit dodgy. And yes, here unnaturally big eyes are initially somewhat weird, but I found myself to accept them quickly. The Iron City (the Scrapyard from the manga), the setting of the movie, is exquisitely realised and excudes the sense of a real place.I'm hard pressed to actually find some negative things to say about the movie. At most, some of the changes they made in this adaptation (especially Ido's personal background) are a bit too blunt, and a few character-focused scenes seem a bit hurried (I guess there have been edits to keep the movie in the two-hour-range), but these are minor niggles which I could easily see past.For the most part, I had a hell of a time and really had to bite my tongue to not squeal loudly for joy during some scenes. I left the theatre with a huge grin on my face, hoping that Alita: Battle Angel gets a sequel (which the movie certainly sets up).This is the adaptation I was waiting and hoping for almost 20 years.",Alita - Battle Angel

The animation is amazing and the action sequences are exciting.The only issue, I feel is that there is too much of the story or rather backstory left untold.

So the arch villain is never confronted, he is apparently all powerful in so much as he has puppets all over the city, so what's stopping him from just having her killed or those that help her? Her boyfriend dies without anyone really ""paying"" for it. Would be like watching John Wick and the guy who kills his dog gets zero punishment.
At the end of the movie she is taking her uniquely powerful cybog body and using it to race, presumably to be able to go up to the city and take revenge.

There were some plot holes here and there that made me think but to be honest, everything really seem to fit within characters' emotions and actions.
With non-stop action this was a movie I really enjoyed. Characters were really likable, no matter how gruesome they were. Each blow struck me in, whether it was horror, emotion, or a feeling of excitement.It really feels like one of those movies where I'd like to see more and more, especially knowing there were multiple volumes of the manga series.

The movie not just a science fiction show, it show u discovery of life, fatherly love, romance and breathe taking fight scene. The character development for a Alita will make u love her personilty and do not stand by in the presence of evil.One thing I don't like is the marketing for this movie, I see this show trailer on a second hand computer and the trailer don't leave a deep impression for me. I see this show with low expectation cause other show is full house. And Wow! This show is master piece.",Alita - Battle Angel
1147,kylefast-02482,"Just, Wow!",10,11 May 2019,"This movie is Manga in live action. The action scenes are amazing, but the movie still has characters with a lot of heart. I enjoyed every second of this film. I've seen it 3 times now and it hasn't lost any of it's charm.

I will never understand the purpose of going through all of this just to leave you on a cliffhanger unless there will be a part two?

But I sure enjoyed this movie so much more than captain Marvel. I could give a crap if captain Marvel lived or not. But Alita?!?! That character is awesome and I knew nothing about Manga. My only regret was paying to see Captain Marvel in the theater and skipping Alita (because I didn't know what it was.). It wasn't until I rented Alita at Redbox, that I was blown away. Not only did I watch it twice during my rental (something I rarely do), I went out and bought the 3D, UHD Blu-ray of Alita. The 3D was fantastic!!!!!!!",Alita - Battle Angel

1155,erwast,The great live-action manga adaptation movie to watch over and over again,9,6 October 2021,"With his 1992 debut of ""El Mariachi,"" Robert Rodriguez announced himself a director with an eye for action. His movies tend to carry an unmistakable playfulness, like in the all-out barroom brawl between humans and vampires in ""From Dusk till Dawn"" and the bizarre yet stylish ""Spy Kids"" franchise in which two siblings face off against some truly surreal-looking enemies. Rodriguez brings this fun-loving, action-fueled touch to the big-screen adaptation of Yukito Kishiro's popular manga, Battle Angel Alita, salvaging a project that had languished in development hell since the early aughts. James Cameron, who co-produced the refashioned ""Alita: Battle Angel"" and co-wrote the screenplay with Rodriguez and Laeta Kalogridis, originally picked up the project around 15 years ago before eventually handing the reins over to Rodriguez. The script is still somewhat unwieldy, chock full of explanations about how robotic bodies work and the history of the decaying setting known as Iron City. Yet, underneath multiple levels of plot and world-building, there's a weirdo heart keeping the action moving along. The movie's star is a promising Rosa Salazar as the namesake hero, a mysterious yet powerful teen girl bot with oversized anime-style eyes and a good and very powerful heart that could power a city. Alita is the last of her kind, a superior enemy who was somehow were defeated by the humans. After she was found in a scrap heap, Alita is brought back to life with the help of a fatherly doctor, Dr. Ido , a paternal relationship that gives ""Alita"" some of its more stranger moments. More straightforward is the relationship Alita has with a secret nemesis, Chiren , Dr. Ido's former wife, and Vector , a smooth-talking kingpin who promises almost anyone who will listen to him a ticket to Zalem, the city hovering in the sky holding society's upper class over the heads of the poor below. Many of his movies feature Latino actors, like Danny Trejo in the ""Machete"" movies and Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara in ""Spy Kids,"" and the trend continues with ""Alita"" as the Peruvian American Salazar gets the chance to lead a big-budget movie. He includes Spanish and English signs in Iron City, and some of the extras can be heard speaking Spanish in the background. It's still rare to hear or see Spanish spoken in sci-fi movies about multilingual futures unless the films are from Latin America.""Alita"" draws inspiration from various sci-fi sources, like the physical divide between the rich and the poor in ""Metropolis,"" the mysterious femme being with incredible powers of ""The Fifth Element,"" and the multilingual, neon-lit grimy future world of ""Blade Runner,"" to name a few. Iron City is a place similar to what we have seen in other movies, but it's outfitted with enough differences to tell it apart, like making the society corrupt enough for serial killers and robbing cyborgs of their mechanical parts and giving the place its own gladiatorial-like roller derby that gives Iron City hopefuls their only shot at getting into Zalem. Somehow all of these storylines are interconnected, which adds to the clunkiness of the script but it never allows it to get boring. Some kind of action sequence is always just a few minutes away. Although Alita is built with some feminist empowerment in mind, some of the messaging malfunctions against old world patriarchy. Because she looks like a teen girl, of course, she develops a heterosexual crush on a human teen boy, Hugo. Never mind that she's actually 300 some years older and very much a cyborg. The two share some cute moments, but others, like when Hugo introduces her to chocolate or when Alita offers Hugo her one-of-a-kind ancient technology heart so he can go up to Zalem, feel so old school. In another scene, after a devastating battle with a big bad cyborg, Alita must trade out the delicate, girlish body the doctor had built for his daughter for a warrior-grade bod that adheres to her, um, vision of herself. That vision includes a corset-sized tiny waist and an athletic set of breasts that defy gravity. It's been 300 years after the fall and we are still holding onto Barbie-size proportions. She physically leans into the awkwardness of walking around as a teen girl bot, unsure of her new body and discovering its potential and limits. When she upgrades her body, she stands tall and confident, having sped through puberty in the span of a surgery. Her character's chutzpah is the reason why it vaguely makes sense to jump from a ""hunter killer,"" a bounty hunter in futuristic terms, to a Motorball prospect when she's working her way to becoming a warrior. With so much background and story to cover, maybe ""Alita"" would have benefitted from a ""less is more"" approach. But considering its estimated budget of $200 million, ""Alita: Battle Angel"" is an awe-inspiring jump for the man who first burst onto the film scene with a movie that cost around $7,000.",Alita - Battle Angel
1156,strelczak,"Beautiful, engaging, like nothing else you've ever seen!",10,22 February 2019,"I went into this without really knowing much about it, I wanted to be surprised. The IMDb rating was more decent than similar films that had bombed in the last few years.The film has a feel of the Matrix in terms of plot line, and of course with subtle references to Pinnochio with the Doctor/Alita relationship.I watched this in IMAX which really has to be the only way to watch it. In terms of VFX and visual spector, this film is just outstanding.Some films have the ability to stay with you long after you have watched it and I'd say this is one of them, very rarely does a films run time just zip by in a second, I didn't want this to end.I'd put this up there with one of the best sci-fi I have ever seen.",Alita - Battle Angel
1157,simplyshalee,"An absolute feat in CGI, INCREDIBLE ACTION, and a BAD ASS FEMALE LEAD",10,15 February 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel, the manga, sits on our family bookshelf, and has done so for the past 10 years. For 10 years, my husband has anticipated this film, bringing to life his absolute favourite manga. When we saw the first trailer- we were excited but scared. Mainly because when you have anticipated something for so long, you can get a picture in your head, and a level of expectation and hype that just doesn't resonate on the big screen. WELL.. very luckily, Alita delivered!I'm not a 3D person, but this is a film that looks PHENOMENAL in 3D. The world itself is INCREDIBLE. I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen for a second. I was completely engrossed in this incredible world that unfolded in front of me. At no point did the film feel too long or too short, even though they smashed through so much content from the manga.Now, obviously, given the goriness of the manga, there were certain elements that didn't go on the screen in the same way. Also, the philosophy within the manga doesn't particularly translate. HOWEVER, that's a pretty normal thing because anime and manga are designed for those types of philosophical talks and explorations, and Hollywood block busters are not. So I don't mind that.Alita herself was PERFECTLY portrayed. Childlike at times and sassy at others, she delivers some incredibly powerful emotional moments as well as some absolute laugh out loud one liners. One of my favourite scenes in the film is the bar fight scene where Alita is picking fights with the other hunter warriors. She just really shines as this badass, no nonsense woman that can completely hold her own. Yet at the same time, she's not invincible either (which is something that is commonly occurring in female driven stories, to their detriment). Alita needs saving sometimes, and she saves others at other times. She is strong, yet vulnerable, powerful, yet not omnipotent. It's a great representation of a female lead done right.Overall, I absolutely loved this movie. I cannot express enough how worth it is seeing on the big screen. The fight scenes are THE BEST fight scenes CGI has EVER graced our screens with. It is an absolute marvel how beautiful the CGI blends with the real. It will keep you riding high the whole way through, cheering for Alita.oh, and one more accolade- Ed Skrein is fantastic as the cocky pretty boy hunter warrior. The chemistry and dynamics between him an Alita are HILARIOUS and ENIGMATIC. So good job Ed!",Alita - Battle Angel

1160,chandIerbing,One of the few good adaptations,8,10 February 2019,"Let me just get this out of the way: this movie is flawed as an action, sci-fi movie. But only to the extent where you have a few seconds during the movie where you're questioning the motive of a certain character or wishing that the action would begin again soon. These flaws are not consequential enough to ruin your enjoyment of the movie. In fact, you will more likely to leave the cinema in awe of the spectacles that you've just witnessed and to be sure, this movie has a lot of it.As an adaptation of a manga, this is fantastic. I did not read the manga but I do watch and read some others so I am familiar with the way narratives are presented in Japanese media and this movie nailed it. It is an American remake that develops enough on its own to bridge the gap between manga and Hollywood, while still retaining the influences of its source material. I compare this with the Rurouni Kenshin movies, which I consider to be really faithful adaptations of the Manga but feel kinda foreign in a realistic movie setting. Whereas Alita is nested within a really believable world whose reality you don't question.And it is a beautiful world that James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez have created, truth breathtaking and detailed. You could really see the love that went into this project. It is unmistakably a cyberpunk world but it is a world that I could see existing in the future. I could go on and on but there is nothing like seeing it for yourself. And you won't be seeing it just for the amazing world but also the heart-pumping action. The actions are so well choreographed and filmed that you truly feel the speed and impact of each and every action. The Motorball sequence is truly one of the best action sequences I've seen in the past few years.Overall, it is a great movie with some flaws in the narratives and character building. But it also managed to differentiate itself just enough in key events such that it doesn't become just another teen action movie.",Alita - Battle Angel

However, as you get deeper into the movie the great concept and visuals become harder to enjoy as it's ruined by a terrible script. It's like it was written by a 14 year old who has learnt English as a foreign language. It's dragged down even further by certain lines being spoken without the appropriate tone or emotion, making it feel plastic and uncompelling.It's a real shame because the plot had a great potential, it has several actors who are/can be amazing, and this movie could've easily been a 10 if the script had only been written with a bit more nuance and care.",Alita - Battle Angel

It's definitely a high dollar production, and worth a watch. But there are some major issues with this film....(spoilers ahead)Primarily, the ending blows: about 10 minutes from the end, not only does the whole show switches from character development, a love story, and world exploration to setting up the second film, like the series finale of a money driven TV Show, but it changes so dramatically to create an opportunity for a sequel that it became unbearable to watch. If it wasn't nearly over I'd have left.The characters behave completely unrealistically considering how they behave up until that point.They do things that really don't make any sense--like Alita not just taking Zapans sword and killing him to protect her man, but instead just kicking him aside and throwing the URM sword at his feet. She just fed a Motorbal/Hunter into a giant scrap grinder! And that was nothing personal, why let Zapan live? And then giving him back his weapon so he can continue to be a threat?She didn't yet know he was pursuing a wanted person! But she did have reason to believe that Zapan just murdered her lovers best buddy and was trying to 'kill' the love of her life. Not just beat him up, KILL HIM! Heck, he was in the middle of a killing blow when she arrived on the scene!What would she have done if she had arrived a second later, and her lover had been cut in half, bought Zapan an ice cream cone?Then there's her boyfriends ridiculously fast recovery from near death, and his attempt to climb up to the sky city without even talking to Alita first? He's got a brand new body, and she just saved his life!And she's all: 'Dude, come with me, I love you!' instead of: 'Dude, there are booby traps, if you go any further you will certainly die! I have another way to get up there!' ... Cause, I'm sure somebody can build a rocketship 300 hundred years after The Fall. Remember, Alita was a member of the Martian military!Then, why does Alita decide to waste time killing the big bad guy's lead henchmen, then bail on the pursuit of killing the bad guy, and instead just use her superior fighting skills to go play some BS sport that one of the bad guys henchmen had already 'just' explained to her was complete BS.Does she think that'll get her up to the sky city so she can kill the bad guy? She already showed him she was a threat. Like he can't just deny her access because she's a morotball champion!?Are they setting Alita up for the Motorbal video game too, as well as a sequel?The ending is just completely ridiculous!Crappy wrap up aside, the Sci-Fi worldbuilding, characters, CGI, and action were pretty cool.

This movie is such a tremendous achievement. I did not read the Manga yet, although because of the movie I've bought the full collection. I've watched the OVA (Gunnm) shortly before Alita and I must say the story recreation is spot on. The effects are ground breaking and the film is pure joy from start to finish. For me the story is not left on a cliffhanger either as some claim. I'll be very glad to see a sequel though. I've watched Alita three times already and intend to watch it several times more. I am pushing all my friends to watch it too, because I'm trying to help sway things in the right direction. The movie is amazingly amazing and one of my all time favorites.

Despite any knowledge of the source material i found this adaptation to be highly entertaining. Visuals are just perfect and even the build up in the first half doesn't seem tiring as at its base 'Alita' is a coming of age story and all actors(lead or otherwise) complement that with ease. Screenplay could have been better and the characters could have used a little more build up but whatever this movie lacks in substance it more than makes up for in highly stylized and just mind blowing visuals.P.S- The 'Motorball' sequences alone are worth your money.And watch it on the biggest screen possible,Alita - Battle Angel

They really wanna make a second movie, I understand.I like so much Christoph Waltz, he has a very unique kind of atuation and maybe this is a problem, for me is fine, I like him, but for someone else could be strange watch him before and then see him in this movie.

And a strange coincidence it is that Alita has big eyes, what a little world.The CGI from character Alita has some problems, Rosa Salazar is good but the movements is kind strange, not just because she is a cyborg, it is strange even for a cyborg.The high point of the movie is the characters like Hunter-warrior's, they are really impressive, the skills and the atmosphere.

As soon as Alita opens her eyes for the first time we are treated to some of the most incredible VFX ever put on a real person since Caesar in Planet of the Apes. Every emotion Alita had just looked beyond surreal and I loved seeing how Rosa played the character so lifelike. Some other familar faces show such as Christopher Waltz who is really good ! to my disappointment Eiza Gonzales appears but she isn't in it for very long but well utilized in the limited time she did have. Keean Johnson is the standout as he gives the balance that Alita needed in her more human scenes . The cinematography is beyond breathtaking as we are treated to some of the most impressive visual action sequences ever ! from the moment she has her first punch to her joining the motor ball tournament it does not disappoint ! Alita is not to be messed with I hope Alita finds an audience this weekend as its something different and has the potential to become the next big franchise, so I urge you to check it out because Alita is here to stay !",Alita - Battle Angel
1187,rastrelly,Too good to be true,9,30 April 2019,"I'll make it short. You have a cyberpunk story, which, for a change, actually *is* a cyberpunk story, that has a logical, coherent and complete story arc of an actual character progression within an actual working society. This already is a major breakthrough for hollywood blockbuster storytelling. Of course, the movie owes a lot to its source material, which it recreates quite faithfully (changing *significant* background bits, though).If you ask me, what movie is the closest to ""Alita Battle Angel"", I won't say ""Ghost in the Shell"" or ""Blade Runner"" - it would be an incorrect comparison. I would say it's ""Amelie"". Yes, *that* Amelie. This movie is a character study first and foremost, and action or sci-fi story second. Each and every part of this movie works if you look at it at this angle. Love story is clunky - yes, and it *has* to be clunky. But it's true to how this stuff actually works. Alita has multi-layered personality - and what some critics call ""incoherence"", I cannot see - yes, she is a sweet and childlike person. But she is a fighter, she is extremely emotional, she does believe in people and hopes to move them by touching what she thinks is good in them. And yet - she also *is* a killing machine (not literally a machine, she's human, a surprisingly common misconception about Alita is that she's a robot or AI) who *loves* battle, who *enjoys* violence, and the only thing that stops her from joining the likes of Grewishka and his goons is her empathy and natural morality.This is great story, set in great setting, and told with great passion and attention, yet it is demanding same from the viewer. This is not a movie you can chew popcorn and laugh at ""witty"" quips; the storyline is complex *for a modern movie* (it's actually rather simple to anyone who read at least one proper novel in their life) and requires attentiveness and will to actually analyse what is happening.Yet, there are certain issues, some significant. Keean Johnson's (Hugo) acting is terrible at times. Some scenery looks far too clean and nice for its own good. And certain social layers - like bums, drug addicts, petty criminals, mutants, all the gross underbelly of deeply ""third world"" environment - are missing from the frame, removing some weight out of the frame, making it look better than it should, and muffling motivations of certain characters, which can be really damaging for experience for certain viewers. Probably PG-13 rating is to blame for this.My personal rating is 910. I loved the movie and was easily able to overlook its issues. For some they might be more of a distraction, but this is my personal rating, not a purely objective assessment, which, probably, cannot be expressed numerically for art discussion anyway.",Alita - Battle Angel
1188,h-93074,Stunning and touching movie with trivial flaws,7,7 March 2019,"In general, I really like this movie. I even consider it as one of the few movies that actually touched my heart.Many think the plot is bad, which I don't think is very accurate. I am currently reading the manga. The story is GREAT! Only they didn't take full advantage of this great story to build the characters, except Alita herself. The ultimate goal of story telling is building characters. And this movie brilliantly shaped Alita, and Alita only. Other supporting characters seem to have fewer background stories, which makes them less vivid. Like Grewishka (aka Makaku in the original manga), Hugo and his brother, they all have very intriguing life stories, but the movie did not tell us. Also, there are many other fascinating characters in the manga did not even appear in the movie, such as Jasugun the motorball champion, Alita's motorball team manager Ed and many others.Also, the plot is jumping around a lot. If you read the manga, you'll notice the exact same style. But I still think they could've done better in the transition between scenes. After all this is a movie, not comics.Besides this, I think ""Alita: Battle Angel"" is perfect. The CGI face is absolutely the peak of our tech. And the emotion brought by this tiny body was so exploding and touching. I, as a man, was moved by this empowered female character. She showed us how to find our true selves and how to stay pristine in the ugly world.And to James, Robert, Rosa and everyone who were a part of this project, GREAT JOB GUYS!! PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL ASAP!!",Alita - Battle Angel
1189,resident_evil_freak,Way better then Avatar!,9,13 February 2019,"I thought this was really good. The animation is amazing in this, some of it looked a little off, but for the most part it blended in good with everything else. The story is a little slow at first, but it was never boring and kept me entertained throughout. The action scenes can get really intense, and they all look awesome. Alitas fighting style remainded me of Spider Man a little bit. I really enjoyed all the characters, they were all interesting in their own way. 9/10 I highly recommend it.",Alita - Battle Angel

1191,ivanamijac,Surprisingly amazing!,9,9 July 2019,"I watched this film just last night. It took me long enough because I was kinda of avoiding it, firstly I am not familiar with this manga and secondly I thought it was for kids. I am so amazed and thrilled! I laughed and I cried. CGI is one of the best I've seen, battle scenes are out of this world and characters are so amazingly developed that you have to love them or hate them. Cameron proved once again that he is worth waiting for and now I cant wait for a sequal. It is definitely not for kids.",Alita - Battle Angel
1192,simon_b-03265,It's sad when insecurity makes a great movie end in a cliffhanger.,5,15 October 2021,"Alita was a great movie, and then I mean ""was"" as in only the first part was good. What annoys me is the ending and the leading up to it. It does not feel like a true ending but instead just a cliffhanger leaving the audience unsatisfied. Instead of having the balls to make the movie rememerable for being a a great movie like pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter, avengers on any other good movie series. The team instead chose to chicken out leaving the movie incomplete, making it forgettable. I didn't even realized thst this was the second time I watched this movie until 40 minutes into it. It had alot of potential and it was building up to something great but the second half of the movie just felt like filler content that didn't move the plot forward. It could've been a 8-9/10 but instead it gets a 5. All of this world building for nothing.",Alita - Battle Angel
1193,robthorley,Much better than the current Marvel crop. Hope they make a sequel!,9,26 July 2019,"Came into this knowing little except to expect a tech fest. Thought it was much more than that, great characters, developing story and great ending that left me googling the prospect of a sequel.Worth every bit of its IMDB score and much more than Captain Marvel which it surpassed in every area. Like a combo of Rollerball, Elysium and Ready Player One. One of the few films i've Seen recently that I'm keen to see again. Give it a go!",Alita - Battle Angel
1194,sifter42,"Great movie! The ""Movie Critics"" are wrong again!",9,20 February 2019,"As a rule, I generally avoid any critics reviews before I go see a movie that I am already excited to see. Movie critics these days are usually nit-picking just to find something to complain about... I don't remember the last time I actually saw a movie that someone didn't complain about something that ""ruined the film for them"". So yeah, long story short, ignore the critics. This was a solid ""A"" movie!Overall I loved the storyline, and the entire movie was a cinematic masterpiece. I remember seeing Bladerunner 2049 and thinking, ""No, I don't buy it. I really can't see the future looking like this"". Alita: Battle Angel set up an interesting story, solid characters, and it didn't waste time with meaningless side-plots. The environment definitely felt like it was worth what it cost to make it. It was still had a very ""fantasy"" or ""sci-fi"" vibe that made sure the audience understood it is meant to be a fictional city. I definitely appreciated that aspect. I'm just tired of seeing yet another post apocalyptic L.A., Chicago, NYC, etc. I cannot say the cities were without their minor plot holes, but they were minimal to the point that it is almost not worth mentioning.In my opinion; the only negative aspect of this movie is the ending. I will not go into any spoilers.... Suffice to say that when it ends; there is no doubt that they are very clearly setting up a sequel movie or two. I really enjoyed the progression of the movie, but the ending somehow felt rushed. It was like they had another hour or two of content, but had to pick a spot to cut it. There is some minor satisfaction and closure with a few characters. However, the main story arc is far from resolved when everything is said and done.I was not familiar with the original manga that this movie is based out of... So, I did some digging and ran across some ""Gunnm"" clips from the 90's. All I can say is that they clearly took some iconic bits and pieces from the source material and added them to the movie. While I'm sure they are in now way ""100% true to the source"", I think they did a solid job of it.TLDR - Go see it in the theaters! Alita is a solid movie that is better than most of what I've seen in the last few months.",Alita - Battle Angel
1195,guldbrand-73462,What?,6,3 July 2019,"Don't waste your time. Now this is a very beautiful feature. Great story. One major error is the is no ending. This spoiled the experience. It is like this is the first in a series. However, don't know is there is coming a sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel
1196,arranadam,I Wish I Had Bionic Ears,5,6 February 2019,"Firstly, it is worth noting that not only did I view this film in 3D with the full Imax experience at Leicester Square cinema, but I was invited to attend the film's premiere, so that James Cameron, Robert Rodriquez and Jon Landau were all in the audience watching the exact same viewing as yours truly. Indeed, there could have been no better setting for one to enjoy this movie, but I could have been stranded in the desert, wandering the sun-kissed dunes for three days and dying of thirst to only stumble into that cinema with my free bottle of water and still want to walk back out into the burning sun and it's sweet embrace of death.
On the positives, the art style and animation were objectively ground-breaking, visually breath-taking and excellently executed. The 3D graphics were similarly fantastic and a needed amplifier to distract from the hideously simplistic rhetoric of the film's, alleged, 'story'. Furthermore, the world building replicated from Yukito Kishiro's graphic novel 'Gunnm' stood strong as a fresh take on a dystopian apocalypse in a city brimming with life, character and colour.
Yet, even those two positives seem somehow tarnished when one considers the amount of time and effort the graphics team have poured into this work for their efforts to only be superseded by the directive imbalance of awful story-telling, a student-worthy script and sub-par direction. Furthermore, Kishiro's world has been snatched by the pie-stained corporate fingers of James Cameron, who's taken one look at the foundation of originality brimming from her work, and simply decided that was enough intellectual-labour required to produce the film - essentially stuffing the script and Alita's world with the most basic, mundane and simply pathetic cinematic tropes, of which are so unfathomably recycled I am in genuine awe as to how the project was green-lit at all (oh wait - he's James Cameron).
The dialogue made me want to install bionic ears for the pure pleasure of being able to make myself deaf - in a full cinema of keen-to-please fans there were no more than four audible laughs through-out the 122-minute run-time. The characters have no consistency in any degree of their life: the father refuses to let Alita get into her armour because he doesn't think she should have to fight and then has no issue with her entering the world's most dangerous sport; with no apparent causality, a character just outright betrays Alita and then tells her he loves her the next time they meet; they all conveniently go to places without reason or justification and without even communicating to each other just so they can be in the right place for the right scene; they all make decisions for no apparent reason other than to fill a plot hole, oxymoronically changing their minds with no link, build-up or explanation but hey... just lie back and look at the animation! I mean just nothing made sense. Even 'motorball' the sport for which the majority of the film's climatic sequences are catered around is just NOT EXPLAINED, the rules seem subjective, the goal seen only in the first game, even the ball in the final scene is just left in the gutter as everyone just decides to brawl on a racecourse, with no need of a track -- or even the concept of a sport? What is going on?!
Lastly, and most abysmally, the ending. My God. As if the movie was lacking any substance or purpose before, the finale literally forced me to write this review for the pure sake of two hours of my life not being wasted without a shred of output or reward. I would say 'spoiler alert' but the ending feels like more of a start to a film than the beginning of the film and diabolically appears to be a set-up for another visually stunning fruit-loaf that collapses in a soggy heap the instant it is tested beyond superficiality.
If you're truly determined to watch this unoriginal tripe of a crap-show, at least watch it in 3D with some especially strong earplugs, or better yet, a language tape of some dialect you don't understand because even if you learn one word in ancient Latin, you will have learnt more from the film than I did - besides reaffirming the fact that money does not buy happiness and certainly doesn't buy good cinema.",Alita - Battle Angel
1197,sapetterson,Must watch,10,5 January 2020,"I loved the visuals and the incredible way they blended characters like Alita with the real world. I also fell in love with the characters themselves. The story is quite well told IMO, and reveals a touching background/motivation behind the protagonists actions which are told in a captivating fashion. The acting is outstanding, especially by Rosa Salazar, Mahershala Ali and Christoph Waltz.In the end there are many questions left unanswered and points yet to connect, so while you will fill greatly fullfilled throughout the movie you'll be left with a gaping void inside you waiting for a sequel and the continuation of Alita's story.",Alita - Battle Angel

1200,jgreg-37981,Far more entertaining than it had any right to be.,8,4 January 2020,"This movie should have been one of the biggest flops of 2019. It had really unimpressive trailers, a weirdly designed main character and was an American adaptation of a Japanese anime,, and we all know how successful they are. It shouldn't have worked, but somehow, it really does.Alita Battle Angel is not a perfect movie. It's screenplay could have used a few more revisions, Alita and Hugo's relationship I really didn't buy and the movie itself is relentlessly sequel baity.But James Cameron's knack for impressive world building is not lost. This world feels so alive and lived in. The action sequences uncertain the command of Robert Rodriguez are incredible. The motorball sequences in particular are fast paced and brutally intense. Rosa Salazar is really good as the title character. She plays the wide eyed optimism and the toughened bad sides of the character very well. Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein and Jackie Earle Haley round out a great supporting cast. Junkie XL's score has a great mix of gentle emotional and heart pounding action music. The pounding electronic base in the track Motorball still gets me pumped.Alita Battle Angel is a movie that came out of absolutely nowhere and blew my mind. I sincerely hope that they make a sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel

After watching so many amazing movies with fantastic visual effect, I wasn't significantly impressed by the movie. Rather disappointed. And the plot is like the director and play writer know that audiences have seen so many cliche so that they don't need to elaborate/illustrate a specific cause and effect in the film.

1207,yveslanois,"you are a teenager, you have outgrown disney and need no depth in your thoughts, here we go",1,14 July 2019,"O how i stumbled with this one. i had always a problem with overdrawn animations and somehow i have outgrown teenagers playing ballgames and competing with each other and having fun all the time in a world that looks like blade runner coated in cotton candy.the story is simple and wellknown, the year is 2563 and everytjhing looks like a cheap version of a 80's sf-movie - honestly, does really anyone believe that people will look and act like dumb rockers and punkers, that they will wear leather and sit in bars and act like they belong in a tv-series? does anyone believe that 2563 the streets will look like germany after the wall fell. the inventions are ridiculous and eople still use their smartphones and if i were 16 again i think would be enthusiastic, but it is hard to feel anything with this oberblown bubblegum dream. alita acts throughout like a japanese girlie who really wants to get somewhere. as does her boyfriend, who wants to go up there, to another place. what place? no show. why? who knows.what works in the easy and no-sense style of a manga, doesn't work in cinema. at least not in the kind of cinema you want to take serious. the well meant ""father"" of alita is caring, but as soons as she wants to enter the really dumb games where some robots (i thought it was over with the transformers, it isn't) fight each other over a ball, he doesn't complain and helps her. it is so terrible. and so senseless. as is the overpower in this story which can enter any mind and take over anybody, but not the mind of the ones it wants to take down. what a pitty.this is a really waste of emotional time and the eyes aren't thankful in the end, because you have seen it all before. over and over again. here is nothing new, there is not one dialog worth repeating and not one emotion to be kept.",Alita - Battle Angel
1208,daichihideyoshi,This is a great movie,9,6 February 2019,"I knew nothing about Yukito Kishiro's manga walking into my screening of Alita: Battle Angel, but I found the film to be gripping throughout. Perhaps only the ending left me slightly unsatisfied (for obvious and necessary reasons when you see it). Sure, there are some implausibility issues that critics are citing (and the film borrows story element from a number of other sci-fi sagas we've seen), but the characters of Alita and her love interest Hugo are entirely believable and compelling. And Christophe Waltz is fantastic. Ali and Connelly have smaller parts, but they're terrific. I was concerned, after seeing the trailer, that the bulk of the ""good vs. evil"" action would be confined to the MotorBall arena, but it's not the case. There are some amazing set pieces in this movie. The film's action sequences and its visuals are absolutely fantastic. It doesn't have a heavy ""artificial"" CGI feel to it at all. And at least in my theater, the 3D experience was better-than-perfect (I typically loathe 3D) - the screen didn't look ""grey"" or ""dim"" like it does with most 3D movies. It was entirely bright and all the colors popped. I can't imagine this film not doing extremely well with a younger audience, and I absolutely want more of this story.",Alita - Battle Angel

Sadly it became a casualty of ""woke capitalism"", never really earning it's true potential despite having all of the right ingredients cooked in all the right ways by some of the best people in the business, and had to instead sit in the shadow of a lesser movie. It's crime? In the coin toss of which movie to endorse with identity politics, it lost to an objectively inferior and forgetable other movie that also had a female lead as a superhero, but without any actual merit beyond that.
Alita kicks butt while still being loveable, relatable and *human*.

1223,taloot-62031,Avatar meets I-Robot and Matrix,8,18 July 2019,"Watched ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL - Directed by Robert Rodriguez and Co Produced by James Cameron, Alita shares a striking resemblance to Avatar. The story has been adapted from a Manga Comic, base in a steampunk-esque type setting called Iron City, retelling the story of a Cyborg Doctor called Dr. Ido who during a search for parts amongst mounds of scrap metal, comes across the cyborg head & torso of a female.Ido takes the body home and with the help of his surgical assistant he rebuilds this female and names her Alita. Alita can't remember much about her past life and so she and Ido embark on a journey of rediscovery.The story explores the idea of love between a cyborg and a human, themes such as sacrifice, revenge and revolution. It's a story that has been told time and time again in different settings where Alita upgrades her body and rises as a challenger to the adversity that is ruling Iron City.The CGI is truly something to behold on a big screen, the graphics are rich and amazing, using slow motion now and again to help you appreciate the complexity within some of the fight scenes: there is tonnes of violence, sick, bloody but very stylishly executed violence against techno music in a steampunk-esque world. Of particular note is the way Alita handles 'Motor-Ball', mixing martial arts in to an already speedy and intense futuristic sport.There are many great things about Alita but nothing new that could really wow you. As I said before, Cameron has gone for an oft repeated tried and tested formula, keeping most parts of the story discrete without giving too much away about the mechanics of the world, how different people survive and what different communities/people populate it. Instead the narrative is pretty linear, you get to see what Cameron wants you to see, nothing more and then as well as using the ending to set up the coming of part 2, you're left with a tonne of areas that weren't explored in part 1.It's a good movie but it could have been greater with more content and detail.

1230,dorareinamora,"Really fun and spectacular, but...",7,29 December 2019,"Alita is a really fun and entertaining movie, while spectacular. It has moments of pure cinema and spectacular music (from Junxie XL). It is a pity that, due to the idea of always the sequels and possible trilogies, it has such an open ending and does not focus on a specific topic. Being a manga divided into many volumes, the film seems to want to cover a lot of things, not focusing on any. And it lasts only two hours, because in the end everything goes much faster than it should. That does not take away the merits he has, which are many, especially the construction of Alita's character, and his wonderful mix of real with CGI, which is simply impressive. Too bad that the relative failure (or relative success) prevents us from seeing Alita 2. It will be again.",Alita - Battle Angel

I never go by critics or so-called people who call themselves impartial movie reviewers. I like action and it has that! I know this movie is very different for the norm. Even my younger brother who is 25 didn't think I would like it. But I loved it! And I'm a 37 year old woman. I'm not Marvel movies person so it is nice when something like this comes out. I would definitely go see it if you like this type of movie. I hope there will be a sequel.,Alita - Battle Angel

1237,wachsmana,A very good movie,8,23 February 2019,"My take on this movie is ""Ghost in Shell"" with a more likable more human character in Alita. The effects and detail are amazing and I always find it a more interesting character development when the student becomes the master type of movie.Perhaps Alita 2 could explore a rebellion of sorts buts sort have been done.I think with some really good writing you can do a lot with Alita. Alita with Dr. Ido are very likeable. If they could explore more of who Alita is would be nice. We know she is a battler warrior. But was she ever trully human?Premise is good. The action and the attention to detail were amazing.I think Alita certainly is worth seeing in the theater but look forward to seeing her again at home.",Alita - Battle Angel

This movie deserves a lot, its shocking to see this movie isn't doing good in usa i guess but people need to realize the hard work and really give it a better rating and make more people watch this move at a theatre. Can't wait for the sequel, definitely need a sequel and wish this and the next to do wonders like the avengers.

1240,pcferry,An EXCELLENT movie if only... (***SPOILER ALERT***),5,6 March 2019,"This was an excellent movie, from the visuals to the storyline to the emotions evoked. There is nothing about this movie that would keep me from seeing it again. That is except....The end. After our protagonist, Alita, loses her sketchy boyfriend to the effects of gravity, we fast forward to her going to her last fight in Motorball to have the chance to go to the golden city in the sky to take on the main antagonist, Nova.But no. It wouldn't be. Instead we get her ready to compete with her sword pointing at the golden city and.... cut to credits. That's right, ladies and gents, the credits. It's as if James Cameron, et al., decided they had run out of money and they were going to just end the movie. I guess they decided to let the viewers ASSUME Alita succeeded in her pursuit of Edward Norton, er, um, Nova.How anticlimactic was it? Imagine watching Star Wars, Episode IV in 1977 just as the X-wings were blasting off from Yavin to confront the evil Galactic Empire to take down the menacing Death Star only to cut to credits? The series never would have gone past that point. It would have been an interesting space opera that child have been the so much more we have become so astutely aware of today. Very disappointing to say the least..Again, let me reiterate, I absolutely loved the movie. But will I watch it again? If and only if there is a sequel that takes us to the city in the sky (yeah, I didn't quite thread the letters together to see the name) to take us to finish the first story and beyond. I guess I could just check out the story it's based upon.",Alita - Battle Angel
1241,PerpetuumMobile09,"Alita is a great audiovisual experience, driven by a likeable heroine",9,10 February 2019,"Alita doesn't pretend to be anything more than a sci-fi action film, with a dose of personality and some darker overtones, and as such it succeeds very well. I'd say it's the best film I've seen in quite some time.It also adds some meaning and depth to its characters, by exploring Alita's relationships with certain people, and by giving some glimpses into her hidden past. But Alita is primarily an action film, and it doesn't make the mistake of spending too much time on subplots. There are also some interesting thematic issues, related to existentialism, memory, consciousness, etc., which help to elevate the film above the standard popcorn flick.Although James Cameron didn't direct the film himself (as he originally planned to), it still has that James Cameron feel (he did co-write the screenplay, and also served as producer). If you've enjoyed Camerons past sci-fi films (such as Avatar, Aliens, etc.), I'd highly recommend checking this one out as well.The visual effects artists (I believe the main effects house was WETA) did an incredible job blending Alita with her environments and real actors. The shaders and lighting really gave the impression that this is how Alita would look like if she really existed physically. I almost forgot I was watching a CG character. Of course, her big eyes was a (deliberate) constant reminder that she wasn't entirely human. In the film there are also other hints as to why her eyes are so big. It may also be a slight nod to her Anime roots (the film is based on Yukito Kishiro's manga series, Battle Angel Alita).Rosa (who played Alita) and the artists also did a great job bringing Alita to life: She comes off as a cute, likeable, spunky girl, despite her dark past. I found her to be far more interesting than many 'real life' protagonists I've seen in films such as Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Wonder Woman. The mocap (motion capture: a technique used to capture an actors movements) and character animation (including facial animation) is some of the best I've seen.Big budget, event films have gotten longer and longer in recent years. Many superhero films, for example, now have running times closer to 2,5 hours. But in most cases these long running times hurt the movie, and it starts to drag. It seems the filmmakers want to cram as many subplots and characters into the film as possible. But very often simpler is better and less is more. Although Alita isn't exactly a short film with its 2:02 running time, it makes every efficient use of its running time: The editing is tight, keeping the story focused on the big 'issues', without getting sidelined by numerous side/subplots.The critics haven't been too kind to the film, but I get the feeling that many 'highbrow' critics try to 'dissect' the film, instead of just trying to have a good time at the cinema. Film is ultimately and primarily a visual medium, and sometimes I think people forget that. Alita is a great audiovisual experience, driven by a likeable heroine. It's the kind of film that needs to be seen on the big screen.",Alita - Battle Angel

1244,soultakerneo,The Gunnm I liked,8,16 February 2019,"As a longtime fan of Gunnm(Battle Angel Alita), I am satisfied. I appreciate the production team took their time to do the research of the original serials. The adaptation is great, they filtered out few ""acquire taste"" and swapped in elements that would make much more appeal to general public. The film really kept true to the original manga and reassembled almost everything from the manga the scenes, mechanical bodies, characters and the world they lived in. They did a great job on capturing Alita's slightly naïve stubbornness, the ""all in or all out"" euthanasic, and the pursuit of who she is.
Storywise, the film ingeniously weaved the first 11 books of manga together, brought up few events that was happening in the 2nd chapter of Alita's adventure to the 1st movie. Which is nice since I bet they're already thinking of the next Alita movie. But as few of Cameron's work, the dark side and the ugliness of irontown wasn't rendered enough. The lack of depth on the ugliness made the whole plot a bit light, the emotional conflict wasn't intense enough and the romance plotline which is very important in the 1st chapter a little bit lack of depth.
The overall CG is stunning. Other than the wanted flyer and the parasite's face the rest of CG is absolute marvelous.
All in all, definite a great Gunnm movie, will definite watch it again and again till the sequel is out!!!",Alita - Battle Angel

1249,kidmetal-matheny,An Unintentionally Hilarious CGI Action Extravaganza That Questions It's Own Existence,5,21 February 2019,"Positives:+ Christoph Waltz carries the film, and delivers a great performance with little screen time. Truly a generational talent.+ Some action set pieces are awe inspiring, and truly give a spectacle type feel.+ Rosa Salazar turns in a solid performance as Alita, she does a great job conveying emotional with just her voice alone.+ Some of CGI shots look great. Especially Alita.+ The first 30 minutes is very, very good pacing wise. Then the film hits a wall.+ The motorball scenes are great.Negatives:The romance is....forced, and never feels genuine, especially since the film is supposed to be over the course of a few days. It also ends predictably.There are some unintentionally funny moments during serious scenes.A few of the cyborg characters look laughably dumb. It's mostly due to the awful CGI bodies plastered over the heads of the actors/actresses portraying the characters.The ending leaves you feeling unsatisfied, and having more questions than answers.The film leaves a bunch of questions unanswered, maybe unintentionally, but it really weighs down the mind while watching the film. You are constantly wondering what certain things mean.The film has very poor pacing, it feels like three hours long at the start of the third act. It feels really bloated.Rating: 5 out of 10Star Power: 2.5 out of 5Final Thoughts: While I am unfamiliar with the source material, I had low expectations, and while it didn't disappoint, it was about as good as I thought it was going to be. A true middle of the road film, where neither the pros nor the cons outweigh one another in terms of the actual film (not in the review). For every awesome action moment, there exists a cringy piece of dialogue or unintentionally funny moment. Where there's a good fight scene, there's some bad CGI that breaks immersion. Overall, I cannot recommend a theater viewing. Wait until it is released and stream it, or see it at matinee price if you absolutely MUST see it.",Alita - Battle Angel

I have two kids and even they couldn't sit still from the horrible rediculous 'noise' this sad attempt at a movie made. Watched four couples walk out, and on a Saturday, maybe six people in the theatre after the others left. The casting of the male lead kid was atrocious, cgi as bad as Steppenwolf in Justice League, and the only thing it had going for it was Christophe, and a few actual actors, (Jennifer Connolly, Mr. Ali..). Other than that, it was pretty rediculous all the way through. Not a laugh from anyone in my family, nor anyone else. Likable main character couldn't hold her on with the stupidity of the premise, and as much as the cast and the art department tried, I couldn't buy into any of their acting, or their world.

1255,stevemasta,Better than expected. Enjoyed myself thoroughly,7,15 October 2019,"I enjoyed it. A lot. I was fixed to the screen throughout and sweat through the intense scenes.
The romance wasn't amazing, but it was compelling.
The pacing was interesting, because the story was told in three distinct parts, with individual fades to black to cue the transition. After reviewing the manga, it's clear these map _roughly_ to the themes of the first three volumes of the manga, but significant swaths of the movie are covering just a few issues in the first volume.Susan Collins, while a secondary character, had an arch that I believed. ""A mom and a doctor"" indeed.
Rosa Salazar was great as Alita, and it was great to see her get knocked down: no Mary Sue, but flaws, growth and complexity.
* Even in the final scene, we see she is still grieving. She's successfully made it to the final round of the Motor Ball championship, but she slices the tear that she sheds for her lost love.The plot twist, unveil, at the end wasn't insanely surprising, but it was intricate. The oppressed that make up Iron City - that all seek to abide in the city in the sky - were lied to: told the rebellion against the city - Zolom - were the ""enemy"".There's mention of Martians that start the rebellion, but everything went quickly. I'll have to rewatch it, or read it, to catch the details. Having sampled the manga and Wikipedia, I know there are great things in store.
Maybe it's just me, but the last movie I was told was bad and watched (anticipating the badness) wound up being rather enjoyable, save a few pacing issues.
* Maybe it is a trend - and my tastes are becoming more accepting of worse and worse art - but there wasn't a lot wrong with this movie.What could be nit-picked:
* Hugo - love interest to Alita - had a few friends that were just window dressing. They made the world feel lived in and offered the typical person's view of Alita joining their lives: ""just some freak whose going to ruin the good gig we've got going; get rid of her so we can get back to making money.""
* Hugo was a little weak on the acting front and there were a few parkour scenes where he should have avoided the movement he executed (e.g. shoulder roll when someone just broke his clavicle)
* CGI young Alita looked just barely out of place. Your eyes adjust. Her adult form is attractive, realistic, and much easier to look at.
* One shot near the beginning that was badly green screened
* I checked how much of the movie was left three times because I was
1. Surprised at how dense (in a good way) the story telling was. The time elapsed was impressive.
2. I held concern for how they would get to tell this story to its end within the time limit.
8/10 for
+ good characters. though fewer with more individual focus would've been better, I think everyone on screen was useful
+ compelling story telling. Even if the plot wasn't a singular quest, I was rooting for Alita to remember and be who she believed she should be.
+ Fantastic action. I couldn't get enough of it. Again, Alita loses, at least two or three times. But she also kicks a lot of trash. Oh, is it a sight to see.
+ Splendid world building. Laced with intrigue, I want to know more about everyone in this world who made it to the end credits alive.
+ Great lead, who goes on an arch and still has room to grow by the end of the movie",Alita - Battle Angel

1259,vanbane,Why Kill the...,6,31 July 2019,"Little dog? Seriously? So it started out interesting, had the usual cliche moments, but a few mistakes made it too silly for me to love the movie.1. When Alita over reacts and asks, ""What do you about me!"" What got her so pissed to shout that? Her memory is mostly blank! Unless she knows her main enemy and so remembers stuff that's made her want revenge like having lost pets, etc., why is she blaming some mindless thug?2. Why kill the dog? She should have saved it in the script, it was pointless. Obviously just trying to kill it would have made him evil but why down the audience and kids?3. Jumping on the table while delivering a speech? Weird.4. If her mind is blank why was she not more timid in the beginning?5. That she ""seeks out conflict"", wow, that's what sociopaths do, that line basically ruined the movie for me. They should reshoot that one seen and make it, ""You were designed for ending a war"", that's all, not, ""You love conflicts and war, you're a female Aries who feesds on chaos, violence and strife.""6. Okay, so she can save a guy by chopping his head off and plugging his head in, huh? And she can morph, but couldn't extend some cables to rescue her bf?7. Why'd she instantly get so upset at her bf being wanted, and the bf's response was pretentious, ""it's not what you think"", what would a blank minded girl be thinking?! Wouldn't she first ask ""What's going on?""8. Why was there no ""hunter warrior test"", some scenese where she proves her skills and is given a rule book and instantly reads it?9. There's no hovering devices? No drones???! Huh? It's 2,500+ years into the future! And no cameras?10. Alita should have been shown using infrared vision.11. A human brain needs blood, it's nonsense that at least some sort of bone with marrow and blood and oxygen and waste system are not shown. Humans require all that, it should have been indicated that somehow all that was in Alita's core system as well as that big evil dude.12. Why if the female doctor was super valuable would her partner remove her brain?13. The female doctor's brain was placed in what appears to be water, again, blood is required, it should have at least been a reddish solution.14. Unless some flying device was causing Alita to fall slowly from the sky city her brain would not have survived the fall, no tech can quench the vibrations of such an impact. She would have otherwise had to have landed on a huge aerogel pillow or some net or some nano-parachute ejected and detached or tucked itself back in so it would not be seen.Too many absuridities and oversights like this = 6 stars. But, it was visually interesting enough and Alita's voice beautiful enough to make it watchable.I hope part two shows she has a nano parachute in her core that ejects when it senses her falling for too long, or blood and marrow is mentioned and so on to make it more realistic. It's a shame that little dog was killed.",Alita - Battle Angel

1272,daredevil2079,"A True Comeback for Robert Rodriguez since Sin City, and the Best Hollywood Anime-Manga Adaptation Movie since Speed Racer (2008) ! IMAX 3D REQUIRED !!!!!!!!",9,5 February 2019,"I don't get why many critics are too much harshing on this movie, I also did worried about this project ever since they announced that Robert Rodriguez was going to direct this movie (Because he doesn't made a good movie for a really really long time since Sin City 2005, the original Manga comic is such a masterpiece). But I did gave it a try after I keep saw the 2nd and 3rd trailers, it getting looks better and better in each trailers.With that said, I gotta says this movie blew me out of the water. With low expectation comes with better than I was expected about it, and it doesn't look messy like the critics said or I pictured of at all.In fact, this is the Best Hollywood Anime-Manga Adaptation Movie since Speed Racer 2008 (Edge of Tomorrow doesn't count because of the whitewashed) and it's RR's best since Sin City too. This movie goes boyond through the wall than I even expected, and I love the original Manga comic I felt like this movie is a dream came true for Manga's hardcore fans. A lot of things that Manga's fans want to see from the comic to the big screen finally at last.The Visual, the Storytelling, the Spectacle, the Action-Sequences, and the Execution are so perfect. Robert Rodriguez redeemed himself in this movie with his mind combine to James Cameron's heart turn out to be a good hybrid unique movie that got James Cameron's signature and Rodriguez's soul into one movie. Rodriguez brought his action sequences' style from Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn and Sin City back into this movie, but this one beyond his level into Mad Max: Fury Road or The Matrix's territories.Rosa Salazar is the standout of this movie, she is the best Mo-Cap performer I've seen so far since Andy Serkis (Caesar, Gollum, King Kong). Her portrayal of Alita is the heart and soul to this movie, and her facial expression into Alita's CG face was beyond speechless. Rosa did brought the unique level to this amazing movie, and the rest of the cast are so impressive too. Even Marhershala Ali did gave another great performance in this movie too, and there are some surprise cameos that you don't want to miss (One came by the CG character but you will recognize her voice, one came at the end of the movie that will make your jaw-dropping so hard.)Another great thing that I want to says is Tom Holkeborg's score (Junkie XL), that will make it to be another great one of his works, just like his' score in Mad Max: Fury Road, Batman V Superman, and Divergent.I hope that the public wouldn't bullying this movie like Speed Racer, I wish it would be great enough to make the audiences love this so much that make it hit enough to get a sequel or a trilogy. My belief would be if this had a trilogy, this will be one of the best trilogies along with Star Wars original trilogy, Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Bourne trilogy, and The Dark Knight trilogy. Please go see this movie a lot, and you will have another great trilogy that you will love forever !Recommended to see it in IMAX 3D, you're going to be WOWED in this great full 2-hours experience.",Alita - Battle Angel

1280,shuyaakitatsuya,Finally a deserving adapation of Gunmm.,9,10 February 2019,"As a long time fan of the original manga, I have waited long and long time again, for the day Gunmm received the adaptation it truly deserved.The wait has finally ended.Alita: Battle Angel, in my opinion, has successfully brought the story to the big screen. The film adapted the core essence of the original manga perfectly.Many people say that the story is shallow and lacking, but that's exactly how it was in the original. Just as Gally (Alita) was lost and confused about who she is and what her purpose was, the opening arc of the original manga was also just a mash of short story arcs that took Gally into a chaotic chase to find answers. I was actually pleasantly surprised that they were able to jam so much of it into a 2 hour film, while still retaining the core elements.Many people, including fans, were concerned about the large eyes of Gally. I too was concerned a little... but just like everything else I am concerned about, I knew I would eventually come to like it. And I did. The way that Gally is introduced into the story as a ''cyborg'' and seeing how there are various other mechanical beings of various shapes and sizes with distinct characteristics, Gally did not feel or look out of place.Though I did find Gally's introduction to be... underwhelming. To those who read the original may understand what I mean. It is an iconic moment of Gally's initial ''awakening''. But I do kinda of understand why they would have left this part out, perhaps it was to give Gally a more human connection... which I do approve of... as... she is actually a... human.... *coughspoilers*.Putting story aside, the action. Action, action and action. Bravo. Besides Gally's quest for self discovery, the fights showing off Gally's just complete epic badassery battle sequences was a staple in the original. And the film did not disappoint. The film brought the already amazing battle sequences made in stationary images from a manga and made it even better on film.As a fan of the manga and as a fan of sci-fi films, this was a great adaptation. Not perfect to every degree, but perfect enough.Just hope we don't have to wait as long for the sequel.I am looking forward to Nova's maniacal laughs.",Alita - Battle Angel

1288,mikoss-53932,Alita: Battle Angel misses the plot point it was suppose to represent,7,19 July 2019,"I was excited to see Alita: Battle Angel. It had a great cast with a good production team. For the most part, the world was extremely well done, the actors felt like they belonged to that world and everything fit in place perfectly. Maybe one thing about the world I felt was missing was that grimdark feel it should've had since it was a ""shadow"" Town.The acting was decent, sadly the weakest link was the main actor sometimes felt like her facial expressions sometimes felt out of place and overexaggerated but that was a minor flaw.Now what I really felt like this movie needed was a totally new script. Almost every plot point felt like it was in the wrong order. Maybe the most important and the biggest plot point is shown in the last 5 minutes of the movie. Also, most of the relationships never felt enough deep to really care about. Also, the motivations were very radical and usually didn't make that much of a sense, characters emotions would change from 1 to 100 instantly for no real reason.That being said the actions sequences were greatly done, VFX was on point and the scenes progressed the story greatly every time. I think it should've had a few more action scenes to cover the lack of real plot.",Alita - Battle Angel
1289,matexunleashed,incomprehensible disappointment,3,9 February 2019,"Quick summary, this movie is utterly terrible and let me be clear, it's not like ""oh well I'm disappointed by I've seen many worse"" or ""well that was bad but not THAT bad"", nah... It was THAAAAT bad! I wasn't that close to walking out of the cinema before movie ending for the last 15 or so years. The story is hollow and shallow, you're thrown into it without much background or explanation. You've got a generic broken good guy, generic evil guy, another generic villian with goodness still in, and generic good guy with flaws. Well, such stroy struckture is not especially bad, there are many good films based on similar principles. But for it not to be bad, all the other pieces must work fine, I mean acting, the dialouges, character building. With Alita it's simply not the case... There's no character building. Most of the characters are with no or little background. The characters are simply underdeveloped. There motives are unclear and most of their actions are irrational or illogical. You can't really feel any conection to them. The movie itself is very chaotic, the scenes definietly don't feel well stiched together. The animation of Alita's face is poor. Her mimics and facials gestures are simply not on a 200mil movie level (which Alita costed). When she tries to express anger, joy or even laughter it simply seems fake and not convincing. Maybe it's not last Mass Effect level, but it's close and it's far far worse than good old Avatar. Alita as a person acts like she's totally mentally unstable, either she kills you without a blink or she loves you with for apperent reason and she's even willing to rip her heart out for yaa... Whole relatioship between Alita and the guy (I don't even bother to check his name) is not believeble, they meet like 2 times in the movie and all of a suden their love is the main point of the story, it's too far fetched. The dialogues most of the time are simply dump and I was embarassed to hear them, it feels as if they were created by some script writing ai in it's very early stages of development. I simply can't belive that Cameron had anything to do with this movie, if new Avatars are going to be on this level, it's better for them not to be created at all. Alita feels like it's something between alfa and beta version of itself, it's not well thought, it's not well played, it's not well executed. It's a disaster.",Alita - Battle Angel

1295,xRetsu,Probably the first successful live action movie adaptation of a Manga or Anime,8,29 July 2019,"Battle Angel Alita (title translated) was Japanese cyberpunk anime published-1990 to 1995. In 1993 it was adopted to Anime OVA-Movie. Alita: Battle Angel (2019) is live action movie adaptation of the 1993's Anime.
The story of Alita: Battle Angel is basically same as 1993's animation, it also adds few more content from the manga while not damaging/twisting the main story line. In the review section I've seen a lot of people criticizing the story. For screen-play writers, an anime/manga adaption movie doesn't allow too much freedom to go wild with the story. I feel James Cameron did an excellent job with the story.
Visuals are really-really good. CGI was 10/10. Also fight sequences were carried out really well. Music and acting was decent enough. Christoph Waltz (Dr. Ido) and Rosa Salazar (Alita) did a good job.
As a movie this should be rated 7-7.5/10. However, considering how difficult it is to adopt a live action movie from a manga, I will rate it 8/10. I recommend watching it 10/10.",Alita - Battle Angel

1299,hberry-51959,Quite good actually,9,8 February 2019,"First let me say: It is worth watching it.
The film is entertaining. Great animation. Did not expect much as I find japanese animes mostly boring except from Myazakis master pieces.I saw the original film 20 years ago and I was not impressed. Did not like it a bit. It is not that it is borring. Just a bit bland. Therefore I was not exited about the idea to watch Alita, but gave it a try.I have to admitt there is some really bad acting. Espescially at the beginning. Really bad. Some actors are good, some do a realy bad job. But at the end it does not ruin the film. Which is quite funny actually.
Mahershala Ali for example was amazing in his role. Realy impressive. Christopher Walz. Hmmm... Not so.I woud say I find this movie better then the original. It has a bit more energy then the original. As well due to the additions to the story they made, which did not exist in the original.
As well, I was able to build a connection and feel a sort of empathie with the main character Alita, which the original completly failed to do. I felt this version has a tiny bit more soul.The backflashs Alita has, were really well done. They had a great atmosphere and appeared interestingly more exiting then the rest of the story. Would have been nice to see more of Alitas past.People complained about the eyes and I did not like them at the beginning, but you get used to them. They really fit the purpose of highlighting, that Alita is not a human. Although this was mainly supposed to be an omage to the original drawings of Alita, if you watch the film, you will find out that there is an other hidden (possible) explenation why her eyes are so large... But I do not want to spoil.Would I watch it again? Definitly. It is fun to watch.
Could it be better. Yeah... At least the story itself... but you can not always have everything. I think it is nevertheless a master peace.",Alita - Battle Angel

1301,unzki,A Solid Adaptation With A Couple Issues,7,24 February 2019,"As a fan of the manga and anime OVA, I really wanted to like it more... It is a better adaptation than I feared, mostly doing a very good job at adapting the source materials (both the aforementioned manga and anime), heart-pounding action, eliciting tears as it rightly should in places, solid cyberpunk/postapoc feels, despite the PG-13 rating you still get a fair idea of the brutality of the original (though no brain-munching or spine-stealing =P ), they didn't even overlook some of the smaller but IMO important details. Alita herself was well realized, and felt like the character I know from the original materials.However, there were two very major drawbacks:Firstly, the motivations of one important character aren't established well enough, and overall there's a rushed feel when IMO more time should've been invested into them. Cramming the first three books into one film was a bit too much, as I feared, and as a result the scene-arc which I think should have been the climax of the movie and taken all the time needed for maximum dramatic impact went by all too fast.Second, the music... It's the nowadays all-too-usual ""Generic Epic"" orchestral Hollywood music that seems to plague action and adventure movies. It sounds fine by itself, but it lacks any character whatsoever and is utterly forgettable which is a damn shame because Alita would've deserved a metal/punk/techno-soundtrack with crummy machine noise and synthesizers in the vein of Brad Fiedel's classic scores for Cameron's Terminator movies. =/ I am rather biased in this respect, though, as I believe the simple yet stylish OST of the anime adaptation from early nineties is one of the best I've ever heard, though I understand that's partly nostalgia and partly because of how hard I got hit by the fan-bug when it comes to Alita/Gunnm. ^^; Still, seems nowadays both movie- and gamemakers tend to go for epic orchestral soundtracks, regardless of whether it actually benefits or even fits a story...All in all, if you're a fan of the original or just out to see a futuristic action romp, I would recommend checking Alita out. Knowledge of the original material isn't required as there's enough exposition to fill the necessary gaps, though at times it certainly helped to know a bit more about the backstory, even when they gave this version their own twists.Alita: Battle Angel is in my opinion a solid 7/10.",Alita - Battle Angel

1305,halimakbar,Dont listen to other bad reviews. It is awesome strong love emotion,9,16 February 2019,"When you watch this movie, you need to be with Alita. Not only her physical strength, but her heart and love.
She love Hugo so much and she would do everything for him. Even though Hugo look to be passive human, but you need to really understand that this movie is not a Mutant or super hero movie that human can have super power.
Hugo is just being a normal human being, nothing wrong with that, but atleast he stop his habit of taking other cyborg part for money because he love Alita so much and also trust on Alita to win the motorball. His acting is ok, because he is just human being, remember this.
When you are very deep into Alita, the last scene at the big pipe and Hugo die, that moment will make you a bit sad because Alita really love Hugo. The cries on her face is truly something.
Only thing why I give 9 star is that, the movie is very short. Nowadays, movie should be minimum 2 and a half to 3 hours. But it is only 1 hour 57 minute. They should make longer story of the love between Hugo and Alita.

1310,Ajkenney00,Makes me wanna read the manga!,7,2 March 2019,"Speaking as some one who hasen't read the manga, I certainly wanna read it now after seeing it!
It raised a ton of questions for me that I think only the manga could answer. Which is more than I can say for most anime adaptions made in the USA. Despite this, my desire to read the managa is also something I take issue with in that, the story itself is ""incomplete...""It doesn't help that half way through this movie it becomes pretty obvious there is bigger story to all of this that we are ""not"" gonna see here. Why? Because then want that sequel!
I really wish I could sit down with Jim Cameron and or Robert Rodriquez and say to them ""listen... enough already with this sequel set up! You and every other studio film is all concerned with making the next movie franchise. Well guess what! If this bombs which is likely to happen given the reputation of anime properties here in the USA, your not gonna get that sequel!
Focus on what you have now! Once it's satisfying grow the story from there, it's not like you don't have material to work with.""This movie did such a good job in the beginning setting up the relationships with her Christof Watlz and the character of Eugene along with this big mystery of her not knowing who she is (it reminded me of the Bourne Identity in that regard) along with how it's all tied to this unique world came and this ancient war that happened. Yet half way through the movie it stops that story to do what feels like side quests from a videogame and deal with Mahershala Ali's character and all the hunter killer cyborgs. Which is great for action but is a complete distraction from the rest of the narrative that is ""actually interesting.""These question about who she is and what is this world is are still in the back of your mind as you watch the rest of this movie, therefore many of the other scenes that have nothing to do with that plot lose a bit of their weight and tension. One scene in particular that I'd rather not spoil too much involves a charater that is ""very close"" to helping out the villans by giving up something of their's. It's exicuted well but in a more focused narratine where I'm not as destracted and only need to focus on the one scene, then I would feel the tension for all it's worth.This at the end of the day is a common example of how the episodic nature of most comics, manga or anime can work against the filmmaking which requres a more focused narative over the course of a 2 hour runtime. Especially if the filmmakers are concerned with making failthful adaptions like Alita right here.
If they do make the sequel which I hope they do, try and make the story more self contained this time. For this movie as an example, if you focused just on the relationships and then the bigger story of who Alita is then you got a solid movie on your hands! For now though, I do want the sequel which is why I'm reading the manga now. If the sequel doesn't happen at least I got the manga to answer my questions and complete the story. If so I feel we all deserve a more complete story in the end.",Alita - Battle Angel
1311,goofydoofy,If you are an action junkie or a sci fi fan DON'T MISS IT.,10,13 February 2019,I think Mr James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez assembled the best vfx team they could possibly hire. I was taken aback by the detail that went into the kinda dystopian world from the very first frame. The movie is serviceable as an sci fi action movie about a cyborg. What differentiates this one from others is the quality of cgi and the motion capture technology implemented to create alita and other cyborgs. I didn't even begin to talk about the action sequences in this movie. It is meticulously staged and awe inspiring whenever alita takes on the bad guys. The visuals are so cool and the fact that it feels so fresh amidst a sea of cgi action spectacles is a triumph and speaks about the genius of Robert Rodriguez and James Cameron. I can just watch it again just to relive those moments. The plot could be more engaging at times but who the hell cares when you are just admiring alita as this compassionate human being on one side and living weapon/nightmare for bad guys on the other side. Totally worth your time at the theatres.,Alita - Battle Angel

1313,malone-17304,One of the best underrated films of 2019!!! SPOILERS!!!!,7,26 December 2019,"As I watched Alita: Battle Angel, with it's stunning CGI and manga like features, I felt whisked away.
Although something did seem lacking that I couldn't quite put my finger on. The first hour of the film was unbelievable, but then after that the storyline seemed to drag abit and took a while to get to the point. Is she a soldier? A bounty hunter?? or a motorball champion??? It tried to explore too many of each possibility and it made the film drag on not coming to any conclusion, then at the end they just cut to 'she's one match away from being a star and going up!'
The film would of been a lot better if they focused on either the bounty hunter or the motorball storylines (in my opinion).
I think that is the only reason it didn't get a 10/10 from me.
The characters,were all there, the acting was brilliant but it was the storyline that let it down. I think they needed to simplify it and stay on track, instead of putting too much into it.
Great film though, with amazing fight scenes.",Alita - Battle Angel

1315,vincentphilipson,Alita: Battle Angel. A true masterpiece...,10,20 July 2019,"I just want to say that I had an absolute blast watching this movie. Probably one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever watched alongside some of the masterly crafted Marvel movies.The movie itself has some of the most stunning visuals I've ever seen with some of the most amazing CGI ever created witch helps create this amazing world where the story of a cyborg girl called Alita takes place.The acting is for the most part great and I was continually blown away by how good and satisfying the choreography in the many fight scenes were. Every punch or kick that is received feels like it has some weight to it.In my opinion the story was great and had a good pacing. Of course, not everything was perfect but I truly feel that everything that's so good about this movie covers up the little were it preforms worse.Before watching the film I had no knowledge of the manga and had never heard about it before. I went in with low expectations and absolutely enjoyed every second of it. Solid watch, would recommend to everyone. Really hopes it gets a sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel

Finally a film with no politics, it really shows that no, politics doesn't need to be involved in everything. Seriously if you haven't watched this film and are on the fence because the journos said it wasn't good, get your backside down on a chair and watch it, the journos don't know what they are on about this film blows Endgame out of the water in terms of originality.

Everybody enjoyed it.To be fair, i read Manga, so i could complain how horrible is new adaptation, as usual. But i got it backwards. Movie made me into Fan. I liked Alita in Manga, but i am not a reader so that kind of not for me. But movie really sucked me in, Loved characters, loved the action, loved everything about it. It's not perfect, but it's nearly 30 years old story. There should be cringe moments, there should be ""cliches""They really nailed it as adaptation. It is peace made by Fans for Fans. Peace done with Passion and Love. You can see it. It's MUST Watch",Alita - Battle Angel
1322,orangevigor,Almost Luaghable,3,24 February 2019,"Hello, and welcome to my first IMDb movie review. I am qualified to write an opinion based on seeing more than 40 movies a year at the theaters, and most likely,twice that with sites such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime.
First and foremost,I break things down into its basic format to simplify things.It
has become the norm in Hollywood to push projects using the theory of "" the public is dumb "".
Aside from a handful of movies each year,the vast majority of movies that get produced,NEVER should be.The rarity in Hollywood is ANYTHING new that shows true creativity.
This answers the basic format question.
90% of movies fall into the one of these immediately.Either terribly writing,acting,
or photography.
Alita suffers from all 3.The script does nothing new we haven't seen before,most of the cast is terrible,and unfortunately the cinematography borrows from ALOT of other movies.
Jennifer Connelly always looks like she just woke up on antidepressants,and Christophe Waltz is a complete waste in such a badly written,thin role.Keean Johnson walks so much like he's got terrible jock itch,it detracts from him actually being the best actor in this film.
Huge aspirations and little goals ruin this otherwise great idea.See something else.",Alita - Battle Angel
1323,ccroca,Must see,9,9 March 2019,Surprisingly good. The CGI and world building are A+. I plan on seeing this movie again with friends. Also look forward to a sequel.,Alita - Battle Angel
1324,joakimlhaugen-57143,Suprisingly good,9,14 February 2020,"From the trailer I expected this movie to be a 6 at best.

The story arc is excellent and gives this movie depth that I did not expect",Alita - Battle Angel
1325,gblakonia,"""Alita: Battle Angel"" film is GREAT!",10,3 May 2019,"Was skeptical on my 1st outing of this, say, 'mixed'(?) genre 1st attempt, but ended up seeing 'Alita' 11Xs total. Absosloutely 'Just What I needed' as my variable alternative. The total experience make's any and all of the very few 'quipes' forgivable. Rosa is a 100% PERFECT lead and Waltz should win another supporting OSCAR. Anxiously awaiting the sequels, which if any film is deserving of, 'Alita' is it. Best superhero/sci-fi film of 2019!",Alita - Battle Angel
1326,jmruiz-43067,Alita won my heart,10,29 April 2019,"I'm a long-time fan of the Japanese comic this movie is based on. And sometimes, movies based on comics can dilute the spirit of the original source material to the point where it just becomes a wash and generic. Not so with this movie. Firstly, Alita is based on the ""Gunnm"" manga written by Yukito Kishiro and follows the story of a young cyborg girl whose partially destroyed body is found in a dump below the floating utopian sky city of Zalem. She's found by a kind and sympathetic cyborg doctor who rebuilds and restores her and brings her back to life. She has a human brain but can't remember where she came from, who she is, nor anything of her past life. Only through conflict does she discover tidbits of her past and her true abilities. This is the premise of both the manga and the movie and I have to say that seeing this brought to life on the big screen was an absolute joy and even improved upon some aspects of the manga!In the movie we follow Alita's journey from being initially naive but curious. As things ramp up, as she finds herself in situations that threaten herself and those she loves and this is when she discovers she can kick some serious ass. Let me tell you, the action is so well-choreographed, so visceral, so hard-hitting and so jaw dropping that I had a hard time taking it all in (probably why i watched the movie 10 times). It helps that she is endearing, likeable too. Not just some CGI creation with uncanny valley facial expressions. Relatedly, the large eyes everyone was worried about in the trailers actually helped to accentuate all the emotions she feels, and that you feel for her.And the sci-fi world created by James Cameron, Robert Rodriquez and Jon Landau, oh my goodness, i wanted to go to Iron City, the setting of her story. It was very much alive and felt like a real destination. Even though it's downtrodden, and run down, you could feel like there was some real history behind it due to the war that brought humanity to this refuge. Above Iron City is the utopian sky city of Zalem where residents of Iron City can see but not touch, left only to imagine the wonderful things that are so tantalizing close.To conclude, you really do feel like you're on a journey with Alita played wonderfully by Rosa Salazar, an actress I had never heard of before but who I am now eager to see more of her work (Alita sequels please). When she's excited about something new, you are; when she's in danger, you are; when she feels, pain, loss, you do too. She's got a brand new world to explore and so will you. Give this movie a shot, you won't regret it.",Alita - Battle Angel
1327,cyclone-41819,A gem of a movie,10,2 April 2019,"20+ years ago I saw the anime, but I had forgotten most of it. I came in not expecting much - historically anime adaptations were notoriously bad. I was shocked - the movie was excellent. It was faithful to spirit of the original material (thus making the story/characters meaningful and good), with entire scenes even taken directly from the source. The action, and effects were superb, the acting great, and all without any identity politics or preaching. A symphony for the eyes and ears that creates a cinema experience so good I have rarely, if ever, experienced - even on repeat viewings (best in 3D in IMAX in my opinion). The feeling of happiness and contentment you get from seeing something special is like that of few other movies. I've heard it compared by older folk to the feeling of leaving the theater in 1977 after Star Wars a New Hope.What really makes the movie work though is the performance of Rosa Salazar as Alita. One can't help but love that character. The large eyes are not a concern, as you will accept them very quickly, and they work stylistically and plot wise. The knee jerk uncanny valley reaction is an initial reaction that is quickly overcome by the humanity and likability of the character.For parents, keep the PG13 rating in mind, as there is violence (not gruesome, but they get away with more than they should due to it happening mostly to cyborgs), and the ending will probably be under appreciated by pre-teens.Was the movie perfect? No. It's because you get so engaged and immersed in the movie, you notice really little things - lines of dialogue that you'd change or have the actor redo, and perhaps an effect or two that could have been improved catches your eye. Or maybe that it sets up a sequel may bother some (but hey - the movie covers only 2 of the 9 volumes of the original manga - what do you expect? Harry Potter did not defeat Voldemort in the first movie either, and I see no one complaining about that.). But then, if you're honest, you remember how incredibly trivial these gripes are when in relation to how the movie makes you feel and to the overall experience. If you then ask yourself how many stars do I knock off for these imperfections, you realize that no movie could ever reach a perfect score if held to the same criteria. If I were to give this movie anything else than a perfect score due to its faults, then a perfect score is pretty much unattainable for any movie, and what's the point of having a score no movie ever gets?",Alita - Battle Angel

It lacks cynicism in favor of tackling the sometimes ridiculous and cheesy moments with an earnestness that makes the moment work more often than not, in no small part do to the talent of those involved. On top of that, the wonderful work of WETA brings the manga's world into stunning realization. You have never seen anything quite like this.It isn't perfect, the last twenty minutes or so show clear signs of being cut down to fit a two hour runtime and the romance subplot will make you cringe, though part of that is intended.All in all, Alita is a must see that everyone should experience at least once.",Alita - Battle Angel

It had a lot of the hallmarks of big budget hollywood that I dislike, as well as overdone tropes & some predictable dialogue, but that was no surprise.On the positive side I really enjoyed the sci fi setting, in particular all the scenes on the busy dystopian streets. There were a lot of neat sci fi vehicles and things of the like that I found intriguing.As well there were a lot of really great action scenes that were stylish/brutal as hell. That's usually not my bag, but I can appreciate it for what it was.Tl;dr for my tastes it wasn't anything special, but surprisingly it had a lot of redeeming qualities.

I didn't know Robert Rodriguez directed this until the credits ran... and then I thought to myself ""Duh, that's why this movie was so insanely awesome!""

1346,kenclark-2,A gorgeous rendition of a creepy concept,8,18 February 2019,"I think I see the problem now. Why do so many of these manga-to-movie adaptations fail? There's a common element running through them that starts to explain the problem - they're creepy. As in, there's nothing attractive about the concept of cyborgs. Why do the Marvel comic adaptations work? Because the characters are human, albeit with some kinds of super powers. But they look like people and they act like people.I don't think the public is really that ready for eyeballs popping out, and replacing body parts with BS mechanical parts. It's just not appealing. It doesn't really work as science fiction either, because inevitably the reason people can become cyborgs is magic. Sure, they say it's technology, but really, rip someone's brain out, stick it in a machine, press a few buttons and they're practically good as new? We're only willing to accept it for the Marvel characters because they're still people.So when Hugo says Alita is the most human person he's ever met, it's the most ridiculous thing anyone in the theater will hear all week. But we're supposed to suspend disbelief for that? It's a bit much. Is all manga full of this kind of pseudo-scientific undead? (No, some of it involves pirates instead. Yeah, I know.)But it's a really well done piece of movie-making, and there are parts of the story that are terrific. I hope they make enough money to make a sequel, because I suspect the sequel would be half as macabre but with more terrific story.",Alita - Battle Angel

That was thankfully not even remotely the case.Balle Angel Alita is a masterpiece of comic to cinema. Having seen Marvel throw it's IP around like cheap confectionary and Disney drive Star Wars into the ground, seeing Fox do something right gave me renewed hope.

1351,starplatinum87,"Moving, beautiful, jaw-dropping",9,7 December 2019,"Umm ok so Alita: Battle Angel is HAWT! After seeing the trailer in theaters my expectations were decidedly low. It looked like it was going to be a shallow CGI confection that was going to be boring predictable and lifeless, and was going to totally miss the point of the source material. I can't speak to the last point, as I never read the manga, but I was utterly wrong about everything else.Alita is visually stunning, exciting, fun, original and genuinely moving film. It really takes its time in developing its characters and relationships, especially Alita herself. I'm totally on board with her and her journey by the end. Again I was seriously not expecting that at all. The got a pretty amazing supporting cast as well and none of them are wasted. The all contribute performances that enhance the story.As to the aesthetics, holy smokes this movie looks good. There is a lot of CGI and while it is obviously CGI it works for the world and look of the film. The merging of CGI cybernetics with human performers is really impressive and gives the film an feeling that is simultaneously kaleidoscopic and totally immersive. It's both subtle in Alita's look and performance and thrilling in the action sequences and those action sequences are completely jaw dropping.Quite often CGI-heavy sequences feel dead and artificial. This is partly due to filmmakers just overdoing it with the amount of action and elements simultaneously at work. The composition is poor eye doesn't know where to go to properly follow the action. The other less obvious aspect of this is the physics. When we see physics that are out of whack we may not be able to articulate it but we know something is off and this also makes heavy CGI scenes unconvincing. Composition, physics and choreography of Alita's action set pieces are spectacular. When I'm involuntarily saying ""wow!"", ""whoa!"", ""geez!"" they're doing something very right. So good.There are a few plot holes in my mind in terms of certain plot elements and character motivations at times, but by the end they were all washed away by how well-done everything else is. Nits to pick for sure though.In all Alita is a pretty magical sci-fi spectacle, that looks amazing, has great characters and a lot of heart. I was not at all expecting this and it's that much better because of it.
Really hope they make a sequel happen.",Alita - Battle Angel
1352,tsah_yawd,one of my favorite female heroes of all time,9,31 March 2019,"So surprised. i went because the fx looked cool (proved to be some of the best i have ever seen). what surprised me was how much i ended up loving so many aspects about the whole thing. i have always loved tough chicks in movies & tv ( Buffy tv series, Aliens, Terminator, Wonder Woman, etc.), and this main character possessed most everything i love about Wonder Woman & Buffy: becoming a super-powered, tough, strong female character doesn't mean she has to throw away all the things that make her a female of any age. these 3 characters mentioned get it right. this movie is a coming-of-age story, as much as it is a superhero arc, a fascinating & original sci-fi storyline, and a demonstration of just how good hollywood has gotten at combining cgi with live action. while not without a few minor flaws, they were easy to ignore because of how fascinated i was by the awesomeness. my favorite aspect: Alita herself. mostly a robot but has the brain & heart of a human. what makes this character (and the movie) work so well, is her evolution as a person. if the ""hero"" is nothing more than just strong & sarcastic, your emotional involvement is shallow. but if they are endearing, and they earn your respect, and they are able to make you connect with them, it makes you root for them like a cheerleader. not only do we witness her rediscover & hone her innate fighting ability (eventually becoming the embodiment of awesomeness), we also see her experiencing what most every young person does: the wide-eyed awe at seeing amazing things for the first time, the first bite of a delicious new treat, the fluttery feelings of a first crush, and the idealistically noble yearnings to do something good & stand for what's right. What makes her & Buffy & WW the perfect models of a strong female is that they aren't overly powerful like Superman (one of the most boring heroes of all time). they sometimes get defeated, maybe even badly. but this is what makes a survivor & a hero: they get back up, they learn, they improve, they evolve. they give their trust, and it sometimes bites them. but they don't let it kill their ability to still love. they don't just fight for what they want for themselves, but also on behalf of what's right for others that can't defend themselves, even if it means they may die in the attempt. when you watch the stories of these women, you see a full range of emotions. you see mistakes that they learn from, tragedies they push through. they keep trying to be better. they allow others to help/assist rather than petulantly going solo, because ""their god-like power needs no assistance from the petty sheep."" you see challenges rather than easy victories. basically, you see all the best inspiring things that we all want to see in a role model, regardless of gender. something we all aspire to find in ourselves.",Alita - Battle Angel

1363,kelsotom,Everything already seen...,5,20 February 2019,"It was announced for several years as one of the most anticipated projects of James Cameron, blocked by the processing of the cumbersome sequels of Avatar, has finally arrived in the hands of Robert Rodriguez, expert film director shot with digital scenes, the film adaptation of this science fiction manga in cyberpunk style.
The story takes place in a future Earth, back from the (usual) total war that took place hundreds of years earlier, socially divided between the poor who live in the trash of the rich and those who take advantage of the weak for their own return (scenario also seen this already). The technology of body prostheses has made great strides and it is normal to see more people with arms, legs and even the whole robotic body than people completely natural, as if anyone had amputations or serious accidents, even if the ancient war has now 300 years ... Or as if it were normal to be amputated a part of the body to have it replaced by metal ... and here I remember RoboCop and the psychological agony to realize that he lost his body and be transformed into a car. Here, none of this is ""normal"" no drama ...
Apparently, the only way to aspire to enter the circle of the richest and arrive at the flying city of Salem (the only veteran of the ancient war) and to become very champions of: Rollerball !!! Exact! Precisely the futuristic game of the homonymous film of 1975! (No comment). The plot is not only this of course, but there is little more and the result is a mix of many things already seen and told better ... The characters are flat, very stereotypical with no psychological deepening. Important actors have been hired (C.Waltz, J.Connelly, Mahershala Ali and another that you will discover ...) to use them very little, leaving room for cgi, motion capture and young actors in simple roles.
Moments of boredom alternate with scenes of action / combat also cute ... But the final feeling is to have seen a story already seen, where you could investigate elements much more interesting and instead are treated only superficially (the ancient war for example and the enemies who were winners). And then the final treat: the film does not end! Thus opening up to various sequels, which, given what I have seen, arouse on my part a level of waiting equal to zero ...
As always happens to me when I leave the cinema I gave a vote that then at the end of the reasoning that leads to this review ends up going down: I had given 6, now we move to 5.",Alita - Battle Angel

1367,olivier-lerch,Surprisingly good,8,1 March 2019,"This is probably the best film adaptation of a Manga to date. I was expecting another dumbed down teen movie butchering the original material (like Ready Player One) but Rodriguez & Cameron have done a decent job.Kuzutetsu aka the iron city is way too colorful and extras in shorts don't belong to the cyber punk genre but I can live with that. Taking out the Gore and the extreme violence was also necessary to appeal to the broader audience.Rosa Salazar's voice and tone humanize Alita fairly well with a nice touch of warmth. CGIs are worth the budget so much that I would recommend for once the Imax 3D version.Combining the motorball (volumes 3&4) to the Yugo/Vector storyline (first 2 volumes) without compromising their respective depth was a challenge, even more so in 122 minutes. There is just enough fan service and the storyline delivers an expected cliffhanger. The Ed cameo on the other hand was an unexpected icing on the cake.I very much hope this blast of a movie will beat the $500m earnings or any other score mark that will trigger a sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel

Cliche-ridden and compiled entirely by two-dimensional characters, this film fails to capture the spirit of what seems to be some quite interesting source material. Held under a microscope, the film's plot is nonsensical and filled with holes. If you want mindless action, perhaps you will enjoy this.

There are hardly any errors (besides a few forgivable subtleties, ie minor plot changes, which actually was better in the modern adaptation) as far as story is concerned, and perhaps the most 'human' science fiction film in recent years.The visuals are a triumph, thanks to Cameron's cg Wizards, and Rodriguez has directed his best film in years.

Sure, the plot is pretty standard and mostly predictable except for a few smaller ""twists"" and follows a rather usual pattern. But that's not really why you would go into this movie, and I doubt it was ever intended to be that way.The reason you would want to watch Alita: Battle Angel is for some sick VFX and awesome action. Luckily, this movie excels in both of these fields. Landscapes are stunning, Iron City feels alive and breathing, and the cyborg designs are truly something else. Plus some wonderful translations from Manga to screen, probably the most awesome fictional sport since Quidditch and fight scenes that are more over-the-top than the last few Fast & Furious movies combined, but without feeling out of place in the established universe.While I'm not entirely sure if I should have been laughing as much as I did during the screening, Alita: Battle Angel is truly a great piece of cinema, albeit a little bit by the numbers.",Alita - Battle Angel

1401,jackwhitt,"Top Notch Animation, Action Heavy, and a Strong Female lead",9,8 February 2019,I managed to get into a early showing of the movie and I am very impressed. The story is extremely condensed which cut out some of the back story which is disappointing but I think they did a good job with the time they had for the movie especially with the little over 2 hour run time. The animation is extremely good. They animated it to feel like something from a manga which is great considering it is an adaptation of a manga. Very beautiful set pieces and definitely fully utilizes modern movie tech. The action scenes are very well done and keeps you on the edge with how crazy it gets. I will say outside of the action scenes there is some cheesy scenes that made me laugh and cringe. I really liked how they portrayed Alita as a very strong character. I wished they built up more on her backstory but hopefully they do that with any subsequent sequals that they make for this new franchise. I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it.,Alita - Battle Angel
1402,AmonStarrick,It's hard to be immersed ...,5,15 February 2019,"The story is set in a futuristic world that's divided into the high class living in a flying city called Salem and the lower class living in Iron City. Iron City supplies Salem and Salem throws all their trash onto Iron City.
One day a doctor for cybernetics finds the core parts of a female cyborg on the trashpile and gives her a new body. He calls her Alita and kinda treats her as his daughter.
As it appears there are people who now want to kill Alita. To avoid spoilers I won't tell more.A big part of the world is the cybernetic thing. A lot of people have mechanical limbs and weapons like chainsaws and blades. It's nice to see that these cyborgs get ripped apart several times and you see a lot of PG decapitating.All that is at it's best in the motorball matches. A kind of sports, where you have to run a race and score points with a ball, while completely demolishing eachother.The Visuals are a two edged sword. Sometimes the green screen looks strange and blurry, as well as the people looking out of place. Speaking of out of place, Alita is probably the worst part of the film.Firstly, she is way too powerful in the first half of the film and it feels like she is never really in danger. Also she suffers from being completely into Uncanny Valley, which makes her stick out negativly in every scene she's in. Besides that she has generic and often cringeworthy dialogue, that's also pretending to be emotional and deep. It's hard to be immersed in a movie, if you can't accept the protagonist as a real character, because she is obviously not real.Another thing that tries to be emotional is the corny love story attached, that has no depth except from one or two questions if a human and a cyborg can love each other. But that's where philosophy ends. All that is underlined by a score that tries hard to be moving.
Pros:Ed Skrein's character, visually and he's a badassVisuals regarding cyborgsMotorball is a cool idea(The uncredited actor at the end)Cons:Alita is a bad character sitting right in Uncanny ValleyThe dialogue is generic, cringy and has lines, you heard several times beforeThe love story is corny and really hard to watch, because it's so cheesyEven though you should expect great FX, they are off at some pointsThough the worldbuilding is fine, the story isn't presented to the fullest potentialConclusion:I personaly don't hate this movie, but it's also nothing great. I personaly think it's just really whatever. 58/100 - 5/10",Alita - Battle Angel

The plot is as complex as blank A4, if you've seen one random movie before this, you'll know exactly what will happen next.But one positive thing is that it had potential, so people might pay attention to the manga, which was used as source material.",Alita - Battle Angel
1410,KvDavid,"Serves as a good premise, very mediocre otherwise.",6,9 February 2019,"Alita: Battle angel is easily the best of any Japanese graphic novels' adaptations, but that doesn't say much. Being better than garbage is not a significant achievement.Post-apocalyptic dystopian setting is what made this movie very entertaining, just like its source material. Low lever of life, poverty, high crime rate and other thrilling factors enhanced the sense of danger for the protagonist, who had just been brought to life, unfamiliar to her surroundings. The tone throughout the film was shifting very smoothly. The day pretty much always referred to joy, love and emotional growth of Alita, however the night always brought the threat of murderers, mystery and shock. This composition may seem simple, but it's very important for setting and atmosphere, since it displays and explores the depth of the Iron city . The hunters doing their job just to earn money, not to decrease the rate of crime presents the dark side of society, since they have to be the only lever of righteousness, also youngsters applying for immoral jobs to save up money for their selfish goals etc. However, there were many cringy and generic moments to flash-out characters. Romance was too rushed, very uninteresting and boring, so was the relationship between Alita and ido, very typical, very tedious. In short, the movie had good protagonists but the chemistry was weak, but unfortunately , the antagonists had no real chemistry at all, they were all boring, self-centered criminals.
The protagonists were decent. Alita was childish, since she was brought back to life in an unknown place, like a new-born. She was naive , stubborn, curious, emotional, often delusional thinking her decisions were always right, in short she had the characteristics of a child. Her significant development in the end was a bit rushed, lacked realism , but premise-excuse justifies it smh.
Ido was a fine character. Just being a kind doctor, often showing medical support without cost obviously wouldn't be enough to make him a good character. Thus, he had a very mysterious and dreadful side-job of destroying criminal cyborgs, not only for financial profit, but for self-interest as well. He was looking for a murderer to revenge his daughter, which made him quite a dark character with interesting contrast of being a kind, friendly doctor at daytime, and a ruthless avenger at night.
Hugo was a decent character as well. just like every good character in this movie, he also had dark side, selfish goals, obscure life. He was an ambitious guy, who did bad things to achieve his goal, but developed into a better person, knowing love and care from Alita. He also served as a good build-up for the story.
As far as the antagonists go, they were basically garbage, with zero personality and insignificant traits ( obsessed with facial beauty and other bs). They made the whole atmosphere kinda boring, throughout the plot, it was 3 main characters VS everyone, and the latter part had no interesting or believable reason to detest another, which made them into plot devices, developing protagonists' martial skills or personalities. Hope Nova will be opposite, be cause he is amazing in the source material and also Norton will be playing this role, so i'm highly anticipating this character.The action was high quality, very dynamic, fast, well-choreographed, well-produced with extremely good CG. I was not expecting the world and the characters to look so good, so detailed, not being ridiculous or cringy. The music fit the tone well, but it was mainly the same genre or composition, thus forgettable or not exceptional, though the sound editing was amazing, just as expected from cyberpunk action thriller.To sum up, Alita: Battle angel was a well-produced movie, with a few good characters, amazing setting and a good premise for (probably) a gargantuan sequel, however, it had not much to offer, some episodes were cringy and generic, the chemistry lacked realism and the antagonists were trash. Still worth a watch",Alita - Battle Angel

1423,wwweber-74250,An amazing achievement,9,21 February 2019,"I saw this movie first in Dolby Cinema and was blown away by expresiveness of the motion capture technology. Then I saw it in IMAX 3D and that took it to another level. Normally 3D movies are shot in 2D and through computer processing a 3rd dimension is artificially added. The live action in this movie was 99% shot with actual 3D cameras thus making the 3D more realistic. It was amazing how well the computer generated imagery merged with the live actors at both the 2D and 3D level. A major congratulations is due to the technologists behind this movie.So visually this movie is worth the entrance fee. But the story itself was both touching and packed with action. We all like to see the the bad guys get beat up.There is lots of mystery in the is movie as well and upon seeing it the second time, some of the mystery cleared up for me. So I recommend seeing this movie twice with the 2nd viewing in 3D. You won't be disappointed.",Alita - Battle Angel

That part's up to you.""-Dr. Dyson IdoAlita: Battle Angel is an adaptation of the manga/anime series and I feel the movie gave it justice. This film I thought gives a compelling storyline that might make you wanting more. I know I did. The CGI was well done that the character, Alita almost looked life like. This movie delivers its fair amount of humor and an endearing teen romance story. As for the action, if you like robots tearing each other to pieces, then this movie has some awesome, intense violent scenes that might make your adrenaline pump. I hope this film makes enough hype to get a sequel. I want to find out what happens next for this adaptation!
Go check out this movie, especially if you've seen the anime or read the manga and if you haven't, still give it try if you like Syfy stuff. You might enjoy it or dislike it, but this is my review for, Alita: Battle Angel, so just roll with it.",Alita - Battle Angel

The movie is below average, the plot, the actors, CGI...Once i watched it, I could remember what is all about. There some messages about moral, but by the logic it could not match with the complexity of the place where the story happen. It was garbage land, low class land, hard survival land, it should be as complex as Mad Max movie and similar type...but it was made like a childish story. I don't think this movie is for the kid, there are some brutal scenes in it.I rate 5, because, there are some part that I can enjoy, not much though+They should give Nurse Gerhad a script, at least two or three sentences or just say hey.

So much that I saw it a second time, dragging family along. They loved it as well.
Its a much better movie and better character than Captain Marvel.

1430,alexlunaros-27515,Horrible story line with atrocious acting.,3,26 February 2019,"I am absolutely shocked to see people giving this a good review. Did the studio actually make 2 versions of this, and send different versions to different theaters just to confuse people?
I was interested in seeing this movie from the get go,but I was planning to see it as a Matinee, because I am normally more forgiving of minor issues, if I only spend $5-$6 on my tickets, rather than $11-$14. I was then pleased to see the T-Mobile gave my whole family $4 tickets to see this, just for being their customer.
But then when I finally saw the movie, I was shocked at how awful the acting and the story line was. In quite a few of the main characters, it was almost impossible to figure out the characters intentions, just because of how flat and stale their performances were (looking at you ""Doctor Boring"", ""Ex-Wife Boring Face"", and ""Absurd Love Interest"").
The pacing of the movie was also extremely strange. I could never tell if the story felt like it has 20 minutes left, or 2 hours left, only for the real ending to kind of just drop on you unexpectedly out of now where, just when the action finally started to pick up.
I am not a complete nay-sayer though, I will give credit where credit is due, a couple of the battles were cool, and some of the visuals were nice.
In the end, I paid $4 for my ticket, and I still feel a bit ripped off.",Alita - Battle Angel

1433,diane-95587,"Started off pretty good, but then became annoying PC trash",2,16 February 2019,"I'm a woman, and I'm getting increasingly annoyed and dismayed by the lack of newer movies I can relate to, even partially.Why do most female roles in modern movies have to push the stronger-tougher-than-a-man narrative? I get that Alita is a cyborg, but still, the romance part of this movie just completely fell apart for me because of how impossibly tough and powerful she behaved, whereas her guy just plain wasn't. Most of the trailer for this movie, and the actual beginning of this movie portrayed Alita more in a sweet, feminine manner and the interaction between her and the guy was touching, nice, and realistic. That's one of the reasons I wanted to watch this sci-fi movie in the first place.But nope, as the movie progresses, we then have to make Alita incredibly powerful and dangerous to the point where it was stupidly ridiculous and I just couldn't take it anymore, and had to stop watching.Sick and tired of the PC crap that all female characters are somehow far tougher, stronger, and more powerful and dangerous than men, when in most cases it simply is not that way at all! If I cannot relate to a movie, and I'm going to assume there are many other women similar to me, then, hey, movie producers, you're going to start losing a large segment of your audience...continue this line of reasoning at your own risk.Or, at least have one main female role in the movie who is not incredibly, ridiculously powerful, and simply more normal.But otherwise, the special effects were great, the futuristic sci-fi world was interesting, yet the story just didn't hold my interest, see above for why.(also, the ending was very disappointing for me...I did come back to see it, and unless they're making a sequel, and that's why this movie ended in such a manner, poor choice for the finale).",Alita - Battle Angel

If I didn't enjoy the way the made ""being Alita"" so engaging, I would have given them a six but they really made her fun. It's nice to have the feeling of being and doing something we can not be so that being done well was so important.The part where the boyfriend gets dropped to his death was kind of pointless. She could have obviously saved him with her skills and capabilities. She should have just saved him because she could and then let him away on his own for being too lame to keep around.

1442,jqw-03736,Sci-fi romance done right and the best manga adaptation ever made,7,21 February 2019,"This was not what we needed, this was what we deserved from an anime/manga adaptation. I'm gonna be honest with y'all, I love reading manga and watching anime but I've never in my life seen a good adaptation of those things. Sure the Bleach one wasn't as bad as Death Note and all the attack on titan and what not, but I still didn't enjoy it. I haven't enjoyed any of them.That was until I saw Alita: Battle Angel this weekend. I haven't read the manga ""Battle angel Alita"" or seen the anime adaptation ""Gunnm"". But I know enough to know where the film should go to be considered a good movie. It starts of really well but then kinda drops the pacing a bit until it gets really good. So the beginning is really well made but the pacing can feel a little bit out of place sometimes, especially after the start of the film. I wanted to know a little bit more about Alita and her origins. Other than that I think the film really kicks you in and you can just enjoy the whole film without worries.It has great characters, especially the main characters being: Alita and Hugo. They are such well written characters with great origins and story's to tell, though I would've wanted a little more backstory for them both. They also have a really great villain, which I do not want to spoil cause he's so mysterious and just screams villain. The other bad guys also feel really thought out and it's clear what they want to do, which is really re-freshing, cause I think that can be a really stupid problem in modern movies.The plot itself is really easy to understand and I think this movie really tells what it wants to in a really good way. The surroundings feel so old but at the same time so new and modern. They have this really cool sport called motor ball which can both feel very cool cause it really says a lot about the characters when they're playing it but It can also feel like they're trying to do this really big, modern sport but not quite mastering it.And as I said before, I haven't watched or read any of the manga or anime adaptations of this story but I can tell you that this works really good as a stand alone movie but also as a love letter to all of the many fans out there that have been dying for this movie to finally come out.
It's really worth the hype!Final verdict:Though the story was a little too fast sometimes and I wish I could know the characters a little bit more then we already knew I think this movie was really well written and I would love to see a sequel after the avatar sequel. It's easy to say that this is true to the source material and I do highly recommend it to all types of movie fans. Whether you've read the manga or not this is a truly fantastic and beautiful movie and I will now watch the anime and read the manga until the sequel comes out.",Alita - Battle Angel
1443,jdlfsmc,Absolutely Amazing,10,26 August 2019,"As a senior citizen, I had very little knowledge or interest in Japanese Manga, and fully expected to be disappointed. Wow, was I wrong. James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez are phenomenal. Rosa Salazar nailed it. The CGI ""gods"" are miraculous. When I first saw Alita, it only took 20 seconds to be captivated and to completely ""see"" a real person and never again see her as CGI. Christoph Waltz was a perfect choice for Ido. Jennifer Connelly as a ""baddie"" was interesting. Amazing effects totally integrated with live action make you feel like you're there. Saw no flaws in the final movie.

1445,brambergs-09181,What's not to like? Well...,9,6 July 2019,"I must say I really enjoyed this movie. As a big VFX-fan this must have been one of the best movies ever, since Alita's skin texture and facial and body movements are extremely precise and believable.The story itself isn't a big gamechanger as there are a few bad guys, some fighting (great actionscenes by the way) and a mysterious lord of evilness, which makes you wanting and hope for a sequel. Put in several growing relationships and it is bound to succeed in terms of likeability.The only thing that's bothering me, just like with Ghost in the Shell, is the Americanizing of anime-films. I would've loved to see this sort of films coming from the land of origin with Hollywood-budgets. Still, Alita: Battle Angle is a very decent movie with good acting, stunning visual effects and some thrilling scenes.",Alita - Battle Angel

1460,Foster-the-Man,"... very hardcore, spiritually and visually aligned with anime ...",9,9 March 2019,"Battle Angel Alita watched in 3D was a literal blast. I waited for a while to see a hardcore action sci fi made with the use of most advanced CGI. Blomkamp was doing that but he is relegated now and of course Cameron originated it. And eventually via Cameron that kind of stuff resurfaced in Battle Angel Alita.I was completely sold on the character and got so immersed that I forgot it was a CGI performance capture. It was so well done that in some instances included short bursts of hamminess which made it all the more human and now I feel that director Robert Rodriguez left those blunders on purpose.The world of dystopian post-war future is lived-in, worn out, with sporadic technical advances and loads of all mechanical things that sort of managed to prove their worth as time went by with all the EMPs and whatnot.The world is very old school in its anime approach, and very adult in its noirish stylings in certain sequences, especially the clashes when Ido is chasing down the city ripper.When action commences, we would've been getting hard-R stuff if people weren't fully or partly replaced by robots. Beheadings happen very often, limbs get cut off and ran over. Overall this is very hardcore, spiritually and visually aligned with anime and the way we imagined it brought to life.My biggest qualm was the ending. Alita was definitely set up to be the opening film in a trilogy or something along those lines. Thus I miss the final climactic fight. We have one, but the story went on afterwards and it felt as if another one should be ahead. But there was no futher climactic battle. However, I didn't feel cheated because some strong emotional moments stood there instead of the final boss fight.Anyhow, a lot of strands were left to be resolved later on and I hated it. I like my blockbusters well rounded and self sustained.",Alita - Battle Angel

1464,kavanpetr,The hero of our time,10,30 April 2019,"Alita caught my interest with her strangely big eyes and otherworldly yet humanly look. I did not expect much more from movie than nice sceneries and visuals, but man, I was so wrong! Alite offers first and foremost the most human and most lovable hero I have ever seen. She is so much packed together in her quite a small body! An insecure teenager stumbling clumsily through her first love, innocent almost-daughter of a loving almost-father and best fighter all around, who needs to fight in order to recall lost memories. I really enjoyed this character who believably connects all her antagonistic traits.But apart from main heroine, I have to highlight CGI (which is very good) and particulary the fight scenes. Fights in latest movies (for example from MCU) are so full of cuts, that you never really see what the fighters are doing. But not in Alita. You can enjoy her beating her opponents (or being beaten by them) as if you stood next to her, while being offered some iconic well designed shots from other angles when necessary.",Alita - Battle Angel
1465,zhangle-84512,"Not just groundbreaking effects, but also brimming emotions.",10,1 May 2019,"This movie isn't by any means flawless, but it can be subjectively. It has all the properties a good film should have: a lovable and relatable lead character, countless of emotional scenes, spectacular action sequences and a powerful ending.
Some people may say the love interest is bad but I disagree. In my opinion, that's what a first love is supposed to be and devotion itself really shouldn't be condemned. And some may say the ending is terrible and the story is cliche and all. But again I completely disagree too. First of all, in order to make the subsequent core conflict more sensible, you need to introduce the world, the characters and the motives of all the characters that get involved in. This is what every franchise does, like MCU or DC, or more specific trilogies like Batman Begins or Jason Bourne or whatever. And the ending of the movie itself, in my opinion, is just like any MCU post-credit scene except for being even more powerful. It's far more than a teaser. You can see the inner change of the lead character because basically there is no smile on her face any more and you can relate to that. Second, this is a manga adaptation, so the production needs to pay respect to the source material and in the same time appeal to the audiences. I honestly don't think there's much room for improvement for this 2-hour film. And I'm even astonished there are filmmakers that have the balls to make a film this unique.
Anyways, with the box office it's getting right now, I don't know if this movie will get a sequel at all. But either way, I love the hell out of this movie. And most important of all, it makes me really care about this cyborg girl, one hundred percent.",Alita - Battle Angel
1466,juanfernandomc,Best 2019 movie BY FAR!!!,10,19 May 2019,Amazing movie. Ten times better than endgame.. It should be the number one movie at box office..,Alita - Battle Angel
1467,chrisncarolyn,"If you give Alita your time, she'll give you her heart. WOW!",10,4 April 2019,"Ever bored on a random weeknight, where you end up looking for a movie to watch? This particular night, you feel like seeing an action flick and one that is available is a movie called Alita: Battle Angel with pretty bad critic reviews. *shrug* A little cookie-cutter mindless action flick can't be too bad. And then... the moment you finish watching the movie and say to yourself ""My god... What in the world did I just watch? Rather... Experience?!?"" Well, this was me. After watching it a second time, my conclusion is that Alita: Battle Angel is one of the most spectacular cinematic experiences in a really, really long time.Alita is a cyborg whose core (a human brain with a unique and powerful heart, in more ways than one) is salvaged from a scrapyard by Dr. Ido, a cybernetics surgeon (or a doctor for cyborgs). He gives her a new lease on life, and when she wakes up, she has no memory of her past. As an innocent teenage girl (that is 300 years old), she goes through a journey of self-discovery.This is not a superhero with superpowers crushing the villain at the end kind of movie. Yes, Alita kicks the snot out of baddies throughout, but the real enemy she defeats is the enemy within... her naivety, lack of self confidence, and finding purpose. Even her awkward teen romance (which was intentional...) grows into a mature one full of forgiveness, faithfulness and devotion. She wins a lot and she loses a lot but through it all, continues to learn, never gives up and keeps on fighting. By the end, she is a warrior who knows her mission.Alita is not the only hero in the story. There were heroes in Alita's life that defined the hero Alita would become. Alita is empowered by those around her, and in return she empowers and inspires others, even people she doesn't even directly interact with. This is real empowerment... people empowering each other to be better. It is NOT someone who ""empowers"" themselves... especially by putting down or blaming others.The visual effects are literally out of this world. As a live action movie, it's nearly impossible to figure out what is real and what is not, allowing to you to really get immersed in the world they built. The attention to details is just amazing. Great characters paired with incredible action and an emotional roller-coaster of a journey makes this movie a winner.Rosa Salazar is the real gem in her genuine and convincing performance. She give her heart (figuratively and literally) in it and it shows. Christoph Waltz is also amazing as usual. Mahershala Ali and Jennifer Connelly (actually pretty interesting character arc if you look into it) are also great. Keean Johnson was a slight miss for me, but even then, he gave his best as Hugo.The score is perfectly crafted by JunkieXL (Mad Max: Fury Road). You can actually watch videos of how he built the themes for each of the characters on his YouTube channel. If you understand the themes, you can literally re-experience the entire movie just by listening to the soundtrack, which masterfully tells the story.Considerations: The movie is extremely violent, borderline Rated-R. There is also one use of the F-bomb (though... probably the only way to convey the intended message in that dire situation).Recommendation: 10/10. HD a must, 3D if possible (The movie was meant to be seen in 3D). Also, buy the Blu-Ray for family and friends, and tell them to do the same if they like Alita!!",Alita - Battle Angel

Anyone who has been paying attention will see the insane amount of new fans that have shown up for this amazing film and character. Everywhere on social media, forums, etc there are tons of people talking about it. Individuals saw this movie over 100 times in theaters, another person said they would literally sell their soul for a sequel. The last time I saw this kind of dedication to a franchise was Lost, and Star Wars before that.ARE YOU LISTENING FOX/DISNEY/CAMERON? DO YOU LIKE MONEY?? Because you are leaving A LOT on the table by not running full speed with Alita. Learn the (very painful) lesson about marketing and messed-up theatrical release dates, realize this movie has EXPLODED, and get your collective butts moving on a sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel
1471,ablake-48519,Unique but not great.,3,3 May 2019,Interesting steam punk like style reminds me of some older films. Was able to predict basicly everything so that was a little disappointing. The love story will cause most people to cringe reminds me of a mixture of hunger games and twilight. A lot of the story progression is very convenient and feels a little unusual. I think the best thing about this movie is the action. Great fight scenes. I would be willing to see a second movie but I wouldn't want to watch this one again. It could be a lot better.,Alita - Battle Angel

The visual effects are absolutely stunning, the characters(especially Alita) are endearing, and the action is jaw-droppingly awesome. On top of that, a lot of scenes are directly ripped from the source material, with the entire story staying faithful to the manga and animated film. I genuinely felt sad when the film ended, because I genuinely did not want the movie to end. I wanted to see more. And I hope that this movie gets a sequel, as well as the recognition that it so very much deserves.",Alita - Battle Angel

1474,damaster-01043,Im begging for more,9,24 July 2019,This movie is absolutely amazing. I loved every minute of it. None of those rediculously stupid characters. Just a really brave character in a world of troubles and danger. A good balance of happy vibes and sad moments and action. The end certainly can't be the end because it isn't the end of the story. This movie is not complete. Its like watching a first half. If they don't make a sequel it will actually turn this movie into a total disappointment for me. That being said the ending leaves a satisfying feeling of progress in the life of the character and it leaves lots of room for the next installment. I just really hope the next installment comes soon.,Alita - Battle Angel

Awful acting. Awful characters. Waste of incredible actors. Remember when Christoph Waltz won TWO Oscars?! He looks ridiculous with his gun on this. He deserved better. Alita is a bland character with no personalities. Her love interest is horrendous. Worst boyfriend ever in a movie. This movie was boring honestly. The plot is convoluted. It cares more about setting up the sequel than its own story. There is no story. The dialogues are laughably bad. Line delivery was awful. Please watch any other good movies instead.,Alita - Battle Angel

Waste of great actors who won Oscars in the past. Exists only to set up another sequel. The main character is unlikable. Her love interest is worse, worst love interest in cinematic history. Christoph Waltz is there mostly for the paycheck and you can tell that by seeing him in the movie. Mahershala deserved a better role. Jennifer Connelly is... just there. I can't name any of the characters honestly. Movie was so boring and forgettable. The fanbase of this movie is total garbage. What the hell were they thinking when making this?",Alita - Battle Angel

1488,cmsulit,Alita ups the ante in scifi animation,10,20 February 2019,"Synopsis
The year was 2563, 300 years after the ""Fall"" when humans and cyborgs (half human, half machine) coexist in a post-apocalyptic world. Alita is found as a machine scrap in a junk yard. She is rebuilt into a fully functioning cyborg and later realizes that she is the last remaining remnant of a now-extinct breed of warriors who are technologically advanced. At the Motor-Ball, she unleashes her wrath with her agility and her Excalibur-like sword.Visuals
The visuals are simply stunning! Alita was almost human-like if not for her oversized doe-eyes that allow you to almost glimpse into her soul, not unlike the world-famous National Geographic poster of the Afghan Girl Alita: Battle Angel (2019) The cyborgs carried the realism being human and machine. Action at the Motor-Ball was riveting although a bit too fast-forward motion which remains the Achille's Heel of CGI animation. The backdrop of the city's urban-industrial decay rendered a 3D-like depth to the cinematography.Human Factor
The movie again is too well-aware that without a gripping storyline to add flesh and blood for a compelling human narrative, the movie won't amount to anything more than a mindless CGI over-indulgence, typical of most Marvel movies. But this one almost rivals the original Robo-Cop is portraying nail-clinching human drama as man struggles out of a machine's confines.Ending Thoughts
Movies seem to be out-doing themselves with every release. Spiderman broke the mold, and Alita, much like the barrier-breaking emergence of the Avatar movie, sets a new benchmark in sci-fi animation. Highly recommended viewing!",Alita - Battle Angel

From the visuals of the opening scene to the casting to the sound track and did I already mention the visual effects, make this movie a must see for manga=anime fans. This is a live action movie. As the movie progresses I was tickled by all of the great actors in this film. Because I had seen the manga, there are scenes that just stand out. This movie just have me in tears with each scene as I marveled at how well it was put together graphically and how the actors brought the manga to life. If there is an Alita 2, I will be sure to not only see it, but purchase it to possess it. I end this post as I started, I love this movie!",Alita - Battle Angel
1490,vitalyx,"Don't expect a strong story. Watch this for the action and the visuals, they are great.",7,18 February 2019,"Went to see this today with no expectations while waiting for my visa appointment. I thought Christoph Waltz's and Jennifer Connelly's acting was decidedly mediocre here, but liked Rosa Salazar (a new name for me) as Alita. She captured the innocence of Alita, as well as her teenage rage very well. The animations are brilliant. The CGI is great too -- lots of well crafted characters and locations.I know they tried to make a movie that kicked ass, and it did, it's packed with gripping action, but I found the level of violence to be disturbing (the movie is rated PG13, and I'm a 33 year old male), and, combined with the post-apocalyptic cyber-punk world that hardly any one would want to live in, the movie itself somewhat depressing at times. The movie is long but still lacks closure, which isn't too disappointing because the story is very corny.",Alita - Battle Angel

In the original comic book series there was no ""motorball"" but a gladiatorial combat between cyborgs and in my opinion this made for a much more gritty and entertaining storyline.
My other bugbear is that they toned the film down a lot it seems to attract a younger clientele.
Other than that it was on the whole a visually stunning film and did hold true to a lot of the characters so still worth seeing.",Alita - Battle Angel

The depth of the Characters is what truly pulls you in. Alita can be everyone!The stunning Visual Effects make Alita look like a real person and creates a world in which you feel fully immersed (In 3D). The eyes of Alita are slightly larger than normal, but, they express the innocence and love within her. The mixed sets creates a sense of realism as if it's totally believable.

1504,58746tre349iup,"Visually stunning, story deteriorating",6,20 February 2019,"I went into the cinema with no expectations, except to get visually stunned. That's what happened. The world of this movie is very creatively done. The detailes are immensly creative. From the bikes, the tools to the buildings and the people living in it is very cool. The cybord / robot bodies are very well done. In short: the hole visual effect of this movie is on the highest rank. And the action scenes bring what you expect: adrenaline.
3D-Effect: in my opinion the technology to make movies in 3D nowadays isn't far enough to make it worth the trouble. But, it will develope and one day it will probably blow our minds.
Plotwise the movie was up until the middle quite ok. I was a bit confused, what actually the target audience was, because there very soaky romantic scenes in it, some very childish dialogues and then some very surprising cruel moments too. The concept of the plot is all in all interesting, but they screw that up, with some dialogues. You don't have to tell the audience, that the big bad guy doesn't like dogs. We saw that. It's ok to leave maybe some of the younger audiences confused. Then there is something to talk about. That's the mistery of movies. If you serve up everything on a silver platter, after the movie we come out and there's nothing more to discuss. That's a sad tendency in todays movies. I remember the first Matrix movie, Memento and others who made us discuss them for weeks after we saw them. Not gonna happen here.
The characters are a bit superficial. Alitas love for Hugo is absolutely baseless, the change of Igo's wife comes out of nowhere and Alitas urge to help everybody, since she's the most advanced battlehardened weapon there is, is questionable.

1509,whosjohnny-148-605982,The human side of the story is what gravitates me and I love it to death the big crystal eyes CGI done right,10,5 February 2019,"With 3 Oscar winning actors/actress and with a director name as big as James Cameron, you wondered what is wrong with all the Critics? Yes, I wondered. So I went and watched it for myself in Hong Kong on Feb-4th 9:40pm 3D IMAX showing; I'm from Los Angeles, CA on vacation. The movie delivers, on so many levels where do I begin? First, I love the continuity and the flow of the story from the first second of the opening sequence. There are just enough element and focus on each character to push the story forward and you actually care about Alita, which is where Marvel shines and DC failed; but DC have recently learned with Wonder Woman and Aquaman and their box office numbers reflected those lessons. The 3D was filmed in such a way to only use it when necessary to highlight depth and does not create nausea for even the most sensitive audiences during action sequences - super big plus on that aspect. If anyone doubt James Cameron has a hand in this movie's directing, this alone should put any doubts to rest; Alita is an improvement on top of what Avatar did for its cinematography. Some critics made comments on Alita not caring for where she comes from, I would like to dispute that here. She emphatically on many levels and many parts of the movie wanting to look back toward her past - I believe the movie made enough effort on this. I feel its balanced, any more would have been annoying and I would even tell Alita myself, focus on your present and the future. Musical scores is a 10 in my opinion, the same group that did Mad Max, powerful, spot on.Now for its negatives, they're not a big deal in my opinion. I wish the movie would be 30-45 mins longer and felt like they're reserving it for sequels with an ""s"". Gone are the days when a single blockbuster movie is meant to stand on its own, so I agree with many critics on this aspect. But can we really do anything about it? That's the big question.My personal opinion is a must see Sci-fi action flick in IMAX and in IMAX 3D, do not wait until even for your 65, 70 or 80 inch TV at home. Was going to give it 9/10 but due to idiotic critics, I move it 1 over to 10/10 to counter balance the B.S.",Alita - Battle Angel

Of course a long and tense expectation builds high expectations that often collapse against the disappointing reality.

The action scenes, however, are as smooth as butter and definitely make this movie a must see for anyone a fan of high energy action.I decided to watch it a second time because the action and world-building was so impeccable and found myself completely unphased by the more awkward drama scenes.All in all, Alita is certainly a must see for anyone looking for casual movie to simply enjoy and be treated with everyone visual effects and lore.",Alita - Battle Angel

I would absolutely recommend going to see it in 3D & honestly if I hadn't, I think my rating would have been closer to a 6. Some extremely beautiful CGI & action makes up for the target kiddy audience lines, jokes & etc. If only this could have been a little bit darker, it could have been something really special!",Alita - Battle Angel

It has a story which is decent enough, but it's also setting you up for an even bigger better story which is unlikely to be made. So just like the first lord of the rings it ends with no real progress on the main story arc, leaving you disappointed. But everything to that point has been amazing.Overall I think it's still worth watching.",Alita - Battle Angel

People need to understand it is an anime adaptation. And it is the best adaptation so far without compromising the source material. And the eyes, oh my God they did it so elegantly keeping her appearance close to the manga. Every bits and pieces falls in the place. If you think few things should have been changed... Go read the manga. Being true to the source is one of the most important factor of any anime adaptation which most other adaptations failed and Alita: Battleangel nailed it.

Following Alita from being a girl who knows nothing about herself and the world to a full fledged warrior was interesting and having Christoph Waltz joining me on that journey was, as always, a pleasure.

My friend who I saw the film with loved the manga and (like me) went into the movie with caution. What we found was a story that was engaging and entertaining, a loveable character we was cheering for, characters that were interesting and we was left wanting more!

It has a great story (if you're into cyberpunk and/or anime) with great action scenes, emotional dialogue that doesn't seem forced, and a romance that seems completely natural. Even if you don't go for the story or the romance I recommend it because the action it something I have never seen before, fast paced, original and brutal enough for PG-13. Also I have read the manga and it does stay true to the story for the most part, besides changing a few names to match western culture.An anime adaptation done RIGHT that anyone can enjoy.",Alita - Battle Angel
1538,prometheus-unbound-x,Another weak manga adaptation,5,18 February 2019,"The original story has plenty of raw material to make a superb action sci-fi live action movie. Instead it's formulaic, uninspiring and the dialogue reaffirms that James Cameron should never be allowed near a script. Ever. The Motorball scene was great though.",Alita - Battle Angel
1539,David_Schmitt,Eye bleedingly gorgeous.,9,13 February 2019,"I never understood the hype for Avatar by James Cameron. I chose not to see it in 3D as that usually gives me a headache, so I was left with seeing a fairly mediocre sci-fi/action film. At the time I much rather wished he had done the long promised Alita film.Fast forward to now and we have the long promised Alita film based on the beloved Japanese manga by Yukito Kishiro. A cyberpunk sprawling saga focusing on a cyborg learning about her past and reclaiming her sense of self. I've read four volumes of this series and it's a beautiful work of art. I've never seen a more faithful adaptation from manga to live action until I saw Alita Battle Angel at a fan screening in Toronto.First, the elephant in the room. In order to make her unique to the characters around her, James Cameron wanted her to have big expressive eyes, both as a sign of early innocence and to give homage to the manga where her eyes are also drawn like that. Now, most characters in mangas have this feature, it's a cultural norm for the comics, but Alita's is especially large and the trailers in the beginning even gave me pause and wondered if this was a good idea.
Well, I'm here to tell you that in the actual film they have since tweaked the look and integration and it no longers look off-putting but gives her the uniqueness they were going for. I was accustomed to it five minutes into her introduction.Rosa Salazar gives a wonderful mo-cap performance, really outstanding and I'd say she did as good a job as when we first saw Andy Serkis as Gollum. I completely believed this was Alita from the manga. Her relationship with her surrogate father Dr. Ido played by Christoph Waltz was believable and touching, especially when you learn about Ido's past. The other major relationship is with Alita's friend Hugo, a boy from Scrap City (the location most of the film takes place) a scavenger and opportunist who wishes to move to the sky city Tiphares. It is also sweet though suffers a little with the amount of story they saw fit to tell.That is about the only negative I have with the film. The script is based on three volumes of the comic and were pushed into one film, though thankfully the core story isn't affected too much, but some supporting characters played by Jennifer Connelly and Mahershala Ali get a little truncated screen time.The SFX are magnificent and should easily win this years sfx awards at the Globes and Oscars, because I doubt anything will be able to top it. The combining of practical and computer effects by WETA sets a new high benchmark for future films.Lastly, the fight sequences are spectacular. Not only in their look and execution but they are clearly seen and easy to follow, kudos to the editor. These are an insane anime battle come to life, it's a treat for the senses and they executed it flawlessly.In conclusion I think it's a fantastic sci-fi adventure. I think young girls would especially enjoy this as Alita is an excellent heroine (James Cameron is known for that). Robert Rodriguez's style very much mimicked that of Cameron's own, so this feels more his then a typical Rodriguez production. I DID see this in 3D+IMAX and no, I did not get a headache and I'd say this would be the preferred way to see it on the screen. The 3D was blended very well and was made to be from the ground up. It's a fun time at the cinema. I plan to see it again with friends because I'd LOVE to see more of this world.",Alita - Battle Angel

1550,vzwbiggs,Where To Begin?,9,16 February 2019,"From the start, it is easy to fall in love with the main character and observe her childlike wonder as she learns about the world around her. While she begins to learn pieces of her past life, there are moments where the reactions of other characters become somewhat predictable. This is not wholly a detractor as a number of these moments are rather delightful.The action and imagery of the entire film are indeed something to behold and would be worth the price of admission alone. However, the main characters perform well and are easily relatable in their own weird way. Both Christoph Waltz and Jennifer Connelly's characters have their own secrets and surprises that are revealed over time that add to the interest of their respective roles, providing a few ""ah-ha"" moments that make the story more interesting.One negative mark I would give is in some of the actions of the male love interest which were going to be either confusing to the story or somewhat predictable -and not in the enjoyable way mentioned earlier. The role is deftly played by Keean Johnson who portrays well the role he is given, and is thus certainly not a deal-breaker overall.Without giving spoilers, the movie has levels of both triumph and tragedy that make for a bittersweet ending that leaves open additional chapters to be told of our hero's journey -a prospect that would be most welcome.",Alita - Battle Angel

If you're going into this movie blind like I did without any knowledge of the lore of Alita Battle Angel, don't worry. It will entertain you for sure.I saw it in iMax 3-D, if you have the money, go for it. If not, I'm sure it's worth watching it in standard.

1558,andersonben13,A Skeptic-Turned-Believer,10,31 March 2019,"I, like many others, initially wrote this movie off after seeing the first trailer and hearing what the ""critics"" had to say. At first glance, it seemed disjointed, uninteresting, and bland. I was wrong. So, so very wrong, and pleasantly so.After seeing Alita: Battle Angel the first time, I was blown away by the world it presented and the characters that lived within it - particularly the movie's namesake, Alita. Based on Yukito Kishiro's 1990's Manga, the Iron City world of Alita: Battle Angel is alive with memorable sets occupied by a believable society that works to serve the domineering city above: Zalem. While using some of its source material's 1990's clichés, this movie still subverts and zig-zags a few modern tropes we've grown accustomed to from the likes of Marvel flicks.Beyond the settings though is the real highlight of this film: Alita. While most characters are played and portrayed particularly well, Rosa Salazar's Alita is as believable as she is lovable. Her journey from a newly revived, confused young woman to a hyper-lethal warrior is something to cheer for, and you feel her passion and her emotions throughout each scene. Part of what makes her character development a joy to watch is the dichotomy between her naive innocence and courageous lethality. While many people pointed out how offputting her eyes are (not so subtly their size), you quickly become used to them and notice they convey more emotion than even the dialogue manages at times.A rough spot many other viewers have pointed out - that I will concede on - is the stiff and awkward dialogue at parts, particularly between Alita and Hugo. Admittedly these portions could have been better; however, they do stay true to the source material.I could go on and on about this movie, but the bottom line is that the movie is a labor of love on James Cameron's part, and it shows. The quality of the design and world-building is unrivaled, and every facet of the movie speaks a sincerity and warmth that is so often lost in most modern action movies. It sets a benchmark. If you haven't seen this movie yet and it's still in a theater near you, ignore the stuck-up critics and go see it! I promise you won't be disappointed.I skeptically wrote Alita off in the beginning. This Tuesday will be my 6th viewing.",Alita - Battle Angel

1562,aronzskv,"Stunning, but just to cliche",7,21 February 2019,"To start off, I did not hate the movie, but I also didn't love it that much.
I will start off with the very obvious, massively praised visuals. They look realistic and you can definitely see that a lot of work and money was put into that part of production.
The story wss also interesting. It was something new for Hollywood, I know it is based on the Manga named after Alita, but Hollywood has not seen anything like this, brought to the big screen with this quality.
Obviously there were also many flaws. First of all, the lines sounded like someone watched a lot of movies and picted every single memorable and cliche line out of every movie and put it into the script. For example: ""I would rather rule in Hell, than serve in heaven."" How many times have you heard this line in a (WB) movie?
The build up off the movie was pretty darn long. I'm glad they 'introduced' Alita through flashbacks, it created some mystery in the first half of the movie.
The movie had also this massive sequel bait. It is understandable that WB wants to create hype around the name and movie, but why in this way? You meet the real main villain only during the last 10 minutes and he appears like 2 times on screen, in his true form.
So considering the fact that the storytelling and script were a bit annoying, it was not bad at all.",Alita - Battle Angel

And frankly, I didn't care that he was involved. I've never liked Avatar that much. I went with expectation to see spectacle. And good lord did it deliver. It was a blast from finish to start. Yes, some parts felt rushed and some plot point could have been developed better, but for what the movie offered it was perfect. My main problem is that it tried to set up a sequel and with the box office numbers I'm little worried that we won't get that. I hope it will do good. However, along with the spectacle I felt an emotion. The chemistry between the main characters work. I even felt kinda of sad for one of the characters, who had no more than 10-15 minutes of screen time. Alita was done so perfectly right. From the visuals (Oh GOD THOSE EYES..... so... Beautiful), to the character arc an on. She never felt out of touch or just placed there. I won't deep dive into the movie, since there are other reviews which will do it better than men, but if you want to see a good movie, with great visuals, good story and characters and have a great time, this right now is the movie for you. It's the MOST FUN I had since Infinity War in movie theater.P.S. Girls, you might not want to bring your boyfriends to this, since the might fall in love with those eyes :D",Alita - Battle Angel

1568,highnessatharva,A futuristic action packed movie which deserves to be seen only on the big screen.A visionary motion picture.,10,9 February 2019,"Alita Battle Angel: Why Watch.*This has been a dream project of legendary producer and director James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez (the makers of Avatar and Titanic) since 2003. Their meticulous efforts in designing this futuristic masterpiece is seen in every frame if the movie.
*The visual effects are powerfully smashing, stunning, brilliant, vibrant and dynamic filmed with cutting edge technology. A visionary motion picture.
*A futuristic action packed movie like that of Ready Player One, Avatar, Ghost in a shell which deserves to be seen only on the big screen. Rush to nearest theatres now!
*It's a franchise. If you know me personally I'm positively obsessed with manga and anime and this film is heavily based on the manga named 'Battle Angel Alita' and have heard people say that Cameron does Justice to the manga with a remarkable Western adaption which works wonders. Probably the greatest Manga to Movie adaption I've seen ever.
*Groundbreaking audioeffects and audio engineering accompanied by Dua Lipa's Swan Song at the credits.
*Rosa Salazar's role as Alita is centric to my fascination with the movie. A very powerful, bold, beautiful, articulate, female lead characters that I couldn't help but fall in love 😍 with. Acting 💯
*A strong, fast paced complex storyline and a likeable plot twist. Story is almost fluid. Multitude of secondary characters with sub par character development.
*Abrupt and surprising end hinting as a teaser for the sequel. (I'm elated!!)
*Adrenaline invoking action scenes nearly every 5 minutes. Alita's always in motion. Endless robot warfare and awe inspiring groundbreaking physics defying, visually appealing scenes around every corner. Just watch it☺
*Movie set in the 26th century with advanced warfare technology, biotechnology, sky high monuments, a city floating in the skies, passionate love between humans and cyborgs, biologically fused robotic population, 100 fingered and multi-limbed guitarists, wrecking ball based competitions and fashionable unicycles, what else do you even need?
*A perfect escape for the weekend. And family friendly too. Some cheesy scenes but nothing explicit.
*Captures the human emotions and feelings perfectly and portrays it aptly on the screen.
*Alita! Alita! Alita! A very likeable character and one of my favorite fictional heroic female characters.
*A budget of 200M$ can be literally experienced at the theatres. Each and every frame is directed for commercial success. Very enthusiastic about this franchise. Makes Final Fantasy, Video Game Cutscenes look like a gimmick.
*Sets up a big stage for it's sequels. Well-established fantasy sci-fi movie you just can't afford to miss.",Alita - Battle Angel

1574,ShreeSarcasm,The generation which we could be in,7,1 March 2019,"Alita is not a just story of battale angel.
It basically is proof of concept of tech been used to generate this movie.
It has really close up looks at alita and other chararcters, which has been not seen in many of CGI intense movies.The evolution of graphic engines , animations , Illustration , blending with real world and creation of a world altogether can been evidently observed.
Story arch l remains the same of any character in many world ending, tech driven movie.
But the showcase is much different in this .
The behavior pattern of human in the machine (Alita) is amazing to watch . The little emotions and change in body musles to show that emotion is well defined.
Evidently seen with face ( eye too, got a big ones).
The hope of amazing what's next is observed.",Alita - Battle Angel

this movie doesn't lecture u about strong women and stuff like that,this movie just captures u with everything that it offers,from start to finish.

1577,dmcgillicky,Absolute Cliche Drivel,1,1 July 2019,This film needs to be knocked down a few pegs. C'mon people. Bad dialogue. Bad story. Bad acting. And Bad Animation. What else is there? O yeah music - terrible music.,Alita - Battle Angel
1578,itzjustrobbie,Good Sci-Fi,9,2 May 2020,I hope they make a 2nd movie to Alita! This was awesome & the story line was spot on! Didn't drag at all.,Alita - Battle Angel
1579,alisamdyer,Best movie on the big screen,9,1 January 2021,I was fortunate enough to see a special early screening of this movie in a special Dolby 4-d setting setup by James Cameron which only made the experience that much more exciting and insane. This movie was beautifully done and I really loved the story as well but a sequel is needed!!! The story is not finished and deserves a sequel!! I hope now that Disney plus owns the rights we will have the opportunity to see this story unfold further.,Alita - Battle Angel

Visuals are amaizing as was expected,but what surprised me was the story and its proggresion,it was fast paced but not in a way that makes it seem rushed,instead it feels just right.
This movie is something you should go and see in theater to really experiance it.",Alita - Battle Angel
1581,michael-88182,Nice one to watch,8,25 October 2019,"It's a great one to watch. Such a strong character, alongside with this interesting girl just do it. You dont even have to like this type of movies (like Marvel's).

1582,harmony_of_the_void,Helluva ride!,9,15 February 2019,"I was nervous about the 12A rating, and the seemingly weak box office start for this film, but hyped based on the trailers - I went in hoping for something good, half-expecting something terrible.
I was very, very happy with the result.
This film gets characterisation right. You learn the motivations and drives of the characters you meet, and what you need to know about the world in which they live. The effects are breathtaking, and ""feel"" right. The way in which a ""human-looking"" cyborg deliberately has the ""uncanny valley"" effect of not being quite right was a very clever move. The characters that are overpowered are believably so, and with in-universe reasoning that makes sense, there's no feeling of Alita being a ""Mary Sue"" that is so much in vogue, because she struggles, she hurts (much is made of her tears to demonstrate her vulnerability emotionally despite her physical power).
I won't go into plot or spoilers.
The plot was evolving, if you don't know the story, the way it opens up from a small story into a huge one, with characters taking on larger significance, was handled brilliantly.
At the end, my wife, who is absolutely not a fan of the genre, demanded to know when the sequel is coming. And I want to know just as much as she does.",Alita - Battle Angel
1583,cdh-83898,Very very well made. Keeps you invested! 9/10,9,3 August 2019,"Overall a great film. Had low expectations and came out with a wow feeling. Overall if you want good acting, action and even some love and not on a cheese scale. See this movie.",Alita - Battle Angel
1584,gaute_lie,Go see it!!,10,8 February 2019,"Excellent done. A sequel is expected and will be attended!

It makes sense why directors were late by a year to release it - just looking a the refined movie details it shows how much craftmanship was put into the effort of making it such level that it came out. Ignore the naysayers and just enjoy this brilliant movie.",Alita - Battle Angel
1589,deadphoenix_16,Damn they pulled it off,10,3 August 2019,I am amazed by how well it sticks to the manga. A manga i was very fond of. The movie covers 2 chapters of the story- looking forward to see the rest.,Alita - Battle Angel

1593,scottruszczyk,Little boring,6,25 February 2019,I went in with high expectations and honestly CGI great but after awhile I just didn't care what happened too alita .a good movie you should become emotionally invested in character and it's hard too care about CGI girl after awhile.at first her innocence discovering things was touching but I felt a disconnect when her power within started emerging.great CGI but the drama was lacking for me,Alita - Battle Angel
1594,slbwtp,Best action since John Wick,9,7 March 2019,"Alita was much better than its RT rating. The action sequences were excellent and were not garbled by the 3D. Creating a mo-cap character that is more compelling than the real costars was the whole point and 'Alita' did not disappoint. Rodriguez, Cameron and WETA sweat the details and it pays off big time in the close ups. Like Zoe Saldana's performance in Avatar, Rosa Salazar transcends the tech and carries the film.",Alita - Battle Angel
1595,clannagh,Exceptional,10,27 February 2019,I feel sorry for the people that read the negative pre-release critic reviews as they will never know what they missed. Luckily I tend to ignore the professional critics and make my own decisions. It seems that many of the people that were unsure but fronted up ended up seeing it several times over. Fantastic film.,Alita - Battle Angel
1596,davidfloringf,Well done.,9,30 June 2019,"Don't listen to any bad reviews and as always don't listen to rotten scores, this movie is great. Watch it for yourself and give it a score if you like it or not. I personally enjoyed every minute of it and i'm hyped for the second part.

1598,bdeef,Adrenaline-Fueled and Visually Stunning,8,17 February 2019,"""Alita: Battle Angel"" is the most advanced CGI movie ever made as of this writing. It is an action-packed, adrenaline-fueled cinematic experience of unparalleled imagery. The realism is incredible. Everything has proper physics, weight, force and kinetics. The lighting and cinematography are spectacular. The scenes are magnificently detailed and beautifully rendered. The characters are well developed and remarkably human, yet not overly dramatic. The villains are also really well done. The love story was a bit hokey and could have been developed better as simply an intense friendship, but other than that the movie was AWESOME. After two hours I was ready to sit through it again -- which is unusual and only happened to me once before: 21 years ago when I saw the original Matrix in theater. That movie was revolutionary (10/10) on so many levels and this movie aims for the same impact. Frankly, it comes pretty darned close (8/10). Go see this movie. If you like anime, science fiction, CGI or action movies, you will not be disappointed.",Alita - Battle Angel
1599,jimgibson-21798,Incredible Visuals And Sound Thoroughly Enjoyed this movie,9,11 February 2019,"Saw this movie at the London IMAX which in my opinion is probably the best place you could ever see a film like this. Such an amazing looking and sounding film. The whole family was completely entranced from start to finish. The way the characters develop is lovely and the action sequences and sound have you on the edge of your seat throughout. There are really touching moments and you are completely drawn into the entire world the director has created... its all so realistic and believable, quite extraordinary.
As other reviewers have noted the story line isn't anything particularly amazing and the ending is a bit abrupt but its matters not at all.
I will def go see this again on the big screen before its too late. Don't Wait for this movie to come out on DVD its deserves to be seen on a BIG screen. Interestingly the first film I ever saw at the IMAX was Avatar and for the experience and breathtaking visuals I would say this is easily on a par with that.
Take the kids ASAP!",Alita - Battle Angel
1600,xmadison,Good,6,11 March 2019,"Amazing graphics, enjoyable storyline and overall good movie experience! Ending was a letdown - Myself as well as the rest of the people in the cinema looked around in confusion when the film ended, wondering whether this was the actual ending or if we were meant to perhaps wait for something more?",Alita - Battle Angel
1601,PaulKrokaveli,Manga to Movie,8,13 August 2019,"The eye design for Alita was uncalled for and flat out goofy looking. That's really the only bad thing I can say about this movie though. If you enjoyed the manga, you will be surprised to see that the movie stays very close to the source material. There's about half of the manga series in this movie. It doesn't feel too rushed though. I hope they finish it with a sequel in years to come. The CGI and special effects (with the exception of those eyes) are very cool. It was great seeing Iron City and Zalem brought to life. It surprised me that this movie wasn't going to be rated R, considering the source material. However, there is still a lot of violence and cyborg gore. I'm glad I rented it. I would like to watch the 3D blu ray of this, but I'm hesitant to spend $30 on a 3D movie with so many fast-paced action sequences.",Alita - Battle Angel
1602,werallmaddhere,EXCELLENT!,5,11 March 2019,"Loved it, proud of this powerful positive woman character!",Alita - Battle Angel
1603,jap1,"Alita is cinematic perfection! DO NOT LISTEN TO THE ""PROFESSIONAL"" CRITICS!",10,14 February 2019,"Thankfully I don't bother reading professional reviews before going into a new film as I want to see things entirely from my own perspective, untainted by other's opinions. Sure, the movie has it's quirks, but overall it was incredibly true to the source material. Almost frame for frame at times. Now that I've seen the movie, when I see the critics' reviews, it quickly becomes evident that they are completely unfamiliar with both the manga and the anime (which only touches on the first book anyway). Some critics were upset that not enough was answered? Well, that's because a TON isn't revealed until much further in the books. This new film and the original anime are both based on the first book. Patience guys. Don't want to spoil it all right out the gate! It's essentially an introduction into the Alita universe. Some critics were upset about the whole motorball premise. Well sorry to break it to them, but that was HUGE part of the beginning of the Alita saga and Rodriguez represented it superbly for a live action translation.My ONLY semi-complaint is that they toned down the violence. The original manga and anime had some pretty graphic moments that would make you squirm. This movie keeps it PG-13. I understand why as it's part of the game in making a big blockbuster film profitable at the box office, but was still a bit disappointing. I was willing to overlook that though, as overall it was a beautiful, perfect movie.Do yourself a favor by ignoring the critics, and just go see this film for yourself! Reading the manga would be a good primer, though. Not saying you have to, but it will help you appreciate a lot of WHY the creators of the film may have decided to do things a certain way. This one gets a solid 10/10 from me!!! Hoping it's a huge success at the box office so we can get some sequels!",Alita - Battle Angel

1609,raiden-51220,"Good movie, good adaptation.",9,2 August 2019,"I usually go into movies based on books/comics/anime/etc. with low expectations due to Hollywood's history of making poor adaptations. I was pleasantly surprised to find Alita Battle Angel stays close to the anime and manga it is based on. While there are certainly differences the movie includes a number of the major scenes from the anime and even some additional scenes from the manga not in the original movie (due to it's length).Although I watch anime frequently, at first I found Alita's large anime style eyes a bit off-putting in a live action movie. This was quickly forgotten however, and before long it didn't bother me at all and I found it really added to Alita's character.As stated earlier the story follows the anime/manga pretty close and is well written. The balance between story and action is paced well and the unraveling of Alita's past keeps you firmly planted in your seat. The movie is clearly set up to have squeals so we don't learn as much about Alita's background as one might want but those questions will probably be answered in the squeals if they get produced.One area where the movie could have improved on a little bit was the use of it's supporting characters. Ido plays a more prominent role in the anime and a couple of his major scenes are replaced by Alita. I don't know why this was done but it felt like Ido (Christoph Waltz) got a little short changed. In addition, the casting for some of the characters was a bit odd. For example; while Jennifer Connelly played her role quite well she really doesn't look like the character of Chiren.The effects in the movie are excellent with some of the best CG in a movie to date. Alita in particular was realistic to the point of being almost indistinguishable from a real actress, thanks in large part to the performance of the movie's star, Rosa Salazar. In spite of being a highly skilled fighter, the character of Alita is very kind. Rosa's portrayal of Alita really shines on this point making Alita impossible to dislike.I passed on this movie when it was initially released, but now I wished I seen it in the theater. Nevertheless I was happy to add it to my Blu-ray collection and hope there are more Alita movies in the near future.If you're a fan of action/sifi movies at all, or just want to see what an excellent anime based movie is like, you don't want to miss Alita Battle Angel.",Alita - Battle Angel

Characters were great everything was just perfect! and now I'm in love with this movie i kept on thinking about it after i watch it! This is truly a 11 out of 10.Great job to the producers and all the staffs! truly magnificent!I'm really hoping to have a sequel on this!,Alita - Battle Angel
1612,joachimmberger,"Alita, the series.",1,15 July 2019,"The story only lines up to one thing only: Alita, the series. A never ending story that goes in predictable loops with open ends to drag you into the next movie. This is only about money-making not about telling a story or entertaining, just money-making. Very disappointing!",Alita - Battle Angel
1613,angiemas-82693,A film with soul,9,16 February 2019,"I went to see this film with great expectations and I must say it lived up to every single one of them. First off, the CGI was flawless. The details in Alita's hair, her eyes, her skin, the cyborg bodies, the battle scenes, all showed just how much effort was put into this production.The storyline was decent (don't expect any mind-blowing plot twists) but it managed to do an astonishing introduction to a brand new cinematic universe.However the characters were the core of this film. I mean there weren't any deep developments, but you really knew you'd love them right from the start. And of course they did the protagonist justice. You don't love Alita merely for her powers (which, truth be told, are incredibly badass) but for her kind heart, her strong will and her humble personality. Not once did she say 'I'm a noble warrior hero'. She directly proved to be one.So Alita: Battle Angel is proof that you don't need to be the most overpowered person in the universe to make people like you. Sometimes a smile can do the trick",Alita - Battle Angel
1614,walidert,I just don't get it,3,10 March 2019,"Unattractive beginning with a confusing Accelerating events, rosa Salazar did a tremendous job despite the boring script,
A complete misuse of the a-list cast
If you're looking for CGI then it's the right movie for you the visual effects are out of this era, It's weird how a girl with memory lost to trust everybody in a distopian society and how Dr ido claimed himself as the father figure, And she obeys him in everything, the fight scenes were OK, the youth element is what I liked the most,
Obvious plot and a predictable story,
In the Conclusion don't go watch this movie unless you want to watch an unnecessary copy of ready player one or mortal engines",Alita - Battle Angel

I knew James Cameron bought the rights to it and been wanting him to direct it. But I'm not complaining that he gave to Rodriguez. Very enjoyable movie and top notch CGI. I'm not gonna spoil the movie or tell you a general idea of the story, except tell you that if you like any of James Cameron's movies, you'll like this too.

CGI is just enough and not fussy , unlike Transformers ,for instance , which has far too much going on in the fight scenes to take in what is happening.

1626,mgavant,"Very entertaining movie, despite the critics",8,22 February 2019,"A very entertaining movie.The professional critics are demanding too much. They see all of the movies so any familiar theme to them automatically knocks they're rating. The action scenes are great with an updated version of Rollerball that does the James Caan original justice.
Sometimes the plot gets lost between a love story and a superhero action movie and that leads to plot twists and comic book assumptions that the forgiving audience will tolerate for the entertainment value.
I'm surprised at its poor box office. It could be a marketing issue because all of my millenial and generation X children and grandchildren haven't heard much about it. So, it didn't penetrate to the audience they were counting on. Maybe too much reliance on the Cameron name?
I would certainly go to a sequel. But, it's interesting that they made a $200 million film without a guarantee that a sequel will be made. Also, counting too much on the Cameron name and reputation perhaps?",Alita - Battle Angel

They tell you that Alita looks like the real human amd you'll not recognize any difference, but in reality that's totally opposite.Second of all: very intens and condensed plot for 1 film.

The vfx is greatly done one of the best vfx in movies. watching this movie in imax 3d or 4dx is mindblowing. for beat experience make sure watch in 3d,Alita - Battle Angel
1637,RadishCao,A wonderful film that hurts me a lot!,8,17 February 2019,This movie is wonderful!!! I would rate it a 9 or 10 if it did not just ended at the most excited point. This gives me a feeling like the most delicious food just stuck at my throat. I spend my money on a movie ticket but not a two-hour-long trailer!,Alita - Battle Angel
1638,jonathanjiaming,"Decent, visual feast, but below avatar",7,22 February 2019,"1. The special effects are really amazing, you can see that a lot of money has been spent
2. Unfortunately, the plot is really cliched... So much so that it's a bit awkward to watch (there's no way of knowing how many years the comic book has been around) that you can predict exactly where each subplot will go.
3. It's ok to change your personal feeling, the rhythm is a little bit wrong... Mother so selfish a person, why all of a sudden on the flood of maternal love, inner drama a little less
4. When the don said something in the bar, the whole audience laughed in the cinema, leaving a message for everyone.
5.Alita is really good looking.",Alita - Battle Angel
1639,yeopps,Movie with lots of heart.,10,30 April 2019,Something that lacks from most movies these days. Makes me wanting more. Best movie of the year for me.,Alita - Battle Angel
1640,sdskandco,this looks like a fatal wound,7,15 February 2019,"The ideal version of this movie would have a two part series where the first film shows the giant battle that is hinted at throughout this movie. This would also make it so the audience isn't just thrust into this world because I felt I spent most of the movie playing catch up.With that said, let's talk about what actually worked in the movie. Alita. Yes the titular character is developed well and her CG is superbly done. (same cannot be said to her boyfriend however) This movie also has some of the best fight scenes of any movie I've seen in recent months. Clear and well thought-out action that is entertaining to watch. Plus it's very true to the manga and that's a commendable note.Where the movie stumbles is with some of the dialogue which is a bit on the nose to accommodate for the audience's lack of knowledge about the setting, and the film's near R rating that felt cleaned up afterwards for the PG-13. I would have loved to see a Rated R gritty cut of the film.The reason why I ""favorited"" the movie is because I'm a sucker for world building and the glimpses of the bigger picture we see throughout made me excited. This feels like the beginning of something bigger and my enjoyment of this movie may retroactively be impacted by it's sequels. Oh and I'm writing this as I listen to Dua Lipa's Swan Song and it's a bop!Also YES that is the god damn Incredible Hulk!",Alita - Battle Angel
1641,justinpinter,Definitely See This In IMAX 3D! Alita: Battle Angel Was Amazing!,10,14 February 2019,"I went and saw this movie last night with my fiance at AMC Riverpark Square in IMAX 3D. I had high hopes for this film ever since it was announced and knew James Cameron was tied to the production. I was NOT disappointed! For the best experience, I highly suggest seeing it in IMAX 3D as it'll better immerse you into the world and characters.I think they did a great job at setting up the story. Beginning with Alita's mysterious past and then throughout the movie unlocking her character and history. I enjoyed the father daughter relationship between Alita and Christoph Waltz character, Dr. Ido. And the love interest between Alita and Hugo seemed natural, and not forced. Rosa Salazar, the actress behind Alita (along with digital artists at WETA Digital) did an amazing job at bringing the CGI character to life. I never got an ""uncanny valley"" feeling from Alita (despite her manga inspired facial aesthetic). It's probably some of the best special effects in film thus far.Speaking of special effects...from crafting the world, to the cyborg side characters, to the action/battle sequences, everything was spectacular. Again, seeing it in IMAX 3D really let's these things shine.Overall, I highly recommend this movie to any fans of Sci-Fi / Fantasy. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen. I hope it does well at the box office too, as they perfectly set everything up for sequels. Such a rich world, characters, etc...would love to see more of it.",Alita - Battle Angel
1642,cotomosamir,Overall a good time,7,7 March 2019,"The story slowed down at points, romance was not believable, but the action scenes played well. The ending left me wanting more.",Alita - Battle Angel
1643,zarobea,Blew my mind,10,30 April 2019,"Not gonna lie, me along with I believe many others went into this movie expecting it to follow the live action anime adaptation trend in mediocrity. Oh man I got my mind blown instead, this movie was an absolute blast. From the opening scene I wanted to cringe at Alita's larger eyes but I just could not because whatever magic James Cameron and WETA did with their effects was so incredibly fantastical I could not believe I was not looking at something real. Even better is it holds up through ever scene with every character, but of course most notably Alita herself. At numerous points in the movie I had to remind myself like ""oh my god this is CG"".The world building was so immersive, I was so invested in learning about the world with both its beauty and ugliness along as Alita learned about them and react accordingly. I have never read the source manga before and I'm currently binging through it, and it's astonshing to see how accurate yet inspirational the pages translated onto the big screen.The action, THE ACTION! Whoever choreographed the action sequences needs their own award, cause oh my god whenever Alita fought with her martial arts, it was so fast paced but I could tell exactly what was going on. Jump cuts were minimal to none. From the first fight scene, as Alita realizes more her power, to the very last fight I was on the edge of my seat smiling and cheering. Even if just for the action scenes along this movie is worth full price.I'm not sure what it exactly is, but Alita's as character just really struck a chord with me or something, after the first few minutes I just connected with her and wanted her to succeed in what she does. Rosa Salazar played Alita so perfectly, her emotions were so lively and colorful. When she was happy I felt happy, angry I felt angry, sad I felt sad. With excellent supporting casts like Christoph Waltz, Mahershalla Ali, Jennifer Connelly, Rosa as Alita was still able to shine through I am so impressed with her performance.The only gripe I would have about the movie is that it could be longer, I wanted to see more, I need to see more, but probably for budget reasons it is cut down to 2 hours so I'm not going to take points off for that. A lot of people hate the romance, but I was no bothered by it. Perhaps by looking at it as a young adult romance along it would be cringy, but through Alita's eyes I completely understand and bought it and rooted for it.It was such a refreshing experience have a movie like Alita: Battle Angel in an era of MCU and Star Wars permeated cinema, and I will support this movie with all my heart for it to get a sequel. Go Alita go!!!!",Alita - Battle Angel
1644,zomorromartin,What Alita does right far outweighs the negatives,7,18 April 2019,"Unfortunately, it doesn't go very far beyond entertaining. The relationship between her and her boyfriend is unbelievable, as there is no chemistry. The score isn't worth noting and the sound design could've punched a little harder.",Alita - Battle Angel
1645,movieexpert005,Waste of Time and James Cameron the thief,1,31 July 2019,"Most Movies from James Cameron are stealing from other Movies. Terminator is stealing from Westworld (Gunslinger). Many Action-Scenes from Terminator 2 (1991) are stealing from RoboCop (1987). Abyss is only under Water, but is stealing from Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). True Lies is stealing from La Totale! (French Movie). Avatar is stealing from Dances with Wolves or Pocahontas. Titanic is stealing from A Night to Remember (1958, a much better movie). Aliens is stealing from the original Alien (1979). And Alita Battle Angel is stealing from I Robot, with Will Smith. I don't like James Cameron. He is a Anti-Christ (The Lost Tomb of Jesus)! And all of James Cameron Movies are very boring (stupid Dialogues) and to long!",Alita - Battle Angel
1646,decapattack,Great movie!,10,21 February 2019,One of the best movies i've seen. The characters are great the action is awesome and the world is huge and very interesting.This movie shows it's possible to make a movie based on a manga/anime perfectly.Movie of the Year.,Alita - Battle Angel
1647,AjiLaStrange,A live-action anime adaptation that doesn't suck.,7,8 March 2019,"I thought the movie was pretty good. The visuals were cool and the character of Alita was well balanced. Even though she's a cyborg, Alita was still able to display a range of emotions and had flaws. She didn't come off as a Mary Sue.The only things that I didn't like happened toward the end. The pacing felt rushed and they threw in sequel bait. Focus less on sequel bait and focus more on giving a movie a good beginning, middle and end.",Alita - Battle Angel
1648,ronnav,LOVE IT!! Rosa Salazar is ALITA herself=)) hopefully a new start of a franchise..,10,26 February 2019,"Lets start by admitting that I am not a fan of Japanese Manga/comics. I had no idea that this movie was based on the combination of Battle Angel Alita OVA (original video animation) and the Manga Gunnm. Saw it over the Presidents Day weekend Feb15-18, liked it soo much that I went back 8x over the film's movie run in theaters. It had a ""good feel"" vibe throughout the movie. Yes, there were awkward parts of the film that could have been better, especially the love story between Alita and Hugo, but you have to realize that this type of character development was based on a Japanese Manga dated in the early 1990s. The CGI was amazingly done. Rosa Salazar's portrayal of Alita was superb!! Perfect casting for Alita.I would highly recommend this movie. There were some behind the scenes things that happened prior to this movie coming out with critics heavily destroying this movie's ratings and articles saying it would flop. Just go see it for yourself, give it a chance. The Alita Battle Angel Fandom is amazing, people getting together all of the world in SUPPORT for this movie! 5/5 STARS! =))",Alita - Battle Angel
1649,leo_tuballa,One of the best movie ever.,10,2 March 2019,My son initially wanted to watch how to train a dragon 2. But it wasn't showing yet in the theater we went. So we decided to watch Alita: Battle Angel. It was a good decision because it was an excellent movie. We ended up watching it again a week later.,Alita - Battle Angel

1651,annawetterberg,Never a boring minute,8,19 July 2019,"I've always liked James Cameron and his work and sci-fi has always been my favorite genre, so I was very hopeful for this movie. Safe to say I was not disappointed. It brings amazing cgi and is a hell of a ride. There's always something happening on the screen and I was never bored one second of the 2 and a half hour runtime. It has some flaws here and there but overall a great and very exciting experience. This is how you make mangas into blockbusters, listen up ghost in the shell.",Alita - Battle Angel
1652,Mik0rist,I'll just go watch Alita again for the 8th time.,8,3 March 2019,"That was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was visually beautiful, it was jam packed with action, it was semi-violent, romantic, everything I love in a movie.It is absolutely the most faithful in substance, tone and spirit adaptation of a manga/anime made by in America, period. I totally forgot to look who cinematographed Alita, and when the credit ""Bill Pope"" ' (The Matrix Trilogy ) came up I practically fell out of my chair. Because of that it reminded me of Aliens, Avatar, the Matrix trilogy, Sin City, the Terminator all together. All those filmmakers are part of Alita.This movie has some of the best action sequences of all time and I'd say the best ever for fully CGI scenes. I rarely care that much about the action as long as it's not bad but it's so good in those movie it's worth the admission alone. In fact, Alita might be one of the most realistic non-humans I've ever seen on-screen.
Alita is really a great character, hoping there will be a sequel soon.",Alita - Battle Angel
1653,mdbran,Brutally awful. Poor Christoph Waltz.,2,1 July 2019,"It's so unbelievably bad, I can't even explain it. Just brutal in every way. I am just horrified that they somehow got Waltz, a top 5 actor of this generation, to participate in this total waste of time. Very depressing.",Alita - Battle Angel
1654,sibster-45850,Plan to watch this again!,10,4 March 2019,"This is not only a great movie, it's an important one. I'll be watching this again for the 2nd time this Friday in genuine support for how well this film was put together. I vividly remember the manga version back in my teen years and I can say they kept true to the source material and too their credit, they pulled it off and then some. And in some ways, its betters.Also, if you're a regular viewer of YouTube you may have heard the insults coming from Brie Larson's mouth. Alita couldn't have come at a better time as it doesn't go out of its way to disparage 40 year old white men.If you support real equality in movies, go support this film and give Captain Marvel a big miss.",Alita - Battle Angel
1655,hp-00536,Would recommend,9,24 March 2019,"Very good movie, CGI I was worried would look awful but it didn't. Plot was good. Not quite 10 because of the sequel set up ending but would definitely watch again!",Alita - Battle Angel
1656,richyang,Watching a piece of my childhood come to life,10,6 May 2019,"As most articles and reviews have stated, this amazing adaptation is based on a Japanese manga from the 90's. Without getting into spoilers for those who are on the fence about giving this masterpiece a try, I will do my best to give an honest review.As adaptations go, this attempt is absolutely amazing. I have been a fan of the series since I started reading excerpts out of Animerica back in the 90's! The dedication to the source material is noted for long time fans of the series, and for those new to this universe it is very well orchestrated to where people can still follow along on Alita's journey.In conjunction with the respect to the source material, I feel that the cast performed so well that I lack an eloquent way to appropriately describe how moving their characters were. This is another reason that this movie has earned such a huge and growing fan base. The journey Alita goes through is one almost anyone can identify with. From an anecdotal perspective, I felt like I was reliving moments from my past as I watched Alita experience her journey. Mrs. Rosa Salazar's performance mesmerized me and just left me wanting for more. Couple her performance with the nods to the source material and you have one very elated and ecstatic fan just glued to the screen. I went a total of 31 times to watch this movie in the theater (IMAX, IMAX 3D, XD, XD DBOX, XD DOB 3D, 2D), and I never grew weary or bored of it. And each time I would take a friend or coworker who was unsure of watching it. Every single person I took fell head over heels for Alita's story and wanted to learn more. In fact, every single person I took has borrowed the original manga and the sequel manga (Battle Angel Alita, and The Last Order respectively) just to relive the story and see how true to source this movie was.The final aspect that made this movie enjoyable, was the soundtrack. Junkie XL does such outstanding job matching the tempo of the music to the tone of the scenes. You quickly find yourself excited during the action sequences, empathetic during the emotional ones, and just grinning like heck throughout the movie.All in all, my vote of 10 star may be a bit biased because of my love for the story. But it is a rating I give straight from the heart. I highly reccomend this movie to anyone seeking an action packed movie, with an amazing protagnosit that involves no influences from political views. This movie goes back to the old school movie ways, you go to a movie to escpae reality and just have a good time.",Alita - Battle Angel
1657,markusretsam,"For once, a live-action adaption of an anime isn't terrible!",8,6 March 2019,After watching Mortal Engines I thought that the movie wasn't that great but the visual effects etc was the thing that made me like it and I was sure to expect the same thing for Alita: Battle Angel. I was wrong. Alita: Battle Angel is a movie that both have awesome visual effects and has a good story that I enjoyed. My hopes for live-action adaptions for the future and future animes have now been resurrected.,Alita - Battle Angel

When i watch a trailer i know if the movie is going to be good or not and if i know its going to be good i become so interested in it and can't relax until i've seen itI loveeeeed this movie. The cgi was INCREDIBLE its awesome to see how far technology has come. The story was well told, the main character has lots of attitude and feelings which they gotta have. It actually made you care for them and you got feel their feelings. I don't understand all the hate before watching it, it blew my mind. The way movies takes you into their world and and make you forget about your own world for 2 hours is something i LOVE. Well done i will watch it again. Awesome action sequences. The one thing i didn't like is that i didn't buy the love story. I wish they were only friends",Alita - Battle Angel

There's a bit of romance, alot of action, and tons of science fiction.I'm a heathen for technology, and this movie has it. I plan on seeing it a third time in 3D. There's real character development in this movie. Alita does look cute, rapidly grows up, and the whole time your thinking.Can this get any better? Huge fan here, kinda reminds me of the old days playing Mass Effect 2 & 3.

GitS, FMA or Bleach But Alita is great. All my prejudices was gone after a few minutes. Finally a Movie that honors the sorce Matirial and stays faithful to the Anime. Rosa Salazar Shines through the CGI every minute. The Tension is thick and comprehensible the action is well choreographed the only thing sad is that Alita is not well known in the US and so many of the audience are hazareders to watch it.

If you enjoyed Fifth Element, The Matrix, and Pacific Rim, this movie is a must see. If you didnt like those films, this will be a hard pass.For me, the film was an 8 out of 10, I enjoyed the setting, visuals, and story. The biggest lacking in the film was the soundtrack which is utterly forgettable and the dialogue at times being too cringy at times to ignore.",Alita - Battle Angel

However, I'm kinda annoyed by the cringy teenage love stuff, the lack of self questionning about her identity (example : ""am I really a living being or just a robot ?"" like in Ghost in the Shell) and place in this world, and by some fight scenes which are just rushed.

But boy was i surprised when this movie made me not blink an eye from the very start!! Every second was worth seeing!!! Im soo inloveeee!!!! I crave for more!!! Spectacular Movie!!,Alita - Battle Angel
1678,beamupscotty,Absolutely phenomenal,10,30 April 2019,"The fans have spoken -- this movie is an absolute masterpiece.I've never experienced the kind of positive word-of-mouth groundswell and fan adoration that this movie has been able to achieve, all on its own merit. Literally no help whatsoever from outside forces -- all organic, pure love for this movie, its characters, and the future stories to come.What's crazy is that you don't have to know ANYTHING at all about Alita, the source material, or manga. I went in with ZERO expectations (well done marketing people.. /sarcasm).When I came out, I was like ""Wow great movie!"" and that was that.. But then, something weird happened.. A couple days later I started thinking about the movie again. And again.. and then I had to re-watch it.. then I took friends.. then I bought merchandise! This came out of nowhere.Watch it and see.",Alita - Battle Angel
1679,fduniho-38803,Science fiction action movie with a heart,10,23 March 2019,"The first time I saw this movie, I liked it so much that I subsequently read all nine volumes of the Battle Angel Alita manga, then watched the anime and started on the sequel to the manga, Battle Angel Alita: Last Order. Even though Alita was a cyborg, her humanity came through very clearly, and it was easy to love her as a person. She came across as a caring, loving person who is willing to take a stand against evil. The special effects were great too. The CGI came across as believable, and it helped make the action sequences more exciting. In general, the action was as well-done as I've seen it in any science fiction action movie.On seeing the movie for a second time, I noticed lots of foreshadowing and other details I had missed before. I had initially thought there were some plot holes in the movie, but on seeing it again, those plot holes got filled in. The movie mainly follows the plot of the anime, and where it differs, it usually does a better job or just adds stuff not in the anime, such as Motorball. One way the movie was better was in making the relationship between Alita and Hugo more reciprocal. This relationship was one of the emotional lynchpins of this movie, and making it more reciprocal made the movie more moving. I also like the change in where Alita's name comes from. It helps define the relationship between Ido and Alita better than the original story, in which he gives her the name of his dead male cat.Overall, I consider this to be the best science fiction action movie I've seen since I saw Star Wars in 1977. It is the first movie of this kind since Star Wars to get me to take up an interest in its world and characters outside of watching the movie itself. I enjoy it more than the recent Star Wars sequels, and I would much rather see sequels to Alita than to Star Wars or any other movie for that matter. And it's not just for the action. One of the best things about this movie is Alita's beautiful heart. Without that, the cyborg fighting would be meaningless, and this would not be the great movie that it is.",Alita - Battle Angel
1680,MrJohnJordan,"Big Eyes, but a Bigger Heart!",9,24 March 2019,"This movie looked very strange in the trailer. Her eyes were huge and the CGI was looking questionable. However, after watching this movie, my perspective has shifted from concern to utter bliss! Alita: Battle Angel is one of 2019's finest action movies so far! It is a must-see for action movie fans!The action scenes are intense and well-done. The slow-motion aspect woven into the fight scenes adds an aspect of beauty to the movie and it invokes a wonderfully jaw-dropping reaction from the viewer. The movie does a bit feel rushed but there was so much high quality content that was compressed into the 2 hour time period that it is overshadows the fast-pace of the story. Even the slower scenes of character development were done in a way that genuinely interested me. Ultimately, the story-line was easy to follow, it was filled with amazing/unique action sequences, and it had a genuinely interesting lead that faced unthinkable odds with arms wide open.Rating: 2 Big Eyes up",Alita - Battle Angel
1681,readonemohamed,Yes she Is worth full 10 stars at least for me.,10,1 May 2019,"A movie that made me watch the same movie 15x in the Cinema is already ""The best movie of all times"" for me personally. No other movie made me do this.
A few other movies I have seen 2-3 times in the Cinema like Endgame recently. They are very good. But I would not go for so any more rewatches. And this happens very very rarely for me.So what made me fall in love with Alita Battle Angel. It is of course Alita herself. She is the heart and soul of the movie. If you like her the overall impression of the movie rises as well. But If you cant connect with her potential other weak points in the movie might throw you off.
And for me Alita is the most charismatic person I have ever seen on screen. And she isn't even real. I never felt that connection. Maybe it is her eyes that are almost hypnotic and the excellently done CG character of hers and the outstanding motion capture performance.
Even a Thanos or a Gollum or many other motion captured characters cant compete at all with Alitas.
And they are already at an excellent level. But hers is out of this world. WETA did outperform themselves and pushed the limits with what is possible.
And on top of a beautiful character you have beauty inside this character too.Alita is curious, courageous, takes people on her road in life and let me experience what she experiences. All those new impressions of life.
I see her rising, tumbling and falling. Just Alita as a character is worth seeing the movie.
Also Ido is very charismatic during the movie and him as father figure of Alita was very well done. The choice to go with Christoph Waltz was a very good one.
Alita and Dyson Ido had the best developed relationship in the movie. And for me it is the most important points.Spoiler-!alert!The story entertained me very well. Alita and Ido had the most character development which was done well. Alita needed to learn more about people and who she can trust and who not. Find her place in life and who she is. Ido lived years of resentment and bitterness because of his dead daughter. Alita showed him a way out of it.
Also Chiren played by Jennifer Conelly and Hugo made some changes. Chirens was a little bit sudden.
There was just one scene placed beforehand that signaled the audience that she is about to change her opinion going to Zalem.
And that was when Vector laughed about the fact that he promised Hugo to go also to Zalem.
From their she knew Vector was lying about going to Zalem and she started to think.
But this was just one line. So if you dont pay attention to it you maybe hit by surprise and disbelief when Chiren came in to the rescue in a later point.Hugo has to suffer even more from missing substance in his character. The viewer is missing a backstory that explains how he became the person he is know. So the audience loses one major thing to connect with Hugo and care for him. And Hugo has a pretty interesting backstory in the Manga. Also another important scene is to show how Hugo felt when he woke up suddenly in a machine body. This is an important scene to see the terror he feels. In his backstory he had always issues with Cyborgs. He wasnt quite racist towards them but he didn't treat them as humans either.
Since both scenes are missing the audience might not understand why he is morally flexible towards jacking cyborgs and the conflict he comes in by developing feelings for a cyborg called Alita.
This made the emerging love story also felt unbelievable.Everything what I mentioned are valid problems people might have who have heard nothing about it before. For me most was okay because I knew a lot beforehand so my mind implicated the missing parts.
And even if you havent read the mangas, you can imagine what might happened between the scenes if you think and pay attention.
For me they are issues. But nothing what breaks the movie.
No the rest of the story was beautiful and also the world building, CGI, action.
The Action is the best choreographed I have seen in recent times. No shaky cam, no unnecessary cuts
You see everything. Also it gets to the extreme what you can still get away with for a pg13 movie.
So action lovers will love it.
In terms of CGI, Action, Worldbuilding and of course Rosa Salazars outstanding performance the movie overperformed by a lot. Enough to make up for the weak points.
That's the reason the movie is a 10 for me and not an 8.",Alita - Battle Angel

However, I love going to the cinema and sci fi and action - adventure are my favourite. So despite the bad reviews I went. If anyone was to tell me back then what I know now, I'll think they were crazy! This film is the best film I've seen, if not top five for sure. I must say it left one hell of an impression on me and could not stop thinking about it after wards. All the characters especially Alita are killa with their performance. The action scenes are so good and the story over all runs smooth and kept my attention the whole time not feeling like a two hour film!

1697,emaildaz,"Wow. Just, wow!",9,1 May 2019,"Not since the release of Kingdom Hearts back in 2002 have I ever been captivated in a universe quite like this.Alita: Battle Angel carries a story that is constantly changing and evolving, but still maintains the overarching narrative of a girl discovering who she really is. And my word, the truth is begging to be explored.There are elements of multiple genres all wrapped up in a package focussing on cut-throat action, stunning visuals, top-tier acting and a soundscape to die for.The film achieves a fantastic sense of credibility and verisimilitude with it's universe, the details and structure of it's society and entertainment are easily relatable to real-world events whilst portraying a totally out-of-this-world concept.There is but one downside to the movie in my opinion, albeit one that can be forgiven if you know the background. The ending is abrupt, comes out of nowhere, and leaves many lingering questions. But I have since discovered that the creators have purposefully taken steps to leave it open for a potential sequel, and the movie as a whole is actually based on an established manga series.It's rare that a game or film captures my intrigue at this level, but Alita has earned my admiration and real place in my heart. If you liked Captain Marvel, you will truly adore Alita!",Alita - Battle Angel

And if it doesn´t show in the Theatres near you, buy the Blu-Ray! The trailers don´t show the movie as good as it is. The Environment (some flaws, some continuity errors, they are really minor!), World-building (which is well done), Characters (Ido, Grewishka, Zapan, Hugo, Vector and Chiren but especially Alita), Action sequences (no fast moving very short ""shots"", you can actually follow the battles and they are amazing), CGI (oh god it looks gorgeous), Story (Based on a Manga that is +20 years old and still kicking) and the emotions. Alita is played by Rosa Salazar and she did an amazing job with the folks of WETA (the CGI Masters themselves), because the Alita you see in the Movie is CGI but based on a ""framework"" of Rosa Salazar. From the first minutes on, you dont see her as a CGI Puppet. She feels so believable(!!!) real. I cant find works to describe her. She is perfect. Just buy the Blu-Ray!

1701,rozbehariya,loved it,10,22 June 2019,"First of all i should say, THAT i loved this movie, and i watched it 15 times in 3 days even though i am not a manga fan at all.
there is no perfect movie out there, even the best of them have their shallow moments and their silly loop holes, a good movie should have more + than - and this one had far far FAR more + than - .the acting and cgi was perfect, the combination of efforts from the writer, director, actress and cgi team on alita payed off for me and i felt it in every moment of the film, the fighting scenes were easily the best i've ever seen, the music was just amazing, and there were many more great qualities offered by this amazing film...the negative points i felt for one was the big bad boss of the story felt really bad in a very senseless way, i am not a fan of the villains being bad for no reason, it does not feel real to me and i cant touch and feel it, but he wasnt really explained in this episode of the movie and i hope it will be more touched on in the next episodes(iam wishing to god that there are more episodes).
the movie had a really nice and smooth rhythm for the first 70 minutes and it kinda felt rushed after that, i think this story should have been told in two episodes and not one, i think one movie should have been dedicated to the love between alita and hugo, and her finding out truly who she is.in all, i loved the movie, AND I LOVED the performance of the actress and how alita was made, GREAT work to the creators of this film, iam a fan",Alita - Battle Angel
1702,annieplease,Reminds me of Star Trek and Hunger Games,7,19 November 2019,"The plot is interesting, moving, action-packed, and kind of novel. The gist of the story reminded me of The Hunger Games (fighting the bad guy who happens to run the system). The cyborg aspect reminded me of Star Trek: First Contact. Did the directors and producers of Alita Battle Angel copy Star Trek in the way that they attach a human face to a cyborg body? Google ""Borg queen star trek,"" look at the images, and you will see what I mean! I appreciated that the directors and writers did not try to appeal to the masses by bringing back all dead characters because such is real life-you don't always get a happy ending. But this ending in particular though was unfinished. I hope there will be a part 2 because the ending seemed abrupt. Did they run out of time or ideas, or are they saving the rest for a sequel?",Alita - Battle Angel

The children do have good life, good things (bikes, clothes, money...) and it's redicules to hear from them ""the life here down is bad, we want up"".
The movie is empty: doesn't have moral, it's doesn't show the problem of the society, doesn't explain the the motivation of the characters.
Alita want to fight only because she is a warrior robot.
Totally unlogical movie.",Alita - Battle Angel

The story line was engaging and immediately got you onside with Alita. If you're someone who needs closure and is impatient then the ending will be frustrating, but, this likely means that a second is on the way. Alita is definitely for teenagers and adults alike. I would have liked to see a little bit more about Alita and the background of her 'Urm' history instead of the stereotypical boy meets girl plot which is very old school.Overall worth a watch.",Alita - Battle Angel

It had interesting characters and the world it is set it has you so engaged. It is also hopeful and has me seeing the best in humanity. It has epic action scenes and really good twists.

Attention to detail was pretty poor regarding the story, whereas the blend of animation made zero sense in regards to the austhetics. I wouldn't be that annoyed but reaching the end of the movie it was shocking. It's an episode film! Nothing really happens, all topics remain open while stories never unfold.

1713,ryuaywas,While I don't know the source material...,10,24 July 2019,"As just a movie that I watched because it looked interesting, I have to say I feel like they got this really right for once. Most manga adaptations just don't hit it right, but I felt like they made all the right choices for this one. I might be missing something by not knowing the manga itself very well, but I felt like this movie was structured really well and I would be very saddened if it didn't end up continuing.The romance felt genuine, it felt like they had real chemistry together and it wasn't just a forced here we need a romance type situation. The bond between Alita and Dr. Ido felt genuine as well, it just felt good watching them bond and grow.I rate this a 10/10 because while I was watching the movie for the first time I felt no issues in general. I was continually impressed by how they handled Alita in particular, her face looked absolutely stunning. I very much like their choice to use larger eyes for her to really show the manga origins, it drew the attention away from any uncanny valley type issues and she just looked gorgeous.After the movie I was left with a strong desire to know more about Alita, and her world. I felt like things were finally winding up and we would be able to see her in all her power and glory...and then the movie cuts. That was the only time I felt a little disappointment in the movie, that I couldn't keep going with the story yet.I selected that this might have spoilers but I'm not really sure that it does, I guess it depends on what your idea of spoilers might be.

Why is this movie very attractive to me? Well, the movie has great special effects, fighting scenes, and an interesting plot. However, I think the main reason is deep emotions. Alita is a deadly cyborg, however, she is capable to show emotions which are not possible for many humans. Whatever she does, it's done 200% from her heart.

The beginning was fast paced, but the direct knew perfectly how to show, and when to tell. It, at no point, felt like it was going to fast.I actually felt for this character, something I can't say I have done, for a strong female lead, in a very long time. 10/10, please, whoever is in charge of the next movie, do not change a thing!!Spoilers: my favorite part in this entire movie, is the reversal of Dr.Chiren's character, it felt.... right. The moment even felt appropriate... it's ok for something to be convenient, as long as it's built up to that. An amazing job leading up to that point with her character.A second close, the dog loving bounty Hunter with the heat of gold. Had 3 lines, nailed em. It was just enough, didn't need to be added to a team, just a regular joe standing up for what he felt was right.

Alita lived years ago and now a doctor gives her life again via a robot body but a real heart in it. So she is neither completely a human nor a machine. In world there are others like her and normal people. I found this concept original. Also we see a love between Alita and a human and since it's possible it was interesting for me.Because of something Alita is so powerful despite of her tiny body and nobody excepts that at first and they make fun of her. But then she shows what can she do and everybody surprises. I really loved this situation because powerful women characters are so important for me.In addition to the plot, scenes are great too.

The facial animation and the eyes was so beautiful to behold.Story pacing was pretty spot on and kept me invested from start to finish, and I didnt even talk to my friends during the movie which we usually do.The fight choreography looks to be performed by people who know martial arts properlyCGI is just masterfully executed that I totally couldnt tell the difference between Alita and the other real actors on screen. Music is really nice and suits the movie really well. Actionscenes is just awesome, specially the Motorball ones :DThe world was so interesting that I want to visit it for myself, and hope to see how Zalem looks like.
If people have not yet gone to see this movie as they had my apprehensions for this adaptation, please go to the cinema and watch it.Help make Alita get her rightful sequel or trilogy.

It was just pure joy :D",Alita - Battle Angel
1727,Eibriel,Really cool movie,8,25 February 2019,"I just saw Battle Angel. Overall I liked it, I think it's a good movie. The story is ahead of the effects and that's always nice to watch, and the characters are multidimensional and interesting.The problem it has, almost insurmountable (I think) is the issue of adapting an animé to Yankie cinema. There are many things that don't fit because of a simple question of gender.To give an example: it's very difficult to define the target age of the film. Children? Teenagers? Adults?But I definitely recommend it!The effects are perfect, except for a few details in the facial expressions and the movement of the heads (the movement of the neck seems to be the most difficult in captures!). The action scenes are impeccable, one understands at all times exactly what is happening, not as in Transformers.
I think that adds up a lot.I don't know anything about the sleeve and I could understand it quite well, the amount of information and the rhythm is very well managed.The end leaves with desire of more, hopefully of the miracle and dare to continue it!

1731,tiagojbastos,Do androids dream of being in a good movie?,2,20 July 2019,"Before the original comic was adapted into this movie, it was also adapted into a two-part animated mini-series. That lacked some of the details of the source material, and rushed things a bit, but the minimalism was not only understandable, but somewhat lovable. This movie is the opposite of that, it tries to expand and add more, but in the end does not stand on it's own.Almost from the start, the movie tries to create a love story that feels less convincing than a ""my dog ate the homework"" excuse, and this exposes the first big problem: the characters have no personality, and serve no real function other than making the story move along. By the end of the movie, one would be lucky to remember two or three character names apart from Alita. All one remembers is a CGI girl with unsettling big eyes, a scientist doctor that always feels out of the action, and the love interest on the ""good guys"" team, and generic bad man, generic bad girl and generic bad monster on the bad guys team. These flimsy two dimensional characters are backed up by bad dialog worthy of fan fiction written by a 10-year old.So it comes down to how good it looks. The design is a mixed bag. Some of the android look superb, others look rushed and unfinished. The main character falls on the latter one. Some design choices are also quite questionable, like most characters looking clean and well groomed, when they are supposed to live in slums. The special effects (CGI) are as dull and uninspired as the rest of the movie, so it fits right in.It's never easy to make an adaptation of a Japanese manga or anime. The 2017 Ghost in the Shell movie is proof of that, but Alita didn't have the same huge shoes to fill, it could have been an interesting movie, even with the design flaws. All it needed was a proper script.",Alita - Battle Angel

1734,epicsteve,Absolutely Brilliant!,10,19 February 2021,"I must say, when I heard that a live action movie based on an anime/manga was being made, I laughed to myself and doubted that it would be any good. However, when it was available to rent, I watched it, in spite of my presuppositions, and when I finished watching it I immediately knew that I needed to own this movie.It truly is a work of art that is unlike anything I have ever watched, before or since. It has even earned its place in my top 10 favorite films!Now if we could only get a sequel...",Alita - Battle Angel

1736,avneeshtripathi,Awesome!,10,18 July 2021,"They have gone through all the details, it feels like an actual real world there, the characters, the action, the story, the leaps and the short action hikes are all awesome.The story build up in the beginning was a bit slow but after that you won't just turn it off.Worth Watching! I just became a fan! 😍",Alita - Battle Angel
1737,pohsamuel,We Need a Sequel!,10,5 August 2021,"Surprising, suspenseful, relatable and beautifully crafted are the words I would use to describe Alita Battle Angel. Although the movie came out in 2019, I remember saying to my family and friends, 'Ooh this looks good, I must watch it.' Fast forward 2.5years, I've only gotten to watch it. Let's just say what captured my attention 2.5 years ago was the realistic and futuristic CGI imagery, I dare to say I don't follow engagingly with anime in general. However, upon watching this movie after all this time it has been out, it has given me more reason for me to wish I had seen this live in the premiere. Aside from the visuals and CGI, the characters were beautifully played, the action scenes/stunts were purposeful and realistic (in that setting), and the themes it portrayed across to the viewers were relatable (to me anyway) to the extend that tears were shed. Alita Battle Angel has gotten me looking for more, it got me a new curiosity by reading the manga.Although it is a simple review of the movie, Alita Battle Angel has got me excited for what's to come.. #Alitaarmy
If the story franchise requires me to wait 10 years for a sequel, I will wait for it...(hopefully not!) so go support the movie, and credit to actors/actresses, directors and producers!Because 'It's all or nothing with me...'",Alita - Battle Angel
1738,George_1989,Loved it,9,24 March 2019,"I absolutely loved this movie and i didnt had many expectations when i saw the trailer. It has heart, action and drama, everything you want. I was very sympathetic with Alita because she is a very good and somewhat naive person in a mean world. I would recommend it to any person who likes action movies, the vfx and cgi effects were awesome.",Alita - Battle Angel

1740,theallenking,Amazing cinematic experience!,10,16 February 2019,"Wow! What a cinematic experience! I watched it in Dolby 3D and I'm not a 3D guy. I would liken this experience to seeing T2, Jurassic Park, LOTR, Titanic and Avatar when they were 1st released. Cinematic game changers, cutting edge effects and amazing world building and ideas. This is easily a movie you can watch in theater more than once. It's that amazing! Sure the story wasn't perfect and had some goofy dialog but it's not bad enough to take away from the overall amazing experience. My only complaint is the ending doesn't wrap up the story and I'm afraid the US box office will kill any chances for a sequel. I'm really hoping it does well internationally and on video. I want more Big Eyes!",Alita - Battle Angel

1745,ryanmagaha,Well Directed/Acted and All New Sci-fi Experience,9,18 February 2019,"So, this is both a check in after the fact and a quick review. For those who don't know manga or have never read, this is a popular title, especially in our household. My girlfriend and I have both read it, the former complete, and we were both a little skeptical of the CGI when we saw the trailer initially.Things changed drastically as the film moved along. Characters are fully thought out, acting is terrific and the CGI is intentional. Let me reiterate, INTENTIONAL. You don't realize that in the trailer. It isn't until you see the world and other characters fully realized that it becomes clear. There will be haters or those who give up on the story right away, but those who give it a fair chance and keep an open mind will appreciate the film for everything it is. A fantastic sci-fi adventure. Well imagined, well acted, well directed. It's different, which is one of the best things about it and honestly, this deserves to be included with some of the best films over the past year. 8.5* out of 10.",Alita - Battle Angel
1746,larsgjerlowjorgensen,Best manga adaptation since Akira,10,2 March 2019,"And Akira was made by the author so that almost doesn't count as an adaptation. This is really one of the best movies on have seen in many years. The reason is both stellar performances, great effects and a story very true to the source material. But the main reason is that this is the first time ever that I truly believed in a cgi character. Rosa Salazar's voice and facial expressions did theirs to help make everything believable, but the attention to details in every scene is simply unparalleled.I hope Kishiros wonderful story and world gets the sequels and merchandise that it deserves.",Alita - Battle Angel
1747,Buchka,Amazing,10,11 March 2019,Absolutely great movie and visuals. Really enjoyed it. Cant wait for the sequel.,Alita - Battle Angel
1748,kurtd82,Greatly exeeded expectations after a 15y wait.,10,22 February 2019,I first found out Battle Angel was an upcoming project of Cameron 15 years ago and immediately had visions of what that could be. I was a huge fan of the Anime. This movie was so far ahead of my expectations. I am seing it a 3rd time this weekend and will go at least once more after that before it leaves theaters. I want more than anything to see Alita again in a sequeal or trillogy. She is the coolest most loveable character I know. I have never seen a movie four times in the theater so this will be my first. It's such a mesmerizing film and you could really tell it was a passion project.,Alita - Battle Angel
1749,robert-masaryk,Finally a reason to go to IMAX and watch a movie in 3D,10,17 February 2019,"I was expecting a lot in terms of CGI quality, yet still got surprised of how good it was. After Avatar in 2009. Alita Battle Angel is the 2nd movie where I truly enjoyed the 3D and the CGI was so unbelievable believable I just sat there thinking... ""man, I am so happy to live in an age where movies like this can be made""... truly a next generation quality and first really good representation of anime. And the critics and story? It was just fine as I would expect from an action driven movie and the human side of the story, the human part of Alita, was actually very well written... This is a must movie for anyone who likes Marvel or DC and for anyone who likes anime / manga. And if you have the option to see it in 3D IMAX, do it.. its an experience.",Alita - Battle Angel
1750,mmuratersin,Incredibly Bad,1,9 March 2019,"Worst sci-fi movie I ever seen. Firstly absolutely not immersive, story too basic. I didn't feel anything when watching this movie. The most disliked aspect is that the film does not have an end and is left in the middle for the second film.",Alita - Battle Angel
1751,mkhoury80,Incredible remake of a little-known classic,10,20 February 2019,"The original ""Battle Angel"" I only remembered faintly as I saw the Anime which was only about 40-45 minutes for both ""parts"" (it was a 2-parter originally but still begins/ends the same as this faithful remake does), I was surprised to see so much of the original accurately preserved, and MANY quotes from the original were also preserved word-for-word and I loved this entire film from start to finish.The effects are superb as is expected from any James Cameron film, especially this one which I suspect was his ""pet project"" for the longest time, while some parts of the film may come across as ""passe"" or ""naive"" that is accurately preserving the spirit of the original, which was done in the 90's. The action is incredible and perhaps the best anime-to-live-action conversion that has ever been done! I also really love how much this film is about female empowerment as well as the team-up with open bionics who made a set of actual Alita replica prosthetic bionic arms for Tilly, the girl who lost both of her arms to meningitis, James Cameron is truly someone to be revered and respected for all that he's done inside and out of this movie!The work that James Cameron has done with this film is nothing short of phenomenal, my only worry is that this seems to be getting a reception akin to being a ""sleeper hit"" while some very odd critics are throwing the strangest bits of hatred towards it for things which make no sense, such as claiming that Alita's body is ""over sexualized""... yet those same critics don't have any objection to Captain Marvel having an ""ideal body"", sound like some kind of hypocritics to me.At any rate, I absolutely adored this movie as it is a wonderful remake of a classic Anime that I loved many years ago, and I very much enjoyed taking my girlfriend to see this on Valentine's Day, she had never seen or heard of this movie or franchise before and she absolutely loved it too, so whether you are a fan of the original animated film or are looking to check out something different, give this a go!",Alita - Battle Angel

This is the first anime adaption that I have thoroughly enjoyed and it was refreshing to watch something unique. Will only people who enjoy anime like it? No. None of my friends watch anime and they all loved it.This isn't a spoiler, but a time saver: there is no post credit scene, so save yourself time when you finish watching the movie :).",Alita - Battle Angel
1754,nunu_1284,Beautiful but...,7,22 February 2019,"I liked the movie. It was visually amazing. I loved Alita and all the fight scenes. The characters were amazing with a great cast. It's a nice universe with a good story. But, I didn't feel at all the relation between characters. I didn't feel the father/daughter bond, I didn't feel any of the friendship and certainly didn't feel the love story.
I didn't feel anything when any of the characters died. Maybe it was badly written, maybe they had to cut scene and push the story faster to fit into a 2 hours movie, but I didn't feel any feelings or attachment to any of the characters.
Great movie, visually breath-taking. Good action, but didn't work for the emotions.
Liked it a lot anyway",Alita - Battle Angel
1755,sixyofo,Must see it in theaters. The most entertaining movie since 2018.,9,10 February 2019,"Great CGI and exciting kungfu scenes. I don't understand why would people give it below 8. It's more entertaining than 90% of the films.It would've been better if the movie can be emotionally compelling. I love Alita's body and facial expressions which reveal lovely teenage girls' personalities. However, they tried to have too much stuff said. The viewers don't really have enough time to relate to the characters' feelings. Only get to feel the excitement and a few laughters.The CGI is great! Would be a waste if you only watch it on TV.",Alita - Battle Angel
1756,JeryVinc,Jeremy Vinchenzo,9,21 August 2019,Hopefully they'll be a second sequel for this movie. Just love how the stories are written as well as the movie and it is so amazing to watch.

1757,b-barton-mail,Best fight scenes,9,8 February 2019,I've been getting very frustrated with the quality of fights scenes for some time but not only does this film take the CGI reality hybrid to a new level this is the first time in quite a while I've really enjoyed a scene and every one of them was rewarding. Ok some of the acting was slightly cheesy but overall it was fast paced and very impressive to look at. I'll be gutted if we don't get to see the next instalment. Go Alita!!,Alita - Battle Angel

1759,arswaw,Just see it,10,3 March 2019,This movie is incredible in every way. I wasn't familiar with the source material going in but I still felt engrossed and never confused at all. Let's look at what this movie does well:World-building - It's impressive how much character they manage to pack into this distant future. The movie would be worse off without this astounding attention to detail.Leads - Everyone has great acting and charisma in this movie. Alita is very inspiring and super capable. I love how she demonstrates integrity and defends her ideals.VFX - The special effects in this movie are state-of-the-art. I don't think anything looked silly or unfinished. The way the city and characters were brought to life indicates that the team behind the VFX had a mastery of their craft.Story - This is a story all about a humanity in decline. It is heart-wrenching to think about how devastating the war that causes a ruined earth would have to be. Alita's story is about pushing forward and facing evil in such a dark world.I will be thinking about this movie for a long time. I recommend it to everyone.,Alita - Battle Angel
1760,Nicklaus_Chu,"Im no critic, Im just ordinary people enjoying a film",8,9 February 2019,"Im no critic, Im just ordinary people with an ordinary mind, maybe thats why i enjoyed the film.

1761,docsnyda,Fantastic adventure!,10,15 August 2019,"No idea why that picture was critiqued so badly. It's a romantic syfi-action-movie.

1762,Boykinkoot,Lovable,7,15 March 2019,"You can't help but fall in love with Alita. Not just because of her big eyes, she is so full of wide eyed wonder, it's truly endearing. Absolutely adorable. Like the boy says about her, she may be cgi, but she is the most human feeling in the entire movie. With that said, the same boy either had bad acting or bad lines, or both. I expected a much different story from the title ""Battle Angel"". By that I mean I did not expect the roller derby subplot, or the get to the prestigious sky city climax. I guess I was expecting a war story. I came into this movie unfamiliar with the anime so I really didn't know what to expect. I was told to see Alita instead of captain marvel because it's a much better character and story, and I must agree. I saw both. There wasn't much of a climax so it slightly fizzled at the end but it really left it open for sequels which is what they were obviously going for. I hate to say this, because I'm against the transhumanist cyborg agenda being pushed on society (take notice all the robot commercials in the last super bowl) but I fell in love with Alita, and you will too.",Alita - Battle Angel

A true masterpiece.,10,17 February 2019,"After the many fails attempts of great anime being adapted to the big screen and failing to capture the amazing stories behind their well deserved admiration, I, like many, was very skeptical of this movie.
I do have great admiration in James Cameron's movies and skills, so I was hoping that this movie would be a little better than the rest.
Boy, did this movie delivered.
Alita Battle Angel is a close to failful remake of the the animated fill from the early 90's and plus more. I wasn't expecting it to be as amazing as it was. The action scenes were phenomenal and the skills of Rosa Salazar was a perfect match to play Alita. The movie captured my interest from beginning to end and I hope a second part gets made. I came home and all I could do is talked my wife's ear out in how she has missed such an awesome movie.",Alita - Battle Angel

1766,victor-lengquist,Really?,3,9 July 2019,"The ending an Alitas motivations makes no sense what so ever! Are we (and Alita) supposed to believe that Nova will let Alita into ""his"" floating city as long as she becomes champion at motorball. Being all-seeing and 300+ years old he would know that she is part of tat same team of super soldiers he worked so hard to keep out, last time they came around!? Stupid.",Alita - Battle Angel
1767,miniman911,"Powerful, violent, empowering, emotional, endearing, enthralling, imperfect...",9,17 February 2019,"This movie defines the thought that something can be greater than the sum of its parts, because it can indeed be picked apart... and it has been... by quite a few respected critics. Does the story lurch forward in fits and starts? Sure. Is the acting uneven? Affirmative. Is the movie great art? Negatori... but the biggest question is this...... Does the movie capture a large portion of the depth of feeling and feel of the groundbreaking manga written by Yukito Kishiro? ABSOLUTELY!!! Frankly, I was worried about this release. The trailers looked promising, but all too often with these sorts of projects, the screen writers fail to truly understand and therefore connect with the source material, and even though this script/screenplay is not Cameron's best work, the shear power and dynamism of the original manga somehow pushes through as does the creator's love for it. I could go on and on, but simply put... This is a movie that does an amazing job of rising above it's faults to become genuinely entertaining and beautifully powerful. If you love the original manga and anime as I do, it is a MUST SEE experience!!!",Alita - Battle Angel

I know nothing about Manga and I was expecting another soulless, boring generic superhero movie like so many others in the recent years.Boy was I wrong with this one! After a short while I became completely immersed into the story. Time was flying by and after the sudden end I was just thinking I want more of this!! How could I missed watching this on an IMAX screen? This is easily the best movie of 2019. Probably it should be high in the Top 10 of the best SF movies of all time as well. Everything comes together here: Top notch actors with great performance. Fascinating world with incredible attention to detail. Interesting and original story with characters that I really cared about. Top notch CGI. Great soundtrack too.I have been looking for movie like this for a long time. Instant classic for me, 10/10.",Alita - Battle Angel
1771,scruffmac,A fun enjoyable Sci-fi actioner!,8,10 May 2019,I went in to see this film with no expectations. The trailers reminded me of the ghost in the shell live action film. So I was worried it would be as mediocre as it. But I really enjoyed it.It had a sense of fun about it and the fight scenes were so cool. It is a kids film. But it had some surprisingly violent or dark scenes. Alita is a bad ass character and really easy to get behind. It lacks a real antagonist or a proper threat. It's more of an origin story for Alita. It well worth a download or buying on bluray. I've seen it twice and can say it has a rewatchable quality!,Alita - Battle Angel
1772,windrasshean,Manga Adaptation With Pure Soul And Masterclass CGI,9,19 February 2019,"Anime/manga adaptation that finally do justice to the source material. Although its cramming 3-4 books story into a 2 hours movie, surprisingly still entertaining and clear enough to follow. The CGI from JC's Avatar team shines even brighter in this movie, just as everybody said. And it wasn't even the 3d!
I brought my sister who isn't a hardcore sci-fi or anime geek, and she was on edge till that cliffhanger at the end. We both want the sequel and more! The ""professional"" critics seems not trustworthy this time, so we didn't listen to them.
Alita: Battle Angel is worth every penny, and I personally will rewatch it, in 3d, in dvd, in blu-ray when it came out.",Alita - Battle Angel

1774,Friberg7760,"Good, Hope it's the First and Not the Last",9,19 February 2019,Alita is in the vein of cult classics like the Fifth Element where some critics didn't get it but became loved staples on cable and video. The movie looks very good and has heart. The movie is done in an anime style and looks like an anime come to life. The biggest negative is in the lack of character development which is a little rushed but is standard in anime. Alita deserves to do well at the box office and I hope to see the story continue on.,Alita - Battle Angel
1775,synapticflow,A huge victory for western live action anime adaptations! Forget the critics!,9,17 February 2019,"I saw Alita: Battle Angel on Valentines Day and what a surprise.This was cyberpunk sci-fi done right. The story was heartwarming, the action was incredible, and the CG work was fantastic. This movie has something for everyone.You get amazing visuals, cool technology, some tenderness and romance, and a whole lot of amazing combat.The changes from the anime/manga were just fine and made for a great story. It made you curious to learn so much more about Alita and her life before this movie.I enjoyed all the actors and actresses in this movie. Obviously Rosa Salazar takes the top honors here but everyone did great and was convincing that this was a real world they existed in.A lot of critics won't like this movie for the simple fact that Alita is not some feminist icon and there are not socio-political messages flying all over the place.
Remember when movies were about fun and not a vehicle for someone's messages and preaching? Well Alita is just a fun entertaining ride and that is the ONLY reason we go to movies. We want to escape the troubles and issues of the world. not be preached to about them.That said, girls can look up to Alita because she was awesome, strong, and very cool. She didn't have to brag about it or insult men to be awesome. She just is awesome.I liked this movie so much, that I watched the anime again for the first time in years. Then I bought the digital manga for my tablet.
I'm going to watch the movie at least three times and will certainly be picking up the blu-ray when it comes out.I hope you will support this awesome film as well!",Alita - Battle Angel
1776,allen-jacobs,Alita was great!!! And so was the movie!!,10,5 March 2019,"I'd seen all the trailers and thought I was set to see this action movie. I was way surprised to find that it's not exactly an action movie. Yes, there is action ... & violence ... but that's really only a portion of the movie. Maybe 25%. The rest is this cyborg girl being found, enhanced with a body, activated, finding out about herself and her surroundings, remembering bits and pieces of her past, & finding love. In one scene, she literally hands her heart to Hugo, her love. It's so amazingly touching. Absolutely I'd see it again. Definitely I'll get it on disk when it comes out in May. This was so well done. Alita looks so real ... her joy of new foods, her various emotions from happiness in picking up a puppy and getting licked to some of the irritations that she encounters ... to falling in love with Hugo. Just amazing at how much emotion comes through her eyes and facial expressions.It's been left open for a sequel, of course.

Every little detail they captured beautifully... And this might be only sci fi movie which makes you cry, laugh, be astounded, makes you jump out of your seat.. Like no other... A sheer masterpiece.",Alita - Battle Angel
1783,raulis-balulis,A really great movie but seemed incomplete because rushed.,9,6 February 2019,"This movie had a great energy overall, it was amazing, movie went so quick i felt movie was 2 short, and prob that was the problem. I felt like this movie should have been 3 hours, because some parts of the movie felt really rushed, the vibe and energy of the movie was beautiful, but it should have been longer so you could show more of the growth and so on rather than rushing such important things in the movie. :)",Alita - Battle Angel
1784,papworth-simon,Worth your time. Worth your money!,9,14 February 2019,"This movie was extremely emotionally engaging on many levels and I genuinely think anyone who enjoys sci-fi and particularly cyberpunk will be in love with its world.The only complaint I have is that certain story elements seem a little rushed which just seems to be a necessary evil to make it movie length, which is not to say it is a short movie, but it could have easily been 10 episode Netflix series, but that would have robbed it of its big screen glory, which it truly deserves.There are few movies I like to watch in 3D and usually opt for the 2D option where possible, Avatar was one of the very few exceptions where I believed 3D was superior to 2D which is why I gave this movie a chance in 3D, and believe me it did not disappoint. Having said that, some people have vision issues which prevent them from enjoying 3D movies properly, and I wouldnt say that 3D is a neccesity, just a cherry on an already delicious cake. I really hope this movie does as well in cinemas as it deserves to.",Alita - Battle Angel
1785,chelsea_elvin,Unexpected disappointment,4,21 August 2019,"It's a lot more teenage-romancy than I expected. I think that was a major deterant because they ruin a strong and badass character like Alita with a childish crush for a character who really isn't worth the time.
For a ""battle angel"" a lot of her talent was wasted on insignificant fights throughout the movie with the only useful plot development within the last 15 minutes. I think they did that with the hopes of a part 2 but that turned this part into a waste.
The acting is also pretty poor and the character development is bad so you never feel any connection or empathy in the movie. Might try the manga, with the hopes of it being better, but the movie isn't worth it in my opinion.
4 stars because I see the potential and would actually be interested in a prequel to this that's about her past.",Alita - Battle Angel

As an audience member, this is by far the best cinematic experience that James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez had ever made. I watched it THREE TIMES (twice alone and third time with my cousins). They also loved it! I love how the movie ended which makes us all anticipate the sequel - ASAP! Great choice of actors from Jennifer Connelly, Christoph Waltz, Mahershala Ali to ROSA SALAZAR as Alita. Acting performances were stunning! This is the only film adaptation that stays true to the Manga. It is action packed! Worth every penny! All the more why I still love going to the movie theaters than watching it online.

But compared to other Cameron Films - like Avatar - it's CGI is very unrealistic and doesn't blend well with the real world and actors. From the rendering quality, it feels like watching the ingame cut-scenes of today's PC Games.

1790,quantupulo,Pretty but confusing,4,27 March 2019,"Sure it's a visual spectacle, but it's missing a lot of coherence in plot and characterization. I had a hard time really caring for what was happening. There needs to be greater clarity in the narrative so that it doesn't just feel like a bunch of robots trying to kill each other, with some humans caught in the middle. I understand that it might be difficult due to the complexity of the source material, but there are some glaring issues with the script that could've benefited from more care and attention.
The romance felt extremely fake, rushed, and pointless.
Very lazy and boring writing. The dialogue is rarely anything more than dull or cringey.
Overall, I didn't find myself enjoying it. Some parts were unintentionally funny, like the bar fight scene and when the guy falls off at the end. But humor should be made with intention, and when what little humor there already is is unintentional, you know it's not a great film.",Alita - Battle Angel

Alita is a really well written and based character, shes confident yet hesitant, emensely powerful yet vulnerable, and clearly has a very large history that the film never gets bogged down with...

It was great popcorn fun, with excellent special effects, a decent plot, and fast paced. Clearly, the producers plan on a sequel, and I would be happy to see that as well.

Then it started to loose maintaining the pace and become disoriented and complicated.Your expectation will touch the sky when you start to watch the movie, but you will be ended up with frustration.The ending (although there was no practical ending) of the movie was very much disappointing and pointless.In this part, the skull of its poor screenplay and directing came out.It seems like the director (Robert Rodriguez) forgot how to end the movie, then he ended it in a rush as easily as possible.And it was one of the worst screenplays of James Cameron.After watching the entire movie, I felt like -- I have watched a video game's promo for kids.",Alita - Battle Angel
1810,medmos,An adventurous foreplay to all my fellow weebs out there.,3,7 February 2019,"For one, I haven't read the manga nor seen the anime movie from 1993 but I can certainly say that this movie bears the same quality as any live-action remake of an manga/anime, which in most cases are very bad.
This movie included every single cliché of an american teenage adventure-drama there is (with a splash of alright action scenes) - An ""exciting"" sports event, a cheesy love interest, and their lust for escaping to some other world. All the scenes including Hugo (the love interest) and his team were terribly acted, cringe-y and out of place. All I could really think of is how most of the budget went into making Alita look well animated, which she undeniably was. The whole movie just felt like it was an ""adventurous foreplay"" for all the weebs; going home after the movie putting ""alita p**n"" into the search bar.
Honestly I really liked the universe that the movie set up, but the general execution was simply too bad. There were some flashback scenes from Alita's memories and those were pretty much the coolest scenes.
What I'd like to have seen with this movie is a whole new story within the universe; an origin story including all the stuff that the flashbacks showed, and more.To sum up the review: They had a promising source-material that they screwed up with this PG 13 Americanized Hollywood vision.",Alita - Battle Angel

She is find in a junky yard by Doc Ido, who brings her home and molds what he found in the body he wanted to give to his daughter, killed by a crazy patient of his. There is no way you don't fall in love with her the first moments of the film as she bonds with Ido and discovers the world, including falling in love with... gasp... a male.Alita is a woman through and through and that is what makes her strong. She enlists herself as a hunter when Ido disallow it. From there she is on a mission to get Grewishka, which has been killing women around the city so she can bring them justice and also get $ to help Ido's clinic. This establishes her as her own agent without resorting to the love side story.I liked Wonder Woman, but Diana only released her full powers because Steve died. Why not when those people died in the village she had saved?In a side history, Alita decides to help her boyfriend to get in Zalem (a suspended city I am curious about), but later she discovers that he was part/leader of a gang stealing other cyborgs parts to give to Vector, the King Pim of the city she lives.In the end, her boyfriend turned into a cyborg himself due to a series of events. She goes confront Vector and ends up speaking with Nova, a being living in Zalem that oversees it and the city under it, in which she says that Nova commited one mistake. Understimating her. It is a powerful moment.Later her boyfriend tries to get into Zalem and is killed by Nova. The movie ends with Alita promising to get into Zalem and going after Nova, which is revelead to be Eduard Northon.I never heard of this manga/anime, but people are saying the movie follows the book to a T.Alice Salazar is nothing out of SPETACULAR as the big eyed Alita.

The reason it is strange is because it is everything that I was expecting. It didn't have some weird plot twist. It didn't try and reinvent cinema. It was predicable to a certain extent. These reasons are why I think it is a great film and why I feel it got such mixed reviews by so called critics.What I wanted was a visual feast, a likeable protagonist and some high octane action scenes. I can confirm I got exactly what I wanted. This film is a beaut, it is action packed with some nice story moments. Alita herself if just an Angel! Naive, likeable and is hard as hell.Overall this film has a great story. Yes it is predicable but who cares. Why does every film nowadays have to boggle your brain? All that matters is you care for the characters and it has a decent story progression. It is funny at moments, sad at others and overall it is a joy to watch.",Alita - Battle Angel

And what I actually got was so, so much better than that.Do you like sci-fi, hard action, interesting world building, characters you care about and real drama with actual consequences? Then Alita is what you need to see.I simply cannot understand how this amazing film wasn't a massive commercial success. Since watching it I can't get it out of my head. The characters are played really well, and as the story progresses you start to care about them and what happens to them.Everything about this film is perfect.

Every character in the movie was enjoyable and all looked real.As far as the plot goes, it was excellent. Great storyline with action, some comedy, and love. Me or anyone else explaining this movie does it no justice, you have to see it for yourself. My recommendation is to definitely watch this in theaters. It's off to a slow start, but I think it's because people don't know what to expect. Same as ""Avatar"". It was off to a terrible start but finished as the top grossing movie of all time.

1831,cangrejito_77,The critics are very...very wrong,10,10 March 2019,"Why do critics pan movies which are magnificent in their vision and delivery and give glowing reviews to movies which pale in comparison? Well...we all know the answer to that question, we just don't want to admit it. I saw the shorts to this film and didn't pay it much attention, a mistake on my behalf... but to be fair, I was too busy scrabbling to add my negative review to the latest Marvel drollop that was recently trotted out, prior to the 'cleansing' on Rotten Tomatoes...totally worth it.But over to this film, I feel as if I have watched Avatar for the first time again. Cameron and Rodriguez have successfully created a fully immersive, cinematic experience which leaves you craving more. Like Avatar, the visuals are absolutely stunning, the characters likable, the story arc simple and the villains detestable. I left the cinema both happy...and sad, happy that there is still Directors out there who challenge the status quo, tell different stories which are entertaining, thought provoking, even beautiful....they take on not insigificant monetary / reputional risk to deliver thier vision to us, the viewer and for that, I am ever thankful.And sad because if this film does not make enough money, this will be the last time we see Alita on the big screen, and that friends...will really be a loss. Sad, because the so called critics, think that cookie cutter politicised trash is somehow better. Sad because if you actually interrogate the ideology behind the politics, this movie ticks all of the boxes, but in a way we can all get behind... 'cis white males' included.I don't usually fork out the dollars for a second viewing and I have only ever done it once before...for Avatar, but in this case, I feel the decision is justified for multiple reasons, the primary one being... it's just that good, see you at the next showing.#notafanboy #bringonthesequel",Alita - Battle Angel

Every character is a cliché and just bland to the point where you'll rot when they finally die. I expected at least a small amount of substance to the plot but there are none.Visuals drags this from a 3 to a generous 6. I can only hope the overall rating will go down over time, 7.5 get out of here! You think this deserves a better rating than Olympus has Fallen (scrapping the barrel here for a movie with ""dont overanalyse the script, enjoy it for what it is"" theme ) at least u rotted for the hero in that one.",Alita - Battle Angel
1833,manel-tn,"Nice effet, attaching story, but...",6,12 February 2019,"Finally got to watch the long awaited Alita and in 3D what's more. Being a fan of Japanese animation,I was looking forward to seeing it. Like many I am sure. It was ingenious how Alita's story was presented. I felt attached to her character, merged in her emotions and having this feeling of suppot and compassion.
However, it was only about her. ""Obviously"" one would say. ""Even the movie's title is her name"". But being the main character doesn't mean to suppress the rest of the cast. That's what I felt. A movie (in my personal view of course) is a whole. The story, the effects, the different characters and their interaction with each other to lead the events and tell the story.
With all my respect for the great work this movie requested, I felt that the rest of the cast didn't get it's chance or enough attention. It seemed that the focusing was mainly in Alita's effects and parts of the fights. The acting felt dull, the texts not rich or interesting. A lot of silence sentences. What made the movie really heavy and made the viewer feel its long minutes.
Still, I don't want to end this (rather long :) ) review without thanking all the cast and members of the team for their efforts and their work.

These past few years for me have been very dry when it comes to movies. I often leave the cinemas thinking ""Meh"" or ""That was good"" for most big movies, but I decided to rent Alita on google play and was surprised by how much I fell in love with the world and the main character.It is so rare (not unheard of) to find actually strong female protagonists that are well written, but Alita, despite being a cyborg, is more human than most female characters in recent movies and is badass to boot. You can genuinely feel for her as you watch her explore her new world and root for her when she fights the bad guys.She's a CGI character that has more emotion and expression to her than most live action characters.The story was whatever, but Alita herself carries the movie 100%",Alita - Battle Angel
1836,meaninglesssoul,10 out of 10,10,11 February 2019,When rating and reviewing films I like to keep it simple. Based on if i had more criticisms vs things I like. that makes it better of course. Thinking back on the complete work. I honestly cant remember 1 single thing I did not enjoy. I did thinking the 1:59 mins or so would feel longer but i am finding it to feel shorter than with other flims I did not enjoy. The storyline and acting seemed just right and there wasnt a moment where I wasnt wanting to see what happens next.I also put flims in either the Would i recommend or not and this is a clear Heck Yes! I am really going to be on the look out for future flims from this story. For the love of cheese I hope the next one is just as refreshing as the first.,Alita - Battle Angel

1841,squeakaroni,Loved it.,8,28 June 2019,"I would just ignore anyone who gives this lower than a 5. They have not seen enough movies to know what is truly awful and what is good, decent or great. With a 1 Star, they are just straight up trolling.To each their own but I went and watched this in 3D with the fancy loud surround sound and stuff and the action scenes were just phenomenal. You could FEEL some of those punches she delivered and having seen a early screening with likely a bunch of fans of the anime who knew what they were getting into I thoroughly enjoyed it and cheered alongside them at a few parts. The story was not perfect, maybe not even great, but it stuck roughly to the original's plot enough to keep me happy and the CGI is just incredible.While it was much better to experience in theatres, I think when it comes out on DVD and Blu-Ray on the 24th of July those of you who get it will typically enjoy it. You can check the overall rating here on IMDB to know that most of us liked it.",Alita - Battle Angel

The score also great and even with alot of cgi, I can feel the connection with Alita, her emotion etc. Better go to imax 3D before it's too late.100% far more better than those movies with the better critics points like Captain ""thrash"" Marvel. What a total journey and experience with great cgi, top performance, great imagination in the cgi cinematography, what a well written except they leave the reason why Hugo insist on going to Zalem.Wish this movie got a batter sales than thrash captain marvel,then we can get a better budget for alita 2 and also better recognition in character empawering not suddenly by their own self, rather by her good surrounding helping each other. Not just plain stupid feminist film empowering herself like the thrash movie I mentioned earlier.Look like Alita and Pokemon are 2 movies exceed my expectation and wish they make a great box-office and we all can get a sequal.Also hope those so called Professional Critics just go and die. Even rotten tomato now been compromised after being bought. Hope imdb doesn't goes to that direction and be the real place where people can check the true worth of each movie and got a a fair recognition they deserve.Still can't understand why this kovie got 7.5, maybe because this is not marvel movie and too many single digit IQ imdb user can rate them also.",Alita - Battle Angel

I even went back and watched the old 90s anime OVA to see how it matched up and I wasn't dissapointed! You really gotta see it in the theaters this is some of the best CGI I have ever seen.

It is endearing, incredibly well acted, beautifully shot and tells a fun and exciting story. My only gripe would be that the action scenes were a little jarring. It is totally a cinematic experience.",Alita - Battle Angel
1854,rascalsart,OG fan of the manga and anime,7,7 February 2020,"SPOILER: So, I've been an OG fan of Battle Angel since it came out initially in the 90's. The manga was great, the anime was iconic, it just never got enough props, so when I saw they were making a remake and saw some stills of Alita's design I ran in the other direction. And even though the plot differs a bit, I gotta say I was beyond pleasantly surprised. It held my attention, her CGI didn't even bother me after awhile and it more or less held true to the original story. I also kinda prefer how they depicted the love story of Hugo and Alita in this film adaptation, they pushed it a bit further and I feel it resulted in me caring about these characters more. Because in the anime, it's more of a naive schoolgirl crush Alita has on Hugo, it's clear she's in love with him, but he is majorly INFATUATED with going to Zalem, to the point that he is daydreamy and unable to be present, let alone realize how into him Alita really is. They don't kiss, There's no ""I love you"". He kinda understands in the end on the tube just like in the movie, but by then it's too late, if you've seen the film, you know what happens next. But pleasantly surprised, assumed it would be awful.",Alita - Battle Angel
1855,fotini188,Pointless 2 Hour Strechout of a Materfull Short Japanese Animation,4,9 December 2019,"This 2 hour (!!!!) movie takes a great animation from 1993 with a dark feeling and tries to make it into a bubbly teenager moview with rollerskating! The animation which feels like it has much more substance than the crappy CGI is about a cyborg (that has normal eyes and not weird baseballl shaped eyeholes) that is not in a quest to save anybody and nobody is acting like she is something special, delicate or unique. It is not about one protagonist but about the separate world of Zalem and how each character relates to that in their journey to reach or try to cut the connections from it. In the movie, the doctor is muuuch older and condensending, treating Alita like a lost daughter (another pointless addition), not supporting her choices and leading to her reactive behaviour. Yugo/Hugo has no character (but great abs) in the movie and nobody cares about the lack of his motivation.The most pointless addition in the movie is the ROLLERBLADE competition which Alita joins and has no consequence at all! Another character that is turned into an emotionless puppet is Chiren which in her 5 minute presence in the original animation has motivations and personal conflicts that are completely lost in the movie. Yes it was very important to include a female member in the killing squad! That totally adds female representation in the movie! It was so worth it adding a 5 minutes fight for no reason! The scenes that are copied from the original animation are decent but have no impact as we lack the emotional connection with any of the characters! Finally, although I mentioned it before, it is worth repeating that these eyes that will haunt me for days to come were not present in the original and only manage to make the protagonist look like a creepy fish that is not even there!The four points that I have mercifullt given to this shiny piece of scrap metal which should have been left to rot in the scrapyard are due to the scenes taken from the original animation. So PLEASE instead of wasting two hours and 2 minutes of your life, go watch the original 1 hour animation that succeeeds in showing depth of character, gritty animation, an interesting cyber-punk world and no sequelbaiting!",Alita - Battle Angel

If you are a fan of the manga comics, you'll feel a mixture of things.
1. This is actually pretty accurate.
2. There's a couple of embellishments, but actually that's not too bad.
3. They have really brought my Alita to the screen in a really kick ass way.
4. Captain Marvel ain't got nothing on my Alita!If you've never read a page of the Manga, then you you'll be pleasantly surprised by the depth of the characters and their development.

I have absolutely no idea why some critics are rating it badly. The story is wonderful, and alludes to a deeper mythology, Alita herself is wonderfully conceptualized, executed, and portrayed, and the fight scenes are absolutely gob-smacking delicious. The art direction is stupendous and the movie is both technologically impeccable and full of heart.Apparently, some critics have an issue with the fact that the movie serves as an introduction to Alita and doesn't conclude the story but rather acts as a first chapter, but what the hell do they expect? The manga went on for a lot more than the first few issues that the movie covers, and if they wanted everything compressed into one movie, then they can go suck a lemonade.Watch the damn thing.It's beautiful.",Alita - Battle Angel

Although so, they managed to sort of save it with the final scene in the stadium! As such, i recommend giving this movie a chance due to the intense build up of the story, which was easy to follow and gave me nothing to get confused upon.

I have zero background in this movie other than seeing a few ads and thought it would be entertaining due to the big name directors behind it. Boy did they pull their weight which is why they're big name directors!The lack of cliche Hollywood uses makes this film quite fresh as well as the blending of Hollywood style with foreign story. The film is full of visual candy and unlike Mortal Engines, actually has a pretty good story behind it. Fast paced and lots of character development allows you to get attached accordingly.Highly recommend.",Alita - Battle Angel
1865,Karth07,Went in doubtful - left joyful,8,11 March 2019,"I'll keep my review short and sweet. Firstly, Alita looked like one of those movies where I can't get over the dumb CGI. By which I mean Alita's eyes and face - the trailers left a bad impression. But within the first 5 minutes of the film I ended up loving it. Not only that but the other visuals in the film are brilliant and effective too.Alita herself is allowed to shine as a character and is developed through her story at a moderate pace, with plenty of emotional and physical strife. This is what I love most about the film, I ended cheering on Alita in my head and wanting a second movie to see where she goes and how she resolves her conflicts. I was sad when she went through her struggles. She did this without any need for forced, obvious jabs at her gender or anything, she's inherently strong and proves it. She adapts and overcomes. She expresses wonder for the world and people around her and grows her bonds naturally.The pacing is overall good, and nobody can say otherwise. There are some moments where the pacing is too quick or slow, but it's forgivable and barely effects the movie quality. There also some scenes that feel a dorky, clunky or cringe, which in my mind could be the only reason critics had their problems with it in the first place. I felt this added to the film at some points, rather than took away from it, but I'll admit I did eye roll on some occasions. I felt like there was some redundant scenes which I would have loved to be filled with more character building.The raw action is superb. The CGI is great (when is it not these days, though). The ending is a gateway to the next movie and leaves you wanting more. For a manga adaptation it's done well. I'd love to give this film a higher rating just to show my support, but overall I have to be honest and give it an 8/10.",Alita - Battle Angel

1876,j-57739,An impressive movie,10,24 August 2019,"It has been a long time since I wrote a movie review last time.
This time, I want to write something about Alita. I downloaded this movie a month ago, but I had not had time to watch it until the day before yesterday. I have to say, I love it.
The movie is adapted from a comic. Because of the limit of the length of the film, the movie only presents the beginning part of the comic. The story is about the self-awakening process of a cyborg girl named Alita. To be honest, the plot is nothing surprising. However, after watching the movie, I still immersed myself in the movie, couldn't get my mind back from the film.
So, why this movie appeals me so much? The plot can't be a reasonable explanation. How about the motif, or some deep meaning that the movie presents? I even didn't think about that. I just love this movie, love the character Alita. When Alita says ""I do not stand by in the presence of evil"" I totally fall in love with this character. And I don't think I need to give an explanation of why I am fond of these words. I am not a machine, like the scoring system of TOEFL named e-rater, which can find the grammar mistakes and whether you use logic conjunctions properly in your essay to give a score without any emotion. Not everything needs a reason.
Admittedly, the Alita does have some defects. However, if you want a perfect movie which has superb plots, has spectacular special effects, as well as a profound meaning, you had better to go to bed, rather than cinema. In your dreams, every needs can be satisfied.
Whether it can impress me is the my only criterion to judge a movie. And, obviously, the Alita did it.",Alita - Battle Angel
1877,smw-50828,"Big eyes, bigger heart",8,21 February 2019,"When I first saw the trailer I was moderately intrigued but figured Hollywood would find a way to screw it up. I just got back from seeing it in IMAX and I am happy to report that is not the case.Having never read the source material I can't comment on how true the adaptation is, but analyzing it on it's own merits, it's impressive.The story is fun, the characters are like-able, the visual effects are top tier, and the action scenes are awesome. The actors do their jobs well (particularly Salazar). She is very charming as Alita and easy to root for. Waltz and Ali are both good as always though the latter was a bit underused. The biggest stars were the visual effects team though. The cyborgs all look great, and except for the eyes (which grow on you) Alita looks incredibly life-like.I really hope this movie does well enough to justify a sequel. This story isn't finished.",Alita - Battle Angel
1878,rasmus-02210,"A lot of early potential, turns to a devastating fall.",3,19 February 2019,"There is a lot of potential in this movie. In my opinion it is beautiful, well acted, and the main heroine's design fits well with her wide-eyed, curious, and bubbly personality. Along with some good action scenes, however the best are actually the early ones in the movie. Which gives it a strong early start, when the story can still explore many different possibilities and we are still not sure if they will stick to or subvert the early cliches. However, as we go further into the movie the problems get cemented and reinforced, turning it into a painful and bellow average experience, if you like me care a lot about story.Now, considering that the heroine has amnesia I was already a but... iffy on the romance part, especially since they went with her amnesia putting her into a state similar to the ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, where she simply doesn't know basic things and think every mediocre thing the male love interest does is amazing... So I figured I was in for a mediocre romance at best, but I figured maybe they just make him a good wide-eyed hopeful boy too and it can be a harmless if boring puppy-love romance. I was too hopeful. Not only did they have a version of one of my most hated romance tropes, they combined it with another trope I do not know the name for. The guy that is secretly doing something monstrous completely for selfish reasons, but when it is discovered the female forgives him and basically acts like it doesn't matter... Even as I am sitting there wishing she would gut the monster... which is certainly not an ideal reaction from the viewer in a romance/romantic tragedy story. And her devotion to him is really far too great, even by the normal creepy standards of the ""born sexy yesterday"" trope. In the last half of the movie it feels like her adoration turns into full on worship in their very one-sided relationship... Ironically this very powerful battle-cyborg feels completely - since I don't have a better word for it - castrated by the romance plot. It is in a disturbing way kinda impressive that they managed to turn such a tough cyborg into a pathetic doormat. But the movie clearly still wants to act like she is the tough girl I paid money to see, even if it doesn't want to actually deliver it.It also doesn't feel like she has a lot of agency in the story, constantly reacting rather than acting, and leaving her without a solid long-term motivation other than the basic amnesia motivation of remembering and stuff not related to her like: I must protect X, or I want to do Y to make my boyfriend happy...It also feels like the movie is fundamentally lacking a climax. Once the romance subplot it feels like we should get a final climactic fight-scene where this powerful cyborg finally reaches the place the movie has referenced all throughout and tears it all down... But no, instead we get what looks to be a mediocre setup scene for a sequel... But by then all the potential feels like it drained from the movie, and there certainly isn't enough for a second one, just 5-10 minutes of fighting everything to tear down the old world...And speaking of the world needing to getting torn down, they are not able to make the place appear bad enough to justify a lot of their dialogue about how bad it is. Sure it is bad, but it doesn't seem extremely bad, there's a crime problem due to people like Alita's boyfriend choosing to be horrible, but there's also a lot of fun and happiness and what must be considered luxury items by dystopia/apocalypse items like chocolate... and the world outside their city appears vibrant and green...If the city is so bad, I don't understand why they don't move, and the city doesn't seem bad enough to justify cheesy lines like the city turning even good people to do bad things.",Alita - Battle Angel

Stunning visual effects and a lot of action scenes that deserves to be watched in Imax 3D. The movie runs smoothly and doesn't feels rushed or dull in any scene. I'm already waiting for a sequel and i got to say this is the best origin movie since batman begins. Every character have powerful motives that explains their actions during the movie. Acting is convincing. the movie sets up the villain as a matermind with much power and authority at his disposal evan tho the movie ends without much about him except that. It gave me high expectations for the next one lets hope it won't take long before it comes out . Roza is performance was more that what i expected she was cute fearless and a total badass all at the same time.The bottom line is if you are looking for a sci-fi movie with good story, great action scenes and awesome visual effects thats your movie .",Alita - Battle Angel

1884,strwar,Alita Battle Angel Deserves A Sequel!!,10,24 February 2019,"Alita Battle Angel shows the interesting character cyborg named Alita. The adventure and challenges,she faces from world that went through almost Cyberpunk style of what I see Alita shows off in her skills as the warrior she aims become. Suffering from memory loss. She goes around learning more from people and from a friend. She soon falls in love with as he has too. Alita faces a enemy from her past that she now needs to face off and soon will be challenged along the way there. From fighting to racing and testing relationship she shares with the man who rebuild her. Alita Battle Angel Is my favorite Female Lead Movie Since Wonder Woman I last saw in the theaters. There's no question that Alita can put herself in the list of Strong female lead movies. Such as Ripley from Alien. Sarah Conner from Terminator. Uma Truman's performance in Kill Bill. I recommend you watch this amazing movie. 5/5 stars! Sequel Sequel Sequel",Alita - Battle Angel
1885,bobbybanast,Great movie,10,6 March 2019,"Overall good adaptation. A solid story, great acting, the action sequences, everything was spectacular. It was well crafted and we was entertained throughout the film. Rosa Salazar did a great job making Alita a strong, loving and complex girl. I felt invested in Alita and her success.Don't let yourself be turned down by the press reviews. Looking forward to the next installment.",Alita - Battle Angel
1886,tdvgraphics,Absolutely amazing.,10,9 February 2020,This movie was fantastic. One of the best I've seen in a long time. I truly hope they make a sequel soon.,Alita - Battle Angel
1887,pjwoodies,"A MAIN CHARACTER, WELL WRITTEN AND ACTED!!!",9,9 May 2019,"It's been a long time since I've seen a main character this well done in a single movie that's not an art film. You know, like old time hollywood; and to do so in a big ,entertaining and engaging science fiction like this, is such a joy to watch.",Alita - Battle Angel
1888,highrock,"Good movie, Great adaptation",10,8 February 2019,"I was lucky enough to view a pre-screening of the movie, and went in there with very high expectations. Something that normally never bodes well. I came out all smiles.The world of Battle Angel is somewhat a mash of Rollerball(1975) and dystopian cyberpunk movies (1995's Johnny Mnemonic comes to mind). It's too easy to compare Alita:Battle Angel to all these other sci-fi works and other recent flamboyant CGI-heavy movies while forgetting that its source material is often part of the inspiration behind them or at least was created at the same time. I often see Gunnm and Cyberpunk 2013 (1988) as two of the main inspirations for the entire genre. They are definitely very influential.James Cameron's script will undoubtedly captivate audiences as it has with Avatar, Titanic, Aliens and most of his other successes while also lacking in the same areas. Where it shines however is how he manages to stay true to the source material. There are obvious differences, which is unavoidable when trying to fit a full manga into a 120min movie. I believe Jackson's adaptation of the Lord of the rings is one of the most successful book adaptations in modern cinema. Battle Angel is on the same level, for a manga.It is important to note that most of the negative critics I've seen out there have issues with the actual original material (without their authors knowing). Most of these critics would detest the Gunnm manga, and often, hard cyberpunk has a whole. (What they are doing reviewing and critiquing cyberpunk movies is a bit beyond me)Add into the mix what the Actors bring to the table, the work of the cast & crew, Robert Rodriguez directing (be warned he leaves somewhat his often typical rough and gritty style), and the work of the visual effect studios (which is breathtaking), and you have Gunnm brought to life in all its glory.If you are a fan of the manga, or if you like sci-fi in general, I definitely recommend seeing it.",Alita - Battle Angel
1889,avigdors-55832,Such a great treat!!,9,28 August 2019,I never read the comics but I definitely consider doing so after watching this really great production! I always liked Rodriguez's way to look at things and this is yet another movie to prove it. Really great manga like title. I hope there is a sequel!,Alita - Battle Angel
1890,estela-86553,Good enough,9,22 February 2019,"Amazing movie. When I was watching it I never thought it was a Robert Rodriguez's movie. There's action, love and a lot of good fights. I can't wait a second part. I like it so much .",Alita - Battle Angel

1892,gekegeke,Mind=Blown,10,17 February 2019,"What a time to be alive! This movie feels like a literal gift. So thankful for have been able to watch it, so thankful for the sheer EXISTENCE of this movie. Wow. Just wow. Watched it twice, once in 2D and once in IMAX. In IMAX, the sheer visual beauty of this film just sent shivers down my body for 2 hours straight. This movie is the culmination of digital technology. Despite being animated, Alita was NOT off putting at all. In fact she grew on me and because of her naiive, teenager characteristics I started rooting for her. All the characters have substantial depth in this movie, all of their actions are rooted in their specific backgrounds and personalities. Furthermore their personalities all undergo progression, not at all forced in my opinion, which is actually rather hard to find these days. Because of these believable characters, the story was not forced at all. It was all in all very entertaining and suspenseful, I LOVED IT!! Most of all though, the action scenes. Wow. Beautifully choreographed I have never seen anything like it. Also the world building. Everything about the cyberpunk world portrayed in the movie seems so real, so believable, because of the amazing, detailed set ups. I just can't express how amazing this movie is. Words do not do justice. AMAZING!!!!!",Alita - Battle Angel

1894,brynja-02847,Go into this movie with no expectations,9,1 March 2019,"I really liked this movie. I went into this movie thinking it would be anothe Mortal Engines but came out loving it. I've never read the manga but rest assured I will from now on. This movie isn't another generic sci-fi movie.
It is a Manga adaptation and if you go in knowing and ACCEPTING that you should not be dissapointed.
Also accept that Alita is very naive and young at heart. She isn't perfect and I like that. Even though she's a cyborg she still has big character flaws but you still root for her anyway.
So keep an open mind and stop taking critics seriously. If you want to go see this movie then go do it.",Alita - Battle Angel

I hope it makes enough for them to make a second one because let's face it you can never get enough Alita.",Alita - Battle Angel

1898,medicalrightsusa,We loved Alita! Definitely purchasing when released.,9,23 March 2019,"Alita was the best film we've seen in a long time. There is nothing in the theater right now with such creativity. Theaters cut show times way too soon. It was nearly impossible to find a theater still playing the film. After watching the film and reading reviews (higher rated film than Captain Marvel), it makes no sense that Captain Marvel is playing on so many screens within a given theater. The popularity of Captain Marvel does not reflect quality, but instead, the Marvel badge is bringing in the crowd. Unfortunately for Alita, due to a confused advertising division, Alita didn't bring in the money it should have, but hopefully it will sell very well once released. The ratings and reviews speak for themselves. This film is supposed to be a trilogy, but more people need to give the film a chance for it to have a chance at even a 2nd release. The budget was 170 million, and tho everyone clearly loved the film, it needs more support (and it deserves it). I hope everyone thinking of taking the plunge will view the film. This is too good of a film to not get the Trilogy it deserves, and we badly needed something fresh and authentic, yet away from the Marvel 'copy and paste' routine.Please support this film. Give it a chance. I believe you'll thoroughly enjoy it, as we did. If you're a Marvel fan, this is a better film than Marvel has offered in quite a while. I rated this film a 9 out of 10 simply because nothing is perfect. I don't think anyone will regret seeing this film. Just go see it! If you can't find it playing in theaters, definitely give it a shot when it is released to the public. It is worthy of owning, not just a one time view.This film is good for all ages. 37 and 40 years old, here, and we LOVED it!",Alita - Battle Angel
1899,keijikiriya,Great adaptation of an Epic Manga,10,13 February 2019,"This movie a hell of a ride. It has heart, some of these great adrenalin rush but stay still very ""human"", great acting (From Salazar to Ali), stunning visuals (the best we have ever seen, Weta thank you). All of these with a James Cameron's touch. Robert Rodriguez is the director but you can feel James Cameron's presence, who is a great fan of the manga, everywhere. Robert Rodriguez said he would do a James Cameron's movie for this film, he totally succeed. It is truly a great Sci-Fi movie.The funny thing is I felt that same ""euphory"" with this movie that I had with Mad Max Fury Road. Both are different movies, but both are great in their own way. Perhaps thanks to the great music by Junkie XL for both movies too ? The thing I know is when I left the theater, I had big smile like I had for Mad Max Fury Road.I must admit, when I saw the trailers, at first I was afraid. Battle Angel Alita (""Gunnm"" in Japan and Europe) by Yukito Kishiro is one of my favorite manga of all time. It's a fantastic story with great Anti hero in a cruel Cyberpunk world, Alita is a cyborg who lost her memory, she struggles at first, she is naive, fell in love, she is flawed but will slowly become what she used to be : the Angel Of Death.Even if in my country (France), the critics praise the movie a lot, the most important critic are the people and thanks to this website we can see that people from Worldwide are praising the movie. Totally deserved. And now I know that I won't look at Rottentomatoes rating ever again. Blade Runner was slapped by the critics (one of the greatest Sci-Fi's movie of all time), Fight Club was slapped by the critics (one of my favorite movie of all time), Bohemian Rhapsody struggled on RT (one of the best movie of 2018) and all these movies are great. Today the same thing happen to Alita Battle Angel. Don't let RT fooled you, always listen people's reaction/critic, that's what I do, IMDB.com and the community never fooled me. I really want this movie to have success because if that's the case, we will have a franchise, and trust me, if the beginning of this epic journey is already very good, what's happen next in the manga is even better.Thank you for reading and I apologize for my bad english, it's not my native language. :-)",Alita - Battle Angel

I went into the theater telling my wife that there were some ""Great visuals but no story"" reviews. We both left thinking maybe the story was not complex enough for some people, but there definitely was a story. Of course the visuals were stunning, and attention to details was amazing.

The adaptation is well done, and Alita is a character you come to, well, respect.But! And it's a big but.., I can't remember the last movie that left me so unsatisfied as this one. It screams for a sequel. In fact, I would advise to NOT watch this movie until there is a sequel... or until you know for sure it is being made. For now, that's a big blank.But.., if you are fine with that, watch it, and enjoy it.., it's good.

1919,jukesarbe,Good movie but misses the point of the manga,8,16 February 2019,"I think the manga is about a girl growing up and going threw different stages (childhood, teenage, adult), here are the strong themes that hit me in the manga. However the movie decides to have all the narrative arcs happen in the same time (love interest=childhood, fight with parents, search of independance) and so losses the point of « growing up ».

1924,rpokeefe,Worth the Ticket,7,26 March 2019,Pretty standard popcorn munching action science fiction movie. Go for the action not for the deep meaning. Captured most of the plot points of the comics. The only thing I missed in the movie was the lack of whole brains splatting on the pavement. I think disembodied brains flying around would have certainly added to the thematic punch.,Alita - Battle Angel

1930,andygr-89608,Mishandled Mechanical Dreams,5,11 August 2019,"Alita's got some wonderfully intricate robot designs and beautiful looking world, undoubtedly caked in history these film-makers wished to share. Unfortunately this film is so marred by the clunker of a script, I wonder who ever let this one out of the editing room.There are moments in sci-fi films that make us reflect on our own non-technologically-advance present day. No manmade device can usurp the importance of a living being's heart. Alita Battle Angel approaches these emotional moments with the precision of a rocket-propelled sledgehammer, banging itself through such themes of ""what is life"", ""hold onto your dreams"", ""can an android love a human"", and ""wow, I'm good at sports because I'm an android"".I am certain James Cameron and Co. threw at Director Robert Rodriguez an un-finished mess of a script. Where the original graphic novel probably devotes entire books to the many themes, they are summed up in 10 lines or less within the film. Maybe this film could have been the Coles Notes of Alita Battle Angel series, but instead is the piece-meal ramblings that are yelled to us over a cacophony of metal scraping on metal.Strap in for a rocket ride through a futuristic android-human story, 300 years from our very own, and then make sure you brace yourself for the sudden impact that is the ending, if you could call it that. I would call it a miscalculated hail-mary.",Alita - Battle Angel

I read the comic back in the 90s, and this movie has been faithful enough to not just make me happy, but IMPRESS me. This looks like the world from the manga comic. SHE looks Alita. Hugo is a little off from his manga look, but overall, this is a must watch. I mean that. If you're an anime fan SICK of lame adaptations, support this, so we see more like it.

If you don't touch on the characters, the plot isn't complete. Perhaps ALITA could be the exception. The strength emerges from within without a sense of a gullible personality. The story is there, but unformulated. That is likely the reason for the title directing itself to an individual.
Regardless, it's undoubtedly a wonderful watch. One to experience in theaters especially in IMAX 3D. Rosa Salazar gives a stunning performance with a cast that stretches her character far to its reaches.",Alita - Battle Angel
1939,mariaqueen-79012,Great action movie,8,17 February 2019,It's a great action movie. I feel that if certain stuff was added and it they would have let this movie be R rated then it would have reached its full potential. I wish it had more gore and more blood. If it was rated R and had more blood in it it would give it a 10/10. Other than that it's a really good action movie. Visuals were on point and the acting was great. Rotten Tomatoes reviewers always read too deep into films which makes no sense. What it in 3D or in BigD and get the full experience. I loved it.,Alita - Battle Angel
1940,jlhoneycutt-41237,From the First Time I Saw the Preview,9,30 April 2019,Over the years I have seen a lot of stories in film. With previews I eventually learned to trust my 'vibe' and 90% of the time it's pretty accurate whether I'll like a movie or not. When I first saw the preview for Alita: Battle Angel I was sincerely peeked in curiosity and interest. I knew this was a movie I would love. When it finally hit the big screen I went opening night and that was it. James Cameron loved the source material for a reason and Robert Rodriguez visualized it brilliantly. I've never seen anything quite like it. Great main character development and well acted by Rosa Salazar. Excellent acting by the other main characters (check the line up!). And an intriguing story! With this kind of groundwork laid there is SO much potential moving forward. Alita (character and movie) is compassionate in a dark world and we sure could use more of that! Watch it and find out why you frequently see these symbols related to the movie: 🍊and 🍫. You'll be glad you did.,Alita - Battle Angel

1943,brigantine,The best live action Manga,8,17 February 2019,This is the best manga/anime live action adaptation I've seen. Rosa Salazar was incredible & her mo-cap really comes through with Alita. The action sequences are absolutely spectacular. The story was deep and engrossing that did incredible world building. I want to revisit this world and really learn all the ins and outs.The one knock I have for it is the ending otherwise I'd give it a 9. I will not spoil the ending but I felt obviously was looking towards a sequel.Overall this was an incredible film that everyone should go see. See it in IMAX 3D if you can.,Alita - Battle Angel

Very strong character work, really fun set pieces, amazing action scenes that I actually cared about watching. Really want to see a sequel.

1945,andrevzx,A must watch,10,25 February 2019,"Let me just start by saying this movie got me very confused, im not the type of person to enjoy a movie like Alita, i went to see the movie as part of a friend's joke, and ended up crying during it, and i really don't know why. I never even wrote a review before, this is my first one, but i had to seeing some of the bad reviews out there.
The movie is amazing, i don't want to spoil it, but trust me, i have my 2nd run tickets bought allready, going to see it tommorow again, can't wait for the sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel
1946,crazycedez,Only giving points for the animation.,4,10 April 2019,"The animation was incredible and beautiful to watch but the story left a lot to be desired. Meaning it was awful. The story was so boring and the characters were so basic my boyfriend and I groaned so many times trying to watch it. My boyfriend actually fell asleep and I only woke him up to watch the battle scenes. This is your run of the mill young adult movie. Had it been darker it would have been better. Cut out a ton of the scenes with the human boyfriend and just leave enough to get Alita to the breaking point where she's ready to go nuts on the people up above, and that would have been great. What a waste of talented animators.",Alita - Battle Angel
1947,houseofisher,"Not perfect but gorgeous, breathtaking, and poignant",10,29 April 2019,"This movie is a technical tour-de-force which is so seamless that you feel its characters and sense their emotional weight subliminally with your heart more than your eyes. Everyone inhabits a world that feels deep and real with no ""CGI divide"" between the practical and the greenscreen. Alita is a marvel (no pun) projecting the emotions of her arc - innocence, wonder, discovery, painful discovery, triumph, and heartbreak - with an amazing subtlety and clarity.The plot was pretty good too. I highly recommend it. To those who've seen it already, I was amazed at the attention to detail which only became clear on subsequent viewings. Amazing.",Alita - Battle Angel
1948,bkvalenza,Loved it!,9,17 February 2019,"Loved EVERYTHING about this movie. So refreshing to have a big movie without a Star Wars, DC, or Marvel logo in front of it. My only wish was that it was 10-15min longer. But I definitely want more!",Alita - Battle Angel

1951,JosephPalacios,"Anime is real, but is pretty boring.",4,12 March 2019,"I didn't think I would be bored half-way through this picture. The first half of the movie is so goofy. But the other half was so boring, the fighting scene pulled me out of the movie, the only thing I could image is the actors on a green screen. Not all the CGI was bad, alita had good CGI but most things I this movie looked goofy and not really happening. I wasn't invested in the second half then i fell asleep through the rest.",Alita - Battle Angel

1953,georgekaralis-33140,Not interesting at all,3,19 May 2020,"A very predictable movie, with simple minded scripts. There were scenes without any contribution to the story. There were characters that were completely unnecessary. An ending only good for a 20min Anime.Not the movie I expected to watch.3/10 only because of the amazing visual effects. Visually the movie is flawless, a true masterpiece of CGI usage",Alita - Battle Angel

1955,gydeon-1,Alita is a true hero story!,10,9 July 2019,"What I love about this movie is that it's pure entertainment. It's magnificently produced, with a fantastic story line, and a heroin that any girl should be proud to aspire to.

1957,hrithikjoshi-74211,An entertaining journey for anime and general movie fans alike,7,12 February 2019,"To general audience, Alita's big anime eyes might feel a bit weird but give it chance and you will realize how entertaining the movie is.The dialogues are fine...neither great nor bad.The movie is at its best during the action scenes and my god does it look great.This movie looks amazing,from the iron city to the motor ball game.It is a fun watch.
The only problem I have with the movie is with its ending.I dont want to spoil anything so lets just say its kinda abrupt.Also,again not trying to give any spoilers,there is an incident in the movie during last part which is well done but then that exact thing happens again presented in a different way and it ruins the significance of that incident.
Overall its a great movie and worth your time and that Edward Norton's cameo was a delight",Alita - Battle Angel
1958,Lucifer-HUNTED,incredible story line as well as as graphic designs!!,8,14 March 2019,"My first expectation was that it was going to be really bad!!!The past live action animations have been completely horrible or ""overdone/over characterized"" but this one was done to almost perfection and the story line never got boring. One thing i really liked about it was that i went in to view it as ""childish"" but it was the complete opposite with the right amount of gore to make any action movie good.-Strongly suggest watching-",Alita - Battle Angel
1959,roopej-03158,A cluttered poorly written movie with engaging action keeping it afloat,5,19 February 2019,"Alita battle angel is full of great action and a potentially interesting story that's let down by a substandard script. It follows Alita a cyborg rebuilt by Dr Dyson Igo ( a substandard performance from Cristoph Waltz) who has amnesia and must rediscover her past while on a quest to reach the mysterious floating city of Salem.
The first act of the movie is probably the strongest from a character perspective as we see Alita exploring this new world and building relationships with our central characters however on a dime that all changes. After observing Dr Igos mysterious nocturnal activities she unlocks some of her past discovering that she has unmatched fighting capabilities and suddenly becomes a wise cracking badass instead of this innocent girl and suddenly the action is centre stage.Alita becomes a hunter warrior and participates in motor ball in order to reach Salem and defeat the baddies that want to capture her at all costs for the enigmatic nova up in the floating city. The action is well choreographed and while it does sometimes creep into the transformers/man of steel realm of headache inducing loud cluttered cgi infused battles for the most part they are exciting and tense as she battles larger and more experienced opponents. However after seeing Alita best even the strongest the tension in these fights wane as it becomes clearer and clearer she is in a league of of her own and her heartless ruthlessness disconnected me somewhat from sympathising with her as a character.Fallen by the wayside in this deluge of action is the development of side characters and their relationships with Alita as well as the back story for the world. The father daughter dynamic is left shallow as is her relationship with Hugo who has a rather troubling occupation and Igo's ex wife who's collaborating with Salems spokesperson Vektor in order to get to Salem. None of these characters have enough time to develop their characters in order to give the audience much of an emotional connection that just leaves the movie feeling very stretched out and thin especially as the emotional connection with our heroine wanes.The effects for the most part were good for the most part but Alita's CGI face didn't work for me at all at times it was over expressive and other times looked blank. It left me cringing at times when she spoke as the uncanny valley territory creeps ever closer. It just struck me as unnecessary and down right creepy feeling like a twisted sexual fantasy of a ultra innocent doe eyed girl who was also a killing machine. It was endlessly distracting and feel like it would be easier to connect with her as a character if she didn't loom so fake while everyone else felt completely real.Going into this for some fun balls to the wall action you probably won't be too disappointed but looking for much depth here will be in vain as this never reaches the levels the ambitiously vast story aspires to get to",Alita - Battle Angel
1960,punkgod-40644,"Breathtaking Visuals, and Memorable Story",9,14 July 2019,"There's not enough positive adjectives in existence to fully describe how incredible this movie was.

Make it successful.",Alita - Battle Angel
1961,mariahjai,It was amazing!!!,10,10 March 2019,"This movie turned out to be better than I thought it would be!!! I was sceptical at first but it was full of action, romance, and determination.

1962,patrickyeck,Splendid Animation can't Compensate for it's Convoluted Storline,4,16 February 2019,"The title should actually read: ""Alita: Battle Angel/Bounty Hunter/Roller Blader/Heart Donor/Lovestruck Teenager(ish)/blah, blah, blah. The storyline resembles a can of spilled peas more than a formidable plot. There is so much going on in this movie that it's easy to forget who's who, what's what and, more importantly, why. It's sad to say but the only decent acting was by the CGI Alita. The rest of the cast offered up painfully dull performances. I have seen better acting in infomercials. Alita: Battle Angel is beautifully animated but don't expect the same kind of ""wow factor"" that Avatar gave us on its debut. Unfortunately all the animation in the world can't save Alita from a storyline that, over halfway through the film, literally had me leaning over and asking my wife ""What's this movie about?""",Alita - Battle Angel
1963,y0unG,Can it be another Terminator 1?,8,23 February 2019,"About half year ago, I heard this movie and at that time I was shocked by its poster. Now I finally have watched it. I feel awesome about the action scenes and its mysterious world. All stories happen in the iron city but I can imagine the great war between Earth and URNS?(maybe wrong).
And this is the best part of this movie, the excellent way to tell people the background of the movie. It didn't use books or a old man's story to do this, instead, it gives us some pieces, like destroyed ship, the last sky city, a flashback about the war and so on. In this way we have time to imagine the whole story before the movie. This makes me feel good.
However, the reason why I give it 8 is that, as a movie that obviously has the sequel, it can not be considered as a good one. I'd like to use the Terminator as the example. Although T1 is not good enough but it is a complete story and its intention to make a sequel is not as obvious as this movie. So this is what I want to talk about, if u want to make a sequel, don't be too obvious or at least don't let a bad guy fail twice (u know what i'm talking about).
Certainly, I hope it can become another T1, because T2 is sooooooo excellent!!!",Alita - Battle Angel
1964,arifaqna,Perfect for Those Who Enjoyed Aquaman (AKA Those Who Likes Mindless Stories With Horrendous Plot),3,26 February 2019,"Saying that Alita: Battle Angel had a plot would be an insult to the concept itself. Rather than a coherent story, the movie works as if Robert Rodriguez had a list of things that he want to put in it, and then when he does put the thing in, he puts a big checkmark besides it, and moves on to the next one. Because that is exactly what Alita: Battle Angel felt like; a big list of things that Rodriguez had a hard-on for, then decided to put in the movie while completely trashing the flow of the story. First Alita become a hunter-warrior, then she got into this, then she found out about that, then she found about this and then the end. There was no bigger story, no bigger meaning. There was barely any story or meaning as it is.The dialogues were cheesy and painful to watch. It reminded me of those ""Riverdale's Bad Writing in 5 Minutes"" videos, except instead of 5 hilarious minutes I got 2 hours of excruciating idiocy. I commend the team on the impressive fight scenes, especially the bar fight scenes against other hunter-warriors, but the fact that they look at the word 'hunter-warrior' and didn't think to change the entire script immediately is ridiculous.I do feel that when people complain about politics or real-life issues in their entertainment, this is the kind of shallow content they're looking for. A trashy, mindless garbages that distracts you from its non-existent storyline and horrible dialogue with huge explosions and overdone CGI battles. These kinds of movies are an insult to storytelling of any medium, but because the market still exists for them, movies like Alita will keep getting made and keep on getting favorable reviews. I just hope that those people would not try to make this movie pass as a well-written one, as I've seen many people on Twitter and Youtube do. Alita: Battle Angel, along with Aquaman, are badly-written movies with cheesy script and a kindergarten-level story with its only redeeming factor being its brainless and banal fight scenes.",Alita - Battle Angel

1969,nsteil,Alita was an Okay Moive with Great Action but Lacks in Plot,6,8 March 2019,"This movie is honestly one of the better anime adaptation that Hollywood has been try to get out to theaters for the last few years. You can definitely tell there was a lot of work and passion that went into making this movie that James Cameron bought the rights to almost 20 years. This is also the biggest budget that director Robert Rodriguez has ever work with and the biggest staring role for the main actress, Rosa Salazar, has ever had.The movie has way too much happening in the plot where I didn't care for what was happening to anyone apart from Alita herself. There was a subplot about the Father/Daughter that was okay, a love story that I couldn't care less about, and multiple other plots that I are decent as well. The character of Alita was alright in this movie, she was one of the only characters that i cared about in the film, but she did feel like a Mary Sue character where she never really loses in this movie, no heroes journey, character flaws or any interesting interaction with other characters but that could also be because every other character in this movie is boring.The action scene is good thought and its what keeps me from saying this is a bad movie. The CGI in this movie looked amazing to the point where I wasn't even bothered by Alita's eyes in it (which yes when I watched the trailer for this I was off put but you do get used to it). You do end up having a lot of fun when they come up and are impressive when you see them.I feel like this movie would have been better if they had gotten rid of some the other minor characters such as Jennifer Connelly's and Mahershala Ali's characters who do pretty much nothing, as well as tone down the romantic sub plot. They could have made this a more personal story where Alita learns about her past, what she is, and what she want to become, and spend the rest of the time establishing the other characters and focus on Jackie Earle Haley being the main antagonist of the film instead of one of 4. But if you are looking for just a movie with a lot of great action scenes then you won't be too disappointed in this movie.",Alita - Battle Angel
1970,kirillvanheerden,Deeo emotion & world building. Needs to be seen at least twice to be understood.,10,9 March 2019,"This movie is a masterpiece and must be seen at least twice to truly appreciate and overcome the dense compression. This is also why critics gave it a low score, it was too much to understand in a single viewing. In fact, the emotion and acting is amazing, Alita is truly about self discovery and improvement, Alita is simple and deep simultaneously, she can switch from silly to life&death serious in a heartbeat, she is transparent yet quick in her thought process and Rosa acts out all these qualities perfectly, she really is Alita. The story building is amazing in this film and it really needs a sequel to fully unpack. Only via a sequel (and managa) can the audience understand how much of a tricky joker and linchpin Nova truly is, how complex and deep the story is (Zalem is only the beginning, merely a drop in the bucket), about Alita's history and about her peers (but dont expect to understand her soul, no one does, not even her, its a theme of self discovery and this is inspirational. Plus the story is still being developed further). A sequel would have a multiplicative effect, not merely additive, because it helps unpack this complex story and the movies will resonate with each other.",Alita - Battle Angel

1972,vulekv-83921,This movie sucks,2,5 March 2019,"I wanted to walk out of theater several times through out the movie. It's simply that bad, only thing that kept me in my seat was my will to soldier on and endure this torture, I'm no quiter God damn it!This movie is just a bunch of cliches piled up on top of each other. One uninteresting thing happening after another. Other than first 5 minutes the movie is utter garbage, it's not even so bad it's good, it's just bad... It fails at everything it tries to accomplish, it's so utterly bland and shallow, I wish English was my native, but even then I would need to be bloody genius to convey how bland and cliche and soulless this monstrosity was...And what's up with those 10/10 ratings...

1974,ren-gonzalez,Worth the watch,9,24 February 2019,"I was very skeptical in watching this movie because translating movies from anime to live action tend to be a miss for me with unrelatable characters. But after finally watching this, I was blown away!The journey of Alita from losing her memories, finding herself in world to becoming a strong selfless kind character is well paced into her growth. It's almost rare to see a female characters go through hardship and vulnerability without demonizing or taken advantage by their male peers when it comes to hero movies. Sure the romance between her and Hugo (Yugo?) was cheesy (keep in mind this is how first love start off) but that doesn't hinder her character development. I love the father daughter relationship with Dr. Ido and Alita which reminded of me and my dad because he too doesn't want me to be in danger. And the fact he learns to accept her into being who she is; really good.The world building is visually stunning, breathtaking, and shows the stark contrast between the two worlds especially when you get an insight on what happened before the events of the movie. The CGI was almost realistic in some scenes but it never pulled me away from the story so kudos to the CGI team. The choreography fitting into the fight scenes made me jump wanting Alita to win even though she might be at a disadvantage but her strong courage and sense of never give up for whats right made me love her more. The villains were proven to be a threat though not as much for the main villain Nova cuz he watched from above the skyscraper city and each character has a very unique designs. Also I really love the Motor Ball scene, would love to see like an amusement park for it but then again I'm bad at rollerskating.I'm still sad about the dog scene even though they never showed it explicitly.Overall, this is the first in a very long time I found a female lead relatable and realistic; a role model to me since probably Terminator and Alien.I'm very glad I got a chance to watch this movie. I even brought my dad and brother to watch it with me and they also enjoyed it. Definitely recommending this to my friends.",Alita - Battle Angel

1978,msfightera,It's Really An Action Packed Origin Story,8,10 April 2019,"When going in to watch this movie you gotta be going in prepared for anime like dialogue. It was clear that the dialogue was going to move a little differently than the average American action packed movie. Due to expecting that, I was unbothered by some of the dialogue issues.The only the thing that really annoyed was the romance, it was really painful to watch. It was just a little all over the place and felt like yeah there was some feelings but didn't seem to play them up enough but yet they still jumped forward with the relationship. Maybe in a way it showed Alita's Naive mindset. Still I could of gone without.Now to the parts that really made me say it's a must watch. First it's visuals! My god the amount of detail they had in show and how the movement with cybernetics on the characters were was amazing. They put so much effort in even the detail of just background characters cybernetics. It felt super immersive.The action scenes were amazing and exciting. The amount of movement they were able to capture with such detail was astonishing. I liked how there was action but it didn't feel like they were filling the screen with chaos.The character building was good only for the main character. The doctor and Alita story was filled in well. With Alita still having some holes due to the show being left as a to be continued ending. Such as the actual bad guy still being overly unknown. Alita's personality was an interesting mix. While she seemed mostly very friendly and naive on the surface she had quite a strong, determined and capable personality. Which was shown through her action. And it was kind of nice having a character that wasn't the cliche hardass through and through. Due to things happening at the end of the movie though I expect a personality change in the second movie (if there is one).Overall I'd say it's a must watch and that I enjoyed it enough to consider purchasing the manga it's based off of.",Alita - Battle Angel
1979,VB15331,So awesome that I wanted to stand up and cheer for Alita,9,24 February 2019,"I watched Alita: Battle Angel at a local cineplex in 2D.I am not familiar with the source material that the movie is based on, having neither read the manga nor watched the anime. However, after watching the movie, I have become a huge fan!The 25th century world portrait was very realistic, and there were many details which begs a second viewing. The fight scenes and the Motorball competition were so well done that they gave me goosebumps and got my heart racing. I haven't felt that way at a movie for a long time.However, the movie wasn't all action, there were gentle moments that reminds us that Alita has the heart of a girl, who is making sense of her place in this world.Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, it is the best movie I've watched since Blade Runner 2049. It is a movie best to be enjoyed at the cinemas, and I wish I had watched it at IMAX.... maybe I will.",Alita - Battle Angel
1980,PierreClement,A good movie,7,11 February 2019,"Alita is well tied up with an easily accessible universe that doesn't waste any time since in ten minutes, everything seems to be set up. Alita, carried by the enthusiastic Rosa Salazar (American Horror Story, Divergent), is immediately endearing. Forget the Japanese references and dive into a kind of high-tech favelas directly from Rodriguez's memories and origins. Christopher Waltz (Inglorious Basterds) plays a good man, which is rare and he does quite well with a background role. But less than his assistant who only has two lines of dialogue.The script is also easy to access, the roughness is rather absent and the plot seems really free of anything that could blur the narrative. The result is a fairly diffuse threat and a story that never really takes off because the suspense and tension are not very present. Everything seems really touched and, strangely enough, it's rather pleasant, nothing is boring. Romance, emotion, action are well enough balanced so that the film does not tend towards ridicule, bully or déjà vu. And yet, with motorball, this robotized rollerball, there was enough to make kitsch...The kitsch is present but assumed and perfectly integrated into the universe. There is a real carnal dimension, the place of the body in technology denotes with the smooth aspect of current productions. The emaciated bodies, the technological appendages are integrated with a disconcerting simplicity. The universe is imposing itself and it feels pretty good. The music is absolutely disastrous, multiplying the clichés of the genre. Junkie XL was not inspired. No composition stays in mind and adds anything new. On the contrary. Rogriguez's work is rather wise on the imagination side and insolent on the gimmicks side, with slow-motion or semi-iconic shots already seen.It remains to be seen whether the flim will not flop again. With this habit of making a film as a ""first film"" of a future franchise, the ideas that scatter the film frustrate the viewer. The lack of development of certain things is obvious.",Alita - Battle Angel
1981,liamb-52223,Best Adaption Ever.,10,9 February 2019,"Honestly reading the original i was a little hesitant when going into the film considering the art style of the original works and the history of adaptions *looking at you netflix*, but after just finishing the film from an early screening i am very glad i did watch it. The graphics is simply stunning i cannot even begin to where one would start when creating something like this. The story is a mix of the first couple books and i honestly think it is incredibly well done considering how much they crammed into this film, the story simply keeps on being interesting i can say without a doubt this is probably one of the few if not only film i was interested this year in seeing this year and i must say they did amazing work.I hope they do a squeal they captured the original story and adapted it incredibly well for a movie, honestly compared to almost every other adaptation of anime/manga and even a lot of books into films, i can honestly say out of all those ive seen Alita Battle Angel is the best ive ever seen done. They captured her character really well done with their cast, and the others are also well done.The Action is simply stunning a honest fresh breath when it comes to most action films with the exception of perhaps the John Wick series, the constant action sequences doesn't get boring nor do they disappoint or drift from the story as in many other films. Instead they use the action and story telling to deliver viewers deeper into Alita's back story and who she was and is now.I still cannot stress how well they adapted this from the original work, the first 1-17 chapters or 3 ""books"" are all mixed into one film that somehow captures the core of the original although some sections are missing honestly i think they are welcome editions being cut out as the original is quite old and some parts dont translate well into modern cinematography.I dont know what the ""Critics"" were smoking giving this film a bad review, the love story section has its moments and is a bit of a cringe at times but that is who Alita is and that is one aspect of her Character they kept and it is also an aspect that helps shape her into herself as she develops further into the story.Directing, Cast. Action, Story, All these were combined perfectly for this film never being boring never straying far from the climax of the film nor is it over the top.I look forward to the Sequel if its coming and i hope the film does well also sorry for the mess of these paragraphs im tired and just so excited about the film, i even made this account simply so i could Review this.",Alita - Battle Angel

No. Does that detract from it's absolutely stunning visuals, epic choreography, awesome acting and voicing by Rosa Salazar (actress of Alita)?...NO!!!The supporting cast aren't perfect, the writing is flawed at times... but the film accomplishes what it sets out to do, and that is to make a visually stunning narrative of a girl who transforms into something beautiful and powerful and absolutely badass, and it does that VERY well.Do yourself a favour, grab your popcorn, psyche yourself up for an awesome, beautiful action film with a very enjoyable Main Character, and go catch it in the cinema!",Alita - Battle Angel
1983,keaglez,"Visual spectacle, great adaptation",9,10 February 2019,"After watching the movie, it gives me a longing feeling to know more about Alita and her original story in manga form. So I went and read all the first 4 volumes of the manga (and continued on) that supposed to be the source material for this movie.I think it has been said over and over, but Alita visual is so amazing that I had to repeat it as well. Beautiful recreation of the town, Alita CG is so lifelike that it creates this sensation of her being right there and the action sequence is done very well. What even better is the 3D effect is easy to the eyes, I don't leave the theatre with headache that I sometime get with other movie. Eye candy indeed.Story-wise, this combine the events happening in manga in non-chronological order. The manga have multiple arcs that happens one after the other, while the movie put them in parallel. For example, the Kansas Bar fight scene in manga happens with only Alita and Doc, without Hugo in sight as he hasn't been introduced into the story yet. Some scenes recreated from the manga is also happening a bit differently.That said, the movie still successfully combine all these scenes pretty well without it feeling out of place. In a way, this improve the story-telling and avoid the episodic nature of the manga. While the Motorball scenes is completely different, both in motivation and the event, I hope this is something they can address in the sequel (if there ever been one) as the timeskip give the opportunity to recreate a lot of missing Motorball sequences from volume 3 and 4.Overall, I think this is a great adaptation. What strikes me as cheesy in the love story between Hugo and Alita, is actually quite faithful to the naive Alita in manga (except not as romantic). Something that isn't explored well is actually the villains, which has plenty of back story that is almost completely missing. I would happily give this 10/10 if only this part take a bit more attention.I'm going to watch Alita again soon, and I hope, the sequel will be made.",Alita - Battle Angel
1984,raakyaz,Not good as in my dreams. This movie was has more potential.,8,28 February 2019,"Movie was exacting and emotional. But emotion not touches to us, not enoughly.",Alita - Battle Angel
1985,battleangelmusic,Positively surprised as a fan,10,11 February 2019,"I was a bit skeptical about this movie. I was worried that it can end up as another 'college drama' with sci-fi background, typical product from Hollywood. But it's not!
My impression was that this movie was divided between day time scenes made by Cameron and night time scenes made by Rodriguez which together gives a nice mixture of two goods. I was surprised that they put so much in such short time and it does not make me feel like I don't know what's going on. I know Manga which helps a bit but there's a lot of small changes that have impact on the story and I'm pretty sure that even people who don't know source material will follow the story without any problem.
Despite that there's a lot of small changes in the story it was done pretty well. Usually changes from original material are weak and sometimes even so radical that movie is an insult to original source. But here I enjoyed all of them because all changes were made with a taste and with a respect to the original manga.
So I'm pretty sure that all or most fans of GUNNM will be satisfied as this is one of rare movie interpretations done well and are not an insult to a fan.
For those scared about 13 (12A) rating: there's nothing to fear. Like Rodriguez said, you just have to change 'human' to 'cyborg' and you are free to do a lot more in the movie than current rating allows to. Of course it's not a slasher or horror with blood everywhere but it's not what this movie or manga is about in the first place.
Visually movie is stunning but it's not a something that I care that much so beside that it satisfied my eyes I leave written review about it to others who may have more to say.
I would love to see a sequel or even more movies from Cameron/Rodriguez duo in GUNNM universe.
I'm giving 10/10 but I don't belong to people who focus on finding every single trivial issue to complain about. Life is too short to do that. I walked satisfied from the cinema, nothing makes me feel bad about the movie and it's what is the most important for me to give a score to the movie.",Alita - Battle Angel
1986,woodsie-26782,One that MUST be seen on the big screen in glorioius 3D!,9,12 February 2019,"Once in a generation a film comes along that breaks the mould. 'The Wizard of Oz', 'Star Wars' and 'Bladerunner' are films that are still fresh 30 years later and If I know anything about film, this will go down as one of the most inspirational films in cinema history.
I am baffled to see critcs giving this film mediocre scores? But you only have to look at the early reviews for 'Star Wars' in 1977 to see that they can get it seriously wrong. 'The Shawshank redemption' was a turkey at the cinema and is now in many top 10 lists. So I'm telling anyone who loves going to the cinema to see this while it's still in the theatres.",Alita - Battle Angel
1987,logiccat,Meta scores are too criticizing on the contents of the movie,9,12 February 2019,You won't left dissapointing on what the film delivers to you. Don't just base on the meta score to judge the willingness of yourself. 'How to train your dragon 3' is way flop if you expect the genre of the film are action and thrilling,Alita - Battle Angel
1988,jesuiledemoisne,I liked it - fierce and new,9,12 February 2019,"Arguably the only slightly weak part of the film is the last 10 minutes or so. In my view there is a slight lack of plot cohesion and would go as far as saying it spoils the momentum. Probably a result of setting the end up for a sequal.Having said this the prospect of no sequal fills me with sadness. This was my sort of movie.The action was exhilarating, the plot rich, filled with pace and touching moments. In terms of world setting it includes a mysterious history and a vibrant cyberpunk, dystopian world.
I will concede there is some vomit worthy cliches and as i say above a strange strange end that seems to lose its way a bit. I just hope that it's not abandoned.We need new stuff like this that is new and dynamic.",Alita - Battle Angel
1989,The-honest-critic,Astonishing,9,13 February 2019,"I'll be honest, when I went into to cinema to watch this movie I was expecting to not like it. I had seen a little bit of the trailer and it did not really ""speak"" to me and Alita's eyes were off putting. When the movie had begun I was actually searching for things to dislike but surprisingly there were none apart from a few cringeworthy moments. I quickly got used to Alita's eyes and they became in fact likeable. The story began to draw me in and I got completely absorbed into the story and the visuals.The world is extraordinary and beautiful and the action scenes in this movie are fantastic, quite honestly some of the best I have seen. The story is a bit fast paced but not to a degree that it feels rushed. Alita as a character is great, she is kind-hearted, innocent, naive and protective. Throughout the movie Alita grows as a person and learns about sacrifice, loss, love and the horrors of the human mind. Alita is very likeable because she is such a good person in such a horrible world and you can't help feeling very sympathetic for an innocent being like her as she is exposed to the cruel world of Iron City.I watched this movie without knowing the source material and I loved it. I was drawn in very early on and had to watch it a second time. I can definitely recommend this movie to anyone.",Alita - Battle Angel
1990,saurabhtupe-68402,One of the Best CGI Movies,10,13 February 2019,Movie was just phenomenal 😍. Loved it from start to end. The movie was so engaging that you won't get bored even for a second. Eagerly waiting for a sequel. Please do make it.,Alita - Battle Angel

1993,alexmannwee,Best manga adaptation to date,10,14 February 2019,"Action sequences were delectable, character motivations were believable and well developed rationales were followed through and through throughout the experience. Couldn't have asked for more from the creators behind this, the purpose of the film never left focus, a quality lacking in many a flick these days. Hadn't yet viewed the source material but I'm more than interested after witnessing such a spectacle!",Alita - Battle Angel
1994,andrewquaza,They've cracked the code,10,15 February 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel is the first ever anime adaptation that works, and its flawless. It stays true to the source material and does the original characters and themes of the manga justice. Rosa Salizars (Alita) is some of the best acting I have seen, the facial performance and overall dynamics will leave you wanting more time with her. Genuine and fresh as well as an inspiration for many of the movies you see today, waiting for the technology to be created for this movie was completely worth it. An ambitious technological marvel that will impress you every time you watch it.",Alita - Battle Angel
1995,andrewquaza,Critic reviews?,10,18 February 2019,"Simply go down the list of the audience reviews here and anywhere else, you can clearly tell the critics are crucially out of touch with the audience.

1996,fgj-34736,Good to see Mahershala Ali and Christoph Waltz,8,15 February 2019,This was a really entertaining movie but it will never be as good Titanic or Avatar.

1997,sixoversix,New to the story? Or think the script is poorly written?,9,11 March 2019,"Search YouTube for Battle Angel Anime. Since it's unlikey many will get a hold of the manga form - watch the YouTube movie (full dub or sub audio options available) - then see how good the movie is by comparison.Overall the movie kept the key parts intact but modified things where it would make more sense - the anime is a hot mess of a script. But most Anime is. Love or hate it for what it is. But this movie is a fantastic adaptation, probably best live action adaptation to a Manga to date - the visuals are so worth the watch alone. Sit back and just enjoy a movie.",Alita - Battle Angel
1998,ilhaq,Alita Is Amazing,10,23 February 2019,Execellent story and movie! Characters are enduring and engaging. Never a dull moment. Character developments were great. Superb CG effects. Much better than any Marvel franchises which are so generic! Must see! Love it!. The human side of the story is what gravitates me and I love it to death the big crystal eyes CGI done right,Alita - Battle Angel
1999,ilhaq,Alita Is Amazing,10,23 February 2019,"With 3 Oscar winning actors/actress and with a director name as big as James Cameron, you wondered what is wrong with all the Critics? Yes, I wondered. So I went and watched it for myself in Hong Kong on Feb-4th 9:40am 3D IMAX showing; I'm from Los Angeles, CA on vacation. The movie delivers, on so many levels where do I begin? First, I love the continuity and the flow of the story from the first second of the opening sequence. There are just enough element and focus on each character to push the story forward and you actually care about Alita, which is where Marvel shines and DC failed; but DC have recently learned with Wonder Woman and Aquaman and their box office numbers reflected those lessons. The 3D was filmed in such a way to only use it when necessary to highlight depth and does not create nausea for even the most sensitive audiences during action sequences - super big plus on that aspect. If anyone doubt James Cameron has a hand in this movie's directing, this alone should put any doubts to rest; Alita is an improvement on top of what Avatar did for its cinematography. Some critics made comments on Alita not caring for where she comes from, I would like to dispute that here. She emphatically on many levels and many parts of the movie wanting to look back toward her past - I believe the movie made enough effort on this. I feel its balanced, any more would have been annoying and I would even tell Alita myself, focus on your present and the future. Musical scores is a 10 in my opinion, the same group that did Mad Max, powerful, spot on",Alita - Battle Angel
2000,crisplacenciat,Great proposal,10,10 May 2019,"Alita contains some errors in the script, but by virtue of his cinematographic proposal, performances (Rosa is incredible), the emotional and functional soundtrack and special effects show that there is still hope of finding a movie that enchants, catches you and you end up asking for more. It is a great movie that shows concern and love for the story. In this many directors should take note of Robert Rodriguez.",Alita - Battle Angel
2001,master_champion,James Cameron never let's you down,10,18 February 2019,"There has been a long list of reasons why this movie may fail (bad previous manga adaptations, usage of cgi, etc), I went into this movie with alot of skepticism. However, it was more than I expected. You would think I should learn to appreciate the cinematic works of James Cameron by now, as many of his movies stand as some of my favorites. The only thing disappointing about the movie is that it never really ends, therefore I hope they do make a sequel. Christoph Waltz does an amazing job as an actor. I am deeply sold on his father-daughter relationship with Rosa Salazar's Alita. Rosa and Christoph does such a fantastic job, they deserve more praise. I would highly recommend watching it!",Alita - Battle Angel

It was Avatar back in 2009. I just wanted to live that experience of watching something phenomenal for more than once. Alita: Battle Angel is the second movie in my life that I've watched on the big screen more then once. Highly recommended if you have a bit of imagination and the ease to feel emotions from that kind of Sci-Fi. Everything was already said in the users reviews about the movie. This is the best movie experience that I can imagine for myself or maybe it's just the genius of James Cameron.

2005,cy-63605,One of the best dystopian sci-fi action spectacle films ever,9,21 February 2019,"I loved so much about this movie. I had not read the original comics, or watched the anime going in, so I couldn't comment on how good an adaptation it is, but to me the pacing was great and nothing felt rushed or crammed in story-wise, nor was I ever at a loss to understand what was going on, despite the world and story being so rich and layered. I personally think it had a fantastic story and although some of the tertiary characters were thinly sketched out, the important ones were full and engaging, none more-so than the eponymous lead. If I had to point out faults, I'd acknowledge that some of the dialogue and acting is cheesy, but I genuinely can't understand why people are saying it lacks in the story department or that it was just hollow spectacle; I personally found it emotionally engaging to a degree I can only compare to the films of Pixar. I actually have a theory that a lot of people are incapable of paying attention to story when it's wrapped in over-the-top spectacle like this, so it's not that the story was lacking, but that the bombast of it all merely distracted them from seeing what else was there. For my money this is hands down Robert Rodriguez' best film by an epic margin, and it's exactly the kind of spectacle I've come to expect form James Cameron. If you like effects driven blockbusters with likeable characters, breathtaking action, and enough heart to power a city, do yourself (and this amazing film's chances for a sequel) a favour and go see it in the theatre while it's still playing!",Alita - Battle Angel

2009,cvijandenis,Fantastic message (if I saw it clearly),8,11 March 2019,"Jump down for the main message if you're not interested in my silly ramblings:)Although I didn't think much of this movie at first, the low expectation made me see it in a more true light. I'm not going to lie. I jumped to see it more for the political reasons (what I can now see are pretty stupid), than the actual movie going ones and since I haven't been in the movies for as long as The Last Jedi came out, I decided to go. The Last Jedi was an utter disappointment and people who were around me at the time, were clearly disinterested. I had to re-evaluate my movie knowledge and go when I see something worthy of cinema viewing. Because for us regular folk, the ticket prices are a bit to pricey to dive in on an every new blockbuster or an interesting piece of world cinema.
So I was there and stood in awe of amazing action sequences which were masterfully choreographed and directed. Some shots were dull and basic but others which included cityscape and the girl discovering something new, were amazing. The humour was kinda funny at times and you could feel the relaxed tone of the movie even though it had some pretty gruesome stuff, which btw
I enjoyed very much:).
I have a feeling like this is the first successful live action manga/anime adaptation which could very well be the same if it was a video game.
Some things that bother me which I shall not include in too many details are pretty much revolved around jumping a bit to fast into the story's main clash.
I wouldn't have minded if it was an hour longer, just for the plot development.
Others were some of the poorly written characters, which Alita sure wasn't, two major logic flaws that could have significantly altered the course of the plot (there were three, try to find them:) - one of them not so important but it was hilarious, and those were just the ones that I noticed)The positive message that I could see, only after exiting the theater is that
Alita reminded us that we must be who we
really are in order to achieve greatness.
And that is a fighter, not a victim.
Albeit we need a teacher to direct our energy
in something positive.I personally think this is a great message for us people and especially children who need motivation and a reasonable and patient person to guide them into adulthood.
To conclude this review, the movie was so much fun, which is what matters the most, and I had a lovely time, even by myself. You should definitely check it out if you enjoy action, sci-fi, or previous works of Rodriguez or Cameron.",Alita - Battle Angel
2010,valenotari,Great Adaptation,9,26 February 2019,"As a fan of the original manga, Alita was a mindblowing, marvelous journey through my teenage years. The design is great, the visuals are worthy of a James Cameron-produced movie and the story is captivating and well constructed.

I truly hope this movie gets the sequel it deserves and needs to complete the story. Whether it needs 1 or 2 is unclear. I don't think everything needs a trilogy. But this one definitely needs to be seen to the end.

The storyline was dull at best and the script seemed like it was written by an autistic 13 year old.

The character also of ALITA is so lovely and passionate in addition to the great acting and performance by the movie staff.

My views has changed completely.She has shown character and positivity of a example that all of us should follow. By being absolutely fearless in the present obstacles. Overcoming and outperform. To fight situations when no one dare-ed and when it seems unfavorable. To speak when no one have the courage to do so.The romance is cringy but overall I absolutely love this film.

The action was solid, the story interesting but simple. The cgi was not ground breaking but it was done well. If I had to give it one negative its that you don't have enough time to take in all the sights n wonders. But that just makes it worth watching a couple more times I guess.",Alita - Battle Angel
2031,fernandez-19539,Very emotional movie,10,28 March 2019,For me the plot has many holes and they tried to rush a little bit the script.

.....and raw...and I liked it.
That's something you dont get to see in these kinds movies anymore.2 hours well spent.I hope they get to make another movie. As it is Hollywood wants a lot of profits to actually make a sequel these days....and I hope alita makes it to part 2.All I have to say is Alita is really a battle angel and she is all that she says she is....I like her.She made me tear up....",Alita - Battle Angel

2038,malimarek,This is why Alita is terrible movie and I like Avatar. (spoilers inside!!!!),3,30 July 2019,"This movie is the one long commercial, full of copy and paste clichés from Robocop, Transformers, Rollerball, StarWars (Luke's artificial hand), Elysium etc.Despite it is based on manga comic books, Cameron and Rodriguez managed impossible - destroyed the plot, destroyed overall feeling of the original story - all due to create money stream from this movie and from planed sequels (cliffhanger at the end is so lame and obvious). Screenplay is brazening and it is nothing but ready prescription to manufacture action figures with individual characters, and there is so many different weirdness which is more than enough for dolls, that kids will try collect all of them breaking parents' wallets. Actors performance varies but they try hard and generally deliver. Teenagers dialog lines are completely inadequate to the movie atmosphere, villains' lines are so tough and scary (irony here) that it hurt listening to it. The producers could not decide if it was kids' movie or PG13/R as there is one swear word. I wonder if there is the footage of Grewishka killing dog existing and it will come out with director's cut release. That movie could be great if the director and screenwriter learned of changing times in acting, plots, script construction and watched The Wire for inspiration or their own movies. There are Netflix and others for reference too.

2040,jalalbakirov,It is what it is supposed to be,10,13 July 2019,"Let me be honest. I would actually rate this movie 8/10 if I was totally unbiased. I gave it 10 simply to balance all the negativity surrounding this amazing movie.Just like the title says, this movie is what it is supposed to be. It wasn't made with a goal to win Academy Award for best screenplay. It is typical story for some of the best shonen and mecha anime, with main character trying to understand themselves and their unusual strength. There was a moment in this film that took me through the same feelings that I had when I saw Goku's first Super Saiyan transformation.Attachment of James Cameron as a producer to this movies was originally supposed to boost it but eventually was a disservice. Because when you have a guy of such influence credited for the movie, everyone expects a potential Oscar nominee and that's not something this movie was trying to be.",Alita - Battle Angel

I went to see it 10 times at the cinema. I can't wait to go and watch it again. I made an imdb account especially for this first review I have made. It is by far my favourite movie after a long time and I will remember it for time to come. I can't wait to watch more of James Cameron's movies. :D,Alita - Battle Angel
2043,romomulas,"An angel of redemption, even more than battle",10,10 March 2019,"The critics we hear about Alita mostly revolve around two points: a supposedly overly-simple or badly written script, and ""confusing"" plot and setting, that are allegedly not understandable unless you research the source material before watching the movie.
About the script: it is simple, but because most of the characters are ""simple"". The point is exactly that the movie portrays simple people. In the best sense of the word ""simple"". This is a feature, not a bug. Not every character has to be complex and multifaceted. A huge tragedy in one's life will make for a rather ""bi-dimensional"" personality, and again, that's just human condition. Which the movie portrays excellently, exactly because it shows flawed people, defined by traumas and ambitions like so many of us. If anything, it might be that in the movie there's a bit of an unrealistic concentration of these stories, but then again, that's also by design. The setting is the equivalent of a slump, where people struggle, yet try to have fun, to do the right thing, and to dream, exactly like in real slums. So again, dialogues are simple by design. You can't add sophistication where there should be none.
This is my critic of the first critic.
About the second, I'll be brief: it just speaks very bad of the critics who had a hard time understanding. Because in the first few mute scenes of the movie, I understood the whole setting, and the background info that I needed, without knowing absolutely anything about the source material. So I'd like to meet those reviewers, and understand if they were really not understanding, or they were just not being honest with their reviews. The latter possibility scares me, and I don't even want to know why there would be this kind of response from the ""official"" critic world.
Now on to my review of what's good. And I don't want to touch the visuals, because this is of course a first rate production, and everything looks (and sounds) amazing. The big question mark for me, going to watch the movie, was: ""What will make the movie, and its protagonist, special?"" Turns out it's REDEMPTION. But on a scale I haven't experienced before in any other movie, possibly in any other story.
Alita, is a ""lead by example"" role model not found in any Disney Princess, reminding if anyone at all maybe Myiazaki's ""Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind"". Through her sheer, simple, passionate, but not flawless approach to just about everything, she inspires and heals people around her at many different scales. From small, to soul-saving. She falls in love in the most simple way, and it's so refreshing... Finally a strong, extremely powerful character that is not scared of giving her heart (literally) to a random person that she just likes. Her simplicity is disarming, again literally. I HAVE seen people having this effect in real life, but very rarely. And I never saw this before in movies. I guess it's deemed too... What? Sweet? Clichè? I don't know. In my opinion, she makes people cringe just like Jesus made people cringe in his life-time: by just loving and being uncompromising to a fault.
She's the hero that we don't deserve, but that finds us deserving anyway.
Similarly, this is the movie that we didn't deserve, but we got to enjoy anyway.
Moving. Freaking moving.",Alita - Battle Angel

Every time I sat down to watch Alita I was captivated by the mysterious nature of Zalem. I was blown away by the world building and character arcs. The motorball scenes took my breath away.

I felt with her like it was my own daughter. What a likeable person, discovering and enjoying the simple things at life like eating a orange or chocolate. The movie take you by the hand and directs you through a very emotionaly rollercoaster drive.Alitas development from a innocent girl to a strong hero fighting against the evil is such an intense experience. This is my favorite movie for now, I like it better than avatar. I also bought the manga to know more about this fantastic world. 3D blu-ray will be bought as soon as it hits the market.

You instantly fall in love with this character. The action is the best I've ever seen. The CGI is amazing. You forget Alita played by Rosa Salazar is not real.

I want sequel and prequel,Alita - Battle Angel
2067,sontzx,Not just another action movie,9,31 March 2019,"The fans of Alita: Battle Angel love this hero. They love spending time with her. They long for a sequel--passionately. I haven't seen this kind of emotional attachment to a hero since the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.This is dfferent from other action movies. I liked The Avengers. I thoroughly enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy. I even liked Ghost in the Shell. The 5th Element was a lot of fun. Blade Runner 2049 was pretty good. Arrival was fascinating and provocative. Gravity and The Martian were enjoyable (less so after I started thinking about them though).But for me and most other Alita fans, Alita made me care about her. The other movies were over when they were over. I left Alita wanting to spend more time with her. Not just wanting a sequel. I just wanted to experience more of her life. I'd love to see a prequel or a ""sidequel"" too.Look at all the reviews on Amazon and you'll see this sense of involvment. Involvement that goes well beyond the storyline.All big budget Hollywood movies have at least one thing in common: they need substantial international sales to turn a profit. This in turn means the story has to be easily to grasp by audiences in Shanghai and Osaka as much as in LA or London.You can add subtleties but they can't intefere with the storyline. Alita: Battle Angel is no exception to this. It's based on a manga/anime series I'd never heard of, though I have seen a lot of anime and know something about Japanese culture. And I've read and seen a lot of sci-fi. Ditto my spouse. So while some reviewers seemed to be a little confused about some things, we weren't. You don't need to know the manga.What you do need, though, is the ability to relate to a human who ""isn't compeletely human,"" as she says herself. And I believe the bad-to-indifferent reviews mostly come from people who can't relate to a person who's a ""full replacement cyborg."" Meaning the only originally human part of Alita is her brain. Her body is machinery. Her face is synthetic. (So her big eyes are just milspec--military requirements for low light sensitivity. If she had ""anime eyes"" so would the other residents of Iron City, and they don't.)Moreover, her body is, for the first time in any movie ever, unmistakably artificial. In Ghost in the Shell. the Major is another full replacement cyborg, but what you see is Scarlett Johannson's curvy body in a skinsuit. With Alita, even though she's played by the very human Rosa Salazar, they use motion capture technology to mate Salazar's actions with an artificial body that couldn't contain a human being, despite being humanoid overall.The bad reviews complain about aspects of the movie--like the simple storyline--that are no different from movies they do like. I don't think these reviewers are lying consciously, but I think they do viscerally reject Alita as someone they can relate to. My spouse and I only needed, like, half a second to adapt to her big eyes and robotic body. But we're both seasones sci-fi fans, and have dealt with tech stuff most of our working lives.The Alita Rejecters sometimes talk about her creeping them out, or finding her eyes ""weird"" or stuff like that, but more often they don't mention is Uncanny Valley problem--they just badmouth the film for reasons that don't reveal them as xenophobes.There is a subset of anti-Alita reviewers who reject her for ideological reasons. When professional movie critics do this it's a dereliction of their professional integrity, because their job is to review films as films, not by whether they support or detract from the reviewers' politics. That doesn't stop them though.These negative reviewers reject her on ostensibly feminist grounds. Alita fans find this jaw-droppingly preposterous. For us, if there ever was a female hero role model it's Alita. But she's decidedly feminine, despite her metal body. She isn't androgynous. (Remember street crowds in Mao's China. dressed in shapeless unisex outfits? Apparently that's the ideal we should long for.) Alita loves a boy in the heedless, headlong way an innocent schoolgirl might feel towards her first love. She loves her surrogate father. Worse yet, at one point she's rescued from being killed by these two men and another man. Sometimes she's rash, makes mistakes, misjudges others. That is, she has all too human weaknesses she has to grow through.These things appear to offend those who demand a female hero to have no flaws, no inner struggles (Rey in Last Jedi for example), and to be as asexual as a sea anemone. And not ""cute."" That's submitting to the patriarchy? One particularly offensive reviewer talked about Alita's robotic body as looking like a ""sex doll."" Meaning her body has a female shape instead of looking like a Dalek. I got the impression this reviewer is one of those people who didn't win the genetic lottery looks-wise, and thus requires all attractive women to not be attractive, so their looks won't make most of us feel bad. Back to Mao's China. Or the Taliban. Your choice.The sex in Alita comprises two (2) kisses--and a boy touches her metal arm. Woo hoo. Well, and she rides behind her boyfriend on his motorcycle with her robot arms wrapped around him. The horror.Remember I said all of these big budget Hollywood films have leave out the storyline subtleties, for that international audience. Because something that means A in one culture can mean B in another. I remember reading that years ago Asian audiences watching one Hollywood blockbuster assumed the hero was the villain because he talked back to his parents.But other subtleties are available, and Alita exploits the best one: the human face. Credit goes equally to Rosa Salazar and the Weta team for accomplishing this. She shot the whole film wearing a dot-covered skinsuit and a helmet to which was attached two 4K cameras aimed at her face, on a titanium boom.If you watch Avatar now--which was state of the art them--the alien characters look cartoonish by the standards Alita has now set. You can see every single pore on her face (somewhat to Salazar's distress), every nuance of human expression.That's what gets Alita past the Uncanny Valley for her fans. The robot body and the big eyes are alien, and they never aren't. But her movements and expressions are so completely human, that the film's fans become immersed in her journey and wouldn't have her look any other way.Are you that kind of person, or are you the kind who would be so creeped out by her differentness that you viscerally reject her story? Only you can answer that, but if you can boldly step over this a big payoff awaits you.Look at the snippy, disdainful faux reviews of many of the critics, and then look at the delighted, immersed reviews of the fans, and ask yourself which kind of person would you rather be?",Alita - Battle Angel

As Alita finds herself and her place in the world, she discovers pieces of her past and we watch the Angel go from naive to fierce in an epic manga adaptation brought to us by James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez.",Alita - Battle Angel
2070,krispostajian,Why Alita Battle Angel is one of the Greatest Films of the Decade,10,2 May 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel does something that is so uncommon and to a degree, rare. James Cameron, Robert Rodriguez, and Jon Landau have brought to the big screen one of the most incredible movies to date. Based off of Yukito Kishiro's manga, Battle Angel Alita, Cameron has helped bring this character to life-and there's more to this girl than her big eyes.
To begin, the story for Alita is rather a nice breath of fresh air from the movies that have been releasing lately. Set in a dystopian future world, Alita already makes our minds go wild thinking about how life would be in this world at the year 2563. The plot does a great job blending a coming-of-age story and one of amnesia. Alita herself already becomes lovable as she turns from innocent to full-blown warrior, but all of her amazing expressions and actions are played by the wonderfully talented Rosa Salazar. Another part of the story that should get more attention is how much of a beautiful relationship Alita has with her father figure, Ido, who is expertly played by Christoph Waltz. One of the biggest achievements of this movie is the fantastic visuals that really pull you into the film where Alita-who you know is a cyborg-looks completely human, and gets to a point where you forget she is computer generated. You can really appreciate the work WETA digital has done with the motion capture technology.
The action in the movie is brilliantly choreographed, with excellent cinematography coupled with a strong soundtrack. The music and the story go hand in hand in delivering an emotional ride, and one that has you cheering for Alita when she is winning and feeling sad for her when she cries. One of the most iconic sections of the movie is the deadly sport of Motorball (which, on its own, deserves a movie because of how gritty and epic it is), that is once again coupled with a soundtrack to really hype the audience up. The action of the movie is also paced at a good rate as there are nice breaks in between action scenes that help fill in the gaps of questions, or just help set up the next scene.The love story in this film becomes one that I thought seemed very appropriate. Since Alita: Battle Angel takes parts from the first 3 volumes of the manga, naturally the director had a time crunch on what to add and what to drop. What followed is a nice blend of sections of the love story from those first 3 volumes. It is implied that days and weeks go by over the course of the movie; so it's understood that Alita spent more time with Hugo before really falling in love with him than we get to see on screen. The love story is one of the best parts of the movie to show how great of a character Alita actually is, and it makes you care for her more since it's another section of the film that helps you get attached to her.The film is an absolute emotional roller coaster that makes you love and hate some characters, but ultimately get attached to them and love their performances. The only drawback to the movie is that the action scenes tend to be a bit on the short side but the quality of them really steps into the light as you see how impactful and important every scene really is. Finally, I wanted to mention the powerful good messages this movie puts forth that many other movies should do. Alita inspires us to find our inner confidence and strength to have the courage to fight or speak for what's right. This shows that Alita is not just a character that females can relate to, but people of both genders, where one audience is not alienated. Alita: Battle Angel truly stands as a hallmark film that will stand the test of time due to how unique it is, and because of the fan base it has built to passionately support and defend it.",Alita - Battle Angel
2071,keiichi-73946,An action movie with heart!,9,29 April 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel is a touching story about a young amnesiac cyborg girl found in a scrap heap and her journey as she struggles to discover who she was, who she wants to be, and who is secretly pulling her strings. Dialog is sometimes corny and the story isn't perfect, but there are several incredibly well-done action sequences sprinkled throughout and the main character will absolutely capture your heart. The CG work by WETA is the new industry bar to top, and the passion of the cast and crew in bringing this IP to life is evident.Worth a watch whether you're a diehard fan of the source material or know nothing about it and just think a sci-fi action movie with cyborg fights and a dash of youthful romance sounds like a good time.Avoid if you're looking for a highbrow artsy film exploring existential questions of what it means to be human, as that isn't what this story is about.",Alita - Battle Angel
2072,cyynister,Manga come to life,9,1 April 2019,"As a fan of the manga for Battle Angel: Alita, I was both excited and a little worried to see this movie. Thankfully, any trepidation was unwarranted.
The world building is very well executed. Scarp Iron City is well actualized. I really felt like they had brought the scrap yard to life. There is plenty of emotion and story to connect to. The VFX's are second to none. The action is breath taking. Panzar Kunst in truly brought to life. You have to see this movie on the big screen, if only for the Motorball scenes.
However the heart and soul of this movie is Rosa Salazar. Her performance makes this movie. That is no small thing when sharing the screen with the likes of Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly and Mahershala Ali, just to name a few, but shine she does. Rosa's performance grabs you and takes you on this incredible journey.
The movie follows the source material very well, reproducing some great scenes from the manga itself.
This is a movies you will want to see many times, I certainly have.",Alita - Battle Angel

2074,nathandetroit-19250,Emotional and gripping Anime adaptation,10,2 April 2019,"As a fan of Yukito Kishiro's Gunnm manga, and the 1993 OVA, I was blown away by this adaptation by James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez. The crowning achievement of the film is undoubtedly Alita herself, who has been brought to life beautifully by Rosa Salazar and WETA Digital (Salazar deserves at least an Oscar nomination for her performance). Rosa's ability to convey subtle emotion through her face and body language immediately endears you to her and compels you to go with her into the foreign, dystopian world she awakens in. The cast overall is fantastic and perfectly fit their roles. The visuals are spectacular, the action is inventive, Junkie XL's score is great, and more than anything it is emotionally resonant. As the first chapter in Alita's journey, it left me wanting the sequel immediately. As a side note, I saw this film 6 times in theatres and I rarely see a film more than once in theatres.",Alita - Battle Angel
2075,connormclachlan-31805,Seeds of Greatness,9,29 March 2019,"It is rare for me to go out of my way to support a movie as much as I have supported Alita. It spoke to me in a way that few movies do. In an industry saturated by super heroes and empty action sequences, Alita stands apart with extraordinary CG effects that actually immerse us in the world and its characters as well as endearing performances from both Rosa Salazar in the titular role and Christoph Waltz and Doctor Ido, her adoptive Father.Alita herself feels like a hero from another time. She's innocent in the good sense of the word, without being naïve or slow-witted, emotionally vulnerable, but at the same absolutely lethal in combat and capable of immense courage. It's hard to explain, but in a lot of ways she reminds me of Luke Skywalker - a character we can look to for strength when we feel like the odds are stacked against us.Even if you're, not an anime, action or cyberpunk fan, I guarantee you will get something out of this movie. Go out and see it in theatres or check out the Blu-ray when it comes out. You won't be disappointed.",Alita - Battle Angel

2078,pierredemontlaur,A patient goldsmith job,10,29 April 2019,"Alita is not an industrial production, it's a craftman's work. The story has been meditated by Cameron during 20 years. It came through several filters : the manga, next the OVA, Cameron's script, Rodriguez's script, the novelisation and then the film itself. It results in a nectar.
Every single part, every single component of the movie is carfully carved, as is Alita's cyborg body.
The storyline is good, the characters are really good, the CGI is awesome, the love interest is relatable, the score is totally adapted, action secenes are tremendous.
If you take one of these elements separately, of course you can find better movies : I'm not saying it is the best everywhere. But it is very rare to get a movie which is really good on all these compoents at the same time. This is what makes it exceptionnal.
Quality is everywhere. This movie has been made out of passion, carefully, with talent.
Rosa Salazar's performance is amazing, even if her character is CGI.",Alita - Battle Angel

2083,leucetioswolfblade,lovely movie,10,29 April 2019,When i went in i was hopeful but worried it may become another live action anime flop but after seeing the acting even for a few moments i saw the drive and the seriousness that was taken in making it. alita's doll body the little details of roses and trim they didn't need to do that but they wanted to. alita was more human and relatable they many super heroes. i believe she may even inspire anyone with missing limbs that they can be heroes too and maybe even make that kind of cybernetic prosthetic limbs a reality. the visuals were top notch story a bit corny at time seemed real fight scenes they didn't disappoint and now with deepest hopes a sequel is in our future.,Alita - Battle Angel

2086,jmorrowzhang,Alita is a True Hero,8,10 May 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel is a fantastic origin story of a young amnesiac girl who becomes a hero. Sound cliche? Well, maybe it is. Even so, Alita succeeds and rises to the summit of her character trope through her ability to inspire the audience. She has this optimism and tenacious spirit about her that feels so genuine and relatable. When she continues to fight against all odds, when she maintains determined to take action for herself and not what someone else wants her to do, you see the hero in Alita forming and it is wonderful. No matter who you are, when watching her struggles and triumphs, there's a piece of you that identifies with Alita. That connects with her. This makes Alita: Battle Angel more than just a great action film. (though the action scenes are incredibly entertaining) This makes the film emotionally engaging and memorable. The film spares no expense in displaying memorable moments with Alita's character: rising up and declaring ""I do not stand by, in the presence of evil"", her arguing with Dr Ido, cutting through her tear as she copes with what happened in the film. So many more. Alita is a shining example among films today that audiences still care about stories like this. Stories with characters that inspire us to be better versions of ourselves, that take us on an exciting and timeless journey.This film deserves a trilogy, much like the original Star Wars film. One day, Alita: Battle Angel will be renowned as a classic and I am glad to say that I watched this movie in theatres.",Alita - Battle Angel
2087,noralhaen,Emotional Rollercoaster the Best Possible Way,10,1 May 2019,"I'll be honest, when I went to see Alita, I had no clue what it was about. I didn't know the Manga, or the Anime, I had seen one trailer and heard it was a good movie despite negative critics.The first that really struck me was the real, vivid look of Iron City. It's not a generic, post-apocalyptic slum. It appears as a City that has lived through the heights and depths of it's history.The second thing was pretty much at the beginning, when Alita awakes and discovers her new body. The depth of her emotions, of her fascination and joy, immediately made me fall in love with her.These two things absolutely kept my focus the entire movie. Every new scene shows another view on Iron City; and every discovery about the world she's in brings new facets of Alitas character. She is friendly, loving and caring for her father figure Dr. Dyson Ido as much as for a little dog she meets, she is determined to earn her place. She is a force of nature, fighting for good cause.An honest review must also contain the flaws. And Alita has some, like every movie. The biggest issue I have with the plot is that the creators bit off a bit too much of the source material. In the second half of the movie it has several satisfying endings, just to go on an finally finishes with a sequel setup. The storytelling sometimes appears episodic, as if several books of the manga had been sewed together to make the plot. But these flaws can't outweight the greatness of worldbuilding, of the breathtaking action scenes, or of Rosa Salazars fantastic, emotional performance that really brings Alita to life, making her the most human person I've ever met.",Alita - Battle Angel
2088,shawnzemla,Spirit and heart deeply felt and seen,10,1 April 2019,"This film is gaining a cult following for a reason. It's simply beautiful and Alita represents what we all want deep down. Character, integrity, heroic selflessness in the face of evil. The critics don't like it, but they tend to lean towards what they're paid to do. I see her loud and clear and am so thankful to all the people who have brought this to be. Alita is the girl we've been waiting for and the franchise we deserve. What an inspiring film. Even moreso it's the fans rallying to support Alita that make me love her even more. LOVE THIS MOVIE.",Alita - Battle Angel
2089,Hyphen-Nation,Relatable and inspiring on many levels,10,29 April 2019,"If you enjoy thrilling action movies with inspired character development, then I recommend Alita: Battle Angel as the best action movie that I've seen. After watching it multiple times in the theater and comparing it with my other favorites, I'm convinced this is the best movie I've ever seen. I never get tired of watching it over again because Alita is so relatable and inspiring on many levels. Just as Alita's heartfelt actions compel her loved ones to do whatever they can to help her overcome evil in the movie, Alita: Battle Angel compels me to do whatever I can to help the movie overcome obscurity, which is evil to me because so many more people could be moved by the passion and artistry that shines through nearly every scene in this masterpiece.",Alita - Battle Angel
2090,mefl-54659,Alita is my new hero,10,3 April 2019,"Alita is the movie we've been waiting for. My friend and I have been talking about it since it came out almost two months ago, and we are still realizing points about the movie that make us want to see it again (a sixth time in my case). At first glance, the movie may seem like just another sci-if action movie, and while the action sequences were extremely well done and exciting, the wholesomeness of this film is amazingly refreshing and is the real reason I am a fan for life. Alita promotes values such as courage, innocence, selfless love, genuinity, loyalty, perserverence, forgiveness, the beauty of the enduring maternal/paternal heart, fighting for good in the presence of evil, and so much more. Alita is a true role model for all, but especially young girls and women who are looking for a model of TRUE femininity; Alita shows that you can be strong, but still maintain the gentleness of femininity -because both of these are what make a true woman. Needless to say, as a 25 year old woman myself, Alita is my new hero. If you haven't seen the movie yet, there may perhaps still be some time. I wish I could give this movie more than 10 stars. Make sure you don't miss this one.",Alita - Battle Angel
2091,hvergelmir-43860,"Couldn't take my eyes from Alita, absolutely amazing",10,1 May 2019,"I did not expected to see a movie of that level when I went to the cinema for first time. And trailers not catched my attention for a long time. But when I saw this film first time, I absolutely loved it. I told all my friend about it and watched about 13 times in cinema. Alita is working on emotional level. Actress performance is flawless, facial expressions are making whole movie. You can almost see Alita's bare innocent soul through her beautifull eyes. Everyoune must watch this masterpeace. I'm so glad I saw this film in IMAX multiple times. 10/10",Alita - Battle Angel

2096,CodeMonkey99,"""You left the theater with the relationship, feelings and the themes. That is what important."" - Rosa Salazar",9,2 April 2019,"I watched this movie more than once in the theatre, never I did this in my whole life. I went to this movie with low expectation, like any other movies because I treat them as ""entertainment"". This movie is without its flaws, with little plot issues here and there. But as Rosa said, you left the theater with the feeling and emotion and Alita: Battle Angel EXACTLY DOES THAT! That is the most important thing you should measure. The VFX is top notch, one of the best. The action scenes are well done, I'm never a fan of action scenes, but Alita did it for me. And again, when you think about the film, you think about the feelings and emotions and it's indeed the sweetest film in my life. Alita: Battle Angel will always be in my heart.
I don't understand with other reviewers saying it's cliche. The film takes the source (which is from the 90s) material seriously, and what love is not cliche anyway?",Alita - Battle Angel

You'll see the hero defeated, come back stronger, needing others help, failing and succeeding.It was a passion project of the producers, writers, director and actors and it shows.

2099,ebrahiem-01195,A Game Changer,9,8 April 2019,"Alita Battle Angel is the first movie that made me visit the cinema twice for. I rarely visit the cinema and usually prefer to watch a movie in the comfort of my home. After much persuasion from friends i got to see the movie, Alita may not be very common here in South Africa but it ought to be.Thestory is brilliantly set up though i did feel it was a bit rushed. The plot is second to none and I must say if ever I was a fan to a movie franchise, it will be so for alita. Alita Battle Angel has the full set of emotions though the combination of love and awe for a character has affected me as deeply as it has in this movie. I cannot wait for a sequel.This movie is certainly underrated and needs more recognition. I urge you to give it a try and i can guarentee that you will not be disappointed.",Alita - Battle Angel
2100,jonathankinison,Best movie of the last decade,10,4 April 2019,"Alita is eaily my favorite movie. I knew nothing of the source material going in, but it hooked me enough to get me to read the entire manga after I left the theater. The story is compelling and egaging, you get caught up in the world and the action. The actors are perfect, Christoph Walts as Doc Ido was the best actor they coud have gotten, he is able to play off Rosa Salazar and make their chatacters feel like genuine father and daughter. Rosa Salazar does an amazing job as Alita, conveying some of the most heartfelt and intense emotions through full body CGI, a quite impressive feat considering how some actors can't even display emotion when fully live action *cough* Brie Larson *cough*. The characters themselves will just hook you, from Ido's fatherly compassion, to Alita's empowering determination, to Hugo's optimism, not a single character feels short of great. A small praise I fell ABA deserves is that it makes use of its PG-13 rating, many movies are PG-13 but aren't much worse than most PG or G rated movies, but ABA gives all the blood and violence a PG-13 will allow, as well as having the most effective use of its one f-bomb I've ever seen. I consider Alita: Battle Angel to be a masterpeice, and would easily have become this generations Star Wars had a certain company not paid to have it trashed by the media in favor of its own mediocre flop. The only issue I have with Alita is that it gave me a fever, and the only perscription is more Alita.",Alita - Battle Angel
2101,nimrod-80723,Go for the insane special effects. Stay for the heroing adventure and amazing characters.,10,4 April 2019,"Whether you have read every page of the manga, watched the anime, or this is the first time you have ever heard of Alita: Battle Angel, there is immense amounts of enjoyment to be had for everyone. Those who have followed the series, however, will be happy to know that the movie stays very close to the source material, as much as can be expected of course, and the visual recreation of the world, so beautifully shown in the mangas and anime, has absolutely exploded onto the screen to create a viceral and tactile feeling of realism akin to the original Blade Runner series. Things have weight and a sense of use; something so rarely found in CG effects driven science-fiction films these days.The effects, visual and auditory, are truly astounding and Cameron knocks it out of the proverbial park. These are definitely some of the best effects, on-screen, to date; period. This new technology created for this movie will open all new windows in film never thought possible before and I, for one, am excited to see if Cameron will get a chance to further expand the Alita world in the coming years.The love and care the actors took with the wonderfully created characters is front and center as they bring to life a series that had fallen into obscurity by the late '90s for everyone, fans and new comers alike, to enjoy. The characters have a gravity to them that seems to pull you in quickly, fan or not, and their personalities shine, good or bad, to prompt the viewer want to know more.The characters are well fleshed out (pun intended) and the heroin, Alita, is one of the most developed, believable, emotionally relatable, and down-right badass female solo leads in a movie in easily the last decade. She doesn't just show up and have everything together. She doesn't lack human flaws, weaknesses, or character conflicts internally and her character doesn't require all of the characters around her to be weak in order to stand out. She does that all on her own and this is based on her actions, the decisions she makes and why. We are not told she is important or brave we are shown it. Despite her metal body, she is more human and conflictedly stoic than we have seen since the likes of Alien or the original Terminator.You sincerely feel for her when she fails brutally or seems to get the short end of the stick, you're there getting amped up when she's fighting back and pushing through the pain, and you're on the end of your seat when she's racing at high speeds and fighting with everything she has against odds stacked completely against her in a battle she doesn't even know she can win. You actually are rooting her on in a way almost akin to the original Rocky.To those who are calling for a strong female hero, one that has depth, one that has flaws but overcomes them, one that can be soft but strong too, one that never gives up and can follow the hero's journey with the best of them, then buy your tickets and get yourself to the nearest theater right now and experience the amazing world of Alita for yourself!",Alita - Battle Angel

2106,a-mbruderek,Heart and Soul in a Cyborg,9,9 May 2019,"I didn't read the manga before watching Alita in theatre but I was curios about for ten years. Right after I saw Avatar I found out Cameron was working on Alita. I nearly missed Alita due to illness and finally saw her in 2d after cap Marvel was released.I was amediatly drawn into the world of Iron city by the first scene, a vast scrapyard and a lone figure searching for spare parts. From there on, Rodriguez sticks to the method of character introuction so well used by cameron on Aliens, T2, True Lies, Titanic and Avatar. the whole movie I was thinking I watched a Jim Cameron Movie.He gives you bits of Information thoughout the movie you need a few scenes later. Not all at once, just as much needed. There always was a feeling of ""I remember this was hinted a few moments ago"". It was like seeing a well guide tour.The Cast was really superb and their acting was worthy of Academy awards.At first I didn't like the romance, but this is about a girl coming of age in a syfy world and therefore a teenager falling in love at first side with a guy supporting her against her fatherfigure is believable.And that is even more importan than the best special effects i ever saw:The Movie and its characters are believable and you can relate to the main characters.I definitely recommend it.",Alita - Battle Angel
2107,sorentopperhede,Surprising accuracy in relation to the original manga,9,28 April 2019,"Battle Angel was the only manga I read growing up, and it wasn't because I didn't find others interesting, I just somehow thought that rereading all the volumes over and over again was the only thing that kept me happy in the world of comics. I related so deeply to Alita and her struggle in the world that I really became attached to it. When Cameron got introduced to the comics by del Toro and announced that he'd be starting production of the movie, I couldn't have been more excited. But, followed by the endless delays due to Avatar, I started to realize that the movie would never happen. In a way, it made me mad when Avatar fans (which I am too) thought Alita: Battle Angel was a waste of time and in the way of the next Avatar movie. But now finally, the movie came. And I could not have been more positively surprised. It was Amazing! I guess most people that have never heard of the character before the movie can't really compare the story to anything, but I can tell you, that for it being a Hollywood movie, the accuracy was satisfying. So the few things that were a off stood out like Alita did in the world. I know that I am extremely biased when it comes to this franchise, because I did after all read All The Time, but I think that some would agree that this movie stands out from the mundane and westernized versions of movie manga adaptations and isn't afraid to show it's colours as it did in the manga.",Alita - Battle Angel

It is noted in some criticisms that they only speak badly of this work out of hatred, they do not even stop to pretend that there is some objectivity. A shameThe character fits perfectly, Cameron's vision was ideal to highlight the purity and innocence as well as how different she is from the rest. The action is excellent and the graphics are the best you can ask for right now.If it were not for some shortcomings that I think it has with how it is treated some characters and some very insignificant pates I think it would be almost perfect.",Alita - Battle Angel

2113,tamquamleo,What a surprise!,10,29 April 2019,"I knew nothing about the manga, I didn't even know it existed before entering the theater. I was just expecting a funny action movie.
What a surprise. Totally immersed in the film, I lost track of time. At the end I was mind-blown.
A very relatable film, astonishing CGI, breath-taking action scenes, a fascinating background story. An entirely new universe opened.
The days after I ordered and then read the original manga, watched the OVA, bought the OST and the novelisation.
It may not be the best movie ever, it's up to the spectator, but there is quality everywhere, which makes Alita : Battle Angel a reference.
Unfairly reviewed, poorly advertised, time will bring Alita the recognition she deserves.
CGI and special effects will become outaged, but actors'performance will never because it is deeply human.To finish, quality is everywhere and in every detail, so it does not become boring after multiple viewings. Like a piece of art or craftsmanship, you enjoy it everytime. Multiple viewings are even required to savour fully this great work, like a good wine.",Alita - Battle Angel

The best effects I've EVER seen hands down and you can't help but be so drawn into the world building and the character that is Alita.

Better than almost anything to come out in recent memory BY FAR",Alita - Battle Angel
2117,assoldier,Full of Emotion,10,30 April 2019,Alita: Battle Angel had my expectations crushed in an oh so good way. What i felt watching this movie were feelings i had not felt for many years. I tore up more than once not only in the first but also every other viewing. I could point out the great worldbuilding or the brilliant cgi but to me it all perishes in comparison to the way i connected to the character that is Alita. Call me an incorrigible old romantic but if you give me a good story and some people i care for that struggle and ultimatly fail in utter tragedy that makes me cry my heart out then i will watch it again and again and then... again!,Alita - Battle Angel

2120,alonsoreyes-32085,A Truly spectacular film,10,1 May 2019,"I really enjoyed the film, the story is well written and the world building is phenomenal as well as the characters, and more so the protagonist, they really brought Alita to life, she is a really likable character from the start and through the end. This movie made me feel for Alita as a real person, we discover her past with her and learn more about herself with her as she progresses through the story, as she grows we grow with her, you really get to connect with Alita wether ur a girl or a boy, it's universal. The actor Rosa Salazar did a phenomenal job in bringing her to life, u really feel like she is real and the Visuals did an extraordinary job in capturing all of that. The CGI is really breathtaking and the action sequences r truly mesmerizing. I mean I can keep going, this really is a spectacular film, but don't take my word for it, go ahead and see it!! U won't be disappointed.",Alita - Battle Angel
2121,rot_soldier,I've watched it 4 times now,10,1 May 2019,"I never watch a movie in the theaters more than once. Alita, I've watched 4 times and would watch it more if I could. The CGI is the icing on the cake. It's the beau story of a father that lost his daughter and finds a girl that helps him become the father he once was. A girl with no history searches to find her identity, love and what she will do with her life. A people, struggling to get by while far up above, the wealth throw their scrapes down to them. It's the most human story I've seen in a long time and dying for the sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel

Those movies don t have any connection with something real, they make you accept a parallel reality in which whatever can be so requires a complete disconnection from reality, losing the beauty of sci-fic. Alita is a movie with soul, a world with rules, more believable than the movies I previously mentioned, which for my surpirsise are the ones more viewed, this says a lot about our society right now. Alita has amazing visuals and most importantly has heart, is not a perfect movie at all, but is the best on it s genre this year, I enjoyed a lot, and surrounded by all this mediocre overviewed movies it deserves a 10, let s support real sci fic and fantasy. Congratulations to Weta too always making amazing visual effects.",Alita - Battle Angel

It's a movie that I'm willing to watch a few times in the last ten years.
Contained from tv, probably iron man and Captain America.But, spend money at the cinema to buy tickets over twice.
Was ""Pacific Rim"" ( twice).
And ALITA,it could made me went to watch 15 times in the cinema.
I can constantly call my heart in the movie.

This is definitely one of James Cameron's greatest work. Alita's character design looks very similar to the one in the manga, and the action scenes were incredible!
Although some of the romantic scenes were a little cringy and the movie felt rushed for me because a lot of ground was not covered from the manga, but hopefully that means we're getting a sequel to the movie to continue Alita's great journey!",Alita - Battle Angel
2126,vampiredancer-96564,I loved it,10,14 May 2019,"The cgi is a piece of art I've never seen before and the story takes you in if you are into scifi movies. But even if you don't like scifi or fantasy this movie is great to watch as my friend told me, who at first did not look forward to the movie but now is loving it. I had my reservations too since I thought the whole anime thing with the big eyes may be a little cringey but they did not distract at all and the story was well rounded and hadn't any noticible anime aspects. You should really give it a try. At least for the amazing cgi!",Alita - Battle Angel
2127,shinobijim,A hero's journey,9,16 May 2019,"While not objectively a perfect film, Alita: Battle Angel is able to provide audiences with a relatable protagonist who must learn and grow as a person just as any normal person does. Alita is naive to the dangers of the world, but as she gains experience, she is better able to realize her potential and navigate her world.I was not sure how I would feel about the movie going in. I had read many articles and reviews that claimed it was a movie with an over-sexualized male fantasy heroine that seemed more like a sex doll than a person. I am so confused after seeing the movie. I don't know what movie they saw, but what I saw was a female protagonist that was not an emotionally constipated tomboy trying to out macho all the men with how tough and cocky she is. I saw a woman who not only kicked ass, but could exist comfortably in the quiet moments, connecting to the people around her. I saw someone who was comfortable in her femininity, as unafraid to fiercely defend her friends and fight for what she knew was right as she was to gaze wide eyed at the world and wear her heart on her sleeve. I saw vulnerability, and we all feel that now and then. We as humans feel inadequate at times. She did too. We as humans WANT to be brave enough to face our challenges, and we want someone to be a hero, to show us how. Alita shows us how.",Alita - Battle Angel

2136,Amaan258,Simply brilliant...,10,27 June 2019,"When I first began to watch Alita: Battle Angel, I did not know what to expect, since I did not watch the trailer. However, during the first 20 minutes of the movie, I knew that this was not an ordinary movie which I'd forget in a few months. This was something...special; unique.What I found most surprising about the film was that a cyborg such as Alita, with the only human part of her being her brain, was capable of feeling and showing so much emotion and facial expressions, more than anyone else in the movie, and in actual fact, more than most people in reality. The movie was extremely unpredictable, with nothing happening as I expected.Alita: Battle Angel is my favourite film, and with good reason. I'd love to watch a sequel sometime soon. Out of the hundreds of movies which I have rated on IMDb, it is the only one which has received a perfect score of 10/10 from me, as I believe that there is always room for improvement, with the exception of Alita: Battle Angel. This movie was just perfect! I highly doubt that I'd be watching such a breaktaking and remarkable film anytime soon (if ever).In conclusion, I'd like to point out that although Alita: Battle Angel is a phenomenal film, it is highly underrated. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone! ""An angel falls, a warrior rises.""",Alita - Battle Angel
2137,jcarsillo-09491,I was disappointed,4,16 September 2019,"To preface this review I'd like to say I think Rosa Salazar is a fantastic actor and she was great in Undone as well as Alita. I anticipated this movie when it first made its way onto my radar. The CGI was incredible but the acting from most the supporting roles weren't up to snuff, in my opinion, and that was the film's biggest fault. They chose to focus almost entirely on the visuals while leaving the story repeatedly fragmented. I don't agree with most of the reviews posted about this film as I feel they were all judging it by the visuals rather than a good screenplay or plot. The male love interest was a terrible cliche as well. Gets 4 stars for the great CGI.",Alita - Battle Angel

At first i thought its going to be a captain marvel or star wars last jedi we hate men and beat up men movie. Especially since I've seen the anime movie on YouTube, when i seen the live depiction of this movie. It became my favorite movie of this year, not because I'm a man or that I'm sexist. It's because I'm tired of all these movies insulting me as a human being and for being a man.
Keep your personal feelings out of people movies. If it wasn't written into the original depiction of the comic/manga don't add things. People wasn't a fan of your version of the character, we are fans of the original source material. And that what battle angel alita and Rosa have done they stayed true to the character its like she went all rouge on captain marvel and zapped her brie Larson character into a coma where she should just go.",Alita - Battle Angel

This is one of those movies where you simply have to turn off your brain to enjoy the action, otherwise plot holes and obvious poorly plotpoints forshadowed in a manner that tells you exactly what's going to happen really ruin the enjoyment to be had from this movie.The 3D animation talent is amazing, and it's sad to see it being wasted on Alita: Battle Angel. 5 stars simply because of amazing CGI.",Alita - Battle Angel
2149,Abreu_80,The details made the film,10,12 July 2019,"In my opinion, and for a guy who doesn't like too much science fiction, this movie is really really good.

2152,jzombie-80168,Awesome,10,14 July 2019,First off the movie was awesome it had great cast script and screenplay it had a great story behind it and follows the comics pretty well but it's also sad at the same time when Alita's love of her life got shredded up and fell off the tube. It was super sad. But if they make a sequel which Rodriguez was talking about I think Hugo will come back. Reasons let me explain Hugo was turned cyborg at the end of the movie and as long as the head isn't damaged then he could still survive the fall. 2 If you remember where Alita came from zalem of course she fell an even greater height and still survived and got a new robot suit so I think he could very well come back.,Alita - Battle Angel
2153,TnK2Sweet,A really good cyberpunk work,8,16 July 2019,"Alita is an excellent work for both those who had read the original manga and who never had contact with the work as in my case. The film is beautifully filmed with incredible effects and really spectacular action scenes. It made me want to go read the original work and I'm just loving it. For those who like a more cyberpunk footprint and is a fan of animes like Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in The Shell you'll sure like the movie a lot. The script could have been a little better organized but it does not make it a bad script, and there is still an addition to the performances of Rosa Salazar and Christoph Waltz simply magnificent.",Alita - Battle Angel
2154,SKotani,Absolutely Great!,10,16 July 2019,"As a long time fan of anime, I was not disappointed with this movie. The movie carries itself seriously as a live action film adaptation, and doesn't lose sight of the narrative or plot that was essential to the anime. The action scenes were brilliant, the cinematography were top notch, the music complimented the scenes and the actors and actresses did a wonderful job. Seeing this movie was written and produced by James Cameron has given me some added faith in him, as I am a long-time fan of The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, however seeing and hearing what I have regarding Terminator: Dark Fate has me wondering whether my continued faith will be deserved.For those who have not previously seen the anime, Alita: Battle Angel will be a great introduction, and may even be a great stepping stone for them to become interested in the anime. Again, as a fan of The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the cyborg characters in this movie looked great, convincing, and even the villains looked formidable. It pains me that it took Alita: Battle Angel to see the kind of visual artistry James Cameron has, that same artistic vision that has been missing in every sequel after T2 from 2003-15 that could have been applied to the Terminator franchise in those 12 years.Alita: Battle Angel in my humble opinion was blessed for having the involvement of James Cameron's brilliant artistic vision.",Alita - Battle Angel

Probably not but what can I say, this movie was spectacular with the Animation. It had it's cheesy moments, but didn't distract from the bigger story.The ending makes way for a sequel but it looks like that might not happen? Hopefully that is not the case, I enjoyed this movie and would look forward to seeing how the rest of this supposed trilogy turns out. (Apparently coming out around the same time as a Marvel movie doesn't give a lot of wiggle room for a non-marvel film to profit here in north america. Although Capt. Marvel was also a good film, so can't knock it either.)I would suggest this movie as a watch for sure.",Alita - Battle Angel

2158,yamindahwich,Mediocre,6,18 July 2019,"Animation:
The animation was realistic and atmospheric, but in my opinion it was slightly too heavy. The style stayed true in many ways to the original manga.
Characters:
The main problems with Alita herself was that it seemed that she could defeat anybody and had no qualms with killing people to get her way. Hugo is portrayed as a hero even though he attacked and stole from cyborgs.
Plot:
We aren't given any information on the backstory of Zalem and Iron City as well as Alita other than 'the Fall' and the fact she was a URM super-soldier. The plot was too complicated and fast-paced- one minute she's an uncertain 14 year old girl, the next she is a killing machine.

But I saw the name James Cameron at the trailer so it was a must watch for me. What should I say? This movie just blow me away. The cgi is the best I have ever seen at a movie. They really mixed the cgi and the real film set in a perfect way. The story caught me from the first second and after the end I was really impressed. This movie touched me in a emotionaly way no other movie did before. After Alita first eye opening you connect to her and she takes you on a journey of selfdiscovering. After the movie ended I had to stay in my sit at the theatre for a few minutes because I was so impressed.I also liked the development of her relationship to Doc Ido and her rising from a innocent girl to a strong female warrior. After watching it five times at the theatre I bought the digital version (blu-rays are on preorder) and watched it mutiple times again.

2167,strummr,"Lots of good, and plenty of bad...",5,27 July 2019,"First of all, I'm a huge fan of Cameron and Rodriguez - their imaginations and vision are second to very few. I ended up watching this on a 60"" plasma TV, as I didn't feel like watching it in the theaters, nor my home theater (150"" screen, 3D). I'm also really big into CGI and creative arts in general (I'm a creative director as a profession), so I was really expecting big things (well, mainly for Cameron's and Rodriguez' vision, and execution).I'm going to rate this simply as follows:
5 - overall; 9 - CGI/effects; 7 - story; 8 - production; 6 - direction.
Yes, there are many more considerations, but as noted, keeping it simple; there would also be 'weightings' to the various categories as well.For what you expect this movie to be, it would probably be a solid 7-8 for most people (visuals, action, 'entertaining'). Personally, I had to give a bit more weighting to story-telling, some character development, along with the great production. As noted, the visuals (CGI, effects, action...), will not disappoint, the basic storyline, albeit a bit contrived (future dystopian scenario with hyper class/cultural separation), will also be more than as expected.So, to nitpick some, the things that mattered for me was the storytelling, it is very disjointed - it's all over the place. Setting up characters, the various activities, and sub-stories - they all get eventually told/understood, but it can be a bit annoying in how it develops (felt a bit unpolished - which seems to me, if I can speculate, Cameron didn't spend much time influencing on the 'direction' side.Overall, entertaining, and I'll put forth a more appropriate review on the visual production, once the 4k blu-ray is released and I can watch it with more attention to its strong points.",Alita - Battle Angel
2168,kuixiv,One of the better movies of the year,7,30 July 2019,"The wonderfully animated and intense action scenes make up for the somewhat clumsy script. Alita is basically what you end up with when you mix a rebellious teenage girl with Neo and the Terminator. As you can expect, that leads to some rather interesting dialogue.

Well i think if most of the people are cyber-enhanced and this is the way society functions(cyber enhancing people for various purposes) for 300+ years, isn't it very natural that normal and cyber enhanced humans blend in quite easily or probably don't feel a need to classify on the basis of cyber enhancement.",Alita - Battle Angel

2171,kevinbui-94120,Alita:BattleAngel > CaptainMarvel,10,1 August 2019,"You know a movie is really good when you're left wanting more as the credits roll. I watched this movie on a whim with no real expectation and boy did I regret not seeing it theaters. Alita is what a female empowerment film should be. Alita didn't have to tell you that she was a strong female, but rather she showed you that she was a strong character that just so happens to be female. The Cyberpunk world of Alita: Battle Angel was reminiscent of Pandora from the film Avatar granted it was produced by the same people. The world was immersive it felt deep and real. Even if you aren't into the storyline this movie had some of the best fight choreography and CGI I've seen in a movie, all of the action was done tastefully to build the scene or character. Some of the characters I felt could've been developed a little more but given the movie was only 2 hours long I understand why they did what they did. It's sad to know that this movie is plagued by bad critic reviews because it was released around the same time another popular female driven movie was released. Alita: Battle Angel may not be for everyone but coming into this movie with an open mind and no real expectations will surprise you. Im now left desperately wanting a sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel

2176,pizzazdaniel,First time reviewing,10,11 August 2019,I just recently watched this movie and felt a connection to it I haven't felt in a long time with a movie. Hopefully they have a second one in the works because it would be great to watch.,Alita - Battle Angel
2177,anzongben,"Fun movie, great adaptation from original",9,13 August 2019,"I watched the anime version as a young adult just getting into manga and anime back in the late 90's, and it left a huge impression on me. Not only was it a rare story of female empowerment, but it was one of the seminal 90's works helping to prove to American audiences that cartoons aren't just for kids.At first, I was very hesitant about the live action adaptation: it's always risky adapting anime to live action, but it turned out great. While certainly different in several ways, the changes are generally positive and I feel Cameron and Rodriguez - both apparently big fans of the manga and anime - did the movie justice by providing a strong storyline that maintains what made Battle Angel great and in some ways improved upon the original. One of the biggest surprises was bringing the rating down to PG-13 (the original manga and anime had plenty of gore and nudity), while remaining riveting and heart-wrenching, without diluting the story one bit, but providing greater appeal to a wider audience.
A lot of fun, and I hope there's at least one more sequel!",Alita - Battle Angel
2178,tlangley-83706,Terrified,1,19 August 2019,"I looked at the Title of this movie and already knew I wasn't going to like it, when I watched it, it proved me right, First of all, Alita is terrifying, her eyes make me super uncomfortable and she doesn't act or look like a human witch makes me more disturbed, second, i was cringing at the movie the whole time i watched, so many of the scenes made me cringe it was impossible to count, Third, the story was just a cookie cutter hero story and was very boring, the characters were so unlikable too, please avoid watching this movie with children as it will terrify them into months worth of nightmares, and don't watch it in general, you could watch another one of the infinite action movies and it's just the same story.",Alita - Battle Angel
2179,robertorossiodummy,"Cliché, cliché, cliché",3,8 September 2019,"I already had low expectations when I saw the trailer for this movie. I was expecting a cliché futuristic story about a robot that fights other robots, but is also a fan of some wacky futuristic roller skates sport. And guess what? I was right.Uninspiring:
The movie doesn't really explore much of the world it's in, it's more focused on Alita and the robot hunters. And I guess that's fine, but that futuristic world is really too cliché by this point. The world is destroyed, people are poor, some major war happened, technology is advanced, advanced AI, but there's really nothing new in all this.The protagonist:
Alita is not a good character in my opinion. Not only does she lack a personality, but also she is basically a Mary Sue. No personality flaws, and extremely overpowered physically. The way she defeats her enemies with so much ease ruins any tension the movie has.CGI:
The movie tries its hardest to impress you with the CGI. And yes, the CGI is good, but so what? Even though it's good CGI, I know it's CGI. And even though the CGI is good, the characters have very bland designs. Basically, it's just robots with weapons, and their faces look human. The movie isn't exactly interesting to look at, you can show me all sorts of futuristic robots and sceneries, but it all lacks substance, originality.The ""plot"":
The plot feels more like a string of events connected together than a structured plot. One moment the story is about finding Alita's past, the other moment it's about her fitting in the world, other moment is about roller skates, other moment is about hunter robots, other moment is about some weird conspiracy theory. It lacks direction, sense. But most of all, it lacks originality.Conclusion:
I found this movie long and boring. I disliked the fight scenes a lot, they felt very cartoony, I disliked the plot, I disliked the world setting. The only good part is the CGI, but it shows how they tried to impress you with special effects, than impressing you with a good plot or good characters.",Alita - Battle Angel

While it had beautiful visuals, it also had an entertaining story.What startled me was the roles that black people got in this movie. First person to die, black. Are you kidding me?The three other black people: evil and vile: Vector, he dies, wild and out of control: Tanji, he dies and finally the assistant to Dr Ido who does not die, but her role is limited to getting to smile and nod sympathetically a couple times.Definitely a bit of stereotyping.

2186,shinmou,A perfect adaptation,9,7 November 2019,"By watching the trailer, I thought this would be a bonker which would come in as a typical Hollywood action movie, packed with actions but no soul. However, very soon I realized this movie was a pleasant surprise. While it didn't follow exactly the original Japanese comic story, it was close and adapted with the right spirit. Rosa performed quite well as the lead character and other actors did their job. The real problem of this film is that the story is not very American. Most people weren't familiar with the story and the spirit and the soul of it is pretty ""Japanese."" I suggest the latter installments shall follow the original story but market more toward the Asian/international markets. A teenage girl hero with complex background is not a typical hero who gets adored in this country. I highly recommend viewers who finds this film interesting to pick up the original Japanese comic.",Alita - Battle Angel
2187,HonkHank,Astonishing movie in every aspect!,10,6 December 2019,"I saw the Alita trailers back in 2018 and it looked like it was right up my alley.
Then I forgot about the film until it hit the theaters in feb 2019 and I went to see it together with my wife.
She had no expectations what so ever besides liking cinema evenings.First Viewing: 9.5 out of 10 stars.
Wow, what a movie.
Wonderful opening scenes, great SGI characters and real live acting, over the top action scenes, very satisfying script. Rosa simply nails it as Alita.
The only annoying part was the abrupt ending set up for a sequel when I wanted more!
There was also a lot going on and it was a bit easy to miss some parts.
My wife liked it very much as well but mentioned that it was not as good as Avatar.
But something about it made me feel the opposite way, that Alita was the better experience.Over the next few days the movie was not letting go of my mind, like a really good tune. So I decided to go see it again (something I have never done before, not even with Avatar).Second Viewing: 10 out of 10 stars.
This time around the film was even better and I enjoyed lots of small details I missed in the first sitting.
But most importantly I understood what makes it such an appealing experience.
It was Rosas top notch performance capture in combination with the perfect CGI character of Alita, the outstanding world building, the engaging soundtrack, and the deep emotions of Alita (Rosa) that gets you over and over throughout the entire movie.
I was very pleased having seen it for a second time.Third Viewing: 10 out of 10 stars again.
Now the craziness.... me going to see Alita for a third time.
My wife smiled at me and thought I was bonkers (perhaps I was).
But the movie experience kept on delivering even though I knew the plot.
I have never before experienced any film as rewatchable as Alita.
This movie is not just the movie of the year but the movie of the decade.I sincerely hope the final profit is high enough (Bluray sales included) and they produce the most wanted sequel ever.
As words have spread around the world about how great Alita Battle Angel is (among those missing out the cinemas) I believe a sequel will attract a crowd and deliver tons of money.Later I have enjoyed Alita countless of times by my home theater.
I find myself rather rewatching Alita than wasting time on some other mediocre movie.
It always manage to stir up my feelings and get me in a good mood and what else can be said to praise this wonderful piece of cinematic art.Edit october 2020: Even after this long time I occasionally still get drawn back into the intriguing world of Iron City.
In terms of rewatchability there is no other film even close to Alita. It just doesn't seem to get old.
If possible I would increase my rating to 12 out of 10.",Alita - Battle Angel

2194,luciuswalker-00717,A Movie With So Much Potential,10,29 January 2020,"I am honestly grateful that James Cameron was so in love with the manga series that he wanted to make this movie for a good decade or so, with only the lack of funding? and technology to make it happen. When I first saw the trailer, I too was a bit weirded out by her eyes, and was a bit skeptical about wanting to watch the movie.However, I eventually decided to see what it was all about, and when finding out that it was actually a live-action adaption of a manga, that piqued my curiosity. So I decided to check out the manga.No. Damn. Regrets.The manga, while a bit hard to understand at times, due to the complex science behind it, was beautiful in its dirty, cyberpunk way, and with how philosophical it can be, especially about humanity, as well as the definition of evil.Quickly falling in love with the manga, as well as the titular character Alita herself, I quickly decided that I did want to watch to movie, and so I did.While admittedly there were some times when I was slightly disappointed or perplexed by the live-action adaption (e.g. Zapan's design, some of the characters appearing too early, the Panzer Kunstlers themselves, and other details that manga fans will agree was a bit risky to change), I still loved the movie itself. I loved how they designed every single character, even the background ones, to be unique in a way that's appropriate for the world of Iron City.I loved how Alita's bodies were designed, even if, again, it differs from the manga, and as for her eyes? Forgot all about them after like 20 mins or so. And you remember what I said about some things being changed that was risky? Well, in the end, I decided that it may be best that the live-action adaption will be slightly different, since if it was completely same or completely different (e.g. Harry Potter vs Stormbreaker vs Dragonball Evolution), then it would be completely boring, or it would be almost offensive to all of the fans. I just loved Robert's, James's, and Jon's take on the series, and I feel like the only reason why it wasn't better was that they were essentially cramming the first couple of arcs into one movie, and yet, they still did a pretty damn job. I mean after all, the characters and the lore were still relatively same in both its contents and its looks.In conclusion, I really hope for a sequel soon. I really do hope that they be just a little more loyal to the manga, and I really hope that we get to see Zapan again (wink wink for the manga fans), Gelda, Nova, and even Erica. I hope to see the other specific parts of Panzer Kunst that made the fictional martial art very deadly, and I hope to find out more about the lore of this live-action adaption.#AlitaArmy...(Come to think of it, perhaps after they're done making the movies, they should try again with a live-action TV series off of this or something. That way, they don't have to shove everything into one movie, and they can take their time with it. Kinda like how they filled in the gaps for the Star Wars movies with the TV shows, like The Clone Wars.)",Alita - Battle Angel

2196,pppptan,Enjoyable movie with some pacing and disconnect issue,8,20 February 2019,"3D quality is the best compared to other 3d movies, clean and detailed, as we expect from a james cameron movie. Story pacing is kind of rush and I feel some transitions does not work. I wish it had more flow in the story. But still it keeps the story and action moving and not dragging to get boring. Expect to see a lot of gory stuff but in a cyborg sense. I still hope to see a movie part 2 to continue the story. Acting of main star, Rosa Salazar is the best performance in this movie. Other character performance were not up to par, so it feels somewhat the main character Alita becomes disconnect from the rest of the characters. It is an enjoyable movie with great action scenes, special effects, 3D (I hope it comes to 3D blu ray) and fast pacing scenes. It is based on Anime story, so it is hard to compare it to a typical hollywood story script and pacing.",Alita - Battle Angel

2207,murillohauache,A Well of Potential,8,10 September 2020,"Possibly the best hollywood adaptation that would otherwise be an excellent anime to date, and by a large margin. It's a miracle that Holywood finally managed not to skillfully transform great animated work into butt erosion (uhum... Ghost in the Shell). The movie thankfully follows the footsteps of the original manga, and thus has not only a captivating plot, but also promises an even better sequel, although the plot itself is only a small portion of what the movie has to offer. The world of Alita is beautifully depicted, needing only a little over 2 hours of screen time to open up a portal to a myriad possibilities, even though the movie spends a good chunk of its time exploring its universe. Alongside that, the visual effects and sound are just astonishing, matching the quality of many honourable high budget sci-fies (such as Avatar), which sum up to a magical experience on theatre. The cinematography and direction in a combo pretty much enhanced a lot of the acting as well, which though it may seem a bit dull to outsiders who are not part of the niche, it preserves the atmosphere of eastern voice acting very well. The movie may be slightly cheesy sometimes, since it covers pg18 topics in a teeny way sometimes, but that also has the upside of appealing for a wider audence for example, and so if intensity is something you look for in a movie, know that Alita: Battle Angel covers that to moderate amounts, but it does not push itself to have realistic violence for example, which makes sense considering it is a fiction movie; it is exactly strong at that: fiction (and a spectacle of the genre). Long story short, If you like ""Avatar"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" series, you should definetly give Alita: Battle Angel a shot.",Alita - Battle Angel

Very believable performance from her, and she plays Alita as an innocent child seeing the world like a newborn. The action sequences are fantastic! And so are cyborg creations. However, as usual, the story gets left behind a little. My gripe about the story? It is incomplete. I suspect that sequels are intended. Bad decision. This should have been a once off story.CGI is getting all the more impressive, as software and hardware improves. The compositing of CGI into real world is incredible, seamless and looks spectacular. This movie has exceeded Avatar. Having worked in post production years ago, I am in awe of the leaps forward in technology!

I want to see director's cut version, I think that cinema version was slightly edited.

Also there is no sex, no naked women, no offensive language and average movie goers felt disappointed because of that. It's a very sad world we live in now.

SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!
When he died the first time, I was sad, but the second time, I felt absolutely nothing. But the amount of gore........ugh, I wasn't expecting that. Another thing that was super strange was the deaths and resurrections of various characters. Is that a normal thing in manga? I'm not well versed in that genre, but if they can make more movies like this, I may give them a shot.
The story felt somewhat rushed on all counts. Just quickly moving from place to place and not always seeming to have a purpose.",Alita - Battle Angel

I stopped watching with 15 mins to go.
There is no character or values in demonstrating how much tougher you are than everyone else. Especially when you are more powerful.

2226,duylinhsss,Pretty but empty,4,1 April 2021,"Having been familiar with the original material, I can't say I was impressed, in any way. However, I shall refrain from having that aspect affecting my recommendation of this movie.I probably shall not discuss the plot, for it is not an aspect that will bring much satisfaction. The movie adapts the animated short of the original comic, which was produced as advertisement for the comic, It collects the action sequences in the comic, dumb it down with some semblance of the comic plotline and broadcast it. As you might expect, encapsulating a few plotline into one is quite an ordeal, and James Cameron is no magician.You'll find yourself following 2 plotline, with a third one dropping in unceremoniously, seemingly because it's ""cool"", and it is. However, I wouldn't bother comment on the direction of the action, I find it hit or miss, with a lot more miss. Still, for those who likes that kind action, it's serviceable. Don't expect crisp with great angle action such as those of Marvel, this is rather cartoony, for better or worse. The two plotlines are also rather cartoony themselves. One is involving vengeance, the other ambition. Both are quite poorly told. The motivation of the antagonists weren't exactly clear, nor convincing. At times, it might feel contrived, and it is. You might find yourself enjoying individual scenes than the entire thing stringed together.The sound and music are rather forgettable, there's nothing worth mentioning.This movie main focus is entirely on the visual. I think it might be described as ""revolutionary"" by others. It does look colourful and interesting, but funnily, to the detriment of the story. Clearly, the story is trying to portray the city as a dystopia, full of crazy people, crime, violence, deceit and anger. Yet the visual is colourful and there's a lot of instances where the citizens are portrayed positively. In contrast to the visual, the supposedly tragic events are out of place, which drains any impacts or complexity of the tone. There are some discussion about the design of the main character. Personally, I just find it distracting, yet nothing of note. The design is probably intended to make her seems innocent with large eyes, yet inhumane in its proportion, either that or they are mocking large ""anime"" eyes. Whatever it is, it merely manages to distract me, the acting don't scream ""soldier"" nor ""99% robots"", she acts like a teenage girl with a mild case of amnesia who knows Kung Fu. The fights visual is, as mentioned before, acceptable. A lot of efforts went to creating the environment for the story, yet I only have vague memories trying to recall them. It's unfortunately, because that's the focus of the adaption.Overall, I think as a super hero origin story, this is acceptable. But, as it is a super hero story in a dystopia, the dystopia part don't seem to show up, despite us being told that the world city is full of perils. All we see is a violent sport, a bar fight, a fight with a big robot guy, a little of human organ harvest and bounty hunters. All of these elements don't mesh with the rest of the visual, making it very confusing in tone. None of the core element of the story works, the romance is cheap and contrived, the father-daughter relationship is half baked, and stopped developing half way through the movie. If you are willing to forgive all of that, you'll find it amongst the thousands of sci-fi adventure movies, with a bit of complexity thanks to the source material.All glitters and no cake. Read the comic, is my verdict.Read ahead for very very minor spoiler.If you want to see how this butchered the original, which much better than this pile of Cameron's Mexican dump, you can find them on YouTube. They do make it seems like it's rather minor, but the visual completely turns Yugo's motivation for getting out of the city around. It turns from tragic and sad to reckless and stupid. He has a nice stable life down in the city, yet endanger himself to escape from what we were told as terrible yet portrayed as very beautiful on screen. The dissonance is rather interesting. Hido's changes turns his night activity into a form of revenge, which he accepts his ""replacement family member' joining in the dangerous works quite lightly. You would think he would be torn, but he rather nodded pretty quickly. That's because it's for plot convenience, as we know. They also turned Nova into some sort of shadowy figure behind the events. While he does play a part, Cameron expertly dumped all of the complexity and philosophical musing out of the window with his version of Nova. The comic portrays everyone as grey, and very few are evil. The heart of the story of hope in a world destroyed by humanity's desire. The image of life was very centric in most of the conflicts. Gally being carried like a baby by Ido while he salvages for parts. Gally's landing next to a sprouted plant at the end of volume 5 or 6. Beginning of that act started with yet, revenge, revenge for lost lives. The movie did away with the theme of the comic and dumb it down to a super hero origin. I have a favourable view of ""GitS"" adaption, now that this mess was made.",Alita - Battle Angel
2227,welongs,The best,10,6 April 2021,"Yes, I don't know what to say, this movie I think is the best, Alita she has a character who does not give up easily, many can also take the positive side in this film, the storyline is not as bad as I think, and we are taken to a world of the future that is very epic in my opinion, and that's cool, the emotional side in this film is very thick , and also Father Figure Like Dr. Ido (Christoph Waltz) is very good, but unfortunately in the ending of the film is very hanging, I hope this movie has a sequel, that's what everyone wants, we want to know again how Alita's struggle will be :)",Alita - Battle Angel

I didn't read any reviews and had no expectation when I went into the cinema. But Alita the movie caught me by surprise! Every minute every second I was enjoying it. It's absolutely amazing. From the moment I walked out of the theatre to when I went home, I was so exited to have seen a movie which stirred so much excitement in me in many ways. It's just like when I first saw T2 when I was much younger and I have to say that since then, no movie has ""wowed"" me like Alita. It's the best movie in the last decade. I haven't been so excited about a movie for long. Well done! I kept on researching on the movie and to my surprise, the reviews are mixed. I would recommend anyone who has doubts to watch it in person and I really look forward to a sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel
2231,jameswwfilm,Anime has finally come on board!,9,5 February 2019,"I've always loved Anime, and it's always been frustrating watching Hollywood movies destroy it (Ghost in the shell). Alita however did an amazing job in fusing Hollywood and Anime. I believe it was a great story adaptation by James Cameron, breathtaking action scenes and directing by Rodriguez, and great casting. I saw this in 4DX 3D in Seoul and It was a roller coaster ride. I was afraid the movie might put me to sleep, but it kept me engaged and watching from beginning to end. I think the most important element for movies should be the ability to engage the audience and never let them go until the very end. This movie delivers. And also I am very proud of Director Rodriguez for taking on this enormous task. He put a lot on the line to make this film.
An interesting thing I found was for some reason I felt there were elements of John Carpenter here.
Overall one of the best 3D films made so far. I believe the bar has been pushed higher for all filmmakers. A must watch in 3D exerpience!",Alita - Battle Angel

2236,maxlaca,Loved it!,9,17 March 2019,"Short version: Go see it!
Plus: Great love story, just short of Romeo and Juliet, not cheesy at all. Great FX and action - leaves Ready Player One, etc. in the Dust.Minus: I have to say that, after some days, I was fine with this issue, which is the most likely reason, why this film did not do as well as it should have: Unconventional Film Arch: There may be some disappointments because the arc may have been written to be a Trilogy.Longer version:
Since the ancient Greek, the idea of an Automaton, or a self-operating machine, has brought nightmares and visions to authors, inventors and regular folks, alike. Humanoid robots and thinking machines are as intriguing as they are terrifying. And with our current rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Machines, the prospect of true automatons and human-machine hybrid organisms, is more real and present, than ever.
Contemporary authors (i.e. Isaac Asimov, William Gibson) have explored the human-machine symbiosis in various scenarios with various outcomes. But the dystopian version of this man-machine future is prevalent. As it is in this wonderful film.The story in the film explores a very emotional aspect of this future, the possibility and potential of love, between humans and machines, and offers a space to explore our own perceptions of where the boundaries between the two may lie. When do cybernetically enhanced humans lose their humanity and become machines, and when do machines that are capable of individual thought and conscious or emotional awareness, become human? And does the degree of 'machine-ness' reflect anything about the degree of 'human-ness'?The story rejects the idea of boundaries between human or machine consciousness and experience and elevates it (the human-made machine) to be our equal as a conscious and feeling entity. The depiction of this elevation, in the film, stops short of a total abandonment of human 'flesh' components, and symbolically encases the abstract concept of humanity in the (tokenized) humanoid brain of the machine. But I found that the story gave me plenty of space to incorporate my own ideas and thoughts, about our potential cybernetic future, and the looming future of an unknowable artificial super intelligence, that may terrorize and rule over us, forever.I really loved the film and very much hope that these two power players, Cameron and Rodgriguez, will be able to give us two more Alita films!",Alita - Battle Angel

2240,AwHec3,Compelling,10,4 March 2019,"I went in thinking a few things about what this movie was and found that it was not what I expected. The fact that it had a few actors was some of the reason why I went ahead and ponied up the money for it. It was well worth the time spent to watch, in fact the story though well told in different stories I have watched had a unique way that it was acted out by those same actors I have liked to see in the movies they have been in like Rosa Salazar, Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali and others so needless to say it surprised and entertained and kept me glued and fulfilled a story line and left enough open to allow for further story and with that make you want more. So overall pretty Great. Anyway it also goes to show that a story can have a good strong willed woman/girl who is a heroine who does go thru the complex situations in it that mimic life and although we don't have the superpowers the reality of the issues we go thru in life is prevalent in a great story such as this.",Alita - Battle Angel

And don't judge girl by her cover. This innocent looking young lady is 300 years old cyborg with most enchanting eyes, killing machine and expert in almost lost fighting art of Panzer kunst. It's very likely that you will have a great time watching this movie if you don't analyse it too much and watch it open mind and light heart. Plot is great, tons of content stuffed in 2h movie, but it is also kept simple and it never gets confusing. Characters are great, top musical score, nice cgi, it definitely ticks a lot of good sci fi and cyberpunk boxes.

2258,vrajak,An astoundingly beautiful dive into manga/anime based sci fi.,8,20 February 2019,"TLDR: If you enjoy robot based sci fi action, this movie is probably up your alley.Alita: Battle Angel is a really interesting and atypical big budget action movie based on Japanese manga source material. This is the source of its oddness, and what I suspect will put off some viewers - Alita sticks to its guns (or rather swords, since guns are banned) to a strong degree, and as a result the movie it self resembles a typical manga, with several arcs, and some expected turns such as defeated foes showing up much more powerful than before, and the main character has a mysterious backstory she discovers over the course of the movie.Alita herself is a marvel of motion-capture and CGI. She's so lifelike and expressive it's by turns beautiful and painful to watch. Things get even better when she squares off against a variety of monstrous cyborgs with truly thrilling combat to behold. The action here does not disappoint.I can see why not everyone loves this movie, its unusual for something with this much budget, and notable names attached to it like James Cameron producing, or oscar nominated actors putting in appearances. Alita herself is strongly acted, and the supporting cast is mostly good, though some of them are underused.There's a chance for 2 more movies! I'm hoping they make them as I want more of this gorgeous, dysfunctional world.If you want something a big different, check out Alita!",Alita - Battle Angel

I've seen it 15 times now and not for one second ha e I been bored, in fact for some reason this film makes my tears flow, I think after viewing the film for the first time, I can concentrate on the emotions rather than what is going to happen, and I think the music score is so brilliant at conveying the Passion of Alitas journey from innocence to heart break and revenge, go and see it, it is a Cameron /Rodriguez masterpiece of a cinema experience",Alita - Battle Angel

They say this film was in production hell since 2001, taking inspiration straight from the original manga; the movie pushed me into wanting to discover more about the world and it's character, which is why I already started reading the manga series, not knowing if this movie will ever get the recognition it deserves or if the viewers will get to appreciate it for what it is

When I got out, all I knew was I wanted more and I mean more. I vary rarely ever saw a movie more than once at the theater, but I actually had the need to go out and see it again... and the again and again. Watching this movie you may find yourself addicted to itIt's a sci-fi dystopian world that we learn about the world this takes place in through Alita's. Any exposition dialog, seems natural when they say stuff, they do it because it would be natural for the character to say it in a conversation, and not just for the audiences sake.Our female lead Alita, seems actually feminine and bad ass, in a very natural way. Rosa's performance is simply outstanding as is all the other great actors in the movie. You will see several characters grow and evolve, not only a hero's journey but a story of finding yourself and growing up, you'll understand the villains motives, you'll see a hero that inspires others to be better not by their incredible ability to kick ass, but through their example and emotions.The action will be probably the best action you have ever seen, and it's not a bit gory.",Alita - Battle Angel

For a very long time this is the first time i didnt ask myself after it why the hero acted like an idiot. When you watch superhero movies (too much drama out of nothing) it looks like those heroes remember to use superpowers in the very end, however its obvious they could use same things before. Not this time. Alita can lose. She is strong, but not invulnerable.
Every person in this movie has a background and very simple but still reasonable motive. Some of them are naive, but remember that almost all of them are humans.Give this movie a chance, its so much different from the superhero serial we often see.

2268,stephenclarke1-974-874537,A fantasic movie going experience,9,26 February 2019,"Alita Battle Angel is a beautiful film with state of the Art effects, a beautiful heroes journey type story, with a love back story. It also stays very close the the Manga/Anime unlike for example Ghost in the shell.The editing and pacing is perfect. There are set ups and pay offs. It has a great sound track. The fight choreography is amazing. You really care for these characters and are emotionally invested.The effects again are cutting edge. You haven't seen this before. The CGI is blended seamlessly between live action and Animation.There is little to none ""uncanny valley effect"" in the motion capture, and the actress gives an Andy Serkis worthy performance.For the first movie the World - building is incredible.The 2 hours go by so fast. It was produced by James Cameron and it shows, it has that polish and above all heart, there is a ""Titanic"" moment ha ha but its done well.
Like Titanic I expect this film to do well by word of mouth. I haven't enjoyed a movie so much since Blade runner 2049.I would encourage you to see it in the best theatre possible, (IMAx if possible) the 3D is done using the new generation of Technology that cameron invented for the new Avatar Films. At least go see it in a Dolby/vison/Atmos cinema.
You won't be disappointed. It has an ""old school feel"" and there is not a hint of SJW politics.
Its just a beautiful film - Believe me you haven't seen anything like it yet, you may be crying on moment then laughing.The film resonates with you, and I and a lot of others are planning to see it again.

After finally watching the movie last night at the ""Experience: Alita"" advanced screening, I am now humbly going to admit that I am truly glad he waited for the technology to finally catch up. Alita is incredible as a CGI character and we manga/anime fans FINALLY have a worthy adaptation to something we love & cherish. The action: fight & Motorball scenes are INSANE in 3D. A few gripes: it needed a cryptic & artfully done intro to this world and Ido, the city crowd shots looked overly rehashed and at the end (SPOILERS) the film fast forwards too much when Rodriguez really should have ended with her next struggle to rise up from her start-out position. Hopefully, they'll start the sequel before that end sequence and wrap it around. If you have daughters, especially share this with them; Alita is an incredible science fiction hero.",Alita - Battle Angel
2275,silviohernandez,Pleasantly surprised.,10,2 March 2019,"Ultimately a story of accepting your role, or is it more of accepting a path? Or maybe it's a movie of challenging perceived notions of what is expected/ the norm. To trivialize this film as just one singular theme is to sell it short. This isn't a review as much as it is a suggestion to see the movie. With Alita: Battle Angel all the trope check marks are there. Great action, decent acting, beautiful set pieces and escapism at its finest. It's something packed with lore that you know for the sake of its run time has to be crammed into this neat 2 hour package but as the viewer you can't help but want more information. To me that's the sign of a good film. I know there's plenty of source material and venues to fill in the gaps of the lore of Alita's world yet I still want more of THIS world as seen through the eyes of Robert Rodriguez & James Cameron. For now multiple viewings will have to be what tides me over in hopes of a sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel

I really enjoy the idea and caracters",Alita - Battle Angel

And I feels proud to do so, I am a fan of Robert Rodriguez and James Cameron , some writer have amazing talent and Cameron is one of the few which able to create worlds... which make you forget of reality, This story is based of a manga, well follow the original story with good add-ons. include deep characters. appealing script. action, romantic, fantasy and charms.
amazing CGI. and Details. as camaron always know how to (this is or Camaron movie or Ridley Scott style none other director have the capacity to make genius movie like this two giants...)
Really hope that will be a continue to serie of alita. It leaves taste for more....",Alita - Battle Angel
2278,bradley_ryden,As soon as it ended I wanted to watch it again,10,17 February 2019,"I wasn't familiar with this movie except from the trailers so I wasn't a fan but it looked interesting so I gave it a shot. I'm kind of a movie guy and for reference lots of movies that are popular I think suck. However the pacing of this film is spot on, not a moment wasted nor a scene drawn out to make the film longer than it should be. Be prepared before you start this movie because there's no time to use the restroom or get popcorn. The story really draws you in and you feel that you can identify with her on some level. The CG is the best I've seen and the story is very inspiring. There's not a dull moment in this movie. It's very climactic, we'll directed, great performance by the actors and great script. I was so blown away that I wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over and so did my brother! So I did and my wife said the same thing as soon as it ended! Neither of us have ever said that before right after the ending! I'm gonna watch it a third time and she can't wait to buy it on Blu-ray.",Alita - Battle Angel
2279,praisethelove,Perfect film,10,1 August 2020,VIsuals were astounding. Story was great. Alita was charming and relatable. Action scenes kept you on the edge of your seat. You were intimidated by the bad guys. Best film I've seen in a long time. It takes you completely out of reality for a while as you step into the world of Alita. Highly recommended.,Alita - Battle Angel

2283,elschreurs,Fun flashy picture and some great performances but the film needed focus,6,10 July 2019,"Okay, I liked the movie but some of the performances were wooden from great actors like Christoph Waltz and Mahershalla Ali who we've seen do great work, such a disappointment. This I blame on the director Rodriguez, for the odd acting of Vector and Waltz's Ido. They felt very muted, no contrast. Christoph felt to me like he wanted to get it over with.Rosa nailed her performance and I rooted for her through the whole movie. Her romantic match in the movie gave me nothing as a character plus his arc was back and forth - he wasn't a like-able guy and I was annoyed to during his screen time. I'd watch the movie all over again for her sweetness and pure believability as her character exploring her new world. Speaking of worlds, I wish it was more explained such as The Fall, Motorball, URM. I haven't read any of comics or other content from this story so being new, many parts felt like I should've known if I were a fan.I don't like the ending and I understand that it's setting up a second movie but how flagrantly it was done is annoying and I felt shortchanged in the end. This is because the villain wasn't strong enough because the main villain was kind of Zapan? (threshold guardian) Or Gerwishka? Another threshold guardian)Or Vector? (Technically a threshold guardian, but was propped up as The Shadow) Or Nova? (Who is The Shadow but made like a cameo, it's like Thanos showing up in Thor:Ragnarok and Thanos is the baddie to beat but Thor doesn't ever get the chance to beat him)Who does she have to overcome? I'm not that naive to not know who it was but during the movie I even asked this in my head, ""wait, why are we spending so much time on this one?"" In her triumph I felt underwhelmed.If the film was more focused, the stakes were better laid out - if you don't stop X then Y will happen - and Hugo's character wasn't a mess, maybe this would be higher up on my sci fi list. Speaking of Sci Fi, the environments were great, definitely lived in. How in the hell is Zalem ""suspended"" or supported like that. See paragraph two!Flashy fun images and enjoy it for those a!",Alita - Battle Angel
2284,justinharlock,It's amazing,9,3 March 2019,"I haven't been this excited about a movie in a long time. I read and loved the Battle Angel Alita manga years ago, and I have a soft spot for the anime version too. I was cautiously hopeful for this film, but afraid that a Hollywood-ized version of the story would disappoint me. It didn't. I was captivated and filled with joy from the first minute. Everything about Alita's character won me over completely. I thought the movie was visually stunning, exciting, and most important, convincing. They made many changes from the original, but none of them ruin it -- because the story still works, because so much in the movie is just done so well, and because the heart of the story, the core, is still there. It's amazing and wonderful and I love it. Sequels please! Please?",Alita - Battle Angel
2285,ogamawab,Great,10,15 February 2019,"This movie is a great movie, the storyline it's very interesting. The story of a girl. I would recommend this movie to watch. If you are a cyberpunk this is a movie for you. If you're looking for adventure this is a movie for you.",Alita - Battle Angel
2286,martinnhenningsen,Everything I could have wished for,9,11 February 2019,"As a long time fan of the manga, I both feared and looked forward to this adaptation.

2287,aseymour3113,Didn't know much about Alita to begin with,8,9 March 2019,"I thought this was a pretty good movie. Before I saw the first trailer drop I really didn't know much about this Title. I am glad I went to go see it. I only had 2 issues with the movie. 1 Dr. Dyson nurse, Nurse Gerhad, should have had more lines in the film. She is a good actress. I felt she was just in the background. 2 Hugo was kinda a little B with an Itch. Too baby-ish. Other than that the movie was Good. CGI was amazing. Christoph Waltz Always hit his mark and is a great actor. Rosa Salazar is AMAZING. She is a great actress and should be proud of Alita. I hope she gets many offers after this. Other than that go see this movie. Well done.",Alita - Battle Angel
2288,frut_loops,Alita: Battle AMAZING,9,11 February 2019,I am going to keep this short and sweet. This movie was awesome from start to finish. The action and 3d was excellent. Will definitely be watching this again and again.,Alita - Battle Angel

2290,davebaxter-234-220871,This film touches your heart and makes you believe in humanity!,9,20 February 2019,"I know nothing of the source material for Alita, but when I saw the eyes of the Alita character, excellently portrayed by Rosa Salazar (I'm aware she is CGI), but those eyes alone drew me in and made me want to know what lingers behind them. I was not disappointed at all! Alita has the heart of a real ""Angel"", the guts of a soldier and the ability to balance both in a way that makes it impossible for you to not love her. I know that movies like this are hard to get sequels made, but after seeing this, I hope they realize that Alita is an amazing character whose story can not be left hanging. Don't leave this without an ending. Not that the ending wasn't amazing in itself, but I can see that there is so much more to explore with this world and this girl and I pray that we all get that chance. If you saw the trailer and thought that this is going to be just some dumb sci-fi futuristic film that you can easily pass on, well then, you are only letting yourself down. Alita is a TRUE Battle Angel that fights for life, family, friends and of course love! Nothing will stop this Angel and nothing should stop those responsible for bringing us more of her. Go. See. This. Movie. NOW!",Alita - Battle Angel

2292,wingnow,This is an entertaining movie to watch.,9,9 February 2019,"Haven't watch the manga before, and I love this movie. Before watching the movie, I thought Alita's eyes is too big and look a little strange, just like many people did. But After watching it, I have changed my mind. They have done a great job and Alita is so cute. The action is awesome, the sci-fi scene is awesome. The only one thing not great is the plot. The plot is a little bit off and not doing a very good job. I believe the plot will be much better in the coming sequel, if they have one. This is the movie that deserve more love.",Alita - Battle Angel

No. Would I watch another? Yes.",Alita - Battle Angel
2298,ra46191,One of my all time favorites.,10,29 April 2019,A great movie. Very well adapted from Japanese manga. The characters were very well done done wonderful actors and CGI magic. First movie I have been to watch in theaters multiple times.,Alita - Battle Angel
2299,SmellyPillow,A rollercoaster ride that will take you aback...and then leave you wanting more,8,15 February 2019,"If you were wondering if you should watch this movie, yes you should; just be emotionally and mentally prepared.I'm quite surprised at the PG13 rating of this movie in my country. The producers probably tried their best to squeeze it juuust within the limits (one vulgarity, duration of gore barely within the limit, etc.)
The pacing of the relationships' and characters' development felt odd and too fast at times, perhaps because there was too much to cover. Just when I started getting attached to any character...bam. ""Too bad."" -- ProducersOn the other hand, the fight scenes and action scenes are spectacular -- and my favourite part of the movie. They will get your heart pumping, trust me.
I also really like Dr. Ido's character - he seems like a dad who simply cares and wants the best for his daughter - and feel slightly sad for him as well, having to go through so much to help Alita. Parents are amazing!I was (and still am) taken aback by the animation and special effects. I feel that it is a great feat to be able to bridge the boundary between the virtual and real world. Technology is at its best when it simply disappears. When you don't have to focus on or think about it. When the emotions and story are the things that come through. This movie succeeds beautifully in doing that. Many times I forgot I was looking at CG due to how absorbing the whole movie is.When the credits rolled, it felt as if I had finally completed (or started) a long journey. I was emotionally and mentally drained, but in a good way.At the end of the day, why do we watch movies? For me, it's to have a mind-blowing, unique, memorable and most importantly, satisfying experience. This movie didn't feel like 2 hours at all. I was eager for more at the end. That means something to me.
Ultimately, the question is ""Is this an experience worth having? An experience worth spending time on? Or one that can be missed?"" I'd say if you have the chance to catch this in the cinemas at least once, it'll be an adventure to remember. You might not leave the cinemas feeling completely satisfied, to be honest, but I mean that in a good way. It's a movie that will leave you wanting more, and for me, a re-watch at least once, because I didn't catch too many things.One thing's for sure though, this movie will keep you thinking about it for some time after you've watched it. And not about how bad it is, but quite the opposite.To all the producers, writers, animators, actors, actresses, composers and everyone else who helped bring this film to life, thank you so much! Pleeeeease let there be a sequel ><P.S. My first review. Hope I'm able to bring value to at least one reader! :)",Alita - Battle Angel

2312,jonathanjohnpaul,One of the best things modern day cinema has given us.,10,22 February 2019,"""You just made the biggest mistake of your life.""
""And what's that?""
""Underestimating who I am.""These words were mentioned in the movie and will immensely resonate with those who watched it with no expectation or underestimated it. I had no idea who this character was and the trailers in the past months barely left an impression. That being said, I walked out from the cinema hall having being rocked to my core by this masterpiece and shamelessly had to watch it another 4 times.(More viewings to come)We've seen countless character from books brought to life on the big screen but this was something different. It is quite apparent that the guys who produced this, deeply loved the source material so much that it has translated into a phenomenal movie experience. More importantly, you'll not only be drawn to Alita but also the world building and the story arc that keeps expanding.Alita being the heart and soul of this movie has her presence fortified by the world she's subjected to. Her endearing character is a concoction of fearless determination and a matured sense of innocence portrayed in an emotionally captivating manner.Take note that this movie takes a few dark turns and is quite merciless. Set 500 years in the future, the world she's in, is quite an intriguing prognosis on what our future might look like. The story explores the notion whether something pure and innocent still has a place in a world bordering on total loss of morality. It also examines how a person with amnesia embraces her omnipotence and identity while dealing with loss. Dr. Ido's character synergizes perfectly with Alita on her road to rediscovery, by guiding her conscience with his fatherly wisdom and care.I understand that there's been a lot of noise about Alita's eyes. When you watch the movie you'll understand that it was necessary to convey Alita's character in an engaging and effective manner employing the philosophy of ""the eyes are windows to the soul"". It just works perfectly.On that note, this is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made with high stakes and profound premises along with Alita making a compelling argument of being one of the best sci-fi characters there is.Do watch it to believe it and I'd fully recommend that you watch it in its filmed format that is IMAX 3D as the visuals and action are on an insane level.Strongly hope it does well to green light a sequel because you'll be begging for one after the major reveal at the end.Score : 10/10",Alita - Battle Angel
2313,sr-cordeiro,"Good story adaptation, bad world recreation.",6,8 March 2019,"I will start to say I'm a big fan of the original manga, probably my favorite Japanese graphic novel series alongside Akira.I knew this movie would never be as good and deep as the original material, for that it had to be 10+ episode series with the biggest budget on the entertainment history. I was ready to accept a reorganization and synthesis of the source story to fit a 2 hour movie and I actually think they did a good job in resuming the first parts of the manga.The Alita character is perfect, really spot-on. The overall cast is good too, only Edward Norton as Dr. Nova didn't feel right to me as he didn't look extravagant and dangerously crazy, lacking the charisma of a very important character in the series.The main turn down for me was the overall ambiance and tone of the movie. The movie feels too ""light"", lacks the dark and visually violent tone of the manga. I believe this deviation from the source material isn't just something aesthetic and superficial since on a technical level it is perfect, all very well done and believable. But I think that if it had that grittiness of the manga the movie would really gain some extra point in everyone's view: the juxtaposition of such a inhabitable and dangerous place with the few good people Alita has the luck to find would make a deeper impact on a emotional level.Even the clothes choice is very questionable since there were a lot of preoccupation for the characters to look stylish instead of a ""ragged"" which would serve much better the narrative.All this details and the major violence tone-down make me believe there were major constraints on this movie for it to be able to appeal to a younger audience. Such a pity since as I said before, the actual story adaptation is actually good.Having said all this, I enjoyed the movie and I'm giving it a positive feedback. Not sure that if I hadn't this emotional connection with the manga I would enjoy it less or if I would like it more since there wouldn't be constant comparisons wandering in my mind.Looking forward for the sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel

I left thinking, ""What a great movie"". I didn't particularly care for the ending, but hope they make a sequel that justifies it. I fell in love with the Alita Character and the visual affects used to make this movie were awesome. A all around fun action Sci-Fi movie with a little innocent romance and robots/ 1/2 robots.

To my surprise, I was engrossed in this film from beginning to end. The source material is amazing and you can tell the filmmakers felt the same way because they did a fantastic job at staying faithful to the manga and not ""Americanizing"" the story or characters or dumb-ing them down.If you haven't read the manga, maybe you'll be lucky like I was and your local library will have the entire collection on hand. I read them about 15 years ago and it stuck with me just like Ender's Game and The Giver did. The OVA is just as good, so I higly recommend that.This movie is definitely worth a watch.

I've been an anime fan for many years and always wanted to see a great Hollywood cross-over. Not that it's important, but there is so much to discover in terms of anime, a good movie like this will encourage cinema goers to maybe, take an interest in the rich pickings available.
Anyway, this movie absorbed me. They seemed to pack a lot in and at times I wondered if I was about to watch the climatic battle scene, only to happily find out that there was more to come.
In fact I didn't want it to stop. But when it did, my brain processed it and came to the conclusion that Alita : Battle Angel rocked.

I loved every second of the Film. The cast was on point and the world they build was absolutly stunning. The CGI is nex level. The fighing scenes blew me away.
Yeah, they alterd the origninal Story in some aspects but it didnt bother me at all.This movie is hands down the BEST adaptation of a Manga / Anime I saw until now and I can only highly recomend watching this Movie. Its really freaking good! I so hope there will be a sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel
2327,aaronwilliford1,Awesome movie from start to finish!,10,2 July 2019,"I was not expecting a great movie when I watched Alita: Battle Angel. The cast is what mostly attracted me to this movie, namely Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, but mostly the esteemed and incredibly talented Christoph Waltz. However, I found that from the very beginning I felt an endearing attraction to not only the main character/protagonist Alita, played most capably by Rosa Salazar, but also to her search for identity and meaning in a world she does not remember or understand. I am generally turned off by the fancy CGI used in most movies nowadays, most commonly and simply utilized to add a flashy edge or ""techy"" aesthetic to a movie that normally would not stand on it's own without it. In Alita I was pleasantly surprised, not only at how much the CGI actually complimented the appeal of film, but also that it was used contextually and appropriately rather than attempting for the CGI itself to be the appeal of the film. The setting, the characters, the storyline, and the history and lore that the film presents as it's basis were all entertaining and immersive. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I would LOVE to see a sequel some day!",Alita - Battle Angel

You made my movie Year.,9,22 August 2019,"Stop Go watch this movie!It is Refreshing, action packed, and so amacingly directed, It really shows that the producer and Director, Understood the source material, while bringing it to the big audience.
I am no comicbook nerd, but i loved the story, even if it was a little predictable, but that did not matter, with such great performances from the cast, they did a fine job, and made it feel warm and fantastic.
Great cgi , perfectly balanced with action humor, and dident need to hide any flaws with silly misreplaced humor.

It is so fare the best Sci-Fi action movies this year, and the last 3 years have offered..! and i Meen it. :-)So the reason i did not give it 10 stars, was that i felt it would be too much to put on it..beacause the lack of media covverage they gave it.. ;-)So now go tell your best friends about this movie and watch it with them.

Just saw this movie. Daughter and I had heard about it at vidcon in Anaheim this past summer. We were looking forward to watching it. I did read all the negative comments and reviews. My expectations dwindled as a result.I've come to realize that those that cast negativity, most likely, themselves, could never put together a better of production. Also, if the critics say one thing, it's usually the opposite for this commoner.That being said, we really enjoyed this movie with all the action, twists and yes even young love. Can't forget the amazing CGI. I'd see this movie again and we hope that there will be a part 2, we'd definitely go see it. Btw it's a must see in IMAX.",Alita - Battle Angel

Since Last Jedi I have decided not to watch any reviews before seeing the movie myself. I watched an early screening yesterday and I were not disappointed. Reading up on some of the reviews after I were very surprised to find that especially the very first reviews from the press screenings were actually rather negative.

I really hope there comes a trilogy, because it is worth it. Don't lissen to the critic snobs they don't know what they talking about.

2351,KingofyourCastle,"Entertaining movie, but too teenager-oriented",7,20 February 2019,"This movie is yet another one that chose to pander to teenage audiences although the source material does not really qualify. We are talking about graphic bloody violence - not exactly PG-13 material. And it shows. Alita as the protagonist is both the fierce fighter and the naive teenager. She is both innocent, caring and able to commit brutal acts without second thoughts. You could call her a psychopath teenager, and nobody seems to care about this contradictions. The different parts of her character don't seem to match.
The movie pacing is a bit slow in the first half, but it picks up as soon as Alita goes to ""work"", so to speak.

I am so excited for this movie and can not wait to hear that a sequel is green lit. From the beginning to the end this movie is exciting and fascinating. The action and fighting was so cool in every fight seen and had me spellbound at many scenes. It was an amazing experience watching Alita's character change throughout the movie and learn who she actually is, throughout the movie you can't help falling in love with this amazing badass character. Besides the action there is a incredibly interesting world that the movie is set in, one that leaves you wondering with interest where Alita comes from, her past and also what else is going on in the world of Iron City. I would love to even see a prequel For Alita that could maybe explain the war and the battle between Mars and Earth and who the Berserkers are. I love that this movie was set up for a sequel, I can't wait to see more of Alita, motorball and of this interesting futuristic world. Please support this cinematic spectacle and wonderful exciting movie, I wrote this review because I love this movie, my new #1 favorite futuristic sci-fi now and the coolest fight scenes have ever seen in a movie and I've seen a lot of movies. I wrote this after finding out that critics have been writing a bunch of untrue crap reviews about the movie and I want to see this movie get the attention and love that it deserves. Please support the movie by going out and seeing its awesomeness for yourself and share it with friends and family that way this movie will get a sequel.

I'm not just saying this because i love CGI movies its simply beacause of those amazing action sequences which was not possible to accomplish only with live action approach.

The visuals are wonderful, shaping a future world still reeling from a war three hundred years prior. WETA seamlessly blends CGI performance capture and real actors in an impressive manner. It becomes easy to accept Alita as a real, living, breathing individual. An initial viewing the film can be seen as shallow and without any real ""meat."" When thinking on the characters, words they say and action they take, scenes and dialogue have a different meaning, at least for me. This made the characters seem deeper than I originally thought them to be. In any case, despite it's flaws, Alita is on my top five favorite movies. It is a blast to watch, easy to enjoy and well worth the ticket.",Alita - Battle Angel

Also, Alita ( Rosa Salazar) was so compelling, compassionate and endearing, one wanted so much to see her vanquish her foes.

Alita is one of the most likeable protagonists I've seen in a while. She almost makes you not care about the others (well, except Ido). And man, is the soundtrack phenomenal too thanks to the work of Tom Holkenborg. It is outright disappointing that as of right now a sequel has either been delayed or isn't in the works.

There are a few cheesy and predictable parts, a couple unnecessarily violent kill scenes, and a plot like Swiss cheese.But, like any James Cameron movie, the CGI and special effects were outstanding. Alita's eyes were over the top, but everything looks beautiful.It was an entertaining story, and perhaps my favorite part, it was an innovative and original creation. This isn't a movie that you come in knowing half the plot, because it follows the standard ""Hero's Journey"" cycle.

2385,aaronkinghim,Quite a deviation from the original anime,4,9 February 2019,"First of all, the visual looks amazing, but to me, it can't save the plot and the essential element of the original.I watched the OVA but not the manga of Gunnm (which is the name of the original anime) and I think the major difference between the two is the connection between Alita and Hugo.Alita, in the film she is like a teenager who is rebellious against his father ,Igo, for his lover Hugo. It sounds odd to me because Alita in the OVA is more than that. Alita is depicted as a figure that is so pure and innocence inside the cruel and dirty Iron City in the original and Hugo is a boy who will do anything to achieve his dream which is to go to Zalem at all cost. Indeed, he is ruthless about it, but at the same time this dream to Zalem is also so pure. Hugo truly believes Zalem is a utopia. The two of them share the same kind of pureness and innocence in the filthy iron city, which is the essence of the OVA, but this feeling is lost in the new film as teenage crush.The film is not good not only because it does not stick to the OVA but also a plot that is too loose.",Alita - Battle Angel

3. Alita's captivating charisma coming from both the design of the character and Rosa Salazar's wonderful acting.I'm not saying the movie is perfect. The characters remained relatively one-dimensional, and I thought that the love story wasn't credible enough to carry the weight that the plot put on it.But whatever, which movie has it all? It is a manga, a fantasy, like a dream. Don't ask it to be what it is not. A different way to put it is that it is more emotional than intellectual. It is exciting, engaging, heartwarming and fun. Carrying it all is the character of Alita who by her heart and energy and humanity leaves you no choice but to see her as real and want her to win.",Alita - Battle Angel
2397,bamatocha,A 3D Joy Ride!!!,10,19 February 2019,"I will make this review short. If you like action, science fiction, killer graphics and amazing 3D then you will like this movie. I was on the edge of my seat through most of the action scenes and when the movie was over I wanted more. I don't go to the movies for sappy love stories or dramas nominated for awards, I go to be entertained and this movie delivered. If you like movies that take you on a joyride then go see Alita and see it in 3D, I recommend IMAX, you will be glad.",Alita - Battle Angel
2398,painterskip,Way better than I expected....why did I not no of this before it reached HBO?,9,9 February 2020,"Loved this movie. Especially the first part.....probably the first 75 minutes, where Alita is just figuring things out. Great story, visuals, acting. I especially liked the doctor. Not sure why...maybe because he was believable?
And since I sort of saw bits and pieces first and then checked out the info online before I watched the entire movie, I knew that James Cameron had his hand in this, and while watching the movie, it shows. And that's a good thing.
I just wish I had seen this on a big screen.

But I was so surprised by how much I loved this movie. The story in Alita: Battle Angel is spot on and so are the visuals. This is one of the best looking films of this generation. The action in the movie is great as well. All I can say is go see this amazing movie with a character that you will care about. This movie makes me want to read the books and know more about Alita.

2404,Vogonphoto,Best movie I have seen in a while.,9,24 July 2019,"I didn't see this in theaters and I am kicking myself for it.On a technical level, this movie is marvelous. I can only think of maybe three points in the movie, probably combining for less than ten seconds, where things do didn't look 100% real. In terms of the realism of Alita herself, it was very believable, down to the smallest detail.It was visually stunning and the action scenes were believable, well choreographed, and not ridiculously over the top. It was straightforward, you knew what was going on, and there wasn't clutter. The cinematography was on point.The music fit but was not memorable in any way.The story didn't stray far from the 1993 anime. I never read the manga, so I don't know how faithful it was.It was a normal rise-of-a-superhero plot that didn't bring anything new to the table, but it also wasn't bland and boring. Think of eating a delicious pepperoni pizza. You've had it a hundred times before, you know what it should taste like, the cook didn't change the recipe, but it was delicious.I don't know if Disney will make a sequel to this or even if I want them to.For aesthetics, visuals, cinematography and everything related, I give it a 10. For story and characters, I give it an 8. And my third category, how the movie makes me feel when it's over, I give it a 10. Overall that rounds to a score of 9/10.",Alita - Battle Angel

Alita would be the exception. Loved the animation, the CGI details on Alita was awesome. I love the interaction between Ido and Alita, wished there was more on Waltz's expressing his paternal love. There is a scene there with Hugo that I felt a bit too much but I like how this heroine is vulnerable as she is strong making it feel like Alita is almost real. I wish they could use Keean a bit more than just the love interest though. He's gorgeous and he would have been Alita's awesome sidekick.

This is a must for Sci-Fi fans out there but it is worth to give a try even if you are not into that normally.Sadly i had to watch the dubbed (german) version, so i cant wait to see it again in OV.I rarely watch movies german, but i was glad that the talented Christoph Waltz dubbed his own character in the german version.",Alita - Battle Angel

A wonderful story for a start of a franchise, if enough support it. A movie without all the unnecessary elements added for 'fanfare'. And No cheesy dialogue during intense moments that are always used especially near the endind and ending.
Alita is a movie that has to be SEEN in the THEATER, the BIG SCREEN; IMAX 3D was fantastic! Have not seen it in other formats yet; and those would definitely lesson the Spectacular viewing entertainment aspect for myself, but definitely not the story.
This is coming from somebody who goes to the movies 1 to 2 a year. It has to be worth the screen time for me due to chronic pain n other conditions (GWS). All others are from home.
I'm guessing the lack of fanfare: sex, nudity, language, and such; and also the critics stating in the begining not liking this type of films or manga gave it the low scores.",Alita - Battle Angel

I just don't get it! Is there no story to tell beside teenage love??? How about the love between the ""stepfather"" and Alita? The doctor's love just disappeared after she ran off THE biggest and most dangerous contest? No ""I love you babe so don't do that again I was really worried"" or ""I'll take care of your beloved bf don't you worry"" father scene? And the ""stepmom""... Seriously, what's wrong with this character, it just doesn't make sense at all. I mean did she still love the doctor? Wasn't she an evil queen wanted power over the city? And, she did know what her man is capable of and instead of running or hiding for a bit, she went back to him announced that ""I betrayed you"" and thought she could walk away?Despite all those, the main question is still, WHY DO ALL STORIES HAVE TO BE LOVE STORIES???

Alita has the freedom to be treated as a great character and not as a vehicle for a polical statement. A huge leap forward in any instance. She is a great, strong, relatable, female character.A universal human experience !Thoughtfully planned, thoroughly executed, beautifully crafted.
Jim Cameron and Robert Rodriguez really raised the bar with this movie.",Alita - Battle Angel
2428,nickkchin,It really needs 11 stars,10,2 April 2019,"The movie was stunning and brilliant in its artistic vision and technical depth.

See it while you can. See it early. See it often.",Alita - Battle Angel
2429,stevp-09878,Slow Start With But Fantastic Set Peices and Salazar Make it Shine,9,9 February 2019,"I was looking forward to this movie and it did not disappoint. Though slow to start, with a lot of world building tossed in, and admittedly some chunky and cheesy dialogue, the eye popping CGI makes it well worth it. The main character of Alita played by Rosa Salazar is the star, megapixels and all, whose large eyes seem odd at first and then hardly noticeable as we embrace her initial childlike innocence and her eventual turn into a warrior princess. While some themes seem forced (like making sure Alita plays motorball, a futuristic roller derby game of mega violence), the rest follows a logical progression. The ending, however, seems rushed, and it would have served the movie better to have a final scene of Alita and Dyson Ido (her maker and father figure) reconciling each other after SPOILER's death. Also, a lot was left unsaid and unfinished, about who Alita is and why she was left for dead on the scrap heap of Iron City before Dyson found her. I am sure they are already gearing up for a sequel (pending box office approval).",Alita - Battle Angel
2430,dilshanuk,Typical Story with a great atmosphere.,7,5 February 2019,"I found Alita as a courages woman through out the movie . The story is good enough to attached the audience through out the running time. But film doesn't seems to have an ending.
The director wants to stretch the story to another editon which is so common these days.
Graphics was decent but not superb. Sound engineering was at the decent level but I expected more since this kind of a Super woman thing.",Alita - Battle Angel

2432,joninarebekka,A relief for a Battle Angel Alita fan!,9,15 February 2019,"I've been anxious about this movie for a year, but I loved the execution.
CONS THOUGH: Yeah, there are some things they changed that I didn't find necessary like having Chiren and Ido having had a disabled daughter, to give Ido some sort of daughter father complex with Alita, and probably is due to Camerons described 'Alita reminds me of my daughter' thing.. yeah, sure, it may make it seem less weird that he would take her, right? I kind of think it kind of just throws a mainstream stereotype into the movie when the story of Battle Angel Alita is no way a mediocre story that needs that twist.. the cheesy bits also bothered me a bit.. like that one with the chocolate, cause its one of those cheap annoying hollywood jokes.. also the age of Alita was altered to a teenager.. in the manga she is pretty innocent, yet passionate (even too passionate) and yet badass, which was part of her extreme passion though, but yeah, she was pretty small and innocent though. In the movie she is a teenager and Hugo is depicted as a 'bad boy', yeah, Hugo does bad things for money in the manga but his character was made to be more relatable goods for typical teenage interest I suppose.. though I just don't see any other reason for that as well except for it being 'maybe more exciting for a mainstream audience', again, making the movie get a little more mediocre with the rest of the worlds crap..
Anyway, though with that being said I was very happy with the outcome, the fighting scenes were better than I could have hoped for, and honestly they were the best part for me.. there were many cool memorable scenes you had seen in the manga before, some could've used a better execution, like the one where her body was chopped to pieces.. either way, I can't wait to see the movie again.",Alita - Battle Angel

Although in some questions she has a petty bourgeois point of view, I can say for sure that she resembles a true revolutionary, like Jiang Qing or Aleksandra Kollontai, a proletarian feminist dedicated to the cause of the toiling masses and determined to destroy the oppressive capitalist regime(reprsented by the city of Zalem, ruled by the fascistic dictator Nova).

I laughed when she laughed. I first bumped the air every time she kicked butt! Please go watch it and judge for yourselves.,Alita - Battle Angel
2441,sinithwar-63401,"I read all the bad reviews, still didn't change my mind",10,25 February 2019,"Let's tackle the 3 most common elements of the bad reviews:
1. The Manga was better
Arguable, primarily because the main purpose of Alita looking attractive in the Manga was simply so the scientist could have a hot robot. It was more about the character development for both scientist and Alita in the Manga. This film places more focus on Alita. This is why the story of the daughter is fabricated and why the script writers attempted to make Alita more than ""just a pretty face"" of which they did a decent job.
Having said that, the plot was also written along the lines of the age range the film was rated for. This is not supposed to be a complicated film, unlike the Manga somewhat was. The manga very borderline Ecchi while the movie is age-appropriate. I would assume that the authors would assume that such a film where the CGI is of a pretty 300-year old teenager would appeal to more ""fellow teens"" than adults. This actually leads into the second common element.
2. The CGI was creepy or cheap
Actually, no it wasn't and I would say that it was highly advanced for what it was attempting to do. Now, I will have to preface this by saying that Alita captured my heart, but her modelling was done brilliantly. If the movie had gone too cyborg, it would have felt like it was needlessly over the top or sexualized. If the movie had just used a human, it would be b-movie equivalent. Instead, they chose to go an anime CGI route that landed it somewhere in the middle.
A movie like this is supposed to do a few things. It's supposed to test the waters to see if the public would buy a ticket for a movie like this. It is exceedingly rare for Americans to purchase tickets to go to a ""foreign film"" like Anime might seem to a lot of those in higher pay brackets. ""Showing in select theaters"" is a common addition to anime movie trailers in America. I mean, my mother still thinks it's porn even though Tokyo Ghoul is on the level of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The most that has ever been done in Hollywood with Anime Films is with the Pokemon series and Hollywood likes to go with what works. Anime is a dicey subject for movie producers because there's no pillar of success that shows it can do well here. Investing in an Anime movie is a big expense, I mean the movie costs $170M verus making $136M in the first week. Other studios will see this as a sign that doing this type of movie is not yet profitable, which means none of them will do it. In other words, in the eyes of Hollywood: Anime in movies above PG-13 is still not profitable.
The other part it is supposed to do is test the age range of where this movie might be most popular. This is done by associating Movie Age Rating to Movie Ticket Sales. Therefore, if a PG Anime makes $1.2B while a PG-13 Anime makes $144M, Hollywood will focus on making movies more kid-focused to get more money and cut costs for higher age brackets to make money on loss-causing age brackets. This was part of the controversy with Deadpool, but people seem to forget that Superhero movies used to be kid-only franchises. Ever wonder why almost every CGI film is a kid-only type of affair?
3. The PG-13 rating is misranked
""It's too violent"" is the most common one I saw. I think I've got a bridge to sell you if you honestly think that. There is barely any sexualization of the character compared to the source material. There are no drugs if I recall. There's some basic wounds that occur and some violent mechanical damage. There are some brutally violent movies out there like Overlord that I would never let my kid watch, but Alita was pretty basic when it comes to violence. I don't recall any cursing either.",Alita - Battle Angel

We have a hero to root for , killer action, and the launch of a franchise that had it come out in the 80's would be the movie you show your kids confident they love and they look at you like this wack.

For the rest, this is a really good sci-fi action flick about a girl's search for meaning and purpose in the world.I'll admit, it's not a perfect movie, and some action fans thought the dialogue was too melodramatic. Other complaints were that they crammed too much plot into the two hours. Then there's those critics who complained she was too sexualized, which wasn't the case at all. It seems more likely these critics were just writing articles just for clickbait.However, if you go to the movie with an open mind, you'll definitely get a lot out of it. There is actually a deep philosophical & spiritual theme here-what it is to be human. It's weaved into this tale seamlessly via the core essence of the original Japanese story.Interestingly, people who complained about the big eyes beforehand really forgot about it during the movie. That's because Rosa Salazar's ability to act and emote with her face (not to mention the animator's work) really helps you fall in love with her character. IMO, she really deserves an Oscar for her performance.I also really loved the father daughter relationship between Ido and Alita. It really felt like they were a real family with a rebellious teen asserting herself.Of course the action scenes were fantastic! They are all filmed clearly without any shaky cam or too many cuts. In fact, many martial arts were used in the movie including Ip Man's Wing Chung and Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do.Lastly, Junkie XL's soundtrack is amazing! I've been a big fan of his since he did Fury Road. I've since bought it and listen to it all the time. It has touching moments for the character scenes and hard hitting electronic music for action.This really is a must see in 3d if possible since it was actually filmed in 3d as opposed to added afterwards. But at this time, the theatrical run is almost over. So if it isn't playing in your local theater, do yourself a favor and buy it once home video is available.",Alita - Battle Angel

2458,kiwikev-50181,Better then expectes but still has it's flaws,6,10 July 2019,"Now to be honest I was biased against this movie from the start. But after watching it I have to say it was quite intriguing. The CGI is stunning and the creative effort put into the cyborgs is almost at the same height as mad max's cars. However, the manga huge eyes on the protagonist is still a bit of an unsettling but that doesn't matter all too much. The movie's story is good, but it isn't great. The abrupt ending really drops the score on this film. It a great example of modern movie mass producing film series where everything will be fixed in the sequel. And it's not only that it ends out of nowhere, but it also loses pace the last half hour of the movie. The narrative should have been thought out to fit one movie or they should have made this a tv series since what they came up with is ridiculous.",Alita - Battle Angel

2460,siddnaved,Amazing actions & Beautiful visuals & a story which stay close to the manga,9,9 February 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel is by far the best movie based on Manga/Anime. This movie proves that Hollywood is capable of making good live action anime movie.
Alita looks beautiful with those eyes, it really made me feel like an anime character come to life. Truly ""She has a face of an Angel & a body made for Battle.""
I'm really looking forward towards the sequel of Alita and I really hope that this movie grows as a franchise.",Alita - Battle Angel

2462,burgessdude,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,2,23 February 2019,"This movie managed to be so boring while so over the top violence wise. Every character design had the exact same format with their face on top of a terminator. This movie tried to steal the plot of the Jason Bourne movies without having any of the realism that made those interesting. The plot was bland and the characters were too basic and boring. Literally in one scene Alita is Dora the explorer and on the next she is cutting robot cyborgs in half. If you want to watch a movie where you lose all sense of reality and are completely bored out of your mind at the same time this one is for you!The only reason I'm giving it a 2 is because my friend luckily got me in for free. Without that this movie was a tear my eyes out CGI fest galore with fun cameos that ended with the best actors in the movie being killed off or never spoken of again. *western dog dude and mashala Ali* this one isn't worth your time. Just go watch WWE where at least there's some sense of realism to it.👁👄👁
Plus you can't those eyes tho",Alita - Battle Angel

When he said' Thank you for saving me', it's not 'saving his life', but 'saving him and give him another chance to be a proper Human, in a city where humans have to brcome inhuman to live.

Alita creates a world that stretches your imagination without being unbelievable.

Maybe it's because it's sticking to the source material but this movie just makes me hungry for the sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel
2484,theirishmanxvi,Good stuff.,10,17 February 2019,Honestly walked out of the film blown away. Robert Rodriguez always has little touches within his directing that really make characters feel real and settled Ina completely rediculous world. Rosa Salazar absolutely crushes this performance. I know they got a star-studded cast but Rosa steels every scene. This is the beginning of an Era. The technology used to render Alita opens up huge potential for the future of film making. This is an epic film. It's lighthearted but also deep and the implications of the world have weight. Overall I'm deeply satisfied. I'll be seeing it in IMAX as well. It's just one of those films you have to see on the big screen.,Alita - Battle Angel

If you're expecting a lot of depth with the overall plot, you'll be disappointed. I don't think that there is anything horrible about it, but there are a few things I would've changed up. If you're expecting AMAZING fight scenes, you'll love it. My expectations going in were geared towards the latter and it didn't upset. There were parts I was gripping my wife's hand tight and didn't realize it until she told me. Overall, it's a solid movie that is worth seeing in the theater.",Alita - Battle Angel
2487,spunky-52686,Simply beautiful.,10,26 February 2019,"I go to the cinema almost every weekend.

2488,jackchooea,Wonderful,9,27 February 2019,Really enjoyed this movies. Just about everything a about it is great. Christophe and Demi did a great in their supporting roles and the CG is just stunning. I was completely immersed in the world that Alita projected onto the screen. I'm looking forward to the sequel but at this point am not too positive about that happening with the relatively poor box office showing. Better than any of the marvel or dc movies ever put out onto the screen.,Alita - Battle Angel

2490,ayushdubey-66913,Hollywood should stop making manga adaptations,3,9 February 2019,Aimless and no story whatsoever. The graphics are amazing but one of the worst movies I've watched.,Alita - Battle Angel
2491,sjyotikhan,From someone who didn't watch the anime/read the manga: 8/10,8,28 March 2019,"Honestly speaking, this movie's marketing department didn't do a very good job, at least with me. The trailers didn't get me all that intrigued, and some posters and other promotional materials were either uninteresting or downright cringy.So when I went to watch Alita today, I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not saying this is a 'great' movie, but absolutely one that is worth watching (specially in a hall with all its 3D glory), and one that deserves a sequel.Let me talk about the pros first. The movie is a visual wonder. The jampacked metropolis of the Iron City was superbly crafted. It had a true third world vibe to it which I really love about cyberpunk movies (trust me I live in the subcontinent). The action scenes are expertly handled as well, which were a privilege to watch in 3D. The slo-mo effect was on point, used but not too much, just the right amount. The visual spectacles help with the worldbuilding as well, which I absolutely loved. A massive pile of some weird unnecessary lore is not forced down your throat in Alita (like in many fantasy or sci-fi movies). Rather the worldbuilding just went with the flow of the movie. I loved the mysterious aura about Zalom. The worldbuilding leaves a lot of room for future sequels too. The story was engaging, thrilling, well-paced and overall pretty good. The pacing was great, albeit it can seem a bit rushed at the beginning. It had some good twists and revelations as well. Be sure to expect goosebumps at certain scenes.Now the flaws. Firstly, I think the scores could've been better. They weren't terrible, but not memorable either. This movie could seriously use a great composer. Secondly, the characters didn't get to me. Most of them were bland (at least three weren't though). I really couldn't connect with the emotional scenes, but that just might be me. The writing may seem bit amateur near the beginning (specially Alita's). Another thing, if you are looking for some android-revolution story, Alita is not it. You'll not see some robot searching for her consciousness or her purpose of life in this movie. Simply put, this is not the movie if you're looking for something akin to Blade Runner or Ghost in the Shell where the main narrative is focused on the protagonist's journey through what it means to be human. In my opinion, Alita did well by not delving into that subplot too much, the movie wouldn't work out with those themes and end up as a mess if it did.That's it folks. I recommend this to every sci-fi (specially fans of the cyberpunk subgenre) fan. People who are craving for an action blockbuster with great worldbuilding and a decent story will be satisfied too. Alita has gotten me intrigued to watch the anime. I sincerely want more of this universe, and I'm really stoked for a sequel. The movie just crossed 400 million worldwide, which might not be enough to warrant a sequel. There is still hope however. I would be pretty sad to see this franchise get nipped in the bud, there's so much potential.
Let's keep hoping, people.",Alita - Battle Angel

2500,spandanpoddar,"Engaging, well-rounded, visual feast, stunning action sequences this film has it all",9,3 July 2019,"Alita: Battle Angel is an underrated beauty for sure, I caught the movie months after the theatrical release but I now wish I had gone for it in theaters. The movie has a jaw-dropping action sequences, with competent CGI which somehow feels extremely natural, yet graceful. You'd never expect an out-and-out action flick to feature such a well-rounded plotline underneath, yet this movie delivers brilliantly on that front too, with the characters and the actors playing bringing about a much-needed emotional story that fuels the action and draws in the audience.
Maybe because I went in with low expectations, but even without, thus movie was a brilliant feast for the eyes and a would have been even more wonderful if caught at a theater. I am really looking forward to the sequels as yes, they've teased a trilogy.",Alita - Battle Angel

2503,joaniechouinard,Poor texts but great action and animation,6,13 February 2019,"With James Cameron as producer, I think a lot of work has been put on animation and action, as in Avatar. I loved Avatar. And for Alita, the base of the storyline is great, well-thought, with high aristocracy living ""above"" the poor one, and once every couple of hundred years, there's a war and the ""world above"" crash onto the other and becomes the poor one, while another high aristocracy rise above. But the dialogues are really cliché, cheesy and poor. Every time there was a cliché speech, and there's a lot, I was like ""OMG what is that again"". I know it comes from mangas and I don't really know (nor like) mangas, but are the dialogues are that cheesy in them? Also, I'm a bit tired of futuristic movies portraying a steampunk society, like there's no other possibilities of fashion or way of living in the future. Finally, probably because of the manga-based story, the characters are really cliché too.
But I have to admit the animated Alita among live-action characters is really well-made. The scenery is also beautiful.",Alita - Battle Angel

2517,fatsamsoundproductions,Robocop Meets Manga,8,23 February 2019,I really enjoyed the film!The casting was mostly good but Keean Johnson was a disappointment. The guy just didn't convince me. Sorry. In my eyes Salazar and the CGI really stole the show. The main character worked better than the other characters that had real human faces. The effect looked kinda bad sometimes. I think it was a good choice just to use performance capture and animate the whole Alita character in CGI.Storyline was a bit cheesy at times but the movie kept its momentum - I think. The fight scenes worked really well on big screen and the audio/score track was cool!The length of the film was also appropriate in these MARVEL BLOCKBUSTER times. I think 3 hours is way too much for an action film. It usually gets boring after 2 hours - when you've already seen like a 1000 fight scenes. :DDI think this flick was well balanced between drama and action - even though cheesy at times. ;-)I was really glued to my seat with this one!

2521,shift-84526,What It Is And What It Isn't,1,4 May 2019,"What it is:Visually stunning. The CG is fun to look at. The team who worked on this did a great job and clearly spent a lot of time and effort getting it right.Stylistically impressive. If you like Sci-Fi, Cyber-Punk, Anime, Manga, or anything else nerdy, you're in the right place. Alita certainly delivers.It's a Jason Bourne movie. From the start, you're introduced to a character that knows nothing about themselves only to discover through muscle memory that they're a trained killer.It's The Matrix Reloaded. When the Wachowski brothers made the Matrix sequels they said, ""Hey, we just made a ton of money on a great movie! Let's scrap the idea to do that again and we'll make a sequel that's just a bunch of the best cool stuff from other movies and throw it together into one awesome super-movie!"" ...and it sucked. I'm pretty sure everyone involved with this movie had the same game plan... and got the same results.It's every movie trope. There's nothing new going on here, no original plot devices, just more of the same stuff.
What it isn't:It isn't good.It isn't terrible.It isn't anything new.
In conclusion:Alita: Battle Angel is ketchup. You put it on your hot dog so it isn't bland. It's not your favorite condiment and you definitely wouldn't put it on your favorite cut of steak, but it does its job and then you forget about it.",Alita - Battle Angel

2524,lucie-52676,Entertaining movie with a lot of missing story,7,26 February 2019,"I loved the detaily, effects, action and excitement the movie brings. On the other hand it felt like the movie was edited in away it missed some parts explaining how the charakter got to that point. It raised a lot of questions, characters felt quite superficial at the time and certain scenes felt unnecessary. Overall i enjoyed the movie for what it is but would not watch it again.",Alita - Battle Angel

2526,awgoodner,"Absolutely spectacular hero-driven non-Marvel/DC scifi action, the next 5th Element but better!",10,15 February 2019,"This movie was an absolute joy to watch and captured so much of what makes a great character driven action movie. Alita is visually mesmerizing and seamless, the CGI is as good as anything you've ever seen. What's more impressive though is not the ""realness"" of it, but how well they capture facial movements. Alita LOOKS ALIVE. She isn't lost in the uncanny valley, she EMOTES. She pulls you in and allows the full suspension of disbelief. She demands that you see her as real, despite the glaringly obvious unreal elements about her. The action sequences are done so well that they never feel like jittery clutter, that despite the incredible amount of movement and shear number of things in non-parallel motion the whole of the imagery is coherent. The actors do what they are supposed to do but make no giant waves doing so, and the story is what is clearly derived from a comicbook style, but is not wholly derivative either. Alita is a character that is both extremely powerful and yet fragile at the same time, reminiscent of Leeloo in the 5th Element. She is portrayed as real, and it is easy to cheer for her and feel for her. If you like scifi action with spectacular visuals and extraordinary characters then this is the movie for you.",Alita - Battle Angel
2527,thekillabunny,Almost perfect adaptation!,8,23 February 2019,"We saw 'Alita: Battle Angel' last night and if you're a fan of the original anime you'll love it!They've done an amazing job, not messed about horribly with the story at all (Glares in GitS's direction 😒), most of the changes are welcome and while I found some of the castings are cringeworthy I can forgive it all because they have Christoph Waltz as Ido! 😊If you haven't seen the original anime movie you might not enjoy it as much, simply because most of my appreciation comes from all the fan service they've done to the original. This movie was crafted by people who loved that film as much I did. And I am so grateful for that, it felt like they were treading on a beloved memory. Luckily they've stepped lightly.",Alita - Battle Angel

Although I'm an Anime fan, and the Battle Angel anime is a lot more graphically violent (blood wise), this movie kicks ass! There are parts of the movie where the dialogue is Star Wars Prequels cringeworthy, but I didn't let that detract me from watching awesome action and amazing special effects. Alita, herself, looks amazing as well. Love the eyes. Think 9 is too high of a rating? I challenge anyone to give it lower than a 7.",Alita - Battle Angel

This movie is one of the best manga/anime adaptations ever made, despite making some changes to the original source material, the soul and spirit remains there, intact.
People have asked me if I would like a sequel, so I answer: Sequels, sequels, friend. I've already seen it twice and I'm planning on watching this roller coaster of a movie multiple times more. We need sequels, people. Go watch it!!",Alita - Battle Angel

Main actress is pretty good, Christoph Waltz is brilliant as always and most of the actors did the great job. Special effects are perfect or almost perfect most of the time. Action sequences are almost hypnotic, and there is plenty of action in this about two hours long movie. I hope it makes enough money for the sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel

In fact I was blown away! The attention to detail throughout was impressive and the action scenes are intense blink and you'll miss it rollercoasters.

Even Passing Avatar in 3D which I loved because you forgot that you live on earth during parts of that movie. This one make you forget that you are watching a CG/live action movie. You even forget about Alita not being a real human at times. The story very well paced, and the whole universe is built very well, it makes you want learn more about everything like when you watch A New Hope. Alita herself make you want to be a hero in this world. I'd say more but most of has already been covered by other reviews.

2549,karassmatt,A very average young adult movie at best,4,13 July 2019,"Apart from the CGI, which is good (but one would expect that from a big production in 2019, right?), there is not much to be saved.Characters have no depth whatsoever, the plot and the dialogues are so cliché it's embarrassing and the acting is generally just as the doctor prescribed, though occasionally it drops to laughable lows, like Alita's reaction when Zapan stabs Hugo.Not only there isn't much to be saved but I was particularly annoyed by Alita's big eyes. They have no reason to be like this other than to make the viewer like her (search ""neotenic characters""). A lame and cheap trick.",Alita - Battle Angel
2550,nick-02269,Inspiring and outstanding story,10,20 April 2019,"Alita Battle Angel gives a fascinating story, a unique emotional experience in the new Sci-fi world, with attractive fight scenes. But the central movie line is about Alita, her journey from an insignificant girl to a fearless warrior, with a pure heart and strong character.
From the beginning to the end, you have an emotional connection with her, from the first breath and open eyes to show yourself the world to first innocent love and fight with evil, all it's possible because she represents human values at the subconscious level.
The Battle Angel shows us a new level of CGI effects with amazing Rosa Salazar performance on set, you really believe in her existence.
These qualities make Alita is the most adorable heroine and one of the best movies at all time.",Alita - Battle Angel

The big thing people have a hard time getting over is the eyes, and it's hard to explain, but they actually bring her out of uncanny valley and you accept the look of the character soon enough after she is introduced.

The movie is pretty solid. Has some emotional elements to it...but the action was good. Definitely rooting for a sequel.,Alita - Battle Angel
2565,haakonbergrolness,Just lazy,3,8 February 2019,"The only redeeming quality of this movie is the special effects, and even they are nothing unique. The story line is absolutely rubbish and strangely paced. It is a movie written for the PG13 rating and nothing more. So tag along for a movie centered around no consistent plot at all while you get some twilight saga teen romance story that is just about as awkward and lazy as you can expect as the red line throughout the movie.You want know more about the follow up to how things got too how they are? forget it!You want to know more about the hunters? forget it!You want to know more about the moneyball concept? forget it!etc etc....But hey, maybe James C. will make 6 sequels to this after he is done with Avatar 5.But I doubt this movie will do well enough to get a sequel anyway.",Alita - Battle Angel

It's been a while since I've exited the theater feeling so pumped up and excited. Though there are a few small flaws, like the pacing in some parts of the movie, and the development of some of the characters, I believe the cons are completely overwhelmed by the pros.If you are on the fence about watching this movie, do ignore the critic's scores and focus on what the audiences are saying instead. I wholeheartedly recommend you watch it, whether you are a fan of the source material or not.",Alita - Battle Angel
2573,hamidmunir-22099,"Superb blend of scifi elements, didn't want it to end",10,7 February 2019,"This needs to be watched on as big an IMAX screen you can find in 3D, any other way won't do it justice, you will literally not be able to peel your eyes away from the screen.
Blistering central performance from Rosa Salazar and ably assisted Christoph Walz, Mahershala Ali as always superb, quietly powerful Jennifer Connelly, all of these performances worked well along with a story that pulls you in with shades of ff7, astroboy and your favourite scifi bits from movies past, rattles along at a pace which leaves you wanting more at the end.
My only criticism is it felt truncated at the end, feeling like they are leaving it open for sequels (which I would love to see) but as a standalone film would have worked better if it was more polished at the end with a truer ending, but this is minor, do yourself a favour and WATCH THIS IN 3D IMAX you will not be disappointed.",Alita - Battle Angel
2574,lilmarie-88190,SNOOZE,4,25 July 2019,Pros: Very artistic film with cool graphics.Cons: so FREAKING BORING. Kept waiting for this movie to get better or more interesting and it didn't.

2575,beachsick,It was more than I expected,10,25 February 2019,They did such an amazing job on this movie. The CGI is SO MUCH BETTER than Aquaman. Absolutely a great adventure. I really hope they are allowed to make part 2.,Alita - Battle Angel
2576,tanderson-97692,"Expected mediocrity, got intensity, hoping for more.",9,23 July 2019,"I thought this movie was going to be somewhat mediocre, if not weird (because of the animation choices with the main characters eyes being enlarged as a homage to the manga).I severely underestimated how good this movie would be. It eases you into the world alongside its main character, and you see the world through her eyes as the story unfolds. Keep in mind, it is on the odd side of Science Fiction, but this was a very well scripted adaptation, the animation and fight scenes were breathtaking, and I will be very disappointed if this film does not warrant a sequel, or possibly an entire franchise. They do have a good amount of story to pull from the manga, and this story needs a decent adaption after the original OVA anime was left unfinished.Worth my time very much so, and hopefully yours as well. 9/10 Kickass little cyborg ninja stars.",Alita - Battle Angel
2577,cpblackw,Setting the bar impossibly high!!,10,15 February 2019,"I you've never read the Manga or watched the OVA then I can certainly see how people aren't impressed, but for those of us who did, this is a major win. After years of horrible live action remakes of popular Manga/Anime, this one lives up to the hype. The ability to stick close enough to the OVA story and not change enough to ruin the experience was fantastic. Like any live action adaptation, there are changes to the story and new characters, but they got the formula right. If you were disappointed in Ghost In The Shell, this is the redemption.It definitely had its cheesy parts to it, but what movie doesn't.10/10, if you're an anime fan or manga reader, it's a must see.",Alita - Battle Angel
2578,allannbellenger,Mind blowing !,10,1 March 2019,"Absolutely fantastic !! The words are missing when it comes to describe what this movie made me feel. First, you're quickly facing a total different world, not so unfamiliar as it could be ours in 500 years. Then you realize quite immediately that the effects are astonishing by their genuineness. Alita is just perfect. She's cute, attaching, and completely dope if I may ! Her hability to learn, to remember and to adapt against her worst scenarios she's faced, like a kid's game. In any words, to fight ! Crashing her ennemies like bugs. As a dad, I've been identifying myself unconsciously to the character Dr. Dylson Ido when it comes to take care of her, to teach her, to advise her and to worry about her. Like a real dad would do. For that I felt this relationship touching, more than with her boyfriend Hugo to be honnest. And caooo.... The ending of the movie just wants you to immediately jump into the next one, hopefully coming not too indefinitely ! My wife, friends and I were on our asses and still cannot fully realize what we just watched. It passed so bloody quickly ! If you wouldn't have noticed yet, I definitely recommend this movie ! Some scenes are violent so get ready to see some chops and stuffs but it stays entertaining of course ! Bip up for the fighting scenes using martials arts move, which has also seduced me even more as I am a martial artist. Enjoy guys !",Alita - Battle Angel

Worth It!,10,7 February 2019,"I wrote a super detailed review about how I've been a fan since the 90's and couldn't wait since I heard James was planning on making this movie in early Y2k and have been through so many ups and downs as it was on and off, on and off, and then put on the back burner. I mentioned how the rollercoaster of emotions was completely worth it and they nailed the story, the world, the pacing, the action, and the buildup to the finale. I also went into #Alita and Rosa's performance capture was the next generation of role augmentation and it clearly has set the bar high. I said a lot more too, but it got erased as I let my phone sit idle too long as I looked up some obscure detail for my super awesome detailed review. It's ok though because ain't nobody got time for that. Go. See. This. Movie. That's all I have to say.

I have to say I was shockingly and pleasantly surprised. Alita sucked me in right away and revealed to me that there was so much more to the story than what the trailer portrayed. The action was brilliant, which seemed to be the obvious draw, but it was the entirety of the film that I was most impressed with. The ending motivated me to write a review in the hopes that a sequel is produced. The ending left the perfect open door for a story with so much still to tell..... Well done Robert Rodriquez and James Cameron.",Alita - Battle Angel

2592,charleschaung,A beautiful action movie that begs for better writing,6,16 February 2019,"I really wanted to like Alita: Battle Angel more, but the movie has lousy dialogue from start to finish and tries to cover too much story. This film felt like it could have been cut up into 1.5-2.25 movies, and more time should have been given to develop the characters and world to get the viewers more invested in the series. For example, Dr. Ito's assistant literally has 2 lines in the entire movie but appears throughout the movie, and the camera focuses squarely on almost every appearance for her just to smile and nod. Why didn't they spend some time using her to have some fun back-and-forth banter with the doctor to help develop their relationship and add to the atmosphere?

2595,luvfitz,Amazing comic book movie romp with heart,10,19 February 2019,"I saw Alita: Battle Angel in full IMAX 3D, and it was fan-freaking-tastic. This is absolutely a movie that is enhanced by the imax experience - most of the time I don't think it really improves a film, and this is definitely an exception. The action is breathtaking, the film is gorgeous, the synergy of sound (especially the rumbling!) and on-screen movement is wonderful, and yet it's the delicate touch of the acting and direction that takes this over the edge for me. Let me be clear, this is a comic-book movie - I'm not saying this is some super-deep character study. Neither was Star Wars. And yet I found Alita in particular and many of the other characters to be done in such a way that the comic-book stereotypes that make up all these types of stories were actually brought to believable, understated life. This film does a great job of show don't tell, both with character development and world-building. One important disclaimer as a parent of 3 children - I would rate this a very violent pg 13. Overall, I loved it - this one has heart and joy and made me feel like a kid again, overwhelmed by sheer awesomeness.",Alita - Battle Angel

The trailer had me sold within seconds. Unbelievably beautiful work of art this film is. It's like the movie was made for me. Absolute perfection!
Thank you so much to the thousands of people who helped create this visual masterpiece! I am a 44 year old male. I approve, and recommend this film to every single gamer/anime/sci-fi fan out there.

Worst actings ever probably . It's like a very cheap Disney channel movie like Hannah Montana or something like that. At reviews they are saying it's like 2049. Its a insult to Blade runner.

2600,xlodvig,How to bring anime to IMAX,10,9 February 2019,"Really decent anime adaptaition like no one has done before. Everything in this movie scream that it is very manga-ish anime-ish style, screenplay, overall story development. It is safe to say, that core story from original source were brought with love and careness with all it's adnvantages and flaws. Allita's eyes express so many emotions, they're so lively, that now I think that it would be a crime not to design her the way she is. Rosa Salazar kills it as battle cyborg, you can't not to root for.Although I noticed one big flaw of this flick. It really should be at least half an hour longer to patch some underused characters here and there. I have waited 20 years to get this. Please don't let me wait 20 years more to get a sequel!!!",Alita - Battle Angel

2602,thomasbarresi,Flattest movie I've seen in a long time,3,20 February 2019,"Oh god this was so boring. Had a free ticket so I thought I would give it a try. Had low expectations, and yet this somehow managed to be worse than them. Not being familiar with the source material, I can't even compare in my mind and say things like 'they changes this' or whatever, because I don't know. I was so bored it was more interesting to analyse my boredom.
So many of the twists are so clearly led in the opposite direction, that it was no surprise that they did the opposite. Honestly I would have preferred they actually went with the obvious reveal, as it was so obvious I would have not expected it.
It was so flat, the fights may be a spectacle, but that is all it is, flashy choreography. There is no emotional impact behind the fights, and oh god it was predictable. I'm not sure that I've seen a movie that made me not care as much in ages, which is surprising for me since I'm super prone to crying through movies, but with this, I just wanted it over.
Surprisingly, Alita's eyes, which were off-putting from the trailers, were something I came to be fine with, but the pacing, writing, twists and all that, was so sub par.
The only complement I can give is to the visuals, which were really good, I'd image the 3D would be a treat for the eyes, but the story and characters, honestly this was just garbage.
That free ticket would have given me more pleasure going into the bin then being put to use on this trash. Which is a shame, I was hoping to enjoy it. If only.The Netflix Death Note movie is better, at least that got me to have some reaction, even if that was to laugh at it.",Alita - Battle Angel

2604,qureshiomar,Fun experience,8,25 February 2019,"I had an excellent time watching Alita.. the animation looked smooth the graphics were amazing. the story content felt cluttered but never to the extent that it would overwhelm any watching adult.
however the ending left me furious and intrigued at the same time. the final scene and the reveal of the main protagonist NOVA caught me off guard and pleasantly surprised. however the point were the screen faded to black mage me go WTF because i so wanted the experience to continue, but later understood that this will make the sequel feel even more grand
the only bad thing i can say about this movie was the utilization of Cristolph Waltz... i think he did do a great job .. but i feel his character did not do allow him to do justice to the exceptional acting skills
over all excellent watch and fun 2 hours ... now hoping the movie can do well and get the sequel that this story is crying out for",Alita - Battle Angel

2606,tomjmroche,Metropolis in a new frame,8,11 February 2019,"Fritz Lang would be pretty impressed with this effort I wager.
If you've not seen Metropolis 1924 or the 2001 animation you're going to want to after this. This film really grabs you from the get go, the scale and gravity of the scenery and the action scenes are impressive. The only non plus was there are slightly over cooked emotional scenes, discussed this with my daughter when we saw the preview. I tend to think if you are say somebody that doesn't have working human bits anymore, well you have a more profound way of looking at life and to be honest I think they got that bit right.Well done guys.
Rotwang wouldn't be complaining about this effort!",Alita - Battle Angel

I was blown away by the special effects and the character design was on point. I do believe they tried to add too much to the movie and should of focused more on Alita, Hugo and Edio's relationship instead of the motorball. Other than that I'm praying 🙏🏼 For it to do well to have a sequel. I'd love to see more of this world!",Alita - Battle Angel
2608,narsil-60221,Cyberpunk Masterpiece,10,10 February 2019,"Hello this review will have small spoilers but nothing major just to put examples reflecting the score i gave to this movie. I also decided to put my review due to the fact most reviews don't truly reflect the value of the movie. First of all, the plot is just amazing from the start till the end I was amazed by the story of alita cyborg constructed from ancient technology who learns anew about her new surrodings where she was placed in and about her feelings. I was just supprised how much i liked this character despite her being main femele protagonist. All those recent movies set in distant future are not even close in comparison to this movie ( yeah blade runner in my opinion is far worse). Actors done amazing jobs like Christoper Waltz who again proves that he is one of the best actors in hollywood, he portrays a doctor who lost his child and with the plot moving foward he feels more and more attached to Alita. There are plenty of greats cameo in movie with great actors that are not recognizeble from the start which is also great each time this happens I had big smile on the face. The world presented in this movie is just amazing after the film I want to see it more and more. First of all if you thing about future growth of population or some major conficts I see the world of alita presented like a junkyard for remaining humanity where the rich lives in neon cities and this is what is presented in this movie it gives the whole plot great deepth ( its more like Elysium.rather that the Blade Runnrr) and like those inhabitants of junkyard my dream is to also see those neon cities of rich. I talked about plot,protagonist actors world so its time for action and this alone deserves a lot. its really not common in Hollywood to see great actions in hand to hand combat where in my opinion only Korean movies posses highest level of fighting choreography. but Alita is just like Matrix huge jump toward best level of action presented in deep plot. After the movie i couldnt sleep this is how i loved the movie and im certain keen eyes will appriciate all the job that King Cameron and Rodriguez done. This movie will have amazing impact toward scifi cyberpunk fans i truly hopes battle angel will remembered talked after many many lears. In many ways it surpases Avatar because who dosent love cyberpunk theme.... cant wait for future movies in Alita world and for the game of cd project red :D
..... Score 10(most for bad reviews deserves 8.5-9 at least) .... best scfi movie in years",Alita - Battle Angel

2610,ioannisbah,Waiting for (a) sequel? why??,5,15 July 2019,"Visualy stunning- I give it that..but no senario-as if the script was of no matter when it came to produce the film..I sincerely felt disappointed instead of thrilled (as I at least expected I would be..) , not to mention the corny ""love-story-that must-give-power to the film"" between Alita and new-wave ""cool biker"" two-faced deliquent..so cheesy inside the messy story with characters entering and leaving/dying with no sense of depth apart from a 2 dimentional existence (and no its not beacause is an adaptation from a comic book)..
Sorry fellas for being so straight but so much fuzz that didnt meet many of my (high I should say) expectations beacause of the production group involved in it!
And the whole finale sequence tha leads to......(no spoilers here-watch and be your own judge)",Alita - Battle Angel
2611,dylandog-12585,Whimsical and Beautiful in Almost Every Way,10,1 April 2019,"(Spoiler-free review) I'd like to preface this by saying that a 10/10 does not constitute a perfect movie; simply put, there is no such thing as a perfect movie and the very definition of perfection is subjective. However, to me a 10/10 means that the movie excelled in every important way, or that some areas excelled so much that they compensate for any shortcomings that the movie might have. For example, a book with amazing writing can compensate for a mediocre plot, and a book with mediocre writing can still be excellent if written incredibly beautifully. That's the type of logic that should be applied to movies as well.I'll start with the flaws-- the only real, tangible flaws to the movie as it is presented, is that there are a couple of missing scenes and sometimes the lack of transition can be a little too much. The biggest example is when there's a bar scene, and it feels like there was no transition whatsoever. The romantic subplot also suffers from the lack of screen-time- had the movie had an additional 10-20 minutes to include proper transitions, the film would be even better than it is right now, but that being said, everything that did make it into the film is fantastic. I wouldn't say it's ""rushed,"" because it's easy to follow along, but it does feel like a couple of scenes met their fate at the director's chopping block.The movie is definitely not for everyone- because it's based on a manga, it has a lot of traits that you generally find in anime culture- the main ones being an upbeat, energetic protagonist, and a cheesy romantic subplot.People who enjoy anime and similar types of movies, shows etc. will love that this movie feels that way, but those who want a more stoic protagonist or want to throw out the cheesy romantic subplot might have some qualms about it; that being said, the visuals and choreography alone make this movie an absolute joy to watch, and even if cheesy romance isn't your thing, Alita as a character is so fleshed-out and endearing that even the most stoic and cynical viewers can't help but fall in love with her. She is a wonderful underdog of a character with some of the best casting I've ever seen.The actress, Rosa Salazar, did a fantastic job making her emotions felt through all the CGI. It's almost ironic that a CGI, cyborg character often feels more human and authentic than some of the more mainstream actors of today. As her boyfriend so eloquently put it in the film, she's ""the most human person he's ever met.""The action scenes are visceral and breathtaking, and for two different reasons. The first reason being the action and special effects, which, if you've ever seen a James Cameron movie before, are unsurprisingly incredible.But the second reason- and the more surprising one to casual viewers- is that Alita is a character that you become emotionally invested in and worry about. The sad reality is, that even if a movie has the best fight scenes in the world, if you don't give a hoot about the main character, you're going to be disengaged. But, and very fortunately for this movie, Alita is one of the best characters I've ever seen in a movie, and her journey is so interesting and compelling that you want to root for her and see her succeed; for that reason, the fight scenes are very intense because you don't want anything bad to happen to her.We see her go through heavy turmoil during the fights; (don't worry, there's no spoilers here) in the first fight, we see her completely trembling and terrified the entire fight, and whenever she fails or falls short in battle, she seems utterly devastated, and so is the audience. While she can seem overpowered at times and never fails to be a badass, she is not a Mary Sue nor is she undefeatable. We get to see her both succeed and fail, learn and improve, change and grow. She's dynamic in that way. One could argue that she is strong because of her vulnerabilities, not in spite of them.The relationship she has with her little family- her surrogate father, her boyfriend and a couple acquaintances, is wonderful to watch and makes for a generally more compelling story. It wasn't just Alita who was played by a good actor; Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali and many others delivered a great performance, and I never felt there was a moment where the acting itself seemed bad. There is one scene that seemed super cheesy when I first watched it, but that was more of the script than the acting itself.Lastly, the world-building was phenomenal. Iron City felt like a real place, and I felt like I was teleported there, as if I was walking alongside the main characters and experiencing their story with them. Good story-telling can do that. And of course, I believe in giving credit where it's due, and in this particular case I'd say that credit currently resides with the brilliant artists who designed the cyborgs and world. Every little nook and cranny, every nut and bolt, every metal limb and machine part, looks remarkably detailed and realistic, and if you can get past the big eyes, Alita looks like a real cyborg.
(Not a real human- she doesn't look like a real human, but she does look like a real cyborg. It's kind of hard to explain.) Some of the other cyborgs have big eyes too, so it isn't just her. While it's obvious they gave her large eyes to mimic the anime style, it's only bizarre for a moment. I'd say it takes about 2 minutes to get used to them, and while they never offer a ""scientific"" explanation for her eyes, it isn't necessary for there to be one since we can plainly see that some of the other cyborgs also have large eyes, implying that it's tech specific to her kind.To summarize, Alita: Battle Angel is a masterpiece. While it is a bit niche in some ways, the average person will still find something to love about this movie, whether it's the story, the world-building, the amazing visuals or the kick-ass action sequences. I don't expect every viewer to love every aspect of this movie, but the average movie-watcher will be hard pressed not to love something about it.The only thing I can think of that isn't completely a pro or a con is the exposition. There's not a whole lot of exposition in the movie, which is nice because it removes the need for an info-dump. For the most part, the movie shows instead of tells. However at times you do feel like you could use a little bit more information to fully grasp some situations, so it's not entirely clear whether or not the movie benefits or suffers from the light exposition.Cons: Cheesy romantic subplot isn't for everyone, some scenes need better transitions and the pacing needs some tweaking. About 15 more minutes worth of content could have greatly improved the flow of the story. The exposition is light, which aids the pacing, but unfortunately means it can be easy to miss important details. If you go to the bathroom for so much as a minute, you're almost guaranteed to miss something important.Pros: Amazing visuals, endearing protagonist, great acting, wonderful world-building, no info dumps, gripping from start to finish, and one of the most kick-ass movies of all time. An absolute joy to watch and an enthusiastic recommendation to almost anyone.",Alita - Battle Angel

The plot rushes a bit through the story archs and the romance feels like a 14 year olds first romance with an undeserving pretty boy.. But that's what it is. But Rosa Salazar is amazing, and the visuals are fantastic , no blurry action scenes, and most importantly. You start fever ing with Alita, the movie grips you and emotionally takes you in which is imho a lot due to Salazars believable compelling performance .

I haven't been this disappointed in a big film since Star Wars Phantom Menace. The male love interest was reminding me of Hayden Christensen. This will probably be the worst film Mahershala Ali is ever in. I'm also growing skeptical of Christopher Waltz with this one and Downsizing. The visuals are good but when the story and the majority of the acting is so lackluster they really don't make up for it. Even the in movie sport is incredibly lame.

And of course, Alita: Battle angel is a true science-fiction movie, which is becoming extremely rare nowadays.

P.S. If you want me to compare this with Ghost in the Shell (Similar, cyberpunk, android girl movie and also a manga adaptation that turns into live action played by Scarlett Johansson)

Alita is a straight up action movie aimed at amazing you with crazy cgi and really sweet action sequences that honestly left me wanting more and more , but sadly that is all this movie has . Do not go into this theater expecting to see a groundbreaking sci fi story that like blade runner or ex machina, instead this movie has a very simple narrative that is easy to predict. I was very disappointed in the way the screen writer and director used their big time actors like waltz and Connelly, who's characters felt very undeveloped and quite bland . This movie fell flat at its face for me and left me laughing at how bad some of the acting and choice of words they used in this movie were . Not a total flop just think twice about spending 20+ dollars for IMAX like me ...",Alita - Battle Angel
2643,tommieee-59530,"Some cliché's, but darn-well executed",8,17 February 2019,"Even though the plot had some cliché's, it was a very well-executed even at the clichés. I got very well invested in the main character Alita. She was incredibly well-written, unfortunetaly at the expense of some other character arcs.
It is definetly a great watch for younger viewers. It shows them an original universe with some creepy vibes and difficult story telling that can introduce younger viewers to film. This is exacly a movie I would be obsessed with when I was younger, and it gave me a sense of nostalgia and a whole lot of inspiration as an amature screenwriter and filmmaker aswell.
Definetely recommending this movie if you like discovering a new world through the eyes of a revived A.I.Rating a well-deserved 8 to keep the score high, as I do not agree with the critics.",Alita - Battle Angel
2644,Eric_L_CinemaDude,One of the Best action films!,9,23 February 2019,"Alita Battle Angel ReviewI love this movie.
Story/plot summary:
The year is 2563. 300 years after ""The Fall"" (big war), Iron City is left decimated in a dystopian like society when Alita was found at a scrap pile in a futuristic junk yard. When recovered and put back together with a new cyborg body by Dr. Dyson, she doesn't remember anything of her past nor recognizes the current world. As the story progresses she finds clues to her identity, past life, where she came from, and what she was born to do. As she goes on through her adventure through plot twists, action packed scenes, relationship building with her dad, and some romance with her boyfriend, she fights her way to take down the main antagonist. In taking down the main antagonist she finds new revelation of her identity and mission in life.Characters:
I love all the characters in this movie.
Alita: Is the advanced teenage cyborg solider who finds her identity and purpose in life through flash backs of her past. She builds a beautiful father-and-daughter relationship with Dr. Dyson and builds a romantic relationship with her boyfriend Hugo. She's strong and courageous with the love and compassion of a young girl and a beating heart of a warrior to take down the evil Nova. I rooted and cared so much for her throughout the whole movie.
Dr. Dyson: Grievances from the past he tries to regain peace by other but failing means until he invests in Alita in being the father figure for her. The father figure is more of something that is implied than really shown but audiences get the picture. I say this because I would have liked to have seen more of the Dr give some more wisdom and guidance to Alita, but what ended up in the movie works.
Hugo: Is the boyfriend of Alita. He's the character that introduces and shows her the current world and status quo of the society. He helps, encourages, and becomes close friends with Alita to the point where he has a heart change of his own dark past. The romance with Alita I think is pretty solid.Action:
The action in this movie is super awesome and trilling to watch! Fight choreography is amazing and so entertaining! This movie is one of my favorite action/adventure movies.
CGI and visuals:
The CGI is breathtaking. Of course they used a lot of actual sets as well throughout the movie. These are the same people that made Avatar with James Cameron so you know it's going to look great. Alita's eyes are so very life like. They truly captured the spirit and emotion of Rosa Salazar into Alita with all of the different sensors she wore. Your conscious mind will always be accepting Alita as a human and not a CGI person. The CGI and VFXs in the rest of the film is also breathtaking.Villains:
The villains work for this movie. The main antagonist that fights Alita throughout the movie is two dimensional. However, Even a 2-D character at the story's center is not necessarily bad; character ""depth"" should be in proportion to the role's importance to the story. Or how much stuff gets blown up. Nova which we sadly learn nothing about who drives all the evil that is happening in the movie we know nothing about which makes him very one dimensional.Rewatchable?: YES!
Would I go to theaters again to see it?: YES!
Was I wanting more when the credits start rolling?: YES!
Forgettable Movie?: NO!

2650,ManDaddio,Something Refreshing To See: Old but Not Worn,10,28 July 2019,"I am no critic. Therefore, I will try to keep this brief. This movie is from a manga. I would highly recommend watching the extras to get as much backstory as you possibly can get if you know nothing about this series before you actually watch the film.
The reason I say that is because it doesn't really play around wasting time. It throws you right into the story.
Why do I say this is a refreshing movie?
It's not yet another superhero movie.
It's not just throwing sjw stuff in just to throw sjw stuff in. When I use the acronym sjw it has nothing to do with hate. I just dislike having ideologies and lifestylee thrown in a movie to try to push a pseudo norm.
I have no problem with people in general. I try to love everyone. But again that doesn't mean that I have to accept what the media tells me that I have to accept. People came to the new world to practice freedom of conscience. The martyrs died so they can practice freedom of conscience. I don't take that lightly and neither should anyone else. I am all about freedom to be who you want to be but that doesn't somehow exclude me. The media is trying to take away rights of individuals. No one should accept that.
Back to the movie:
It's kind of a setup movie hopefully leading into a sequel that will hopefully be better then the lead in. The ending is not really a cliffhanger but certainly eludes to something coming next.I did read some of the negative reviews around the web and I really kind of disagree with them. I didn't find anything wrong or disturbing or interfering about the growing love relationship between Alita and her male friend. And it doesn't end the typical way. Not to say that I was happy with the way things went but it doesn't take away from the movie in any way. I'm trying not to say too much because I don't want to give away details.
For the most part this was a action flick was good CGI and a fairly believable fictional story.
I believe this movie is mainly setting up the character Alita for hopefully a second movie. It would be a shame if they don't make one.
It's nice to see movies like these adapted from manga. I really didn't mind Ghost in the Shell either with Scarlett Johansson. Yes it was kind of an action film but it had a futuristic and dark story and the relationships in the film didn't seem forced.
I really am only interested in films to get back to the basics. That get back to doing things the old films did that brought charm to the screen.Yes there could be some people saying that this is just another movie with another female character that's unstoppable. And I can't disagree with that. But again this one didn't seem forced. I don't think anyone is against strong female characters. I think we're just tired of seeing characters that don't deserve the praise that people give them. That don't have a backstory that's worthy I've giving them the praise that they deserve.
Alita originally was created to be a killing machine. She didn't do it on our own strength. She's a cyborg. Her strength is her mind. And now that she has some human qualities shining through it's going to be a challenge for her to control the urge to kill. Especially now that she has a reason to.
I know I didn't really give too many details on the movie and I don't really want to.
The characters in the film we're okay. The story itself was kind of something you probably seen already before. But that's okay because it's not just another Star Trek movie or just another marvel universe movie or just another DC comic movie or just another Star Wars movie.
I'm not very experienced with manga but what I have seen you could say is kind of out of reality to some extent but they usually have characters that have feelings. That struggle with their humanity. I'm not sure if that's where this is going with this movie but I hope it does. And if it doesn't it shows the dark side of the human soul.
But I don't think this movie was just made simply to attract crowds to make easy money. Or to just throw things in it just to say we accept a certain group of people.
Well enough of my incoherent rant.
My conclusion for this film was it was much better than I thought it was going to be. And I had a very enjoyable experience watching it.
Personally, I don't think that there's anything to really give it a negative.
I stopped watching the transformers movies just because it was just relentless destruction and violence just for the sake of that. This movie deserves a much better rating than all the ones that I mentioned.
Something fresh and something different deserves a 10 out of 10 in my book. If I enjoyed it then that's a win for me. It's either I like it or I don't.",Alita - Battle Angel

2652,kodog-42499,NOT FOR THOSE WITHOUT IMAGINATION,9,9 March 2019,"Before you go see Alita, ask yourself why you go to see movies in the first place... is it to make you emotional? Forces you to critically think? or do you want to escape reality and just be entertained? Alita: Battle Angel has ALL of these qualities. If you cannot feel the emotion, perhaps you are not looking deep enough and are shallowy observing just the surface context (love can develop out of friendship between two completely different races? Hmm) is it unrealistic to demonstrate the oppression of the sick and the poor, but yet there is hope for those who are willing to fight for it? On top of this Alita captivates you from the very beginning and before you know it, it's over. (Entertaining?) Most likely making you want for more and or wanting to go through the experience all over again (I've seen it 2x in 3D XD).
Don't hesitate, see it, if you don't enjoy it, go back to Saving Ryan's Privates, that's more real for you and obviously the raw emotion you are probably looking for (i.e blood, guts, death, sadness ....P.U.K.E)",Alita - Battle Angel

Alita has plaStic face and human brains, but was the skull metal or what? The rest of the body is metal, plastic and wires but still she eats normal food. So Alita has robot-based intestines. Yep. And Alita has a pulsating heart but how could Alita's head survive in scrapyard without any food if the brain needs organic energy and blood or some other liquid circulation? The film is full of stupid moments. Alita asks from human boy (that she loves) that does it matter thar she is a cyborg? Hah! The funniest part was when that same boy was lying in doctors bunk constructed as cyborg with only his original head left and Alita said ""He looks like feeling fine"" It is not passible this film has anything to do with Cameron.",Alita - Battle Angel

This ain't be a big problem though because the movie is still enjoyable to watch even for those who aren't a big fan of Japanese storytelling.My hope is that the producer creates more live action adaption from Japanese manga and anime.

2665,edwardjnoel,Don't let the reviews lie to you,8,10 February 2019,"Honestly before watching the movie I read a lot of mixed reviews and was very sceptical going in, however after watching it I was very happy that I had ignored the reviews.It truly is a visual masterpiece and showcases the future of CGI moving forward and blending it into reality the production of the movie was done by I would say some of the best there is to date and to see it in action excites me in future releases of movies like it.A lot of the criticism came from the story and I can honestly say it is not as bad as reviewers have left it , and it truly plays on the mystery of her past and I do feel it does enough justice in connecting you with the main characters. Overall it was great and entertaining. My only criticism to nit pick is it could of done better with a more epic soundtrack to signify her presence, and they could of played more on her innocence in more humerous ways, other than that the action is straight Epic , her story is intriguing and it is definitely a empowering film that I would recommend for people to watch, not just because it's good but also to support more films like this (avatar 2,3,4,5 etc) in the future to come.",Alita - Battle Angel
2666,tomasbezkoro,Solid 10 out of 10,10,17 February 2019,"James Cameron has outdone himself with this movie. I've always been a fan of his work, but this tops everything he has done in the past. The visuals are breathtaking, with a collection of some of the greatest CGI I've ever seen... I only recently found out that the character of Alita was also computer generated. I was honestly shocked by this because she looked so real in the final cut, even when in the same frame as real life people. The movie is rated 12A, however it's gore factor is on the brink of that rating, which I love. If you like intense gory images in a film, you'll love this movie. Furthermore the film is filled with action scenes which only seemed to escalate in intenseness as the film progressed, leaving me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Put this together with the photorealistic CG, and you have a 2 hour masterpiece. Some films usually last more than 2 hours, as the director stretches the plot out, creating a very elongated and boring story. But not Alita: this fulfils the 2 hour mark so densely packed with plot, we would be practically asking for a sequel!I would recommend you see this film as soon as possible, it is one of the best I've seen in a long time, and I once spent £7 to go see the emoji movie, so that's saying something...",Alita - Battle Angel

It has outstanding special effects, and it is the first movie to give realistic human faces to computer-generated cyborgs. The action is thrilling, and the movie is faithful to the Japanese manga Battle Angel Alita.The cast is first-rate, consisting of Oscar winners Christoph Waltz and Jennifer Connelly. The acting is well done, and the costumes and sets are visually stunning.But the main reason to see Alita Battle Angel is because of Rosa Salazar's amazing performance. Rosa portrays Alita as a truly human person who is passionate and good-hearted.Edmund Burke famously stated that ""All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.""

I've heard a lot about big manga eyes and it's simply impossible to pull this off with all the weirdness and stuff.
Then came the point where i watched it.The story line isn't perfect but it was build up perfectly till the end of the movie. Alita was a nobody, and probably an insignificant girl finding her way and identity through a harsh and unforgiving world. Glad to have Dr Ido and other characters there to nurture her the love and support she needed. Somehow the story progressed and i soon realise Alita is such a compassionate character, so innocent and so lovable. Her imperfections made the movie perfect.Watched it for the third time, boy i tell you there always new things to discover everytime i watch it. All in all, i enjoyed the character and story very much. So much soul and heart you bring back from this movie which makes sense to have a sequel soon. Can't wait.",Alita - Battle Angel

2674,duncakpeter,Incredibly derivative,3,24 February 2019,"I was looking forward to Alita, really. Trailer was awesome and the source material, too. The end result is, however, full of YA cliches. Alita is 300 hundred years old, yet she is a teenager. She is the last one of her kind. She knows the forgotten, incredibly powerful, kung-fu moves. Her personality is non-existent to allow viewers easily project themselves as Alita. Even dialogues were strangely Twilight-like. Full of ""deep, meaningful"" messages which don't really mean anything. All of the lore is just vaguely hinted at because our imagination works much better that way. Boo!All my points go to the visuals. But even CGI is just a copycat. You can easily notice Blade Runner here, Star Wars there. ""Original"" work went to villains. It's the most generic rooster you've ever seen: a brute, ninja (with katana even!), junkie, mysterious lady and a lady with knives instead of hands.I couldn't help myself but facepalming the whole movie. The script was written by a teenager with no imagination.",Alita - Battle Angel

2680,artfreak_guy,"Overall Fun, Action Packed, and a little under-developed Storyline",9,5 February 2019,"I was hoping this movie would not disappoint, and it did not... at least in the aspect of action, and some drama, but not so much on the storyline. I understand there's only so much one can fit in a 2 hour span for a story that was originally a multi-volume Japanese Manga (a graphic novel equivalent to western standards), though I think a director's cut release would alleviate some of the over-fast paced developments and some 'holes' in the story. Overall, as mentioned in the headline, the action is AMAZING, the visuals can at times make you forget that the scenes and characters are done CGI (I saw it in IMAX and it was GREAT). Even though as mentioned, that the storyline is a bit wanting (in my honest opinion), it's enough to make one care for the characters and for the final outcome of the story. Music, sets the tone and mood as to be expected of such a release and acting is top notch from all actors.~Final verdict~

The fight scenes are pretty good, nothing we haven't seen before, but still pretty exciting stuff.The character dialogues are just simply dumb. It is like watching a disney channel cartoon made for kids. The character developments are even dumber. The whole movie feels like it happens in a week and the characters get so emotionally attached to each other they do the dumbest shit for each other.But the worst is Hugo. He is just a morally rotten scum, which could be an interesting character, but when he is not stealing other peoples body parts he acts like he is the nicest guy in the world. It just doesn't add up. But the movie wants you to like him and feel bad for him. Also his friend, who is at least consistent in being a scum, get chopped in half to save this guy. Fuck him. Was glad when he died.This was not the worst movie i ever saw but it is not good. Simply just dumb.",Alita - Battle Angel

The action sequences are also the essential elements of this movie and they executed them perfectly.

The soundtracks were great.
The only bad thing about this movie was that it is so good that I've watched it twice in IMAX 3D leaving the cinema wanting more. Thanks James Cameron for making the movie. Can't wait for its sequels.

2688,jdbane,Good Adaptation,8,7 February 2019,"It's difficult to put in a good review for a film based on Anime or Manga. As any anime fans know, the dialogue tends to eb choppy and emphatic, always reacting to what's happening.That said, I can honestly say that I enjoyed the film. The pros are that the action was slick and the animation and CGI were smooth and melded perfectly to the live action, all without bringing on the dreaded uncanny valley effect. The characters are likable and for the most part, their character drives are well established. Their relationships feel more or less fluid (still not 100% sold on her relationship with Hugo, not much in the way of Chemistry there). Once you get into the second half of the film, you start getting into the meat of the plot which helps you get invested.But there are cons. The first half of the movie has our main character being awed and shocked by everything in the film. Some directors might think that having a character like that is a good way to get some exposition done, by explaining the world to Alita, and therefore the audience. It was not handled well. But then, when you have a full book's worth of world-building to tell, you have to cut some corners.Once you get past that in the second half, things start picking up. More character development, more getting to the meat of the plot, and you end with an interesting and very strong segue into a sequel. One that I hope to see happen, since they do deliver a strong finish with the end of one of the villains, but always standing strong on the plot that there's a bigger baddie waiting. Anime and Manga fans are used to this, and I think Western audiences are starting to as well.All said and done, a strong movie. I hope the sequel is better now that all the exposition is out of the way.",Alita - Battle Angel

2690,chrisbirkitt,Battle Angel Alita,10,7 February 2019,"About time a hollywood film did some manga some justice. I am a massive fan of the original manga and anime movie. I grew up reading and watching them and it stands high amongst my all time favorites. I absolutely loved it.This film did kind of do them justice, It is visually stunning and i can understand why they waited to make it with the technology and CGI we have today. It shows. They brought the world of Alita to life, from zalem to iron city and i absolutely loved the motorball sequences even though they occured a bit sooner than in the original (My favorite story arc in the comics) It could have very easily been a 3 hour movie with things they have missed out and the thinking that they will bring out a second to continue the story is exciting.I guess i marked it down one step because of the need to make it more accessible to the wider audience (Censoring it down to 12A) This could have easily been an R rated film. Saying this however i was not disappointed with the fighting or action scenes. I enjoyed the casting choices and all played their role pretty well. The story choices kind of suited the 12A rating so unfortunately no brain eating cyborgs are seen and the action scenes are toned down a bit (especially motorball.)I really enjoyed my watch, it kept my interest throughout and i loved the worlds they have manage to recreate. If you enjoy amazing cgi futuristic action films you will not be disappointed. I even took my wife who enjoyed herself and that is saying something.Pros:Amazing CGI and Graphics
Excellent fight scenes
Nice acting to bring the original characters to life
Very original in the world of movies today
Cons:
The pacing and story can seem a bit wierd to people unfamiliar with the original
Its not the complete story (I would defo pay to see number 2 though)
The fact it is a 12A when it shouldve been allowed to let loose!
Highly Recommended!",Alita - Battle Angel

2694,twodfan,Must watch!,10,8 February 2019,"I've never read the manga. But I understood the story. IMHO, the plot and the pace was great. Although the actions are fast paced and heavily made in CGI, it was amazing to watch. Not as dizzying as other movies like Transformers sequels and TMNT.
Alita was a wonderful protagonist. I would love to the next sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel
2695,Jas_Car,"A stylish, respectful and yet flawed retelling of a classic cyberpunk story",7,8 February 2019,"I would like to offer my spoiler-free thoughts on Alita:Battle Angel for both those new to the franchise and fans of the source material (as I have been for 24 years).The film centres around cyborg Alita, discovered as a discarded head & torso with amnesia, who starts having glimpses of her past life when her combat potential is awakened.First appearing in the 1990 manga/comic, this version of the story more closely follows the 1993 anime (therefore is a new retelling of the old retelling of the original story) with elements from later comic story arcs added for spectacle.Back then, Alita's genesis story and world were fresh and groundbreaking but, In the decades since, other writers and producers have used similar themes, concepts and imagery, a lot of which are now commonplace in sci-fi. Some have perhaps even been influenced by the original work (2013's 'Elysium' springs to mind). Thus, newcomers may not find too much here that separates this film from the dystopian sci-fi crowd.Personally, having read the ongoing manga graphic novels since 1995, it is with this background I judge the 2019 film.While I prefer the original manga story over the anime version this is based on, Alita:BA excels in expanding it into a modern cinematic blockbuster, handling most of the source material with respect. However, the film also brings with it some of the problematic pacing, narrative and character writing found in the anime, which are more obvious now that everything has been scaled up for this version (and adds some of it's own).It succeeds in translating the world and action to the big screen even better than I had hoped (I watched it on a 3D IMAX screen and the film looked consistently spectacular). The central character is very well portrayed, acted and realised, and there is greater focus here than before on her growth and development from being child-like to more adult as she tries to discover her place in the universe.There are plenty of nods and references to the graphic novels, some work well while others seem a bit forced or taken out of their original context. Fans of the manga would notice and really appreciate many of the inclusions and homages.Taken in isolation, I believe the film is enjoyable and reasonably accessible to newcomers, but suffers from cramming too much into an origin story and treading familiar ground. From that viewpoint I would give it a 6/10.However, as a fan familiar with the context of this movie and it's origin, it turned out far better than I expected it to. The love that the production team has for the project is there for all to see and I was engaged and entertained throughout. The production values were mesmerising; within 1 hour of the film ending I bought the ""art/making of"" book, I'm not usually that quick to do so! As such, I would give an 8.Having been aware that this film had been in stuck in development for nearly 20 years, I am extremely pleased that it has finally been made. However, I fear that the timing of it's release is perhaps too late to truly capture the imagination of modern audiences or cement itself a unique place in sci-fi history, unlike it's 30 year old manga counterpart.For these reasons, I'm settling on a 7.",Alita - Battle Angel

You feel the emotions she's feeling and get to follow her adventures as if you're travelling beside her. The plot is simple, a bad guy and a destined hero. But there are unique plot twists and turns in this story with a lot of cool things mixed into it. There twists and things make it truly different from other ""hero"" or ""good versus evil"" movies.

I believe this movie is a prime example of what's wrong with Hollywood right now.I'm not saying that Alita is the only movie that's wrong, Crimes of Grindelwald did the same thing and itsi hilarious.A big number of movies made today are just made to cash grab as much money as possible with ~30-45 minutes of good content that has anything to do with the plot. Alita is a very good example considering they spent around 90 minutes of screen on time on almost nothing. A lot of the plot is cut out and instead of the stuff that is important they give us a half assed love story. I'm just not going to say anything more cuz it's not worth my time. I already spent my money on this and I only hope you won't. If it ever comes on Netflix or Hulu you can maybe watch it if you want to lose 2 h of your life.

2720,awko-21111,"Alita, best film since Blade Runner 2049",10,14 February 2019,"""I WILL NOT STAND BY IN THE PRESENCE OF EVIL"", an inspiring line spoken by the protagonist in Alita: Battle Angel when facing an indomitable and frightening villain got me thinking that I will not stand by in the presence of clueless movie critics giving lukewarm reviews to this excellent movie. Hence my motivation in writing this review to a film that I consider a great visionary triumph with such groundbreaking special effects not experienced since Avatar and a world-building as dazzling as last year's critically acclaimed Blade Runner 2049.Based on the manga by Kishiro, the creative combo of Rodriguez and Cameron have created a world so technically stunning and cinematically immersive that it stirred and delighted my soul during the whole movie.At its heart, Alita is a tantalizing adventure about teenage self discovery and self fulfillment, although disguised by the plot which stated the protagonist as a 300 year-old alien berserker. The story combines science fiction with martial arts in a dystopian future. The fight scenes are as well choreographed as say The Matrix but avoid over indulging in extended and repetitive fight sequences. There's a lot of exposition fitted into a 2-hour movie, hence some scenes seemed to be truncated in order for the story to advance accordingly.That said, the plot has familiar elements made new but in more interesting ways. Elements of a world constantly being monitored borrow heavily from The Hunger Games, with the adrenaline infusing Motorball acting as ""the game"". The action scenes are thrilling, at times violent but as explained earlier, never over indulges. And when such scenes are short, I found myself wanting for more, hence repeat viewing ensues.The film ends with somewhat of a cliffhanger, with fanboys like me hoping against pessimistic box office forecast that this movie will make enough money to warrant 2 more sequels to complete the overarching story of one of the most interesting female characters in one of the most visually arresting, imaginative and energetic science fiction movies of all time.Go watch Alita: Battle Angel. Highly recommended.",Alita - Battle Angel

2723,jnchan-93016,Best anime adaption to date,9,11 February 2019,"Just saw it in Hong Kong so I think that must be earlier than the US release.Let's face it. Anime adaptions are hard. But this is the one time I feel the director and screenwriters actually understand the content. The movie does struggle to juggle plot, character development and action. But having said that they recognize that there is plot a character development, unlike dragon ball and death note adaptions.They stay fairly faithful to the original storyline but insert a few original bits about motorball that comes from later in the story. Overall, not a bad portrayal of the original story. If there is one thing missing, it's that they don't show how gritty it is to live in the scrap heap of a city. So they show the world that they love in but not enough to make you feel the desperatness to survive there",Alita - Battle Angel
2724,dbbabalik,Good balance between action and drama,8,16 February 2019,"Movie mostly satisfy the expectations from these successful director and writer. We are building a sympathy to a robot and feeling like ""she"" is a human. Her specialy builded face has a big influence on that, especially her big eyes. From start to end it never gets boring, there is a good balance between the action and the drama. So it is not an empty action movie, you are observing the feelings of a robot and the relation with others. She actually is a war machine but you never feel like that against her, it is the one of main success of this movie. Also it shows that no matter how much power a person have, she or he can still be so naive. One flaw of the movie is it ends so sudden like a tv series episode. To conclude, this movie definetely worth watching.",Alita - Battle Angel
2725,johnwilliams-02074,Great movie,10,11 February 2019,"People criticising the plot do not seem to realise that it is drawn from manga source material. So it is a manga plot. Ok, not that original, but not as stale as Ready Player One, and if anything there is too much plot condensed into the film. But, the CGI is incredible, the action scenes are amazing, and Alita's development, both as she realises the extent of her skills, and grows emotionally from a girl into a young woman are superbly handled. This will probably be one of my films of the year, if not the film, and for me ranks up there with great sci-fi films.",Alita - Battle Angel

Except for special effects and cgi, the movie is nothing much to talk about. The story seems a bit interesting, but the dialogues and the actions of the characters make the story worthless. Many scenes were too cringy to watch. No character had any depth and all displayed emotions looked completely fake. I didn't expect this from the director who made a masterpiece like Avatar.
Too many plot holes, emotionless characters with bad dialogues and lack of depth makes this movie unwatchable for me to say the least.
Only rated 3 because of cgi.",Alita - Battle Angel

2740,reeceagland,You have to see this,10,14 February 2019,"Wow, this is a truely amazing film from the first minute onwards.
It has it all, great visuals but such an amazing and well told story. You care for the characters more than many movies in recent history. The visuals are amazing and the fight scenes spectacular, but it is so much more than this.
The acting is top notch too and the director has done an amazing job.
I contrast this with Ghost in the Shell. That was an ok movie but it was boring, I didn't care for the characters if they lived or died, the acting was meh, the story, meh and it just lacked heart or much of a purpose. And so much is untold.
Not so this. From the get go you care about a cyborg machine with weird eyes. She is such a great character, you quickly forget the CGI that goes into it. It is one of those movies where the CGI is amazing but it not what the film is about, it fades into the background.
I really recommend this film. forget the oversized eyes of Alita, after a few minutes it is not noticeable.
Action packed too.
And it is one of those films you have to see on the big screen not wait for video/netflix.",Alita - Battle Angel

Because of those other unfair critics, i was quite skeptical about this movie at first, but i went along and gave alita battle angel a try. Ended up fallen in love with alita, no joke.Her eyes are the most targeted complain from those critics that might not even watched it yet.
I too think her eyes were too big at first, but while watching the movie, her eyes fit her so well that she looks beautiful, and not to mention she's kind, loving, sweet and can be cool and edgy when she is angry. Trust me. I'm not ashamed to say that the movie made me fall in love with alita, and i highly doubt that I'm the only one.Though there's some part in the story which needs improvement, but alita's character, cgi and battle sequence pretty much made up for the lost points! This movie deserve more than what the critics says, it's a gem covered in mud! We are humans too, we don't randomly like something that isn't good! Try it before you rate, don't destroy a great movie just because of alitas' eyes.Don't you think that a movie capable of turning a skeptic into a fan deserve a chance from you too?
(1st scenario:you don't like it) well thank you for trying anyway, maybe this movie isn't for you,just move on.
(2nd scenario:you love it very much) you got an extra movie sequel to look forward to.If you chose to ignore it,you might be missing something out. So give it a try, I'm not sure whether you'll like it, but i only know that they managed to turn me from a skeptic to a fan.",Alita - Battle Angel
2747,Chapati1009,IF YOU DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE YOU'LL REGRET IT,10,15 February 2019,"First off, i pity people who don't watch a movie just because critics say it's bad, instead of watching it and judging it by themselves, let me let you in on a secret, critics don't have magical powers they are human beings just like you and me, with their own prejudices in mind. I congratulate everyone that was involved in making this movie, its among the bestest(emphasis) movies i have seen so far it might even be better than the avengers. It's emotional, fun to watch, action packed, yaani it sucks you in, i don't even have words to explain to you guys how i was over satisfied with this movie. Please go watch it and don't miss out.",Alita - Battle Angel
2748,shanksnstuff,Alita: Battle Angel is beautiful adaptation and deserves a trilogy,10,16 February 2019,"I read the Battle Angel Alita (Gunnm) manga after I first saw the trailer for this movie. I had no idea what the manga was about but was curious by the initial trailer even though I thought there was a high chance of the movie flopping. Prior to starting the manga, I wasn't expecting much more than your commonplace action-adventure story. Well, I fell in love with the manga as soon as I started and read the whole thing in a few days. Alita is one of the first heroine characters that I genuinely love and her likeability is translated perfectly to a live action movie. If you are worried about the eyes, don't be. If anything, they make her even more lovable.The movie revolves around Alita who is a discovered by Dr. Ido as a disembodied head in a scrap heap beneath the large aerial city called Zalem. Once brought back to life, Alita immediately begins a journey of discovery of herself and where she came from, searching for relics of her past to help her define her purpose in life. Her innocence is challenged and she is forced to grow to face the harsh realities around her. Her relationships with Dr. Ido and Hugo are complex and compelling to watch unfold. The motivations of all characters are believable and relatable and I was not bored for one second. The movie ends on a note that I found very satisfying but will end up being highly disappointing is a trilogy is not made. To me, this is like the Star Wars: A New Hope of live-action manga movies. Genre defining and worthy of flagship recognition.Stop reading now if you don't want spoilers.The movie, while not a direct translation of the manga, represents its source material very well. A few artistic liberties are taken but they make sense and translate well. The movie covers right up to where Hugo dies trying to get to Zalem and ends with Alita starting as a badass Motorballer to try to distract herself from such an emotionally disturbing loss of her first love/as well as to try to win her way to Zalem. Perfect spot to cut it off. Nova is briefly introduced and will obviously play more of a role later in sequels are made. The pacing was good and the movie didn't feel too rushed. All I'm hoping for with the release of the movie on Blu-ray is an extended cut because I need more of this beautiful, brutal world.",Alita - Battle Angel
2749,fabio-11509,An example of what a film adaptation mustn't be,4,16 February 2019,"I will be honest, I didn't read the manga, you know, I think that mecha pseudo-seinen/shojo half psycologichal manga of 80-90 are pretty boring and sincerly a waste of time. When you read two or three you had read all of them: the main characters (usually heroines) ar all the same, all the plot twist are all the same and there are tons of clichè.
I have some thousand hours of manga reading so I suppose to know what I'm talking about.
During the show i could predict exactly where the plot would end, which character would have sacrificed himself, etc...
But i firmely think that no one should criticize it for this or for the lame parts in the original opera that are being reproduced in the film. If you love this kind of operas or if this is your first time watching something like this I sincererly think that you would enjoy it, well, you would enjoy maybe something like this but well made.The problem with this film is nor the CGI (not so incredible) nor the story from which it was adapted, it's the adaptation it self.
The original opera was designed clearly for an adult public but I think that the producers didn't have the balls to make something 14+ seeing the flop behind the corner, so they tried to turn the first part of this ""thing"" in a teenage comedy, trying to make it enjoyable for the children, recoloring the blood with green (children are stupid so if they see a severed head but instead of blood it loose green liquid there is no trauma) and destroyng the characters development erasing everything bad from their personality.So when we get catapulted in the second part after the break we found our self in the real story, where there are violent massacres that make the effort made during the first part completely useless, and all we have are weak characters introductions and like this could not be worst, a lot of must see part clearly present in the original opera not included in the pellicola. There are no characters evolutions scenes and we can't simply empathyze with the ""plot twists"" or what the viewer see as suddendly weird characters' decisions, that's so damn cringe.In the technical side we find a not shining CGI, a direction of the first part pretty screwed up and a totaly wrong pallette for the picture in my opinion (bright color just to make everything fabolus and very likable for the children).This film is so damn bad, they completely messed the original opera, it looks like a Michael Bay brainless film.",Alita - Battle Angel
2750,shakerali-74646,It's all about Rosa Salazar!!,10,16 February 2019,Simply Rosa Salazar deserves at least 2 or 3 awards for this amazing performance.. she did itt right!,Alita - Battle Angel
2751,ruweb,"Awesome 3d action movie with great, emotional, incredible and cute Alita",10,16 February 2019,"Summary: The movie is best viewed in 3D on a big screen. It has the A1 3d worldbuilding, awesome emotional Alita character, best action scenes so far.The world is amazing. Alita is living, emotional character, you believe her.
Robert Rodriguez and James Cameron made a great movie.
You can feel their love towards Alita, passion, a lot of work was put in it.It's based on a manga adaptation, but plot is easy to follow and a lot of people (like me) who didn't read original manga loved this movie (that's why some critics call the plot is flawed - damn them).Action scenes are creative, each one is unique, and honestly makes a lot of superhero movies look like 'one guy beats another with the same set of 10 kicks and punches'.
Alita vs all kind of cyborgs, robots - jumps, kicks, twists - you gonna love it.IMHO it's the once-in-a-lifetime experience actually, a milestone for movies in sci-fi / anime or manga adaptations. If you aren't watching it in 3d while it is in the movie theatres , you missing a lot. It probably won't work on a home screen (same as Avatar).Also everyone who cares that more great movies should be coming instead of fifth remakes of old stuff or just new superhero and nothing more original - please go watch the movie (though I love some Marvel movies).You will enjoy it.Thank you.",Alita - Battle Angel
2752,dupatton,There are no perfect films. This one is Faithful.,10,16 February 2019,"As the title of this review states. There are no perfect films. Every movie ever made can be subjectively criticized in some way by some one for some thing. This adaptation from the source material is the same. It can be criticized as all things can be on some level, but coming from this some one's perspective. It is most obviously a labor of love from it's re-creators. An anime, or manga adaptation in the western cinema is almost certainly a mark of death. However if you are familiar at all with the source. You can very plainly see that the makers truly wanted to be as faithful as they could be in putting their mark on this story. I'm not here to discuss the CGI, the acting, or any of the other facets of this film. I am simply here to leave my words of encouragement to the creators and all involved whether or not they have the chance to make another. You have done an amazing job and this fan of the original material is grateful you understood what you were getting into. Well done to you all.",Alita - Battle Angel

2754,aipsart,Like a video game walkthrough,3,16 February 2019,"Watching Alita is like watching a video game walkthrough - the game player talks to somebody, and fight. She gets some fancy equipments, another fight. Some conversations are supposed to give her some clues. Most plots and dialogues are just fillers. The solo goal is to check every spot on a map for non profound reasons. Once she's done that, game is over. Will see you around in game number 2.If you are a video game fan, you might like to spend some spare time watching it. Because the VFX is excellent, fighting scenes are exciting and impressive. But that's pretty much it. Therefore if you're a real sci-fi fan, who enjoys seeing some complicated characters, twisted stories, inspiring metaphors and deep thoughts, getting a peek of the meaning of life and humanity, the secrete of the past and the future... you better look somewhere else. Because in here you'll find none.",Alita - Battle Angel

The storyline was basic and cliché, the characters boring and often just cringe-worthy at their ""best"" and so to summarize, this whole abomination just managed to torture me the whole way through. I don't think I've honestly ever hated a movie THIS much, especially as I wrongly had such high expectations for it.

Came out with a huge grin on my face. Beautiful movie aesthetically, as well as story wise. Great lead character. I actually cared and wanted to know about Alita. I was immediately interested as the movie began. The movie honestly blew me away graphics wise. I did not think the anime eyes detracted from the movie in anyway. I definitely recommend this movie.

A solid and well-deserved 10/10 !!!",Alita - Battle Angel
2772,diastasis,Refreshing,8,17 February 2019,"I approached this movie with very modest expectations. I cringed when I saw an early trailer some months ago. The early-edit ""bug-eye"" thing that other reviewers have noted turned me off. Otherwise, the trailer looked run of the mill. I don't go out to the movies often. I am however eager to see well-crafted fantasy worlds on screen. Because Cameron's name was attached to it, I was confident that it would be well-crafted. As a kid, I loved Terminator 2. On the other hand, I quit watching both Titanic and Avatar before reaching the 20 minute marks.I saw the movie Alita in Real3D (highly recommended option) and I was pleasantly surprised.The CG was impressive, of course, but relative to contemporary big-budget production, who cares?The cyber-punk type setting was really well done. The action was constant and a little bit over the top, but it was surprisingly entertaining. The action somehow played well off of the Alita character. Before watching the movie I was apprehensive because I thought the Alita was going to be a straight-up android but because she's a cyborg the human element was compelling.The film makers were very successful at balancing the quantitatively small human drama with the action. What I mean is that the action is primary and big, but it lends a unique credibility to the human side of Alita. She's a ""battle-angel"" who has fallen to Earth from parts unknown. She discovers that she's been trained (made?) to kill and this carries the pace of the movie. But, she has the very human and vulnerable heart (for lack of a better word) of a young girl.My buddy and I were both agreed that Hugo was a tool. At the end of the movie we were glad that he got taken out. On one level the romantic angle was annoying. As another reviewer Zac Bertschy said, he's kind of a Disney-channel looking guy. When watching the movie, that sub-plot did seem intrusive and annoying. But, in retrospect, maybe it helped create depth in the Alita character. She is a girl after all. Of course this 15 year old girl with amnesia will fall for the first douchey guy who comes her way. She hardens her heart when her attempt at love fails. More could be said about the awkward heart scene. I hope that Cameron invests some of those Avatar millions into an Alita sequel. They should keep the romance subordinate to the action but still develop it further. Maybe she'll come across a real prince charming and she'll struggle to let herself love again. That would be good.There is so much room to expand into sequels. I hope it happens soon.Also, I was pleased that there was no discernible girl-power pc signalling. I loved the warmth of the fatherly Ito character.",Alita - Battle Angel

2778,lifecoachlynch,Best sci-fi martial arts action scenes.,8,18 February 2019,"I can't think of a movie that has better sci-fi martial arts action sequences. Of course, Robert Rodriguez is known for well thought out and interesting action sequences. His unique vision and skills for creating intense action sequences adaptes itself nicely to this backstory and genre.I personally enjoy a wide-eyed bighearted female action hero. I'm sure you've noticed that there is a theme in Hollywood for characters of that description. Alita is, so far my favorite version of that type of hero, and I am totally a Star Wars fan boy. (I love Rey too.)I would have liked to have given this 10 stars. Honestly I think I know James Cameron could have given us a little more to walk away with. Both Star Wars and Avatar leave us in a state of reverie. We carry with us a sense of interconnectedness with the forces around us. We're drawn into the mystery and our imaginations find ways to experience that mystery in every day life once we've experienced the world that those films bring us into. Alita did not deliver that quasi-spiritual mystery. I would have liked to have felt like I was part of something bigger. Alita is the hero, and there no mystery to unravel or experience. I think they could've done more to get into our heads.Alita was set in a dystopian future. However unlike Blade runner, or the Matirx I didn't carry that sense of mysterious dystopia out of the theater me. I loved the Alita movie! But the only dystopic or mysterious feelings I have are the sad feelings that I will have if they don't follow up with a slightly deeper sequel. I fell in love with Alita, but not her universe.",Alita - Battle Angel

Seeing Alita: Battle Angel sparked an ecstatic sense of hope that finally, moviemaking have caught up, and have done justice to the untapped potential of the expansive and immersive universe which could only could have been experienced through manga and anime from 28 years ago. The core of being young, the simple emotions of unconditional love, innocence lost and idealism thrashed against an invredible contrast to violent and evil gore. You can see that Alita: Battle Angel was created with love, compressing a much longer source content in multiple tankoubons, while managing to retain the majority of visual, emotional and immersive elements of the original work. Even if compressing the movie sacrificed some plotline material, I think the resulting work overall still manages to retain and even improve the original canon, which I'm sure those who have read the original series will appreciate fully. I hope that this will actually even bring a lot of viewers to the original manga, which is not constricted by a pg13 rating. Overall, one of the best imax experience I've had in years, thanks to Cameron, Rodriguez, Kishiro and all of the team that created the movie, congrats on creating a stellar example of how a movie should be made.",Alita - Battle Angel

The CGI was masterful and the fight scenes were some of the best I've seen in any movie out the past few years. The pacing at the start of the movie was to fast with throwing multiple major plots within a few scenes in order to quickly get a semblance of a story for the movie going. The relationships were very quick to develop and were quite cheesy, Other than Alita I never really cared for the other character's because they were thrown in so fast and quickly moved away from. I really recommend people go see the movie overall it has been one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen the last number of years, I really hope a second movie comes quickly from it and maybe a prequel to explain Alita's origin as that seemed very interesting.",Alita - Battle Angel

I don't usually like adaptations, but I had high expectations for this one since I trusted both the screenwriter and director of this movie. And they did a good job of portraying the world and stayed true to the manga's spirit. The action scenes are awesome and the performance of Rosa Salazar really brought the character to life... or to CGI, with those big doll eyes! The main protagonist is outstanding and captivating and has the same charm, appeal and strength of will of the original protagonist. Praised be Rosa Salazar!Nothing is perfect, though. Since it's a hollywood blockbuster targeted at a higher audience, some elements lacked the depth of the original material. First of all, it didn't put much effort on the real biggest villain, which wasn't the bad guys, but the system. The Scrapyard was a charming place with a lot of people struggling with their lives, although there was no justice; its citizens were simply exploited to supply stuff like resources and services for Zalem, which provided little in turn; Robots and electronic defense systems acted as overlords to the local population. The remaining of the political power rested on the hands of criminal warlords who tried to benefit from the system while contributed both to the floating city but also to making the citizens to act on the line. Everyone who tried to act against the system were simply put to death, either by its robots or by criminals or bounty hunters. It's a similar environment to a slum or a ""favela"" in third-world countries, like Brazil or African countries. The director portrayed this part of the story in a very shallow manner. You simply got to hate the baddies, simply because they were evil and Alita's anger was, thus, directed to them; In the original material they had character, while the system simply treated them as replaceable parts. The motorball sport was completed detached from this main theme, and I see it more as a mean to appeal to a younger audience, like quadriball did for Harry Potter.My other disappointment was with the villain ""Nova"". Until he makes his appearance, there are only clues of his involvement on the events around Alita. Instead, the directors preferred to give him a face and a voice, acting more like a big boss gangster instead.All in all, I believe it's a good action-packed movie. And a good job for a manga or anime adaptation, which is rare. Definitely too shallow to be considered great, but entertaining and satisfying. For this, I give it my 8 stars. Now I'm waiting for the sequels!",Alita - Battle Angel
2792,tatdob-00946,Failed adaptation of a thought-provoking and complex graphical novel,2,19 February 2019,"I would like to start off with saying that the BAA graphic novels played a large role in my growing up as a kid as they helped me get introduced to philosophy, complex character development, and grey morals. I had a feeling this film would be a dumbed down adaptation of the novels, but I was not prepared for this. The directors of this film did very little justice to the complex characters and philosophy displayed in the graphic novels. They took the most interesting and chaotic neutral character, and villainized him for no reason, taking away some of his best quirks and personality. Visual effects couldn't save the drudgery of cheesy unrealistic dialogue, inconsistent plotline, and flat character development produced by this film. My friend had to hold me back from throwing my popcorn at the screen (I am often quite a composed person).",Alita - Battle Angel

2797,helojumper-82082,Amazing picture,10,19 February 2019,"James Cameron continues to astonish with innovation and storytelling. Alita is a very well written and directed movie. The technology used to create this move is spectacular and the action scenes are breath taking. I have already seen this movie twice and want to watch it again and support it. It is a shame that there has not been much advertisement that I have seen but I hope good word of mouth helps it excel so we can get a sequel. The story hits you in the feels and it is as if you are in the movie yourself interacting with the characters. My goodness what a movie! If you are sitting on the wall, go see it you will not regret it I promise!",Alita - Battle Angel

Just saw it on imax 3d mall of Africa , south Africa ! Blew my mind on the scope of this movie , don't believe the haters , this is for fans of action with heart and James does that well ! No fillers just gold , see it on imax or better ,a great under dog story ! Visually stunning and landscapes are well defined ! This just entered my top 10 of all time !",Alita - Battle Angel
2799,starofelyon,This is a REALLY good movie!,9,20 February 2019,"Don't let the large eyes put you off. After about 5 to 10 minutes into the movie, Alita's eyes become one of her most endearing traits. Alita is one of the cutest and yet most tough characters to ever find her way into film. Imagine the Terminator with the body of a teenage girl and the martial arts skill of warrior from the most outlandish kung fu film ever. As powerful (and violent) as Alita becomes, she never sacrifices her loving spirit and feminine qualities. I haven't seen a heroine this qualified to be such in many years. Certainly, NO heroines in competing popular franchises come anywhere close to Alita the Battle Angel.",Alita - Battle Angel
2800,anishgayam,One of the best movies I have every watched,10,20 February 2019,"Alita is one of the best experiences I have ever had in my life. I haven't been this emotionally attached to the protagonist in any other movie I watched in the past. This movie gives you a whole new experiences with amazing never seen before fighting scenes. I am the type of guy to get bored watching a movie for the second time, but with this, I can't wait to go and watch it again. I find it unbelievable that such a movie would be voted so badly on rotten tomato's and other websites, but I heard it's doing better. The producers are complete geniuses and the graphic designers and editors were phenomenal. If I could, I would donate millions to this movie so it could surmount its production cost as fast as possible. I speak for everyone when I say this: There MUST be a sequel. SEQUEL SEQUEL SEQUEL.",Alita - Battle Angel

2804,khmu-55370,BADASS sci-fi with STUNNING visuals!,9,20 February 2019,"One of the best action driven movies I've seen in awhile, solid story telling and solid acting. Alita was so badass and the Oscar definitely goes to Rosa Salazar who gave life to Alita. Aside from the touch of romance in the film, that threw some of us off a bit (including myself) the film wasn't cliche nor cheesy. The movement was smooth and the CGI was stunning. The character development was great and there were numerous epic moments that really sealed the deal for me.I'm hoping a movie like this gets a trilogy, although for now I can't wait for the second film!",Alita - Battle Angel
2805,bgeq,im in awe!,10,20 February 2019,"Film was spectacular. The romance was a little awkward. But other than that, the movie just blew me away. Alita is the baddest woman/cyborg of all time movie female greats. Up there with Ripley, Sarah Conner, and Wonder Woman. James Cameron is still king.",Alita - Battle Angel
2806,panagiporets,Epic scifi movie,10,20 February 2019,"I just watched Alita and I left the theater wanting more,the story was great the action was amazing Alita was bigger than just one movie,she needs 10 more movies to explore her brilliance as a character,bottom line it was the best scifi movie I have seen since Avatar.",Alita - Battle Angel
2807,olivercormejo,Hoping for a sequel,9,20 February 2019,"I liked it a lot more than I expected, going in with low low expectaitons. Fun if don't think too much about the overall plot and rack your brains too much - there are pieces that are well thought out (the world in general) and things that are rushed through (romance) and some predictable cliffhanger elements.",Alita - Battle Angel
2808,joshuastanfordpersonal,I cant wait for the sequel,10,21 February 2019,"This was an amazing movies, and I can't recommend it enough. If your a fan of the original source material you are in for a treat. If your not familiar with the original source material your in for a bigger treat. I was on the fence, watching and waiting for the moment that the movie would officially win me over. And I think that moment will be the same for a lot of people. It was the first fight scene. Hands down one of the most bad-ass scenes ever. I hope enough people go to see this movie so that we will get a sequel. Don't mistake the movies ending as sequel bait either, but there is so much more story to tell because the original source material has so much more. After seeing this movie you will be waiting for a sequel too. Finally, a good anime to live action adaptation that follows the original to a T. Go see it.",Alita - Battle Angel

2810,hypersmiley-61316,Exceeds Expectations,9,21 February 2019,"Rosa Salazar really shines with a flawless performance. She invoked so much empathy from me that I teared up countless times. The rest of the casting was an excellent choice. The changes to the character Hugo are very welcomed alongside subtle changes for the better with the other characters. The changes to Hugo brings relationships closer together. The changes to Zapan are absolutely awesome. Gore has been toned down a lot, which I think is great to reach a younger audience. There are many parallels to our own world that are thought provoking. Pacing is good. There were two bits of dialogue that were immature to me, but weren't a big deal. I liked the anime, love the manga, and so far love the movie even more. Another movie will need to step it up to beat the rest of the manga. Hopefully then I'll be able to give a ten star rating.",Alita - Battle Angel
2811,aspenjcrystal,Ambitious fun and fast film,9,21 February 2019,"The movie packs a lot together in a fun way so you are quickly immersed into a futuristic yet somehow relatable setting. I feel like so many movies are recycled ideas that have already been created on film, and though this story is apparently based from the 90s and presents some aspects we've seen before, it's presented with creative methods to deliver something new and refreshing which leaves you wanting more (in a good way).Wasn't completely ground breaking yet it pushed the envelope further and could lead to more intriguing movies in the future (hoping). I feel like anyone with imagination and curiosity will find this movie a rare treat. The themes and issues are very relatable to many demographics, and are shared in a non-abrasive way, which is sadly rare these days in cinema. The characters were colorful and intriguing, the cinematography was enjoyable and the story was fast yet purposeful. I greatly enjoyed this entire film and can't wait to own it when it's released!",Alita - Battle Angel

Truly Inspiring.,10,21 February 2019,"When I was just a 12 year old girl, the cover art for a random manga I had never hear of, or even knew what it was about, caught my eye. I had a gift card for my birthday, and on a whim, I bought it. I devoured it, and then I devoured the rest.I turn 30 in a week now, and I spent the last 17 years hoping it would be turned in to a movie, and then the last 12 years checking this IMDB for information every few years. The moment I saw it ""in-production"" my heart started to race.As I waited in line in the theater, I felt like my 12 year old self, so consumed by the world of Scrap Iron City and Zalem floating above. I felt the spark of knowing my journey with Alita would begin again.In all, it truly was the movie I long awaited, and I don't understand any critics opinion stating it was a horrible movie. Perhaps my bias blinds me, but from the viewer reviews you see all over, the ""critic"" review does not match what the movie goers are saying.This was the start of Alita's journey on the big screen, and I do hope that this won't be the end. She has so much growing to do, and we have so much still to learn.Alita is no long just an insignificant girl.",Alita - Battle Angel

I can't believe how many times I've gone back to see it, and it's amazing that so many others have as well. This movie emphasizes theme over plot that leaves you with an everlasting love for the film, making you want to come back again and again. Going in for another round, I'm more excited than I was the first time. It also helps that they focused the story on Alita, rather than trying to shock-and-awe you with the extraordinary visuals alone. I can go on and on about how great the movie, or the stunning performance of Rosa Salazar, or the masterpiece that Robert Rodriguez has created, or even James Cameron's passion for this project entirely, but I'm not going to. I shouldn't have to. And you shouldn't listen to me or anyone else. Just go an see it, and forge your own feelings. The motion capture performances of the actors is off the charts, and the story is just so good. Going in my first time, I had neutral expectations, but my whole world has been shook by this incredible film and I can't stop seeing it. So ignore the biased critic airheads, and go see it while you still can!",Alita - Battle Angel

Every second of the movie i was completely immersed. To be honest the story moved me more than any movie I've seen in a long time. This is coming from someone who goes to the movies at least 3 times a month and knew nothing about this movie before seeing it. This tops everything put out this year and is probably in my top 10 movies I've ever seen,Alita - Battle Angel

I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life, but this is just beyond awful. Watching Alita: Battle Angel was the longest 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life. My family and I all hated so much and we were falling asleep by the end. The acting was terrible and the script was horrible. The plot had so many holes it was unbelievable. The only positive thing I can say about Alita: Battle Angel is that it really brought my family together with the common hatred of this movie.",Alita - Battle Angel

The second time I saw it in Dolby 3D with its intense sounds, there was nothing like it. Hard to say this isn't by far the best work we have seen on the big screen in a long time. After seeing it 2 times in 3D, it is hard to think there is any other way to see the movie. 11/10 Looking forward to the possibility of #2!",Alita - Battle Angel

Over the next 10 months or so the 2nd and 3rd trailers slowly changed my mind and come February I was pretty hyped for the movie. I saw it on Friday in IMAX and went back to see it again the next day in IMAX again. I have since seen it 11 times and have dropped hundreds of dollars on related merchandise. The acting, the CGI performance capture, the plot, the attention to detail, and most importantly, the faithfulness to the source material are all off the charts. Alita is quite possible the most ""human"" character I have ever seen in a movie, which is ironic seeing as she is a cyborg whose only organic organ is her brain. I've never seen a movie more than once in theater before and have never been this invested in any piece of popular media. If Alita: Battle Angel does not get a sequel that does it justice I am going to sink into a years long depression.",Alita - Battle Angel

2830,M1k3Land3rs,This is how a manga should be adapted,10,25 February 2019,"20 years ago when I was a kid, I used to go to my little city bookstore and sat there for hours reading mangas such as DBZ, Captain Tsubasa, Yuyu Hakusho and one that was special for me, Gunnm.I was very doubtful when I first heard about the project of adapting this manga to a movie, thanks to the total Dragon Ball Evolution/ The Last Airbender disaster, the casting choices of Ghost in the Shell and Death Note...I have to say that this movie performed far beyond my expectations. It is not only a homage or an astonishing adaptation, it is simply a great movie.The story is almost a 100% faithful to the manga, with some parts created but these choices make sense throughout the movie.
The movie director made such a great job that I felt like the manga was the storyboard of the movie.I was making fun of the choice of having Alitta's eyes in cgi but now I cannot imagine depicting this cyborg without it.I loved the stories of Gally, and I hope that there will be more about Alitta in the future...",Alita - Battle Angel
2831,traintracks-46274,I want to reiterate and do a more professional review of this title,10,2 March 2019,"The story line, of the manga and anime and movie, I realize now were simply fleshed out by the manga writer/illustrator and I only have realized this in hindsight of my complaints to missing scenes that I liked, and perhaps I was being a little too over critical and inappropriate in my first original review. I'm going to try to analyze the script without too many run on sentences and explain what I like and love about it. I think most people already appreciate the stylings of the cgi and eye candy so I won't be touching on that very much in my review. The sword, that Alita receives from the hunter warrior Zapan is not anything I ever knew about backstory until recently, and I have yet still to read the entire manga. As I have stated earlier I was just a fan of the anime and watching amvs on youtube for a while. In hindsight of my original review basically, I came to the self realization that if you were to change anything or make these scenes happen...the entirety of the story would be completely befuddled and muddied waters of sense. It just wouldn't make sense and I only realize this now. Which is why I'm rewriting this review to say that I realize how stupid my original review was. It was silly and pointless. However, they did actually remove clive/gime and I believe I know why they did now. The reason is because he basically makes the story arc harder to follow. he is basically somewhat insignificant and complicates the story but also is basically an irrelevant eye candy. From the original anime. Extra unnecessary work, for a 2 hour movie, you can't quite fit every damn thing in so I totally understand the reasoning now. It would be like, if in ghost in the shell 2 for example if they made a movie out of stand alone complex anime series they could not at all fit the entire anime into a movie that should be about 2 hours...which has like 22 episodes each of the 2 seasons. it's just impossible. It's very actually important to understand how this works. Because otherwise anime/manga adaptations will fail, if you don't know how to stick to the bread and butter of the story and remove the or rather cut the fat like george foreman grill actually. Does that make sense? The complex story, has to be trimmed and turned into something that is 2 hours, and I'm glad I and others are seeing this and appreciating how well done and executed it was on this film. I believe the same method should be used if they make another ghost in the shell film? I hope they do, and I hope you guys make battle angel 2, also. Would be very cool and epic to me. I have no idea how I would go about this, because I'm simply not involved enough in this one to flesh out story line with manga, but I have watched ghost in the shell so many times I think I can help with that story fleshing. If there was a longer anime I would definitely be involved in this one also. Oh no I'm not actually involved in ghost in the shell or this movie at all. Neither of which I've had anything to do with, I'm just already thinking about writing or helping write a script for gits 2 movie. that makes sense and hopefully people will like. Basically I would just be cutting down that of which was already given to us and turning it into 2 hours essentially. by personal choice of scene keeps and removes. which probably best actually to involve creator of anime and manga writers and animators etc? So, anyway I think I am off topic. The really cool thing about this movie is, they made the story shorter, and more straight to the point so that it actually makes 1000000% sense when you watch it. I liked all of the new additions and changes, they make sense and are enjoyable to watch. Thanks for all of your hard work, I hope to see another film soon maybe in a year I really hope.

I love the huge eyes on Alita; well done!The movie in 4dx was fun because the chairs vibrate and shake and swivel up and down and there is puffs of air and water mists. It was great excitement. The 4dx glasses came with the purchase of the movie ticket and I thought the glasses made the movie too dark because of the dark tint.I plan on seeing this movie a third time and am choosing standard format again so I don't have to wear the dark 4dx glasses.

2840,jamesleeming,Loved it,10,27 February 2019,"Went into the film with relatively limited expectations but I really was blown away. You don't need to read the manga or anything.Basically, it's a fun and wholesome heroes journey in a fresh and exciting universe. No stale lasers, or energy beams pointing to the sky. No Marvel quips, no generic shooting and explosions. The action is all melee, stylised robot-fighting. Better yet, we get massive robotic brawling while whizzing around on skates.This movie doesn't ask you to think deeply about society, it's free and completely irrelevant to the modern world. It's blessedly simple and fun, a dystopia without angst and whining. It's an adventure story without subverting expectations. It's romance without cringe. It's a great film I'd thoroughly recommend, old-timey themes with modern graphics.",Alita - Battle Angel
2841,Cold-burger52,Good,9,2 March 2019,"Thank the Lord Hugo dies, took two attempts but finally.",Alita - Battle Angel
2842,mcwilliamscarsond,Nice story but seems like they couldnt decide on ending,7,27 February 2019,"The ending wasn't good at all, seems as if there are parts of the movie missing or that something is missing.",Alita - Battle Angel
2843,susanacorssio,One of the best live action adaption,8,27 February 2019,"Impressive film on many fronts. Great special effects, of course, but wonderful pacing and engaging action scenes. Unlike some CGI heavy films, Alita knows when to end a scene and move on. The romance is cringe worthy and the weakest link in the film but, in the end, worked as a display of Alita's character. Lead actress is fantastically expressive - tons of nuance - and perfectly rendered - no hint of uncanny valley despite the large cyborg eyes.",Alita - Battle Angel
2844,alphamale-75852,Amazing movie for everyone,10,1 March 2019,"The movie is amazing. I've already seen it 2 times in the cinema, thinking about 3rd time. It's first time ever when I'm ready to pay for the tickets to see movie again in the cinema and surely will buy Blue ray. Very important thing is that you have to watch it first in IMAX 3D, it makes you feel really engaged in it. As far as I see, many people are really thinking about Alita as manga/anime adaptation. Personally I haven't heard about the comics before the movie, only after. I just saw several trailers and decided to check it out straight in the cinema. I would say that it's pretty big mistake to advertise and portray it mainly as an anime adaptation. Because many people don't really know a lot about anime culture in general and even think that it's weird, etc. In reality this movie is for everyone, you don't need to know anything about original anime story, with fresh mind I think it's even better to get the movie right.The visual side is done perfectly. Cameron, Landau and Rodriguez team is really on top of that game. I don't really understand why it has been criticized by some critics for the scenario. It's understandable if you're huge original anime fan and got own vision on how it should be done. Otherwise it's just not right to criticize the entertainment movie that way. It's obviously not a movie like a Green Book, which scenario is pretty simple, but very human. Comparing it with Avatar or Ready Player One, I can say that Alita's story is more interesting for me and I won't call it a standard scenario. Surely the main hero Alita is just lovely, not sure why her eyes are an issue for some people, but they look fantastic. Also, she smiles a lot in the movie and that's catching as well. She is naive and idealistic, that's why it's really easy to fell in love with her. Rosa Salazar bravo. General cast is great and everyone is fitting characters really well. Hopefully we'll see all of them in the second and third parts, one movie is simply not enough for Alita's story.Not sure why is not doing perfect on the domestic market and hope that things will improve. International audience love this movie and it feels like China and Japan are ready to help with earnings. Let's support our Battle Angel and show production team that we want more of it.",Alita - Battle Angel
2845,rowdood,The fight scenes were fun to watch,4,28 February 2019,"This movie starts with an expansive and interesting sci-fi world, and then the characters explain what happened and the world just kinda of exists with its many holes. I think the biggest reason I didn't like this movie was the dialogue: I hated it. It was usually just lore, which is fine, but not much thinking was involved on my part. It didn't often add to characters beyond the first 1 or 2 lines they spoke, and it didn't usually advance the plot. in many cases a lot of dialogue is arguing between Alita and Hanz Landa, and in the arguments Hanz gets the most development out of any character in the film, talking about how he bounty hunts to help people; which is why I think he was the best character in the film, but he wasn't above and beyond any other characters.The characters were likable enough, but definitely didn't benefit from the long run time, as most weren't exactly the most interesting people. You wanted the good guys to win and bad guys to lose, so they were able to do that much. But Jesus crist, Hugo. Hugo was a incredibly flat character. He was just boring. He did bad stuff but it wasn't developed. We didn't get to watch him change. He just stopped doing the bad things. His dialogue was bad; not advancing his character though the film, But there wasn't much of a character for it to advance, so that makes sense. In the scene where he's beheaded I was honestly hoping he died. And I didn't feel anythingwhen he died at the end.The fights were visually interesting, but had low tension. I know Alita was technically in danger if her head was smashed, but it never felt like that was going to happen; and i never cared enough about the other characters, (or her) for me to care that they were at risk.Basically this movie was cool to look at, but had some of the least engaging dialogue I've ever heard, with most audience members figuring out the point of a scene right at the beginning and having to wait for it to finish, without the scene adding anthing to what the viewer assumed would be shown. I often see it compared to BR 2049, a movie that I loved, but that I loved for the questions it asked, and for it's theme and characters. You don't really get that in ABA, but it held my attention when fights were happening.",Alita - Battle Angel
2846,iskvorc,BATTLE ANGEL!,9,28 February 2019,"I m no critiq so I wont go in depth analasis, I will just give you my personal experiance:When i went to see it, I didn't watch any trailers and had no clue about the movie, all i heard is ""go check it out, its great"". There was no posters or commertials where i live and if it was not for few youtube channels saying go see it, I probably wouldn't even know it existed. At first I was ""battle angel, that sounds corny"" but after i watched it, i was ""yeah, go Battle angel!""
I was 100% in the movie the whole time, never checked my watch and at end of a film, I didnt even finished my drink, which was the first for me 😀.
The world is beautiful, characters likable and relatable, and Alita is awsome. Sfx and battle scenes are epic and worth going to cinema just on them alone.
This movie is a gem and it hurts to see it struggling, go see it! 😀",Alita - Battle Angel
2847,vetovolition,A Sci-Fi / Fantasy Lover's Dream,10,28 February 2019,"I missed all hype and trailers for this movie and just watched it blind. It was phenominal! I actually went back the next day to watch it again in 3D it was that good. The CGI was out-of-this-world, with seamless interaction with human characters and surroundings.The world they've created is fascinating and raises so many questions; you can tell there's a rich history that would take aeons to explain in details. The viewer is instead invited to join Alita on her own journey to sense off everything, figure out what's going on, how everything fits together, and what role she is to play in it all.If I had one complaint it would be the love story feels a little rushed and a little forced. However the second time I watched it it felt more natural... There's only so much time in 2 hours to dedicate to rich character development and romance, whilst you're busy scripting awesome cyborg fights. All things considered, I think they did a pretty great job with it, although not as good as Avatar's love story/ development.If you like Sci-Fi, fantasy, stunning action / fight scenes, great CGI and a deep and rich world to ponder, do yourself a favor and go see Alita in theatres as soon as you can!",Alita - Battle Angel
2848,danielrexmcclure,GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!,10,1 March 2019,"1. This film is WAY darker than the marketing led us to believe. It's not a cheesy teen dystopian film, and it definitely doesn't shy away from violence/ blood. They got away with using blood because most of it is blue(cyborgs and such)
2. People on the internet like to talk about the eyes. I get it, at first glance they look off putting, but when you get into the movie they blend right in and you don't really notice them.
3. The character development is really good. Alita goes from an innocent little girl in the beginning to an absolute badass by the end. She is angry and ready to fight the system.
4. Please go see the film before posting criticism. A friend of mine said he would never see this film(eyes), so I saw it without him. Later, I finally convinced him to go see it with me. After seeing it he told me it was way better than he thought and he would definitely see it again. I think a lot of people thought this film would be trash and have vowed to never see it, try it before you knock it! It's an excellent film and it deserves a sequel.",Alita - Battle Angel
2849,simonjardine-69155,Incredible !!,10,1 March 2019,"The previews / trailer sucks.. You MUST watch this movie at the big screen.
I personally thinks it's better than Avatar, simply amazing 11 stars !!!!",Alita - Battle Angel
2850,doicescubogdan,Enjoy,10,14 March 2019,U guys enjoyed the movie!! Then why not give it a 10..this way they will make more movies like this one.,Alita - Battle Angel
2851,tingyenlin,Best manga to live-action movie of all time.,10,2 May 2019,"Based on the gigantic world created by Yukito Kishiro, James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez did so well to put all the elements of the manga and the heart of it in a 2 hour movie. The visual effects is stunning and look even better in IMAX. Alita has super big eyes, yet it doesn't bother me at all. In fact, the big eyes make Alita such an emotional character. Rosa Salazar did so well to make this cyborg girl a human but robot. With a cliffhanger at the end of the movie, it deserves a sequel to fulfill the amazing world Kishiro had created.",Alita - Battle Angel
2852,ssgtnelson,Great Movie,10,3 March 2019,"To put things into perspective, I saw this movie on a whim, I don't know anything about it's background, and I'm not a fan of Japanese animation.
So, with that aside... what a great a movie. A few times I was lost concerning the world I was watching... but that makes sense. Alita awoke not knowing this world, so I don't know anything as well.
The world is interesting, especially the past. I'm hoping they do another movie just so I can learn more about this world and what led up to the current events. The graphics are amazing. The cyborgs look stunning, even the patched together cheap cyborgs.
And Alita, as a character, was amazing. She was the perfect mix of teenage angst/rebellion and loving, obedient daughter. Without to much of a SPOILER she rebels against her fathers wishes, and when he rushes into the bar to 'save' her she lowers her head/hides her face in shame as to what she had done... but still sticks to her guns! That level of humanity shows through... whoever made this character did a marvelous job with her. She wasn't whiny... she wasn't a Mary Sue... she's wasn't a snob... she wasn't arrogant. She was perfect and lovable.",Alita - Battle Angel
2853,ChrisWhippit,Fascinating!,9,3 March 2019,"Alita got me good.

2855,mpstrik,Guaranteed enjoyment for animelovers,10,3 March 2019,"There are no boring or unnecessary moments in the strong and well structured story of this movie. While watching you can feel the anime and manga source, which means it is translated well from it's origin. If you enjoy cyberpunk and anime you can't miss this movie. And I recommend to watch it 3D in the cinema. Some fight scenes are really immersive.
This movie really suprised me how much I liked it and it might very well suprise you too.",Alita - Battle Angel
2856,sasha-06162,Conclusion,10,4 March 2019,"And so I will begin in order.
First: the film is great, Yes there are certainly some drawbacks, but exactly this does not spoil the picture of the film
Example: Alita made a more cartoonish look, I'm not arguing because there is the original manga Ality, also a cartoon painted Alita; next Ality big eyes is the most annoying, to be honest cyborgs are different about the shape of the eyes, it really is a small school, but again I repeat it does not spoil the picture, as you get used to the main characterSecondly: This film I believe that it is one of the better ideas, James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez, those who do not understand the plot of the film or that the film is banal,kids, not for adults, it is deeply mistaken. The plot shows the life of a cyber girl named Alita, who fought against the scientist Nova, but lost and Dr. IDO brought her back to life and shows a film about the life and character of Alita herself, who she was, and who she became now, she was given a second chance, which can not be missed and she took advantage of it; Most people write that the movie plot is not interesting, too many stocks, well I'll tell you why, James Cameron was his idea to put the movie alit for, and only he knew what the story is, it could very well expand the plot of this film, but he couldn't do it because at the time would take 3 hours, and even more, unhappy with the criticism, so Cameron had to narrow the story, but the most important show is still able to do it.My last word: ask all critics and viewers, please do not put little marks and not to lower the rating, please Yes, this movie was half taken from the manga, so what, what difference is Cameron has shown feelings of love, sorrow, happiness good Ality which girls was not all, the Actress ( Rosa Salazar) who got the role Ality was able to Express all the feelings Ality as in the original, and this is the only film which was shown when mixing the manga and the present reality, I ask you again not to reduce the rating of this film and I ask the same of critics too, these Directors tried very hard to show all the feeling as if alive.
I will be glad if all respond",Alita - Battle Angel
