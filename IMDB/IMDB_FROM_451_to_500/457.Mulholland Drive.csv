0,TheLittleSongbird,One of David Lynch's best and one of the best of the decade- not for all tastes though,10,4 September 2014,"I found Mulholldand Drive to be a fantastic film, having loved all of David Lynch's films seen personally so far (personal favourite being The Elephant Man, one of the most emotionally affecting films ever made) with the exception of Dune. For this viewer, Mulholland Drive is one of Lynch's best films and among the best films of the 2000s, but it is also one of Lynch's most love-it-or-hate-it films- from a love/hate him director- as seen in the reviews here. And it is very understandable why people would dislike it, it is weird (not unusual for Lynch), it is slow, the story mayn't be clear to some, the symbolism may go over people's heads and it does get confusing especially towards the end. And it has nothing to do with not getting it, it is just not for everybody's tastes and not everybody is going to connect with it. For those who love it neither of these are problems, admittedly it is a good idea to be acquainted with Lynch's style beforehand so that it doesn't come across as too much of a shock and also to watch it more than once. Justifying what was so great about Mulholland Drive, a good place to start would be the visuals, which are never less than scintillating with bold colours, symbolic imagery and some of the most striking cinematography of any film from this decade. The Silencio Club scene is so beautifully shot. The haunting retro score, thought-provoking dialogue and that it contains some of Lynch's finest direction and the best directing of all the films from 2001 are further things to like. The story is where those who dislike it are perplexed, granted there may be too many plot strands crammed in towards the end and not everybody's going to like how the ending is open to interpretation, but with me the thriller-drama story was gripping and I was captivated so much by the surrealist atmosphere, offbeat emotional intensity and sizzling suspense that the slow pacing didn't feel slow at all. It wisely focused on the relationship between Watts and Harring, and while bizarre it was very well handled. The cast carry the film brilliantly, especially with the sensational lead performance of Naomi Watts who has never been better than here. Laura Harring is enchanting and Justin Theroux is very good. In conclusion, while not for everybody's tastes for understandable (and quite obvious) reasons Mulholland Drive was fantastic in all areas. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Mulholland Drive
1,Leofwine_draca,Not the sort of film I enjoy watching,2,29 April 2017,"Like INLAND EMPIRE, MULHOLLAND DRIVE is an obtuse and mysterious exercise in film-making from director David Lynch. Like INLAND EMPIRE, it's an abstract mood piece, a bizarre mystery that asks the viewer to do plenty in working out the meaning of clues and seemingly random moments in an effort to build a picture from one big puzzle. Like INLAND EMPIRE, I hated it.When I sit down to watch a movie, I like linear storytelling and concrete detail. I don't like odd things that have no explanation and are present for the sake of merely being arty. MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a slow and long-winded narrative about a couple of women exploring a strange and skewed world. The Hollywood setting allows Lynch some self-referential themes, but I found the whole thing a big turn-off, not least the bland performances from Naomi Watts and Jeanne Bates. The ending, when it hits, offers a disappointing twist which rounds off the production quite aptly.",Mulholland Drive
2,SnoopyStyle,maddening surreal tale,6,19 July 2016,"Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) is a naive Canadian aspiring actress who arrives in L.A. to stay at her aunt Ruth's Hollywood home while she's away filming in Vancouver. She finds a dark-haired beauty in the shower. She (Laura Elena Harring) has amnesia after a car crash on Mulholland Drive and takes on the name Rita. There's a diner called Winkies. There's director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux). There's a hit man (Mark Pellegrino) who has a hit that keeps going wrong. Rita remembers the name Diane Selwyn and Betty joins her to find the dead woman.This film is maddening. David Lynch has created a confusing surreal tale. I'm sure someone has dissected this to make sense of everything. I can't tie the whole movie down. The pairing of Watts and Harring is great. Watts is especially terrific. If this comes with explanations, I may just like this more.",Mulholland Drive
3,Hitchcoc,Another Bad Dream from David Lynch (In a Good Way),9,30 November 2010,"What can I say. Each time I see a David Lynch film, I see my own disturbing dreams in them. The fundamental story has to do with two people whose paths cross; a woman who survives a murder attempt because a group of teenagers are joyriding and crash the car she is riding in. She finds herself at a home in a bedroom which is the temporary quarters of a young actress. That would be enough for an interesting film, but Lynch would never do that. He brings in other sets of characters in counterpoint to the main ones and after a while we don't know who's who anymore. We also have some of that crazy cinematography and visuals that are left to our imaginations. All the participants show up together, yet they shouldn't have that relationship; or should they. I did enjoy seeing Billy Ray Cyrus get his clock cleaned. I was content to let the whole thing wash over me. I wondered what happened and then I didn't care.",Mulholland Drive
4,classicsoncall,"""...and now, I'm in this dream place.""",10,24 February 2018,"As is often the case with a movie I don't understand upon an initial viewing, I head on over to the FAQ page for the film here on IMDb and read what's available to see if there's any kind of analysis or explanation of what happened. That would be an excellent start for anyone curious about this movie. But then, upon a second viewing of this picture the very next day, events in the film, both the dream sequences and reality became much clearer. Not only that, but the way the story was plotted and presented was proven to be downright exceptional. I think ""Mullholland Drive"" is a mind bending spellbinder that you won't forget long after you've seen it, no matter whether you loved it or hated it.We get any number of hints in the story that things are not quite what they seem through various scenes and lines of dialog that in retrospect are cleverly placed. I'm going to call Betty/Diane (Naomi Watts) and Rita/Camilla (Laura Harring) by their names implied in the various situations I mention in order to keep things sensible. Recall when Betty asks the stranger taking a shower in her aunt's apartment what her name is. She can't remember, and then gazes thoughtfully at a screen poster of the movie ""Gilda"". The woman takes the name of it's star, Rita Hayworth, but more significantly, the poster's tag line states ""There NEVER WAS a woman like Gilda"". Just like there never was a woman called 'Rita'. Immediately following, Betty relates to Rita how happy she is to be in Hollywood and in her aunt's expensive apartment, and says ""...and now I'm in this dream place"". When Betty tries to convince Rita that they should follow up on Rita's thought that her real name might be Diane, Betty suggests that they investigate in an undercover fashion - ""We'll pretend to be someone else"".Though it may require a complete leap of faith, one needs to consider that the movie's story actually begins when Diane, now on the movie set of the 'Sylvia North Story' as a spectator, sees Camilla kissing director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux), who's showing her and her co-star how to do the scene. It's at this point when Diane begins to understand that her real life relationship with Camilla is coming to an end and she doesn't like it. Though it seems drastic, Diane hires a hit-man to kill her former lover with the words ""This is the girl"", which ironically were the same words used by Adam to hire Camilla in the first place while under duress from the Castigliane Brothers and more directly, from the weirdly threatening 'Cowboy' (Monty Montgomery).Then there are the entire scenarios involving the blue box and it's key, and the interlude at the Silencio. The narrator at the Silencio repeatedly assures his audience that what they see and hear are illusions. With the Betty/Rita, or Diane/Camilla relationship about to hit the rocks, I thought it quite fitting that the Spanish singer offered a rendition of Roy Orbison's 'Crying' (Over You). That was a very nice touch.There's actually a whole lot more I could probably comment on, but then it would get tedious for the reader, so I'll finish things up by saying that you ought to give this film a try with an open mind, and even be prepared to get confused because the non-linear exposition of events can be troublesome. And on top of that, things are made even more complicated by the random dream events. But for the patient, I think this is a masterful film that deserves one's attentive consideration.",Mulholland Drive
5,gavin6942,Twin Peaks Continued... Sort Of,8,30 January 2015,"After a car wreck on the winding Mulholland Drive renders a woman (Laura Harring) amnesiac, she and a perky Hollywood-hopeful (Naomi Watts) search for clues and answers across Los Angeles in a twisting venture beyond dreams and reality.So this is what would have happened to Audrey if ""Twin Peaks"" was allowed to continue? Odd. And how will that play into the return of ""Twin Peaks"" in 2016? It probably will not, but who knows? These worlds are clearly not far apart. Even Angelo Badalamenti's score is reminiscent of his ""Peaks"" work.But then, Club Silencio is a return to ""Blue Velvet"" in a sense. Or even all the way back to the woman in the radiator in ""Eraserhead"". David Lynch may be odd, but he is consistent.",Mulholland Drive
6,lee_eisenberg,What was it about? You're not supposed to ask.,10,19 October 2005,"The fact that you most likely won't be able to figure ""Mulholland Dr."" out during the first viewing is what makes it so great. David Lynch throws in so many twists and turns that it'll make your head spin...if you're not too transfixed already. The plot has Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) arriving in LA hoping to become a star, when she becomes in the most bizarre series of events that you could ever imagine...or does she? The answer doesn't just lie with Betty's new roommate Rita (Laura Harring), but rather in that which isn't too obvious...or does it? I can't even try to describe the movie further; you have see this movie to understand it. In fact, you might want to watch it twice; there's a lot that you probably won't pick up during the first viewing.Anyway, David Lynch has created here what may be his most interesting movie ever. Granted, his movies are usually bizarre, but ""Mulholland Dr."" is in a class all on its own. So all that I can tell you, be prepared to be shocked.",Mulholland Drive
7,jboothmillard,Mullholland Drive,8,15 August 2006,"I first heard of this film at number 44 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments because of the lesbian scene (and Jeff Goldblum gave his opinion on it), and then I heard it was a film from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director David, and it is a very good one. It is after a concert that the two main characters go to where I can't understand what is going on. The story before that is that Rita (Laura Elena Harring) having a car crash in Mullholland Drive (Hollywood), and for some reason before she was pointed at with a gun. She has quite serious amnesia, and she spends the night in a house that Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) was borrowing from her aunt. It is pretty gripping as they try and discover who she used to be, and they form a close bond, that soon turns to a true love lesbian relationship. The other story going on, although not that interesting, is film director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) having problems with a film. After that concert I mentioned they change their names for some reason, Watts is Diane Selwyn and Harring I can't remember, but this part aside, the rest is a must see. Also starring Ann Miller as Catherine 'Coco' Lenoix and Jackie Brown's Robert Forster as Detective Harry McKnight. It won the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Angelo Badalamenti, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. It was number 38 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!",Mulholland Drive
8,ccthemovieman-1,Another Strange-But-Fascinating Film From That Strange Director,8,27 October 2006,"Wow, what a strange film. It's a David Lynch movie so it's no surprise that it is weird. I defy anyone to totally explain everything in this film. I can't be done. After some research following my second viewing of this film, I pretty much know most of the story but on a first look, and with no aid from other reviewers or outside help, it is hard to figure things out. So, if you're in that boat and was confused, don't feel bad; that's normal. Let me just say the key to the film is Naomi Watts' character.At any rate, I find the film fascinating. I love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch. The camera-work is excellent and the music is creepy, a la Lynch's ""Blue Velvet."" There also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes. In all, it's very well scored.Like Lynch's ""Twin Peaks"" television series, this was a film in which the end was pieced together afterward since Lynch thought this film was going to be a long, drawn-out TV series. When that didn't happen, he pieced at the last minute this ending. That may account for some of the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations concerning characters we see earlier in the film but who mysteriously disappear.The theme of the story, supposedly, is a negative comment about Hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushed.Both Watts and the other leading lady, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in their celebrated lesbian sex scene. Looks- wise, both women were chameleons, looking average at times, stunning at other times.I enjoyed this movie more on the second viewing than the first. It's not just a curiosity piece; it's a very intriguing movie.....just don't feel stupid if you can't make sense of a few things.",Mulholland Drive
9,rmax304823,Betty and Veronica Go To the Dark Side.,9,10 April 2006,"So many people seem puzzled by this film but I don't know why. The interpretation is clear enough.You see, the thing is, the apartment manager Coco (Miller) is simply dreaming that she is Betty (Watts) who is in turn dreaming that she is Rita (Harring). Near the beginning of the film, when the amnesic Rita lies down in the dark and goes to sleep, she dreams that she is the director's mother (Miller) and -- AT THE SAME TIME -- out of penis envy she also takes the role of the director (Theroux) so that she can have sex with the person she loves most in the world -- herself. (You don't really think that masturbation scene is in there just for the fun of it, do you?) The heuristic skeleton key rests on one simple and indisputable fact. The two dreams -- Miller's and Rita's -- interact with one another. For the simple minded this might prove a problem, but I'm sure Jung would have had no problem with it. Of course Jung was a madman, but still -- Well, I won't go on with this because I don't want to spoil anyone's pleasure by spelling everything out. Let me just say that the topper is this: I MYSELF dreamed this entire movie last night after a dish of chili to which, I admit, a few too many habanero peppers might have been added. Does that explain it for you? Or do I need to draw you a picture.Actually, all seriousness aside, we can at least guess at the meaning. My guess would be that Betty (or Diane) came to LA, fell for a leading actress who managed to get her small parts, and got jealous when the actress fell for the director. So she hired someone to knock off the actress but somehow the deal was made public and when the cops came for her she shot herself. That's my guess. Honest.Whatever else one can say about the movie, this is a true original. Nobody but David Lynch would have dared to make it. It is two and a half hours of absolutely gripping and unfathomable meandering. An exercise in style that probably won't appeal to everyone, but a work of committed art nonetheless. (Who understands Finnegans Wake, another dream?) What Quentin Tarrantino did to chronology in ""Pulp Fiction,"" Lynch does here, only some of the out-of-synch sequences are fantasies. Each of the dozen or so semi-episodes is related to the others in some way and each scene is intact and comprehensible unto itself but, related or not, the scenes don't quite match one another logically. (Eg., before the credits we see a frenetic bunch of jitterbuggers which has nothing to do with the story until the end, when we learn that Watts got into performing after winning a jitterbug contest in Ontario.) Like a poem in sprung rhythm each line fits perfectly but is discordant. Naomi Watts. How come Australia has been fielding all these succulent blonds? Where do they get them from? She is perfect for the part. When she arrives in L.A. she is breathless with excitement. She has this gracile frame and wide gray eyes and two big childlike incisors and is given to phrases like, ""I couldn't afford this place in a million years."" And, ""Everything is A-Okay."" And ""Wow!"" She seems so pale and vulnerable and naive that one senses she could be easily squished. She's perfectly believable as Nancy Drew and later, when she is the bitter, discarded lover, she's STILL believable in a darker, spiteful way.I just saw it for the second time, expecting to be bored, but couldn't get away from the screen. Every scene had something new and ominous in it. A singer in the club Silencio, belting out a song in Spanish and a cappella that I didn't recognize as ""Cryin'"" until it was almost over. I wondered if Ray Orbison in plus time and minus space could recognize it. The trumpeter was Conti Condoli, a fantastic jazz musician (for a white guy) who has played with Stan Kenton and Doc Severison and has his own recognizable style. No hay mejor! His brother Pete's pretty good too. The sound department also deserves plaudits for meeting the considerable demands placed on it by the film. The score will make your woofer tremble.There's a little humor in it, not much. Dog doody on the tiles. Two scenes involving Theroux's wife.Okay, I think there is at least one thing we can all agree on. This is CHAD EVERETT's best performance in years.Why do we give awards to semi-moronic blockbusters like ""Titanic"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" and ignore the recklessly innovative work of directors like the Coens and Lynch? If you miss this, you will be missing a lot.",Mulholland Drive
10,Tweekums,The sort of surreal weirdness that one expects from David Lynch,9,13 May 2017,"As this film opens a car is driving along Mulholland Drive in the Hollywood Hills. It comes to a stop surprising the woman in the back. The men in the front point a gun at her and order her out of the car. It looks as if she is about to be murdered but then a pair of street racers come round the corner and one smashes into the car before the woman gets out. She staggers away and turns up at a house in Hollywood. Meanwhile Betty, an aspiring actress, arrives in Los Angeles and moves into her aunt's apparently empty house and is surprised to find a woman in the shower. It turns out this is the woman who was involved in the incident on Mulholland Drive; she says that she has no recollection of who she is or what exactly happened; she calls herself 'Rita' but only because there is a Rita Hayworth poster in the room. Betty agrees to help her find out who she is and what happened. Meanwhile a film director is being told who he must select as the lead actress in his film; he refuses and it soon becomes apparent that those who want her aren't the sort to take no for an answer.This is very much a David Lynch film; the story starts relatively normally but there is always a sense that something is just slightly off; nothing you can readily identify just that gnawing feeling that things might not be what they seem. As things progress the strangeness increases to a point that I wasn't at all sure what was going on this could easily have made the film a confused mess but instead it had be gripped trying to figure out what happened I suspect if you asked a number of people what the film was really about you'd get a similar number of different theories. The cast does a great job; most notably Naomi Watts who is on great form as Betty and Laura Elena Harring who is also great as 'Rita'; they have an impressive chemistry that makes a romantic scene between then erotic and believable rather than sleazy and forced. The rest of the cast impress to, especially those playing some of the stranger, more Lynchian characters. As well as the disturbing weird stuff there are also some funny moments. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the strange; it won't be for everybody though; I suspect it will divide audiences; some will love it, some will hate it but I doubt many will be indifferent to it.",Mulholland Drive
11,BA_Harrison,Mulholland Drivel.,1,18 February 2016,"I would love to write an intelligent, detailed analysis of Mulholland Drive, I really would, but since I haven't got the slightest idea of director David Lynch's intent (other than to completely confound the viewer), I'm going to have to pass. Instead, let me tell you how my week has been so farMonday: Work as usual. Was involved in an RTA on the way home (not my fault—an old lady drove into the side of my car). Rang insurance company. Started to watch Mulholland Drive—fell asleep not long after.Tuesday: Dog ate a packet of ibuprofen and had to be rushed to the vets (no idea how he got them—suspect the cats were involved). Went to work. Came home. Visited the in-laws. Resumed watching Mulholland Drive—fell asleep not long after.Wednesday: After the two previous days, this one was fairly uneventful. Dog came home, hopefully without any lasting problems. Ended the day by watching a bit more of Mulholland Drive. Perked up for the lesbian sex scene between Naomi Watts and Laura Harring, but fell asleep soon after.Thursday: Car collected by body shop. Went to work in wife's car (being extra careful to avoid elderly drivers). Watched the rest of Mulholland Drive (managed to stay awake, largely in hope that Watts might indulge in some more sapphic shenanigans, but she doesn't).4/10 for the sexy scene, reduced to 1/10 for the self-indulgent, pretentious, and utterly pointless surreality of the whole thing, especially the opening dance number, the incomprehensible club scene in which a woman mimes a Spanish version of Roy Orbison's classic 'Crying' before fainting (???), the weird hobo with the strange box, and the bit where two miniature people crawl out of a handbag and sneak under a door.",Mulholland Drive
12,moonspinner55,"Eerie, provocative take on Bergman's ""Persona""...",8,4 September 2005,"Byzantine, brilliantly-acted drama parallels Hollywood glamor girl on the wrong path with freshly-scrubbed young actress who has just arrived in Los Angeles for a movie audition. Writer-director David Lynch shrewdly guides this jitterbug dance into a dreamy-nightmare world where fantasies and rude awakenings crisscross in coldly masterful style. It's a complex jigsaw of a movie--something along the lines of Bergman's ""Persona"" yet even more treacherous. You may not know where you're heading (or, indeed, where you've been) but you trust that Lynch does. Do concrete conclusions ever materialize? Some say yes, some say no, and some are still scratching their heads. There is no final summation, though that doesn't mean the picture is incomplete. It's a delicious film experience. David Lynch's world is a wicked one, and he's happy to invite us in. ***1/2 from ****",Mulholland Drive
13,blanche-2,A bizarre journey through the subconscious,8,13 August 2010,"It's not often that a film that leaves one confused and frustrated can be described as great, but I have to hand it to David Lynch. ""Mulholland Drive"" is a great film and requires several viewings to mine all that is there. And there is plenty there. This isn't a pretentious director throwing something completely nonsensical on a screen that high-brow critics scream is great art when it is, in fact, junk.Supposedly, ""Mulholland Dr."" was intended as a series, but it didn't work out. That's a shame, because it could have been pretty amazing. It was perhaps ahead of its time. Today, with cable networks doing so much original programming, it would have found a place.I can't say too much about it, because everyone will have their own ideas and theories of the film. In the beginning, it concerns a botched hit due to a freak accident on Mulholland Drive. The victim escapes and hides out in an apartment, but she has amnesia. The woman staying in the apartment, Betty, becomes interested in her problem.Except it's not about that at all. It's a dark, intriguing trip into the world of the subconscious, filled with crazy images, bizarre characters, and some strange dialogue.Not an easy film to dissect, so watch it for yourself, and then go back and watch it again. Take note of the sign ""Sunset Boulevard"" - and prepare to be mesmerized.",Mulholland Drive
14,Quinoa1984,Life is But A Dream (after a reviewing),10,12 October 2001,"David Lynch's Mulholland Drive brings him in the territory of Twin Peaks, Eraserhead, but more-so a highly-charged form of surrealist thinking singular only to Lynch regarding Hollywood to make the best films of the year, and of his career. The film is a twisting, meticulously crafted and acted cinema piece about many a lot of things. At FIRST, the basic plot: a woman (Laura Elean Haring) survives a car crash and stumbles down the hill next to Mulholland drive and walks into a woman's house she has never met before. She also has amnesia, and when the woman (Naomi Watts), an actress, who is currently occupying the place lets her stay for a few days to get her memories together, the plot unfolds. Other side stories are interestingly blended into the rest of the movie involving a troubled director (Justin Theroux) who is forced into things he didn't intend on, the woman living in the house who tries and goes for auditions, etc.But the plot (even the part involving Haring) isn't even the big part of the movie. Lynch, like he did in Eraserhead, exposes the audience to logical and realistic (er, in Lynch's sense) scenes and then sidesteps into a surreal and dreamlike world...or what one might THINK is the dreamworld. Yet it's really about dreaming, one might think, as reality and fantasy become part of the pieces of Lynch's method. What is it to have a dream, anyway, Lynch may be essentially asking the audience? And what is it to have things both idealized and ugly in equal measure, reflected in the subconscious, and drifted back during sleep like some kind of wavelength that is personal but psychologically sound, more or less? And, most importantly, why do we need fantasy? Well, there needs to be a divide, Lynch may be supposing, between fantasy and reality, but at the same time, for the sake of art and cinema, the line needs to be blurred as well to reach underlying truths about what it is to create, what it is to act, what it is to be controlled in the measures of creation and reinterpretation.These might be pretentious points presented by another filmmaker, but Lynch, for all of his abandoning of conventions (albeit with a firm, knowing embracing of the intent in conventions, archetypes and clichés from Hollywood films), is nevertheless a superlatively entertaining writer/director/sound editor, who makes some of the most profound and everlasting statements ever about Hollywood and the illusions created from reality (whether manufactured ala 50s singers in a booth then put on film, or in some capacity regarding a dirty dude behind the Winkies) while never losing the power to make it one hell of a ride. And by 'ride' I mean the ride of a filmmaker overwhelmingly yet carefully confident in what he wants to convey: of the corny light and contorted ideals that comes out of the darkness of Diane's dreams (I'll relent and say that it makes the most sense, even though I'd love it just as much if it didn't go so easily for sense), and that, of course, it's all about emotional response.In short, it's one of the must-see films from the 2000s, not just for Lynch fans but for those who might never think of going near a Lynch film: it's funny, it's tragic, it's mysterious, and it's both dense and simple in equal measure. Like music, it'll either rock your boat or leave you dry and for me it still rocks my boat to this day.",Mulholland Drive
15,Coventry,Incomprehensible elegance,8,22 November 2004,"Mulholland Dr. must be located somewhere on the 'lost highway' in the wide area of 'Twin Peaks'in other words; it's a pure David Lynch product and a film that will unquestionably divide audiences. Every time this genius (to some, at least) delivers a film, it immediately grows out the biggest cinematic event of the year and a topic of endless discussions. Seeing the rating on this site, it looks like many people consider this Lynch's best achievement in the weirdness field (The Elephant Man and The Straight Story not included), yet I don't agree with that. No doubt it's a mesmerizing film that haunts and moves you long after you finished watching it, though. On the surface, this is a tale handling about the stereotypical life in Hollywood. You've got the young and easily impressed actress who's hoping to build up a career (Noami Watts) and there also is a second storyline handling about a director (Justin Theroux) influenced and threatened by the mob in his casting choices. So basically, this is film-noir type of story but it's crystal clear that Lynch doesn't care much for the typical genre intrigues and focuses more on what's lying underneathlike the whole spectrum of human emotions. Oh heck, I can't explain it and neither can anyone else. But it works! Throughout the whole film, you're hypnotized by the elegance and mystery Mulholland Dr. radiates. The bizarre and eccentric characters fascinate you and the slow-paced camera-work creates an unmatched tension that'll make you jump more than once. And yet, something is lacking here. Although Lynch can't be blamed for it, as he intended this a pilot film for a new TV-series in Twin Peaks style. *** HUGE SPOILER *** after an hour and a half of careful observing and hunting for clues, the story falls into identities switching. This sort of leaves you behind with the unsatisfied feeling of déjà-vu as you recognize it from Lynch previous classic 'Lost Highway'. *** END SPOILER***. After ABC declined turning this into a TV-series it feels like Lynch rushed with adding twists and turns with a disappointing climax as a result. Despite these flaws, Mulholland Dr. still ranks as one of the greatest films since the new millennium with its unique eeriness and excellent cast. Naomi Watts is terrific as the tender and fragile young actress and Laura Harring is downright breathtaking. There's a near-perfect chemistry between the two leading ladies resulting in the most sensual erotic sequences of the last few decades. There also are minuscule supportive roles for class actors like Dan Hedaya and Robert Forster.",Mulholland Drive
16,sunwarrior13,Great surrealistic film,10,5 January 2006,"Mulholland Drive is one film that a viewer will have to see more than once.This is a surrealistic film that interconnects dream and reality.It is a film to be analyzed closely to interpret Diane Selwyn's subconscious.The main character,played by Naomi Watts, is a failed Hollywood actress who is a lesbian lover of a famour star Camilla Rhodes,played by former Miss USA Laura Elena Harring.It tells us a story of her dreams,fears,her actions such as ordering a hit on her lover,the consequences of her actions,her regrets,her fantansies,her frustrations and her illusions that is represented by her alter-ego in the film Betty.I liked the film so much and I had to watch it at least three times to make an interpretation of the make-up of the main character's mind.Direction of the movie was great.And definitely Naomi Watts was brilliant!!!",Mulholland Drive
17,jotix100,Nightmare in la-la land,10,23 January 2002,"David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. is a rare film that combines the best elements of previous works and gives us a spellbinding picture that keep us riveted to our seats even when there is no action.The combination of the two actresses, Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harding, produces unexpected results. Nothing is so on the surface, or better yet, appearances are deceiving, to put it mildly. There is a very strange chemistry in the interplay between these two great actresses than in many recent films. It was great fun to see the great Ann Miller in the role of the landlady, Coco. She's a welcome sight in the middle of the mystery that we're trying to decipher with all the clues that Mr. Lynch throws us. It's a shame that the rest of the old familiar faces, like Lee Grant, Robert Forster, Chad Everett, don't get enough time on camera.
This strange film was very different from the childish Hollywood fare of late. It's a shame Mr. Lynch doesn't get the chance to give us his vision of his world, which is always welcome by his appreciating fans.A job well done.",Mulholland Drive

There's a lot more than that to the plot, but you should see the film yourself to find out.  Almost as good as ""Blue Velvet"", this is David Lynch's newest mind trip.  It makes sense for an hour and 45 minutes (it was originally a pilot for a TV series that was rejected by ABC) but then things change drastically and images (and characters) go barelling out of control...but that's expected from Lynch. Characters and things change in very unexpected ways...alternate realities seem to step in.  Or do they?  This last section is wide open to interpretation--like the best Lynch films this demands multiple viewings. If you're a Lynch fan (like me) or if you like films that are adult and challenge you, go see it.  If not, stay away.  Also, there's a not so explicit lesbian love scene.",Mulholland Drive
19,LeonLouisRicci,A Fractured Female,8,9 August 2012,"This is one strange film. It is a surreal, audacious adventure and an abnormal psychological presentation of a fractured female libido. It is full of disturbing and beautiful images that combine for a conglomerate visual vestige of nightmares and wish fulfillment. There are red herrings and blue haired women. If you can make it to the end, all the disjointed pieces come together and most make perfect sense, some make some sense, and others make no sense at all. That is the beauty of this bold art film that is not for the casual consumer. It is a challenging exercise in explicit sex, implicit intent, and non sequiturs that are as demanding as anything in modern cinema.Do not expect the usual multi-plex movie or the family night in front of the big-screen TV and you might be ""pleasantly"" surprised. If your taste tends towards the more mundane easily digested Hollywood popcorn picture, the suggestion here is take a detour off of Mulholland Dr.",Mulholland Drive

I'd ask what is it really about, but I am not sure I'd believe anyone who actually claimed to know.

21,Boba_Fett1138,Warning: watching this movie could activate confusion.,8,19 October 2011,"David Lynch movies can confuse people, to say the very least. It's all because he picks an unique approach, with both his writing and directing, that isn't focused on explaining everything that is happening on screen.It's why basically everybody has their own little theories on what ""Mulholland Dr."" is all about. It's funny how incredibly diverse most of them are and this is also the greatest power of this David Lynch movie. Everybody can look at it- and experience it differently and form their own opinions about it. So it's basically pointless to read or hear other people speaking about ""Mulholland Dr."", since chances are you'll get something totally different out of the movie. So yes, also my opinion about it is also of course completely irrelevant.To be fair, it isn't unique for a director to tell his story in such a way that it leaves almost everything completely up to the viewer's own imagination and interpretation. But David Lynch is the only 'mainstream' director at the moment that still makes movies this way. It's the reason why he has such an huge following and every time a new Lynch movie gets released people go nuts over it, even when they have no idea what they have just seen.And no, I also really have no idea yet what I have just witnessed. Who knows, maybe I'll understand it better on repeated viewings but understanding it is not the key to liking or appreciate this movie, fore I regardlessly really liked and appreciated the experience that this movie offered me.Great thing is that the movie always keeps on fascinating you and is forcing to keep paying attention and search for clues that are hidden in it. The movie is basically a mystery, in which different story lines and different characters get followed, that seemingly have very little to do with each other but at one point do come together or are relevant to each other. It keeps you glued to your seat, even though you might have no idea what is exactly going on. The movie forces you to put things together for yourself, since the actual movie itself offers very little explanation to anything. As a matter of fact, the last few minutes even make the movie all the more confusing, instead of wrapping things up and explaining to you what the story was truly about and what exactly was real in the movie and what wasn't.Personally my theory about the movie is that it's all about alternate realities, coexisting with each other, that at one point got somehow mixed up (due to the accident?). Every time the blue box gets used, a new alternate reality get opened, which explains why some of the characters in the movie switch identities and certain events seem to have changed or never even happened. But who am I to explain a David Lynch movie to you, while David Lynch himself is probably the only one walking this Earth that truly knows what the movie is all about or perhaps he himself also doesn't. He just loves to mess with people's minds, so it isn't even completely unthinkable that some elements of the movie were never supposed to make any sense at all and he's laughing at all of us for trying to explain his movies.But really, this is a movie you could talk about for all day long but in the end it really is something you have to experience for yourself and form your own judgment and interpretation on it. But let me just tell you that no matter how confusing this movie, you still get intrigued and sucked in by it, due to the way it all got shot and told by David Lynch. 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Mulholland Drive
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Excellent, but not for everyone",10,12 June 2005,"This is the second movie by David Lynch I've seen(not counting The Elephant Man, his only non-surreal movie). The other one is Lost Highway. Because of this, but not only because of this, the following review will contain a lot of comparing between the two. As someone brought up(on the message boards or in a review... I can't remember exactly), this seems like Lynch wasn't satisfied with Lost Highway, so he made this to improve on it. Of course, it could that all his films are like this... I don't know. This seemed to have a more cohesive plot and it made more sense than the aforementioned film. In spite of this, I still didn't fully understand until I read a very good interpretation on the message boards. The idea of this seemed more vague and harder to figure out than Lost Highway. It seemed easier to follow, though... but maybe this is because this was the second time I saw a typical Lynch film(not to mention how similar in basic idea this was to Lost Highway). I found myself sympathizing more with the characters in this film, as well as finding their actions plausible and credible. The movie made much more sense to me right after watching than Lost Highway. In conclusion, this very well may be a revisit/remake of Lost Highway. The plot is very interesting, and vague as it may be, it can be pieced together if you pay close attention and watch it more than once. The pacing is very good, you're rarely bored. The acting is perfect. I didn't find any performance to be anything but stellar. I didn't see Lynch playing around with lighting in this film as much as he did in Lost Highway, but maybe it was just more subtle this time around. I recommend this to fans of Lynch, surreal films and film as an art form. Excellent film, but won't be to everyone's liking. 10/10",Mulholland Drive

The music, the pacing, the facial expressions--it did nothing but cause awkwardness because I was thinking, ""What's so suspenseful about this?"" This movie was a spasmodic wannabe ""Pulp Fiction"" string of scenes that I failed to connect with. I was waiting for that connection moment, that ""Aaah it's all making sense now"" moment. It never came. Instead I thought I was watching one of The Twilight Zone's rejects.

I remember going out to the alley to throw away some trash after watching this movie and looking over my shoulder the whole time.""Mulholland Drive,"" while enigmatic, is one of the more accessible of David Lynch's puzzle pictures. Naomi Watts blows the lid off the joint in a tour de force performance as a young woman who goes to Hollywood to become an actress and is swallowed by the rotten jungle that is the city of dreams as it exists in Lynch's brilliant head.I used to dismiss Lynch as too clinical and cerebral a director. His movies always made me feel bad without understanding why. But after seeing more of his work, I'm struck by the strong, almost aching, emotional quality that pulses through much of it, underneath the visual and narrative sleight-of-hand. ""Mulholland Drive"" is scary as hell, but it's also deeply sad and moving.This was the best film of 2001.Grade: A+",Mulholland Drive

She stumbles into an apartment for shelter and is met with a young actress who arrived in town for an audition. Together they try to unravel a haunting case of mistaken identity, murder and madness. Complicated yet extremely clever plot full of originality and exquisite imagery. Directed by David Lynch with the same eerie affect he employed in Blue Velvet. Knockout performances by Naomi Watts who dreams of adventure and life in the Hollywood spotlight, but cannot comprehend the consequences and the reality of her fate. Laura Elena Harring plays the confused actress who possesses a mysterious box with a key. Justin Theroux plays a struggling film director given special instructions by ""the Cowboy.""

29,namashi_1,A Masterpiece by Lynch!,10,8 April 2014,"David Lynch, a filmmaker who has gained a cult following over the years, has delivered many stories on celluloid with command. But his work in 'Mulholland Dr.', took my breath away. A dark neo-noir film, that is shocking, repulsive & tragic -- all at the same. 'Mulholland Dr.' Synopsis: After a car wreck on the winding Mulholland Drive renders a woman amnesiac, she & a perky Hollywood-hopeful search for clues & answers across Los Angeles in a twisting venture beyond dreams & reality.'Mulholland Dr.' is an unforgettable film, thanks to Lynch's masterful writing & eerie direction. His Screenplay examines dreams & reality, in a scary, frightening way, which in every aspect, arrests & engrosses you. Its also shocking, repulsive & tragic. Its poisonous, yet riveting. The twist in the tale, too, is spell-binding. Lynch's Direction is eerie. He creates an atmosphere of absolute bleakness & ambiguity. He tops himself in here, as both, Writer & Director! A Special Mention for the amazing Cinematography by Peter Deming. Performance-Wise: Naomi Watts is astounding as the puzzled protagonist. She delivers a performance that defines fear, paranoia & ambition. Laura Elena Herring, also, is brilliant. She's at par with Watts from start to end. Justin Theroux is first-rate. Mark Pellegrino leave a strong impact.On the whole, 'Mulholland Dr.' is one of the greatest neo-noir films ever made. Lynch At His BEST!",Mulholland Drive
30,=G=,I only have one good thing to say about this flick...,6,10 April 2002,"...and that's ""Naomi Watts"". Lynch, in an apparent effort to stretch, appears to becomes obsessive about this noir nonsense which by all accounts is a huge movie but which exit polls at theaters would probably reveal to be a loser. Bottom line, I about fell asleep from boredom as Lynch took his own sweet time pulling together the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle which develops into just so much excessive silliness. On the up side Watts turns in a stellar performance and Lynch limps along with no big names. On the down side is everything else: No characters we can identify or empathize with; no hero or anyone we can care about; a shoddy convoluted plot which just gets more ridiculous as time wears on; etc..yadayadayada. Bottom line, this movie sucked except for the titillating nude chicks making out part which only engages the limbic system. Hype = boxoffice and, as with ""Memento"", most moviegoers will have trouble understanding what this flick was about and why they should care. Recommended only for film fanatics, critics, dilettantes, and the like.",Mulholland Drive
31,DKosty123,Over Analyze This,7,24 April 2016,"Without Alfred Hitchcock around, thrillers like this one are few and far between. This movie will not age well, because since 2001 rotary telephones and regular phones are gone, replaced by cell phones. This move predates home computers it seems. Therefore, even though the film is past 2000, it must be set in a time prior to 2000.To me, the entire film is a dream. There are way too many things which can not be reality. We have Betty (Naomi Watts) moving into her Aunts apartment and finding Rita/Camilla (Laura Harring) naked in her shower without the water running. Betty then gets word that Rita (name based on a Gilda poster (film starring Rita Hayworth) does not belong there. This is the biggest hole in this plot, as any normal person would call the police at this point. Instead, Betty decides to tell her this but decides she wants to learn more about Rita who is nearly naked and hurting. Things that get lost in the shuffle include the car accident that Rita got hurt in and her serious wounds which mysteriously vanish without any real medical care. From here the suspense builds as scene after scene are not predictable and sometimes do not make any sense. In the last half of the film, Betty starts reliving the same scenes she lived in the first half but with slight changes.The mystery theater which appears in the second half of the film and the casting call by the cowboy create a strange sort of suspense. As the rotations happened during the last half of the film, you have to be able to remember the first half sequences and note the subtle changes in the latter sequences. That is the only way this movie makes any sense.This is the kind of movie that makes you think, but is it the perfect film? Hardly, though it does make you think how dreams can alter reality which is the purpose of all the twists and turns. This is a film that you note things and then in the end note how things change as the dream changes. The cast carries this off well and in the case of David Lynch, this is by far his best film.",Mulholland Drive
32,Red-Barracuda,Lynch's masterpiece,10,23 August 2005,"Mulholland Drive is David Lynch's best film. This is high praise indeed, as Lynch has produced some of the most interesting films of the last 30 years. Mulholland Drive takes elements of his previous work and moulds them into a glorious whole - the amateur detectives of Blue Velvet, the interchanging characters of Lost Highway, the sense of dread of Twin Peaks, the host of crazy characters of Wild At Heart. The atmosphere created in Mulholland Drive is extraordinary. And the at first seemingly senseless structure reveals itself, on repeated viewings, to be in fact fairly straightforward. There are far too many classic Lynchian moment to mention and the acting is excellent, particularly Naomi Watts who gives a performance of incredible range. You have to see this film, it is one of the best I have ever seen.",Mulholland Drive
33,cherold,Fascinating puzzle box of a movie,8,10 September 2017,"I enter any David Lynch movie with a mix of anticipation and trepidation. Most of his movies challenge the viewer to make sense of them, but sometimes that challenge is much too steep (Lost Highway, Inland Empire) and sometimes Lynch just seems to be seeing what he can get away with.But when he gets the mix just right, he creates something that wonderfully balances storytelling and madness. And that's what happens in Mulholland Drive.The movie starts as a beautiful LA woman escapes from an attempted assassination. She soon finds assistance from a wholesome blonde newly arrived in hopes of becoming a Hollywood star. They start a Nancy Drew- style investigation and occasionally cross paths with a Hollywood director being forced to recast his movie.At first this seems, in spite of a few really odd moments, as a straightforward mystery, but it's Lynch, so of course, it keeps getting weirder, eventually becoming surreal and disorienting.The last third of the movie is extremely peculiar, but by the end it's clear that this is David Lynch's version of a Shyamalan film, with all the parts connecting at the end.Well, more or less. While Shyamalan likes to cross all his ""t""s and dot all his ""i""s, that is something Lynch hates. He doesn't spoon feed the audience with answers, and even once you figure out what has happened, there are all sorts of oddities and loose ends that can't be fit into the total narrative. In some cases I think it's simply because Lynch is using parts of the original failed TV pilot this is an extension of; how else to explain an early diner scene? Other directors would have pared most of this away, but Lynch *wants* the messiness and the hanging threads. And much of the fun of Lynch is that you can't make total sense of his stories and are forced to look beyond sense to understand his mysterious world.As puzzling as Mulholland Drive sometimes is, it ranks as one of the more accessible of his artier films. The movie expects the viewer to put a little work in, but that work will be rewarded.And if you're still puzzled, seek out the Salon article that attempts to explain it all. But first think about it for a while. Pondering Mulholland Drive is a fun thing to do.",Mulholland Drive
34,ElMaruecan82,"""Mulholland Dr."" at the crossroad between fantasy and reality, illusion and disillusion, conventional cinema... and David Lynch!",10,22 December 2017,"Last night I had the strangest dream no, I didn't sail away to China but let's just say that dream was far more exciting than the day that started when I woke up.Hitchcock said cinema was ""life without the dull bits"". In a way, dreams play like an ""internal cinema"", they're emotional, haunting, 'entertaining' to some degree and naturally, they're mysterious. And their mysteries are of the toughest sort because they can only provide clues, not explanations, hints, not signals, and sometimes we just wake up and we don't even have time to reassemble the pieces of the puzzle. If there ever is a puzzle, which is even more puzzling! If films played like dreams, movie theaters would serve aspirin tablets instead of popcorn, we live in a time where what most viewers seeks is an experience with a meaning, a point, a plot or enough visual hyperbolas to hook our eyes onto. Cinema has become so ambitious on a technical level yet so simple intellectually, only challenging you when it handles timely or socially relevant themes. It does immerse you into a new world, it does ask some suspension of disbelief but let's face it, a very few directors have ever touched the 'essence' of dreams. David Lynch did and he did it magnificently in ""Mulholland Dr."", certainly his masterpiece.The film isn't a mystery: it is, quoting Lisa Simpson, herself quoting Churchill: ""a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma"". There is a narrative in the sense that it's Lynch telling us a story but no matter how hard you try to focus on the 'plot', there comes a moment where you realize it isn't just about what you think you're seeing, but the unseen these things you're watching are hinting at, it's another level of comprehension. It's not even asking for comprehension but a genuine desire to embrace the film's mood and it's so lavishly done that any movie lover would enjoy this film. It starts by trying to separate between the real, the dream and the subconscious until you discover how symbiotically they all interact on a cinematic level.
In other words, this is surrealism at its finest.For the sake of the review, I'll mention that it's about two women, a voluptuous and enigmatic brunette (Laura Harring), and a young idealistic blonde starlet (Naomi Watts). Their identities vary less misleading you than warning you over taking the ""mystery"" too literally. For a mystery to be valid, it has to exist within a coherent and seemingly constant universe. If I had to compare the film with another classic, it would be ""The Wizard of Oz"". Lynch made many more explicit references in ""Wild at Heart"" but in ""Mulholland Dr."", it works even better on a subtler level, characters exist within two worlds, the reality and the dream, and like in ""Oz"", the way they act in reality affect their 'status' within the dream.Whose dream are we talking about? I don't feel like spoiling the experience at that point. But let's say Lynch has a unique aesthetic approach through his subtle hints, don't take their weirdness as artistic licenses, they all have a reason to exist even in a state of non-existence. And like a real guide into a dark corridor of strange visions, Lynch provides unforgettable transitions, so stylish anyone would take them as ""all flash and no substance"", stuff with lampshades, phones, voices, déjà-vu situations, characters who seem totally disconnected with the story, but once you reassemble the pieces, you realize that within that strangeness, something is making sense. There is a puzzle, after all. Lynch is the Wizard of Oz, but unlike the original, you should pay attention to the man behind the (red) curtain. And it goes even deeper than that.The duplicity of characters evokes a universal reality and ""Mulholland Dr"" deserves more credit for that: it shows that we don't exist on our own, on a sole layer, we are what we are, also what we wish we could be and sometimes, jealousy or envy can drive us into re-evaluating our past or reenacting it or visualizing again with a ""best case"" scenario. There are two worlds intertwining, one to see through rose-tainted glasses, illusion, and a darker one, disillusion. This 'explains' the genre-bending approach: it plays like a romantic thriller, soap-opera, slapstick or horror. But Lynch doesn't treat them like genres but steps in a mind's journey, from the heights of idealization to the abysses of deception. And in-between, you've got the subconscious, and I can't think of another director that gave that abstraction a visual reality. Maybe Buñuel.Lynch is more divisive, and I don't think I enjoyed his previous movies with the same passion but ""Mulholland Dr."" comforted me that it's not his weirdness or wildness that disturbed me but how the effects played in the whole picture. ""Mulholland Dr."" had such a hypnotic beauty that I didn't mind the 'obscure' moments, I was just drawn to it, and In watched it three times in a row... and I feel like I only got the tip of the iceberg, like for ""Blue Velvet"", you don't get ""Mulholland Dr."", you get it. Unfairly overlooked by the Oscars, Naomi Watts magnificently embodied two states of minds, one about the 'illusion' of Hollywood and one about the disillusion. Yes, the film has also a saying about Hollywood, the dream and what's behind.The film only received one Oscar nod, but so deserved, because this is one of the rare instances where the directing tells the story, and although the word has been hackneyed, one can see in Lynch, love him or hate him, a true auteur in the imagery, the text, the subtext and the spirit. And ""Mulholland Dr."" is a crossover between ""Memento"", ""An Andalu Dog"" and ""Sunset Blvd."", a surrealistic masterpiece, a Lynchian masterpiece.Now, I've said enough, from now on, it's...Silencio!",Mulholland Drive
35,paul2001sw-1,Davie goes to Hollywood,8,26 January 2003,"In Mullholland Drive, David Lynch has directed not only a highlight of his personal career, but also one of the first seminal films of the 21st century.  The strengths and interests of this film will be familiar to his admirers; but never has he carried them off with such aplomb.  So we have small-town cookie-ness, taboo sexuality, nods to the 50s, downright weirdness, and the semi-supernatural; and all filmed beautifully, paced without hurry, Lynch's L.A. is still not bustling, but rather still, a slow-moving hypnotic lure.  Add in some very funny movie-industry satire, and a deliciously complex plot, and one has the makings of a classic.  Yet in spite of this, the question remains: is it any good?This is a tale of two parallel and contradictory stories, each involving the same pair of women, one seeming to both pre- and post-date the other.  The tease is enchanting, but before the film ends, one realises there will be no resolution in the conventional sense.  The first time one sees this film, one is partly impressed, and partly dissatisfied, thinking perhaps, Mullholland Drivel?You may have heard various 'explanations' for this film, attempts to make it all make 'sense'.  But even these need caveats and riders, and the advice basically boils down to this: don't trust anything (which is hardly 'sensible' in any meaningful sense).  It may be interesting to understand what Lynch was trying to do, to understand why this film has this particular shape (and not any other); but that doesn't make the finished work coherent. But perhaps also, this is missing the point.  From Sunset Boulevard onwards, cinema keeps revisiting the lurid hills of Hollywood.  Mullholland Drive is simply the most beguiling journey yet.",Mulholland Drive

But from the moment Betty 'turns into' Diane everything that came before and which comes afterwards falls into place.  Of course, the less you know beforehand the better; that way, the more fun you will have putting the pieces of the jigsaw together.Performance of the year, too, from Naomi Watts in the pivotal role of Betty/Diane, robbed of an Oscar last year from a too timid Academy.  She gets under the skin of these characters in a way that is genuinely creepy. Funny, disturbing, gloriously on the mark this is really Twin Peaks in LaLa Land.",Mulholland Drive
37,bowmanblue,A mind-bending film which makes you work,10,4 August 2014,"'Mulholland Drive' is a classic, but that doesn't mean it'll be enjoyed by everyone. If you like your stories easy to follow and getting from point A to point B in a straight line, then you probably have never watched anything by David Lynch. He specialises in creating teasing, disconcerting vibes and films based on feeling and mood, rather than linier storytelling.Mulholland Drive is a dark mystery about a young girl who arrives in Hollywood to pursue her dream of being an actress, only to get caught up with another young woman who has lost her memory and has a murky past which slowly gets unravelled.If you're familiar with Lynch's work, you may have seen his previous film 'Lost Highway.' It wasn't as well received as this one. It was - although visually stunning and darkly odd - not easy to follow. David Lynch creates films that are, to a certain degree, about what you feel, rather than just telling a story. He freely admits that Lost Highway was about a 50/50 split of feelings and storytelling. This made it a lot harder to follow as a narrative. However, Mulholland Drive is a little easier - it's about 85% story and 15% feeling, making 1 hour and 52 minutes of it pretty easy to watch.Then you have 'the big change.' The last 20 minutes are the film's 'pay-off' and you will either love it for showing you what you've spent nearly two hours watching, or hate it for 'cheating' you.If you're thinking of watching some of David Lynch's work, Mulholland Drive is a reasonable place to start. It's a basic mystery story which is - relatively - easy to follow. If you like it, try Lost Highway, or even Inland Empire (which is the hardest of all his films to try and decode, based on it being about 80% feeling and only 20% story). Just be warned, all of Lynch's work is pretty dark, often violent and pretty sexually explicit.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Mulholland Drive
38,dromasca,"Confusing, but Beautiful Movie",9,29 March 2003,"Whoever looks for a good and simple story - this is not a movie for him/her. As many of David Lynch's films, 'Mulholland Dr.' is complex and mixes reality and dream in a sophisticated and beautiful web. I can provide an explanation for the story, with some time twisting, but it would be a useless spoiler. The beauty of the acting and filming, the mistery of the atmosphere, Lynch's themes of passion and horror played back from other movies, the way he plays with the popular culture in an LA we know and re-discover - all these are combined in a movie you need to dip in, and not look for the killing logic. It is the strangest movie I saw lately, and one of the best. 9/10 on my personal scale.",Mulholland Drive
39,ThomasDrufke,Silencio,9,28 March 2015,"Every film doesn't have to be Transformers 4, where there is absolutely no substance or meat to the product, sometimes we get films like Mulholland Drive, where I do more thinking before and after this movie than I have done for the last 15 movies I have seen combined. David Lynch has always been one for secrecy so I'm not sure we will ever get the true meaning of Mulholland Drive. But I think that's okay, I mean it's good to have multiple interpretations of a film in general. For me, I'm not entirely sure I know the truth, but I can try.It's basically a story of hopeful and broken dreams in Hollywood. Not only is it a commentary on how we think it all works but it's a maniacal thriller about not getting recognition for what you think you have accomplished in life. It plays with reality and the fictionalized versions of what we hope reality was or is. Naomi Watts plays the lead role, Diane Selwyn, a hopeful actress who is wishing for her break or chance to shine in Hollywood. The film also deals with the depths at which you would go to succeed and be noticed. Watts brings so much range to this character. Sure she technically plays both Betty and Diane so it calls for separate personalities. But it's not an obvious change. I think that's the most important part of her performance is that she exposes just the right amount of madness and sadness when needed. It's crazy to think about how the first half of the film is pretty much fake. It's all a reality or dream that Diane creates to see her life how she hopes it would have been and to see Camilla as Rita, a much better fit as a love interest.I basically see this film as the love child as 3 films. It has the story telling and narrative structure as Pulp Fiction, the hopeful then broken dreams of Sunset Blvd., and the descent into madness and suffering like Black Swan displays. Lynch creates a masterpiece of a film but also one that I don't know I will ever want to watch again. Whether it's the maliciously laughing old people or the monster like hobo, Mulholland Drive is one of the more disturbing films I have seen. Not that I read but it's like a book you don't want to put down but are terrified to find out what happens next. Knowing it's a David Lynch film means it's not going to have a happy ending or meaning. Instead it's a bit of a cynical view on Hollywood or what we thought Hollywood was. I love the way Lynch uses the camera as an extra character following around the story to create both more suspense and a certain amount of familiarity with this world. We are going to look back at this film decades from now and realize how incredible it was. The surrealism Lynch brings to the story creates both the promising reality we want for Diane and the tragedy we feared for Betty. It's a beautiful disaster film at it's core. I commend this film for daring to be so different than anything we have really seen before and shout out to Profiles (with Malone and Mantz) for pushing me to see this film. A true masterpiece.+Watts' range +Commentary on the industry +Impeccably written and directed +Surrealism Descent into madness 9.2/10",Mulholland Drive
40,gbill-74877,Mind-blowing,10,1 January 2020,"Marvelously clever and stylish. The first two hours require patience, as it's unclear what's going on and how all of the disparate threads tie together, but when they do in that last half hour, it's mind-blowing. I love how Lynch created a puzzle that's so sophisticated that even once you grasp the basic concept, your analysis with those around you will probably continue on for awhile, e.g. for what various things mean, and how all of the elements of reality are incorporated into the dream. The ambiguity is fantastic. It's an understatement to say that Lynch elevated a pretty simple story with the surreal, out of order way he told it, and the narrative device went very well with the dashed dream of stardom in tinseltown and the satirical elements of the industry he incorporates. Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring are amazing in it too.",Mulholland Drive

42,callanvass,A Thought Provoking Masterpiece!,10,20 March 2005,"This is a thought provoking masterpiece from David Lynch!. It's very confusing at times, and i didn't get all the answers i wanted, but still i enjoyed every minute of this movie, and Naomi Watts gives a fantastic performance in this!. You have to pay very good attention in this movie or you will miss some of the plot twists that happen, and a lot of them are surprises!. There's lots of bizarre fascinating imagery to go around,and all of the characters were great, however i had one problem, i found the ending kind of abrupt, other then that i adored this movie. The Direction is GREAT!. David Lynch does a fantastic job here, creating lots of bizarre imagery, a dark creepy atmosphere, and overall keeping the film fascinating throughout!. There is a tiny bit of blood, but that's not what this movie is about. We get, bloody cuts, gunshot wound to the head, and a bloody nose bleed. The Acting Is Oscary Worthy!. Naomi Watts, gives an OUTSTANDING Oscar Worthy performance here, she is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS!, and deserved her Oscar Nomination for her outstanding performance here, she also had great chemistry with laura Harring, she is also extremely likable, and that audition scene is a WOW!. Laura Harring is excellent here she is beautiful, very likable and had great chemistry with Watts. Justin Theroux, is very good as Adam the director , he is a bit of a dork at times,but overall i dug him. Dan Hedaya, is good in his scenes and added class. The rest do fine. Overall If you want an extremely smart thought provoking film see this immediately!, and i say It's a MUST SEE! ***** out of 5",Mulholland Drive
43,Bored_Dragon,Much better than I expected,7,5 June 2017,"Story is one of the most boring and pointless ones I have ever had misfortune to see in a movie. But it would be hypocritical to hold it against this movie and use it as excuse to rate it in lower half of the scale. It would be unfair for two reasons. First, because everyone who has even basic knowledge about Lynch work knows what kind of nonsense they should expect from his screenplays. Although I said I won't see another Lynch movie ever again, the moment I decided to see this, partially because of majority of critics being extremely positive, and even more because of Naomi in leading role, I was ready to endure whatever nonsense Lynch passed off as an art this time. Second, because movie is not just about the story it tells, and this one has a lot to offer beside the lousy story.Visually, this is work of art with very distinctive and striking atmosphere and, to me, very lovely details and cadres done as homage to cult TV show Twin Peaks. Even more than visual aesthetics, I was impressed by sound. And I do not speak only about soundtrack and legendary Badalamenti, who also did music for Twin Peaks, but also about sound effects throughout the movie. The strongest impression on me was left by Spanish version of Crying by Rebekah Del Rio and sound of frontal crash in the beginning of the movie. Excellent performance of Naomi Watts implies, cause she is the main reason I decided to see another Lynch. She is definitely worthy that sacrifice.But the very strongest impression of all was made by sweet Naomi and super-sexy Laura Harring in the hottest lesbian scene I have ever seen outside a porn. Although it is very short and not explicit at all, it is so deeply emotional and sexually charged that it left me completely breathless.All in all, I do not regret breaking my word and watching another Lynch. Overall impression:7/10YT link to song I mentioned above:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHQnb3HS4hcLesbian scene I mentioned is from 5:38 to 9:30https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANZsh2RQL1cExcellent audition scene:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl1T2DB0OxwAnd great analyses of the way Lynch manipulates expectations:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXZK0Binfk4",Mulholland Drive
44,paulclaassen,I had no fun whatsoever watching this!,1,22 April 2019,"What the heck did I just watch!!? Is this film slow for the sake of being slow with dreary characters for the sake of being dreary? An hour into the film I was annoyed with all the characters and bored as hell. At times I actually thought the film was playing in slow motion. And what weird dialogue!There were moments I thought the film was intended to be a comedy, although a very bad comedy at that. Not only was the film slow moving, but even the characters uttered their dialogue very, very slowly. Yawn... The film just didn't grab me at all. There were just so many moments that should have been on the editing floor instead. And then the film turned out to be nothing more than a lesbian affair gone wrong!!! What the hell!I couldn't wait for this utterly dreary film to end. Yup, there's a huge twist, but by that time I really couldn't care anymore. True, everything would make better sense with a second viewing, but there's no way I'm sitting through this again just for the twist ending...This is not what I expected and I had no joy watching this.",Mulholland Drive
45,sol-,My brief review of the film,8,9 January 2005,"In a time when many were unhappy with films being too straightforward, David Lynch created this film that is the exact opposite. The film never delivers a straight answer in the end, and although there is a lot to appreciate in the film, it left me too unsatisfied to fully like it. There have been many extensive reviews written about the clues that Lynch offers to the mystery, but those are such which would be better picked up on watching the film again. It is likely to satisfy more on a second time, however is that how a film is meant to be? An excellent film can become better on repeat viewings, but it should be satisfying the first time round too. However, as aforementioned, there is still a lot that can be appreciated in the film without a full understanding. It is a very intriguing film, generally technically well made, stylish and with a good score. But the lack of a linear plot made it rather grim for me. One can surely appreciate it even if one has to look up the answer to understand, but without reaching a happy medium between too straightforward and not straightforward enough, this is not an easy film to admire and like.",Mulholland Drive
46,zkonedog,A Puzzle-Box Film I Have Absolutely No Desire To Put Together,3,29 July 2021,"After seeing Mulholland Drive pop up on every ""Best-Of Thrillers"" list I came across, I finally decided to give it a watch. While the film certainly has a lot going on and requires effort from the viewer to even begin to put the puzzling pieces together, I found myself utterly unmotivated to partake in that process.For a very basic overview, Mulholland Drive sees perky Hollywood hopeful Betty (Naomi Watts) arriving in Tinsel Town, only to immediately be greeted by a mystery involving an amnesiac woman (Laura Harring) after a car accident. Concurrently, a seemingly unrelated (or is it?) plot involving embattled movie director Adam (Justin Theroux) plays out in a series of ridiculous/goofy encounters and shadowy/comic figures.One thing to know about Mulholland Drive right off the bat: it isn't to be taken literally. This is very much one of those films in which almost every scene can be contextualized differently based on the information provided towards the end of the movie. The crux of the viewing experience, however, will likely hinge on one's appreciation (or lack thereof) for director David Lynch (he of Twin Peaks fame). To call Mulholland Drive ""odd"" is almost an absurd understatement, as it contains some of the strangest vignettes ever put to the big screen.I realize that, in large part, the great appeal of a flick like this is the ability to interpret and re-interpret its scenes and characters. Since nothing is literal or concrete in terms of reality, all readings of the film are basically ""up for grabs"". The biggest problem I had with the overall experience, however, is that I found it both too odd and not compelling enough to dive into that sort of after-watching dissection. In short, I simply wasn't motivated enough to care either way.Perhaps the best reasoning I can give for my much-lower-than-the-consensus rating of Muholland Drive is that I've seen other films that do everything it does better. Want odd scenes and grand cinematography? Watch The Shining. Crave the ability to obsess over what is reality/metaphor? Pick up Enemy. Even a much newer film like 2020's Black Bear does a better job of setting up the ""what is a dream versus what is reality"" quandary.Overall, though, one's enjoyment of Mulholland Drive will almost certainly be decided based upon reactions to Lynch's writing and directorship style. For me, I found the whole thing just too odd to even think about picking apart truth from metaphor.",Mulholland Drive
47,poe426,David Lynch's Hollywoodland...,10,25 May 2002,"***SPOILERS*** It's all about mood- the creating and sustaining of it. From THE GRANDMOTHER on, ""mood"" has been Lynch's mantra, and MULHOLLAND DR. is an excellent example. Lynch manages to ""keep it up"" from frame first to last. Few filmmakers are as capable. (And there IS a coherent storyline, despite popular misconception.) I was thoroughly satisfied with what amounts to Lynch's version of CARNIVAL OF LOST SOULS. After the tender mercies of THE STRAIGHT STORY (whose final, breathless moments blew me away), I was concerned that Lynch had himself ""gone straight"" (as have filmmakers like David Cronenberg and John Woo, to name but a pair, who have eschewed that which made their work unique in favor of more ""legit""- i.e.; more ""commercial""- pursuits), but MULHOLLAND DR. takes a sharp left back into the landscape where the soul of David Lynch lives.

49,leplatypus,My 10 clues (dvd),7,4 September 2011,"1) Who sleeps tonight ? The first part of the movie is a dream: Betty/Diane is dreaming her perfect life by mixing in a positive way all her experiences even if her subconscious, her guiltiness can't make her forget her real life.2) Wake Up! The second part is the reality: Betty/Diane has a sad life: she is just an extra in Hollywood and her lover rejects her. For revenge, she hired a killer.3) The land of illusion! Lynch portrays a great vision of Hollywood, the two-sided city: a mythic place made up with dreams and artistic faith but where finally corporations and sex govern: in fact, it's a mirage! 4) City slickers: It's good to have Lynch visit a great urban town and leaves country and rural town for a while. I don't like very much LA but Lynch finds great spots (the hills, the palm trees, Dinkies) to glamor it.5) Even better than the real thing: What I like with Lynch is that the fantastic, dream world seems normal and warm whereas the everyday life seems surreal and painful.6) the eye of the tiger: as the best painter or photographer, he pays attention to the sets, props and cinematography and always delivers stunning framed visions: the phones, the ranch, ....7) Who's who: His cast is always excellent: the newcomers to me, Watts, Harring Theroux were refreshing.8) There's always music in the air: Badalamenti is a genius to always catch some heart-ripping melodies (and he's also a funny extra) albeit this isn't his best score for Lynch.9) Elementary my dear Watson: The clues Lynch gave were a good idea to make the film interactive and this way is far better than 3D.10) Sappho is crying: I am nevertheless disappointed with the love story because its lesbianism seems here a mere toy, a gadget to appeal to the audience.",Mulholland Drive
50,howard.schumann,A brilliant film but frustratingly elliptical,9,14 March 2005,"A woman's head slowly sinks into a pillow. The scene changes suddenly. A different woman (Laura Harring) is being driven in a limousine on Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles to an unspecified destination when she realizes that she is about to be murdered. Before she can be killed, however, two cars, drag racing on the drive, crash into the limousine. The woman staggers away and finds shelter in an apartment in Los Angeles where she meets Betty Elms (Naomi Watts), a vivacious blonde who has just come to town from Ontario looking for work as an actress. Betty learns that the dark-haired woman who calls herself Rita is suffering from amnesia and cannot remember how she got there.David Lynch's Mulholland Drive has a website www.mulhollanddrive.com. In this case, www could stand for weird, wacky, and wonderful. We know that one part is real and one part is a dream but the challenge is to figure out which is which. Or you can simply enjoy each twist of the plot, each steamy love scene, and each bizarre character as further evidence of the director's enormous talent. The film contains seemingly unrelated incidents but they all eventually come together -- well sort of. In a diner called Winkie's, a man tells another about a dream that a frightening figure is hiding outside the restaurant which is confirmed when both venture out there. Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux), a popular Hollywood film director is being intimidated by two mobster-like figures (Dan Hedaya, Angelo Badalamenti) who tells him that he must cast an actress named Camilla Rhodes in the lead. Kesher also discovers that his wife is cheating on him and gets beaten up when he discovers the two lovers in his bedroom.A mysterious stranger called The Cowboy (Lafayette Montgomery) appears to be keeping track of his life. In the third sequence, a hit man looking for a black book kills three people who just happen to be there. Meanwhile, Betty's relationship with Rita develops into a Lesbian love affair as she tries to help her regain her memory. Two thirds of the way through the film, however, the perspective suddenly shifts and the complex plot gets murkier as identities change and reality and dreams intersect. Mulholland Drive can best be viewed as a bitter satire on the corrupt relations in Hollywood and the exploitation of women. It is a brilliant film, frustratingly elliptical but beautifully performed and very entertaining. It is a film that will keep coming back to you in the wee hours of the morning.",Mulholland Drive
51,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Requires a flexible imagination and most likely a cheat sheet,7,2 December 2009,"David Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr."" is like one of those video games that the programmers make so amazing yet so impossibly difficult that in order to be fully satisfied you're forced to buy one of those walkthrough game guides. The film might be a masterpiece, but it's a Rubix cube of surrealism that prefers to leave you with more questions than answers.Psychological thriller barely begins describing ""Mulholland Dr."" Most notably, Lynch has no lack of ability to create suspense. Despite being a total mindfudge (implication of more explicit language necessary), the film is completely gripping and will not lose any viewer for a second. You could argue the beginning is not very deliberate, but to understand the film everything is essential.On Mulholland Dr. a woman (Laura Elena Harring) survives a fatal car accident but is left with amnesia, wandering her way to an apartment of a woman heading out of town who happens to be the aunt of Betty (Naomi Watts) a starry-eyed aspiring actress who has come to stay in LA while her aunt is gone. Together, the two try and find some answers as to the woman's identity. Meanwhile, a Hollywood director (Justin Theroux) is without his lead actress and being pressured by mobsters to select a particular one.But plot is a side dish in this movie. As hard as it is to do, the way it's best enjoyed (and I wish I'd known this pre-hindsight) is to take in the visuals and emotions and tame that instinctive plot detective inside all of us. The beauty of Lynch's work is best understood by what the events and images of the film suggest. Don't view them as tangible proof of factual happenings in the film, but as manifestations.Put on those lenses and Lynch's work is easier to appreciate. The slow movement through the sets, the symbolism, the bizarre but intriguing transitions and the way the film's score works flawlessly to direct your every thought and inclination -- it's all there if you can manage to let go of the plot when necessary.It's hard to analyze the film any deeper without exposing the cheat sheet -- even if you'll probably need to look at it anyway. Lynch has even listed a number of things to pay attention to to help understand his film -- you can look those up on IMDb or anywhere before watching and it could help.Does the fixation on surrealism hurt ""Mulholland Dr,"" not necessarily, but the best films don't require hints or cheat sheets to love and in order to love ""Mulholland Dr.,"" you have to know what's going on and that's a lot for the vast majority of movie watchers to handle.

This film is very funny, but I encountered an audience which seemed intent on taking it very ""seriously"".  It's a satire of Hollywood, and Lynch is a director who makes the creation of a film the motivation of the plot itself.  In order for a Lynch film to exist, there must be a ""replacement"" leading lady who must be killed (of course).  It is consciously referential to ""Gilda"", and seems to reference at least 3 other films:  ""Carnival of Souls"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", and ""Barton Fink.""  I love how Betty looks like Doris Day in Lynchland when she steps off the plane.

As the movie opens, Betty is in the back of a limo. Just when the limo's driver unexpectedly stops and pulls a gun on her, the limo is hit head-in by another speeding car. Betty survives the crash and leaves the scene, walking around on Mulholland Drive. When she see an elder lady clearly leaving her house on a long trip (lots of luggage), Betty sneaks inside. In a parallel story, Betty, a young woman from Canada, arrives at LAX, with starry eyes, hoping to launch her movie career. Betty's aunt has given her the use of her house as she is away on a long trio. Yup, when Betty arrives at the house, she finds Rita there. Turns out Rita has lost all memory as to who she is (she takes the Rita name from a RIta Hayworth poster). At this time we are 10-15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: written and directed by David Lynch, this came on the heels of Lynch's rather straightforward ""The Straight Story"", a marked departure in the Lynch catalog. Lynch came up with another twisted story and film instead: ""Mulholland Dr"", very much in line thematically with ""Lost Highway"" before and ""Inland Empire"" later. The last time I had seen ""Mulholland Dr."" was when it was released in 2001. Frankly I didn't even recall much of the story line or other details when I saw it again in the theater recently. While certainly a good movie, it doesn't feel to me like the masterpiece that many have called it. I'm not saying that it is or isn't a masterpiece, but I didn't experience it like one. This was of course Australian actress Naomi Watts' breakthrough role in the US. I had forgotten that there is a fair amount of nudity in the film. And then there is the surreal story itself where it's best not to try and take everything at face value or to try and explain everything logically.. The movie's score is of course done by Lynch's house composer Angelo Badalamenti. It blows the mind that this movie is approaching its 20th anniversary, AND that Lynch made only one more feature length after this, namely 2006's ""Inland Empire"".""Mulholland Dr. was playing at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this past weekend and on a whim (and also resulting from a lack of new movies coming to theaters), I went to see it. The Saturday early evening screening was attended okay (about 10 people--in comparison, the day before I saw the new Chris Nolan ""Tenet"" and there were exactly 4 people in a large theater for that). I certainly enjoyed seeing ""Mulholland Dr."" again, but I wasn't overwhelmed like I expected to. Of course if you haven't seen this, or it's been a long time, I'd readily suggest you check this out (again) and draw your own conclusion.",Mulholland Drive
55,robert-temple-1,"The desire for fame, the intensity of love",10,14 February 2011,"This is a work of such outstanding genius and of such subtle nuance and complexity, that a brief review cannot possibly do it justice. In this film, writer and director David Lynch restrains himself from being too gross and disgusting and manages to concentrate instead wholly on just telling this gut-wrenching tragic tale in its fullness, to the exclusion of his usual self-indulgent follies and distractions. (The many bizarre 'Lynch touches' found throughout this film are kept within bounds, so that they all work and are effective.) I have just seen the film for the fourth time, and it gets better every time, and definitely improves with (either its or one's own) age. There are many fans of this film, and there is a website I recommend, which is www.mulholland-drive.net/studies where many answers to enigmas in the film are to be found. For instance, the house at 6980 Mulholland Drive towards which 'Rita' is being driven in the limousine at the opening of the film is really at 6980 Macapa Drive, whereas 6980 Mulholland Drive is apparently an unoccupied spot directly below the Hollywood sign above Mulholland Drive, which is a long road which goes up towards the Santa Monica Hills and is an address of many famous movie stars past and present. The Hollywood sign on the hills features prominently in the film, and is of the essence of the tale. It is wonderful to see two old-timers and shameless scene-stealers in this film, namely Lee Grant and Ann Miller (it was her last film appearance, not long before she died). The moody and hauntingly effective music for the film is by Angelo Badalamenti, who has worked with Lynch on most of his films and on TWIN PEAKS. Badalamenti appears in the film as one of the two Mafia brothers who spits out his espresso coffee and keeps saying 'This is the girl.' (He does not speak in chords or octaves, however, but has a human voice.) The film is remarkable for the stunning, brilliant, and Oscar-worthy performances of the two leading players, Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring (her strange surname was originally Herring, which is a respectable English surname, and why she changed it I cannot imagine). Every frame of this film is totally mesmerizing. I do not know how Lynch manages to make every shot so full of mystery and menace, and although a lot of it is down to brilliant editing, the only real answer can lie in saying simply: 'That's a genius at work.' If only he were less unruly in some of his other films, or had somebody to restrain him from his excesses! Geniuses are naughty boys and need to be restrained by Nanny or they run out of control and make a botch of their work. But in this film, he kept down his wilder urges and just made the film work. The famous French producer Alain Sarde had the good sense to back this film, which was languishing unappreciated as a script in America and was misunderstood. It really is more of a European film, despite the intensity of its locale and its deep roots in that specific and uniquely American fantasy world of Hollywood. The film is dedicated at the end to Jennifer Symes (1979-2008), who was apparently an aspiring young actress similar to the character played by Naomi Watts in this film, though that is not information which I have verified, and is just from the internet. The beginning of the film shows Naomi Watts ('Betsy') emerging all fresh-faced and breathless from Los Angeles Airport, an ecstatic expression of excitement and anticipation on her face at arriving in Hollywood, where she hopes to become a star but will settle for being just a famous actress. She takes a taxi to an apartment which belongs to her aunt, who has gone to work on a film on location so that Betsy can stay there for a while. The address given in the film is 1612 Havenhurst, but that does not exist, as Havenhurst ends at 1500. The real address of this truly extraordinary art-deco apartment is I1 Borghese, 450 Sycamore Avenue, for those who want to drop in for tea with the aunt. (Why not? Hollywood is where fantasy is reality, isn't it?) Watts and Harring are totally spellbinding in their performances and in their relationship with each other, which becomes very physical and just about as intense as they get, not to say obsessional. There are electrifying scenes with both Melissa George as Camilla Rhodes and Michele Hicks as Nicki Pelazza. Both of them do wonderful sixties songs, as auditions. And there is a spine-tingling and magnificent rendering of Roy Orbison's song 'Crying' in Spanish by Rebekah Del Rio which Lynch films in full. One of the endearing traits of the naughty little boy Lynch is his love of sixties music. It seems that a jitterbug contest in Canada was cut from the beginning of the film. 'Betsy' is supposed to have won it, so what a shame we did not get to see it. Possibly there was pressure from the producer about the length, as the film is two hours and 20 minutes long, and in some versions as long as two hours and 27 or variously 28 minutes (I suspect a minute of the sex scene may have been cut). I wonder if there will ever be a director's cut, or perhaps this is it. David Lynch carries on the noble tradition of French surrealism in his films, whether he knows it or not. Every screen minute of this film is in an alternative reality, even when the camera stares at mundane things like a plate of uneaten fried eggs at Winkie's on Sunset Boulevard. Sometimes I could imagine that André Breton and Philippe Soupault secretly contribute to his scripts through a medium and devise some of the eerie, supernatural, and reality-piercing scenes.",Mulholland Drive

Reality at times doesn't feel real because it not just doesn't correspond to our aspirations on what we dreamt, but also from how it can make us feel which we never asked for.This is one of my favorite films of all time from another of my favorite movie directors David Lynch, this film is number two in my book. Like with most of his movies it's not so much a film as it's more of an experience; and it's another in the weird category as its non-conventional but most of all one big enigma.I'll admit after seeing the movie I needed to have a few minutes and said to myself ""What the frak didn't I just watch?!"" This is indeed a very strange movie as it's not the kind you see every day, it's seems simple and yet it isn't. You could easily sum everything up in the end but then there are so many pieces that don't connect, that you can't make a proof positive conclusion, though you still can make an interesting analysis of it. This is also a film where you can watch it more than once and always uncover something more.The film has this very strange and threatening dream like atmosphere from the beginning and even toward some of the end. Throughout most of the film nothing every really feels real from what's happening even the people were seeing don't feel real as there's something off, from some of the strange dialog, it's a small quirk or character trait, you can't quite put your thumb on it but you know it's there.I really love some of the cinematography in the film which is just beautiful and really help enhance the experience of the film. Like this one with this blue box and how the camera just slowly zooms in on and then does it very quick once we get closer to the interior, it really felt like I was falling straight into that hole. Sort of goes with that old saying of staring into the abyss for too long and you fall right in.But also, there are little moments when the camera in some scene moves a bit to places it shouldn't, as if it's a common rookie mistake from a rookie/amateur cinematographer. This I find interesting as it sort of reminds me a little of those found footage movies you would see where throughout the film were in the perspective of the cinematographer, which makes perfect sense for our viewing.It's interesting how we follow three different characters throughout the film that don't necessary connect with each other but sort of do, much like the manga/anime series ""Durarara"" where there are lots of characters each with something going on that more or less all connects. You can also count us in as character number 4 or 5, from how the camera moves throughout the film that represents us, were literally part of the action.Each of them is sympathetic as each have their dilemmas. From the beautiful amnesiac played by Laura Haring whom I'll admit is another celeb crush of mine, it's a shame she didn't get a little more, but she goes by the alias Rita, this film fits like a glove for her as she's has that look of the heroines you'd seen in any noir. The good natured naïve up and coming actress and would be noir heroine Betty played well by Naomi Watts. And there is the movie director played by Justin Theroux, Adam whom is sort of an underdog struggling to make his movie despite getting crap canned a lot. Believe or not he's my favorite character in the film as I can sort of emphasize with him as I myself am a struggling artist and have felt that pressure and have had my share of crap thrown at me.I really like how the film gets into the physics of fiction and dreams, there are a lot of really strange moments/scenes and even scary moments in the film, yet all have a strange sense of reality. Like one in a restaurant where we hear some guy that isn't even a main character in the film is telling a story which I'll admit I think is one of the scariest moments ever, because the story is creepy enough but then we get the payoff to it which I'll admit scared the crap out me, jump out of my seat. This was one of those moments that stick with you because it really had nothing to do with the film itself but felt like it was a scene for another film.Yet in a way it sort of says something about the world in movies and TV shows how were always focused so much on the main characters and the developing plot that we don't realize there is a lot more going on in the background, but the more we watch the movie or TV episode sometimes there is that one or few people in a scene from an episode or movie that sticks with you because you can't help but wonder who that person is and what else could be happening in this strange fantastic fictional world the characters inhabit; it really makes sense when you think about it more just as there is a story happening for the main characters it doesn't mean there isn't anything else happening for other characters were not focused on.Though what makes this figure that we see only for a brief time scary is that it's a tramp that is just grotesquely dirty, this is a fear we all carry that I can easily empathize with as that's mine which is on dismal failure. But also, this one figure also represents the disgusting evil that is hidden in the shine of the Hollywood lights.Also, despite how much we follow the three lead characters, we don't really know them. But that's the point as each of them have no real depth all of them are by their nature really character role or archetypes you've seen in several films and TV shows, mainly ones of yesteryear. From the character Betty and her perkiness that can make you puke, no one in reality is ever this nice, except a character from a TV sitcom or anything else you might have watched.Let alone what the characters sometimes say which sounds like scripted dialog. This makes sense in how characters are constructed and handled as they only have depth and character depending on how much we invest in the writing which can reflect ourselves and the times we live in. I like moments where they break from their character mainly when they pick up a little detail as the movie goes on, like when the character Adam notices Betty walking away it as if they've for a brief moment woken up, where they stop playing their role and face a truth.Another is when both Betty and Rita go into the Theater Silenco, which is a really interesting and creepy scene, with a magician whom kind of looks a bit like actor Tim Curry but isn't (would've been cool if it was). And it's interesting as you see all different kinds of acts but each of the acts are facades as we see each performer stop performing but the sound is still going.In a way the whole show was sort of reality calling Betty but also just the whole audience out however everything going on for the character isn't real. However, this is really about Betty's illusions and even our own we might hold about Hollywood, that most of what we've been bought and sold about it is all just that smoke and mirrors with no real worth.At the heart of the film it sort of shows just simply the underbelly of Hollywood. I like that as there have been very few films that have done it, two most notable is ""Sunset Boulevard"" which this film really pays homage to it a lot. Another is the anime movie ""Perfect Blue"" which is another really trippy one and was ironically years before ""Mulholland Drive"". This film really takes a unflinching looking into the scumy innerworkings going on and presents sad truths as to why most of us have the hardest time making our dreams come true or some dreams do come true but not without a dire price.I also feel the film bit of a cautionary tale as to why we shouldn't invest into false notions we have about fame and the lifestyle, because just like the movies made all that by its nature is an illusion. Let alone the importance of having an identity and to never lose it to a soulless empire and the spotlight which doesn't necessarily make you see clearly but blind you to the truth.The Hollywood lights don't always make life brighter; they just make it darker.Rating: 4 stars.",Mulholland Drive
57,dfranzen70,Confusing for most but the most rabid Lynch lovers,6,4 September 2006,"Mulholland Drive will appeal to aficionados of David Lynch, but for those who merely like his movies - or, worse, haven't seen any of them (Elephant Man, Eraserhead, Dune, Lost Highway), it'll be a thoroughly incomprehensible mess. I suspect it's not, really, but figuring it out calls for mental powers the like of which I'll never have. The movie does more than merely blur the line between reality and fantasy, it obliterates it.For about two thirds of the film, everything sort of makes some kind of sense. It's weird enough, sure, but it seems to follow some logic. Then Something happens, and the movie goes off the rails. Intentionally, I'm sure - it's the kind of movie for which clues are very, very subtle, and it's entirely up to the viewer to piece them together. Even so, different viewers will come up with different explanations for the events in Mulholland Drive.The basic gist is this: Betty Elms (Naomi Watts), fresh off the plane from Canada, arrives in Hollywood to make her fortune as an actress, along with approximately 40,000 other ingenues each year (taken from the Great Book of Stats I've Made Up). She has it a little easier than most novices, though, in that she gets to stay in the nice apartment of her aunt, an actress who's conveniently out of town and has permitted Betty to stay. Ah, but Betty quickly discovers that she's not alone - there's a naked woman in her shower, and it turns out she's an amnesiac. The woman takes the name of Rita from a nearby movie poster, and Betty decides to help her find out who she is while keeping nosy neighbors out of the loop.Now, the viewer knows that Rita was in a car accident on the titular road in the opening scene of the movie. She was being driven in a limo, and the driver pulled the car over and pulled a gun on her. Before he can shoot, though, two drag racing cars careen around the turn, and one smashes into Rita's car, killing everyone except her. She subsequently wanders into Los Angeles itself and hides out at Betty's aunt's place.As with most Lynch movies, though, nothing is what it seems. All Rita has in her purse is a mysterious, oddly shaped blue key - and stacks of money. When she and Betty visit a diner, Rita thinks she recognizes the waitress's first name - Diane - and maybe even flashes on a full name, Diane Selwyn. Could Rita be Diane? The ladies figure out Selwyn's phone number and call it, but they get a recording. Then they visit it, but when they find the woman's apartment, they find Selwyn had switched with someone - and at THAT apartment, they find a dead body.But that's not where it gets weird. In the middle of the night, Rita wakes up with the word Silencio on her lips, and she brings Betty to a strange club with the same name. In what's been described as the most moving sequence in the film, the women watch an interesting performance - first an emcee tells them that ""There is no band"" and that all is just a tape, and then a singer belts out a Spanish version of Rob Orbison's ""Crying,"" which apparently has quite an effect on Rita (who cries) and Betty (who shakes). After the performance, Rita discovers she has a small blue box, and back at the apartment she opens it. And that's about when the movie goes completely nutso.What does it all mean? I do not know. Who are all of these people? I do not know. I don't know much about this movie, and I just saw the thing. I fear it's entirely beyond my comprehension, but I did find a good analysis of it online.I like mysteries. I like having to figure things out, but I don't particular enjoy movies that have a zillion possibilities, depending on how the viewer wishes to interpret things. Or, if that's how the movie's going to be, I kind of wish the clues made some sort of sense. Otherwise, it's just a cacophony of white noise - nothing makes sense, so nothing is there.",Mulholland Drive
58,kevin_robbins,This film has always disappointed me,5,15 July 2021,"Mulholland Dr. (2001) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline for this movie opens with a car accident and a woman who emerges from it with amnesia. She finds a way out of the car and into a woman's house...that happens to have a house sitter just arriving. The woman with amnesia and house sitter work together to uncover her past and it becomes hard to tell what's reality and wasn't from their adventures. This movie is directed by David Lynch (Dune) and stars Naomi Watts (King Kong), Robert Forster (Jackie Brown), Billy Ray Cyrus (Hannah Montana) and Laura Harring (The Punisher). The storyline for this is abstract, but the writing felt uneven to me. I hated the dialogue and acting in this. Thought they did a great job casting but felt the execution was poor. There were some good sex sequences and eccentric scenes. I know I am in the minority on this, but this film has always disappointed me. I'd score this a 5/10.",Mulholland Drive
59,meeza,Best Film Of The Year So Far!!!!!!!!!,10,6 November 2001,"Start your engine and gear up for the cinematic experience of the year at `Mulholland Drive'. Director David Lynch's dreamscape new film is one of the best of the year! It will definitely make u-turn your head in bedazzlement after you watch it. The movie is about an aspiring young actress who befriends a lost amnesia vixen on-the-run. At the same time, the film also focuses on a director who is forced to cast the leading lady in his film by some quirky underground mobsters. However, the plot is not what drives this film. The surreal images of the film is what makes it unforgettable! It is like a dream! Never told in a normal sequential order. It is the images what we most remember in a dream! Just like it is the images that you will most remember in `Mulholland Drive'. Director David Lynch should have his hand lynched on to a Best Director Oscar statuette next March. It is without a doubt, the best direction executed in a film this year! The films unknown female stars Naomi Watts & Laura Elena Harring were a vision! Watts out because Naomi will be a name you will hear a lot of during the next several years; and Harring's Rita Hayworth looks is worth the price of admission. Their lesbian thespian scenes will be in your top 3 list of the most sexiest scenes of all time. But most important, their performances are of oscar-caliber. Also, this just-in  Justin Theroux also delivered an oscar-worthy performance as the constrained male director. Even one-hit wonder Billy Ray Cyrus was solid as the pool cleaning stud who sleeps with the director's wife who breaks our male protagonist's `acky, bracky heart"". This film will leave you mesmerized for days or even weeks. If you do not believe me, just get in your car now and head on over to `Mulholland Drive'. ***** Excellent",Mulholland Drive
60,FilmCriticLalitRao,Not sure whether this must be termed as the best film directed by David Lynch.,4,10 July 2007,"In any manner whatsoever,I don't want to offend any of the admirers of David Lynch who are present all over the world.However I would like to mention that I purchased a DVD of this film in order to fathom what made it so famous that it won the best foreign language film at the French Cesar awards ceremony. However my first viewing session of this film was deceptive as it left me numb and I could not make head nor tail of this film.As in the past I had seen only one film from our American master in question called ""The Elephant Man"" and as I was not much too satisfied with the film,my expectations with Mullholland Drive were high and sorry to say unfortunately they came to a cropper. First of all I found it hard to understand why so many events were happening and that too in quick succession.There was no coherence and it appeared to me that the innocent viewers were bombarded with a volley of jumbled scenes.Yeah it is a good thing that some of those scenes were shrouded into mystery while some were suffused with sensuality.So thanks to these elements I was able to contend myself with this film. The two leading actress are worth mentioning as their coming together might be a healing for some haplessly sore eyes.",Mulholland Drive
61,GiraffeDoor,See a Svankajer Movie instead.,3,12 April 2019,"Gotta say, I found this movie annoying.Surreal should be a selling point but this is so excessive, non-linear and seemingly bizarre for the sake of bizarre, I might recommend as a study in how off the wall a movie can be, but not as an example of surrealism done well.",Mulholland Drive
62,Chris_Docker,Original film making in a class of its own,10,26 February 2002,"What is behind the curtain? Or just around that bend? Behind the door? Behind the words? Where will our hopes and dreams take us? If we succeed, they become part of who we are. But if Fate is unkind we face our own fallibility. In the multifaceted and unreal world of Los Angeles, a city of dreams and nightmares, being true to yourself can be as hard as discovering who you really are. The way can be littered with mobsters, hit men, and pressures that can drive you crazy. A great setting for a noirish thriller and a mystery within a mystery.In the glamorous and sometimes dangerous world on the fringes of Hollywood, two girls (played by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring) are drawn into a lesbian relationship that is unequal in more ways than one. A sense of foreboding is never far away. A top director, Adam Kesher (played by Justin Theroux) is having to re-audition a lead role, but if he doesn't do as he's told he will lose everything. Who knows what will happen when the road ahead is dark? As we piece together opening scenes, a woman is ambushed in the back of her car on Mulholland Drive. We watch an accident and a narrow escape. We see her drawn under the wing of wide-eyed Betty, whose idealistic vision of Hollywood seems almost too good to be true. Amnesia, a hit that goes wrong, strange occurrences around a Wendys Diner, and lots of media-mogul double-talk. We are assaulted with a barrage of clues to solve a puzzle which remains tantalisingly out of reach.Then there's a major twist.Mulholland Drive is not a mystery that you solve by the end of the film. You have to go away and think about it. The movie uses a broken chain of cause and effect that challenges and forces an audience in on itself. Remember Memento, where we realise the film is shot from the point of view of a man with short-term memory loss? Expect the unexpected. And once you work out the 'beginner's' or 'classical' interpretation, new avenues will open to explore, like a poem as it blossoms.One of the beguiling aspects of the film is that each scene is so captivating, so unusual, so colourful that we are tempted to enjoy it for its own sake. We race from horror to laughter to romance to mystery. A simple hit-and-run for an address book turns into Tarantinoesque mayhem as the clean-up operation gets hilariously out of control. Adam is prone to imaginative violence with golf clubs or pink paint when told who to cast or is cuckolded by the pool man.High production values and fabulous sets add to our visual enjoyment. Perfect editing brings every shot home hard. But the script increasingly tries to force a more Brechtian analysis upon us, making us stand back from the characters where we had suspended disbelief. When Naomi Watts' is auditioning for a part, the intensity of her performance moves us as if we had finally connected with her character. In a nightclub, when an act is pre-announced as lip-synched, we don't want to believe. Images are absorbed faster than logic, but they are so beautiful we may as well leave logic until later.Just as the characters in the film, if we do not explore different sides of our make-up consciously as an actor does, through creative channels, then our subconscious may do it for us. We all dream. Some of take us might take recreational drugs. Most of us indulge in wish-fulfilment and sexual fantasies. Mulholland Drive should be avoided by those who like straightforward stories without too much of a challenge. It is not just a passive viewing experience. But if you like exploring strange byways and have the patience to see what is around the corner, Mulholland Drive is one of those films to put on your all-time must-see list.Want a starter? Check out the director's 10 Official Clues.Editor Mary Sweeney says, ""Even the critics who wrote in their reviews that they hadn't understood a thing admitted three days later that the story was perfectly clear."" (If you're still stuck after that, it's been extensively analysed on the Internet, where there are dedicated sites.) Mulholland Drive is a film about identity. Your unconscious plays a part in coming up with answers. Don't worry if you have to sleep on it. After all the pieces have fit into place, you might decide just to enjoy it as poetry. The drive can be more enjoyable than where it leads.",Mulholland Drive
63,estebangonzalez10,Lynch is out of my league,5,13 August 2013,"""Now you will see me one more time, if you do good. You will see me, two more times, if you do bad. Good night""Mulholland Drive is considered by many one of the best films of the last decade (2001-09) and among David Lynch's best work. There is no denying that Lynch is one of today's most revered directors, but this is actually the first film of his that I've been able to see. Unfortunately I wasn't able to enjoy this movie as much as everyone else did and I'm ashamed to admit that Lynch is way to smart for me. While watching this film I felt that there were several scenes that didn't make much sense and that the director was just being pretentious showing his craft and great skills, but after reading the Hulk's critique of this film explaining every single detail in the movie I have to admit that Lynch was a genius and I just didn't get the movie in the same way others did. Looking back I realize that every scene has a meaning and the film is rich in symbolism and semiotics. Despite paying attention to the film I missed very important things that I can now see were really thought out by Lynch. I feel ashamed because I wasn't able to grasp the film in the same way Lynch would have wanted me to and I felt everything was pointless. The performances in this film are really great but I was never drawn into the film in the same way others were. I guess I'm not someone who cares too much about dreams or puts too much thought into them and their underlying meanings. What I did enjoy about this film were the satirical elements introduced by Lynch about the film industry in Hollywood. The characters were really well developed and the mood of the film is suspenseful at times. I also enjoyed the score of the film and thought it really added to the overall eeriness of Mulholland Drive. I might enjoy this film more if I watch it again now that I have understood most of the underlying meanings and symbolisms here, but I just can't gather myself to watch it again because I was never absorbed by the story and found everything rather dull.Betty (Naomi Watts) is a young aspiring actress who has just arrived at Hollywood from a small Canadian town. Her aunt, a successful actress herself, has allowed her to stay at her home while she is off shooting a movie. When Betty arrives at her apartment she is surprised to find out that there is a young woman already there. This beautiful brunette is suffering from amnesia after surviving a terrible car accident right before she was about to get murdered and has decided to hide in the apartment after seeing Betty's aunt leave. She thinks her name is Rita (Laura Harring), but she can't remember anything else. Betty decides to help her and allows her to stay with her. In the meantime there are a few other stories taking place. On the one hand we have a director (Justin Theroux) who is looking for a lead actress to replace the one that has disappeared. The producers want to force him to choose Camila Rhodes (Melissa George), but he refuses. There are also a series of detectives (Robert Forster and Brent Briscoe) trying to solve a murder, and a hit man (Joe Messing) who is a little inept at his job. All these stories seem to overlap each other as everything is connected, but at the same time not everything is what it seems as the line between dreams and reality is a very thin one.I love films that aren't told in chronological order like this, but I had trouble here putting all the pieces together. Now that I was able to understand it all I can see how brilliant Lynch was using all these different imageries. This is a film about transferring guilt and romanticizing love in an otherwise cruel and dark world. Lynch is always in control of his craft here, but he was way ahead of me and truly lost me. Naomi Watts had a breakout performance here, and she is now one of Hollywood's best known actresses, but this will be the role many will remember her for. Laura Harring is also great here as the needy and vulnerable character that Betty wants her (or fantasizes her) to be. Mulholland Dr. is a very complex and thrilling mystery that begins to make sense long after you've seen it. Is succeeds in the fact that the images stay with you and haunt you, but I really didn't have a pleasurable experience watching it. This is a very ambiguous film and Lynch has written a fabulous screenplay, but one that I wasn't prepared for. This is a very dark film that plays out as a contemporary film noir. Lynch was nominated as best director for his work here, but surprisingly it didn't receive any other nomination in 2001. The film has garnered cult status over the years and I understand why. I'm a little disappointed with myself for not enjoying this as much as I should have.Rating: 5.9/10",Mulholland Drive
64,sauravjoshi85,"Great, Great, Great",9,21 May 2020,"Mulholland Drive is a neo-noir mystery movie directed by David Lynch and stars Naomi Watts, Laura Elena Harring, Justin Theroux and late Ann Miller in the leads.To be honest I was not able to understand the movie and thought that this is yet another confusing mystery movie which has no ending but once I cracked the mystery I just wanted to salute the director.This is one of the most complex movies ever made and is to be watched very carefully and once you are able to understand the movie you will get the great mind behind it.Very strong acting by the two female leads and Naomi Watts steals the show with her stellar performance. Screenplay is confusing yet gripping and will force you to keep guessing the climax.Visuals are great with strong music.

65,noralee,Intriguing Sights and Sound for Not Much Point,5,29 November 2005,"""Mulholland Drive"" is ""Twin Peaks"" redux, including its genesis as a planned TV series. Only instead of taking on the quirks of the Pacific Northwest, David Lynch plays on a Hollywood setting, gleefully spinning on artifice and dreams, with many references to other movies, including ""The Day of the Locust,"" ""The Wizard of Oz,"" and ""The Hucksters.""The lush cinematography, music and carnival of character actor cameos almost make up for the interminable colorful red herrings that wouldn't be out of place on the old ""Dallas"" and a glacial pace.We see all of the two striking young lead starlets as fetching eye candy to pass the time, giving us both blonde and brunette femmes fatale. I was blown away by a Spanish version of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" done by performance artist Del Rio, but I'm not sure what it had to do with anything.Just as we know that Picasso could draw realistically, we know from ""The Straight Story"" that Lynch can in fact do a straight narrative. He just chooses not to. (originally written 10/21/2001)",Mulholland Drive
66,kluseba,"Excellent Lynchian routine - the twin of ""Lost highway""",10,9 August 2010,"This movie is another surreal piece of art by David Lynch, but it's not as great as the amazing and twisted ""Lost highway"" or the wonderful ""Twin Peaks"" series. Those movies ore episode are simply over the top. But it is still a movie that is more intense, intelligent and surprising than most of the other so called psycho thrillers and is worth a ten star vote.A little advice: You must also watch ""Lost highway"", because this movie is like a twin of this unique masterpiece! Now, let us begin with the bad points, because there aren't very much. This movie is not as twisted, surreal and surprising than ""Lost highway"". That doesn't mean that you might be able to understand it when you have just watched it once, but your not that literally lost as in ""Lost highway"". I also think that this movie copies the structure of ""Lost highway"" a lot and is less innovating. There is also a slow paced beginning, then a key event, the looking for the truth beyond dream and reality, the sudden change and the twisted ending connecting the end of the movie with its beginning. With the scenes of the house party in the ending, Lynch gives a lot of possible solutions and keys to the viewer and doesn't let him or her just stunning and without any clue like in his previous work. But if you think by now that this movie is easy to understand than David Lynch gives you such a strange element in the last scene of the movie that makes you desperate and that makes you think that you are back in ""Eraserhead"". But why should Lynch change his style after he had created a true masterpiece a few years ago? We should just see those points as minor critic points. It is not an ten plus extra star masterpiece but just an excellent ten star movie.Now, there is another negative point that I have to mention in a more general way: David Lynch wanted to start a new series around ""Mulholland Drive"" and this would have been such a great experience as ""Twin Peaks"" was or even better and David Lynch put all his creative imagination and dedicated a part of himself to the project - but Americas blockbuster-minded, easy-watching-commercialized Hollywood bosses didn't believe in a success and didn't accord the necessary amounts to one of their genius - the series might not have been popular and a good sell. That's why David Lynch was never able to finish his dream of a new series and we might have never seen parts of his filming if some French investors wouldn't have supported him and convinced him to make at least a movie out of his filming. David Lynch got financial support and an open-minded entourage and that's why he turned some new scenes, worked out a slightly new screenplay and created this new movie. A big thank you to the French supporters and thumps down towards the American film industry which let fall one of their best talents. And maybe all those complicated circumstances are the reason why Lynch made cartoons and worked as a producer in the next years and we had to wait seven years before he came back with the low-budget semi-masterpiece ""Inland Empire"", it's a really sad thing.Now, let's talk about the very positive parts of the movie. It has a little bit less dark atmosphere in the beginning than ""Lost highway"", but there is a key event and some action right after the introduction that make this movie easier to watch - the ""accident"" on the Mulholland Drive. But after this happen some really strange scenes that create a really thrilled atmosphere and that make the viewer of that movie think, guess and analyze - the strange old couple, the guy who has strange nightmares, the killer who's doing some stupid mistakes... There are many interesting details in this movie, even more than in ""Lost highway"" and the viewer becomes somehow an analyzer or detective. This movie requests multiple viewings and personally, I discover new elements after each viewing and I have seen the movie at least three or four times by now and it wasn't the last time. You really see that Lynch was supposed to do a series with this one because of all the well thought details.""Mulholland Drive"" lives also from the great acting of the two feminine main actors, especially the really charming Naomi Watts who does the job of her life. Every character is unique in this movie even the smaller roles like the nightmare guy and this point is even done better and more intense than in ""Lost highway"". Only the role of the cowboy has a lot of similarities to the role of the mystery man in ""Lost highway"", it is just a pity that he has not much space in this movie.And there is the same advice that I gave for ""Lost highway"": expect the unexpected! That may not be as clear in the first three quarters of the movie, it is less disturbing that other works of Lynch, but in the last one, you should better be prepared for some weird stuff that was worth the wait. I agree with critics who say that this movie has a certain Lynchian routine - but his routine is far away from being boring and especially the final thirty minutes should convince you! So, if you want to see a movie that makes work your mind and feelings, a movie you must concentrate on and that may request multiple viewings to understand, you will really appreciate this one. If you're looking for an easy movie for a DVD night with some friends - go for something else, because your party people might get frightened!",Mulholland Drive
67,davispittman,Took me some time to process afterwards....,10,9 April 2017,"Wow!! What a complex film! I mean I don't think I've ever seen a movie that makes you think more than this one does, but hey that's why it's so excellent. Mulholland Drive stars Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, and Justin Theroux. It even has a short Billy Ray Cyrus cameo lol. The acting is just wonderful! I adored Watts and Harring! Naomi Watts can go from being so kind sweet and simple in one version of herself to being disheveled and washed up. She handles the lead role with such skill. And Laura Harring plays her role very well, realistic and believable. And Theroux does a pretty good job with his performance, his isn't quite as big/important as Harring and Watts's are. The script is very close to perfection. A script for a film like this must to be written very carefully and be very specific and detailed. If it wouldn't have been then it wouldn't have been nearly as interesting. That's the main thing about Mulholland Drive, it is COMPLEX and WEIRD lol. But I think that's a great thing. We need more mystery thrillers that are made like this and do this to viewers. I know now after doing some brief research how and what the movie was saying at the end. At first I had absolutely no idea, but then the pieces started to be put together. And it started to make some sense. This really is an excellent movie that will give your brain a real work out! I totally suggest it. And stay with it, it's kind of long and you've got to be patient with it. 10/10!",Mulholland Drive
68,rooprect,Here's why David Lynch is a bad director,3,24 March 2007,"My review for this movie is the same for every other Lynch movie I've seen (and like a masochistic fool who doesn't know when to quit, I have seen many). As Roger Ebert wrote, Lynch's work is ""sophomoric satire and cheap shots. The director is either denying the strength of his material or trying to defuse it by pretending it's all part of a campy in-joke.""I used to have a friend who couldn't carry a tune. Once in a while he would try, and immediately we would all start laughing at him. At that point, my friend would deliberately start singing off key, as if to say, ""uh, I MEANT to sound bad!"" This is David Lynch syndrome. His plots are often juvenile & simplistic, and his dialogue is goofy. But then--afraid of his audience laughing at him--he deliberately takes a satirical, sarcastic tone of film-making. It's as if to say, ""uh, I MEANT for that scene to look ridiculous."" Next he hides behind supercilious gimmickry like symbolism. Sure, symbolism is cool (that's why I love Kurosawa), but symbolism without substance is just babble. Back to the analogy of my musically-challenged friend, this is like hiding his poor singing skills behind a lot of big arm gestures and fancy footwork.In Mullholland Drive he weaves a web of such convoluted symbolism that many people are dazzled like deer in the headlights. But don't be fooled folks. My advice to you is the same as my advice to the deer: RUN.So enough already. Davy boy, please get the tongue-out-of-cheek, drop the schlock and give us a serious, genuine effort. Sure, some people will laugh at you. Some people will call you juvenile and silly. But that doesn't matter. What *does* matter is how confidently you can express yourself. Listen to Bob Dylan sing. Watch Arnold Schwartzenegger speak. These people sound awful; yet they present themselves with enough confidence (lack of sarcasm & cynicism) that we, the audience, must admire them for their authenticity.When you learn that simple lesson, Davy boy, then you will have graduated to the level of ""artist"". Until then, you're just a kid with a camera, trying to be something he isn't.Now to all you people who love Lynch because he's weird & different & non-Hollywood. I agree, he is. But why stop at Lynch? Go all the way. Check out the films of Godard, Kobayashi, Fellini, or (as much as I personally hate him) Peter Greenaway. And I highly recommend the early films of Jeunet/Caro like ""Bunker of the Last Gunshots"" or ""City of Lost Children"". These are films that are weird without TRYING to be weird. Know what I mean? Explore! If you really want to leave Hollywood, don't stop at Pasedena. Go all the way.",Mulholland Drive
69,Kdosda_Hegen,"As a huge fan of Lynch I'm quite disappointed. But it's not Lynch's fault, it's the fans...",6,14 April 2020,"This movie is just another take on the plot of Perfect Blue. You may argue it's absolutely nothing alike and you're right, but base formula is the same. Anyway, Mulholland Drive has many great scenes and many interesting twists, but it's too confusing for its own good and sometimes plain cheap. This movie has lesbian sex scenes, clearly made just to get the stupid virgins' atention, so cheap and disgusting. Half of the reviews who rate this movie 10/10 only mentions the sex scenes in their reviews, the most of other half says they love it, but confirm that they don't understand movie at all (Which doesn't make any sense to rate it high), it just shows that this film does not deserve most of it's praise. Lynch obviously did it on purpose to manipulate the stupid, so he's the genius. Only the very few actually paid attention to this mess and know what really happened. Anyway if you go through this mess scene by scene you'll notice many Lynch's genius subtle details and filmmaking, but the problem is the chronology, after 2/3 of movie it becomes so blended, that most viewers had no idea what they saw. If you don't understand what happenned, LondonCityGirl (youtube channel) did a great explanation video on it, she says all you need to know. Anyway while the plot is quite good, it's as I mentioned before just another Perfect Blue plot's version. The other of this movie's biggest flaws is that it is too much based on interpretations, most I love, but some not so much. To summary, this is a quality film for most part, but the lesbian scenes, way too blended chronology and the overusage of interpretations makes this one of Lynch's weaker films.",Mulholland Drive
70,andrewchristianjr,GENIUS.,10,4 April 2020,"This is a unique movie. Unique because regardless of what you consider, if you liked the film or not, you will think about what you just saw. It is a reactionary film in ways because it toys with your perception. Genius. A masterpiece of dark mystery that no one to this day has figured out.",Mulholland Drive
71,Jonny_Numb,one of Lynch's best films,8,13 January 2003,"David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" is a movie that not only gets better upon repeated viewings, but also requires a lot of brain work on the part of whoever views it (that means YOU).  The script is filled with strange incidents ('Club Silencio,' for instance) and characters (a cowboy, a dwarf with links to the underworld, and a rotting corpse hanging out behind a Hollywood restaurant), but is also filled with with small details that clue us in to the answer to Lynch's riddle.  ""Mulholland Drive"" is a mystery in the purest sense of the word, with events and characters that overlap, and seemingly go back in time--there are no easy answers to be found, but trying to figure them out is part of the fun.Betty (Naomi Watts, filled with the right amount of cheerful naivete and, later, despair) is a young Hollywood hopeful who encounters a car crash victim named Rita (Laura Harring), who has amnesia.  In the meantime, a harried film director (Justin Theroux, of ""American Psycho"") is re-casting the female lead of his film, but outside forces beyond his control insist on one specific girl.  That's the basic plot--Lynch's narrative structure depends on unconventional incidents/characters that are better left unsaid.If there's a flaw to ""Mulholland Drive,"" it's the VERY made-for-TV look of the film.  Quite obviously, many scenes were intended for network TV (the film was originally going to be a series, a la ""Twin Peaks"") and went unchanged in the final cut of the film, which isn't necessarily a bad thing--it just cheapens the look of the film.  But that's a minor complaint. For fans of Lynch...or people who just like a good mystery, ""Mulholland Drive"" delivers in spades.  4 stars out of 5.",Mulholland Drive
72,dierregi,Naked chicks get you high ratings,1,9 November 2014,"When I first watched the movie in 2001 I was still hoping Lynch had something to say, despite the disappointment with Wild at heart. I was surprised by the high rating and good reviews this movie got, but finally when I watched the movie again tonight on TV I got the point: hot, young, naked actresses and plenty of lesbian sex. Watts and Harring starring as the mysterious Rita and Betty go all the way, titillating the viewers with their antics.Undeniably, both Watts and Harring really did a good job with the absurd script they got. But the script remains absurd. My personal take is that Lynch had a grudge against the Hollywood establishment and the whole movie is supposed to prove some point, such as how directors are forced to choose actors, even when they would prefer to cast somebody else.It is pointless to summarize the plot, since the movie switches into a different one two thirds into the story. Anybody can interpret the complete lack of logic in whichever way they want and then ""accuse"" whoever does not ""get"" it of being dumb. The point is, there is nothing to ""get"", apart from Lynch frustration, unleashed on paying audience, a plot that does not make any sense and a couple of good actresses, only one of them actually making a career out of this crappy movie.While Mulholland Drive propelled Watts into super stardom, Harring was left behind. Which seems unfair, but then again, perhaps fitting in Lynch's world where nothing makes sense. However, Mulholland Drive put me off Lynch's world once and for all.P.S. I like fictional stories to make some sort of sense, since I get plenty of absurdity from real life. I think authors could make an effort to churn out stories with a beginning a middle and an end, even if not necessarily in this order. Creativity does not necessarily imply messy, self-involved narrative.",Mulholland Drive
73,truemythmedia,Essential Lynch,10,25 July 2019,"When I think of Lynch, my mind immediately jumps right to ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""Eraserhead""; and I'd be hard pressed to pick a favorite between the two. In my opinion, both films are essential viewing for any cinephile or even anyone who has an interest in arthouse films. This film is as bizarre as it is entertaining and thought-provoking. How does one go about describing ""Mulholland Drive"" to someone who hasn't seen it? On the surface level, ""Mulholland Drive"" is a pseudo-psychedelic noir film with romantic undertones and a few shocking twists and turns. But below the surface, which is where director David Lynch really excels, this film is an existential journey into the metaphysical, one that examines the human condition. This film comments on love, loss, betrayal, and death, and it does so in a way that only director David Lynch could do. Our journey through Hollywood to find answers starts out as a dream and quickly turns into a nightmare, one that forces the viewer to examine him or herself, what they hold dear in this life, and eventually, it puts the viewer face to face with their own mortality.

74,davidmvining,Quite the Rebound,8,25 May 2021,"Rather famously salvaged from a television pilot made for ABC, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive is a delirious and mad descent into depression from two different, mutually exclusive directions. This is kind of the perfect Lynch movie in a way, where the specifics and literal realities are wildly open to questioning, but the central thematic idea, the story, is never in question.I'm fairly certain that it's not just that the first 90 minutes are the original television pilot and everything after that is the footage shot two years later, but it's pretty close. The first 90 minutes feels like a television pilot with the introduction of a whole cast of characters that would have gone on to play large parts in a series. It has the same sort of feel as the pilot to Twin Peaks as a host of characters start at different distances to a central mystery begin their swirling motions that will bring them closer. The center of the mystery is Rita, the brunette in the back of a limo about to be murdered when another car careens into it on Mulholland Drive, knocking her senseless and leaving her without memory as she walks away from the scene. There's Betty, newly arrived in Los Angeles, wide-eyed and ready to start acting while taking up residence in her aunt's apartment. There's Adam, the director nearing the end of pre-production on a new movie being forced into choosing a particular actress to play the lead. There's Robert Forster as the detective in charge of the crash scene. There's Dan Hedaya and Angelo Badalamenti as brother financiers who work for Michael J. Anderson in a suit that makes the little person look like a very odd normal sized person in a glass enclosed room. There's the mysterious Cowboy who talks to Adam. There's the hitman who kills a buddy in his office, steals a book, and ends up having to kill two more people to keep the crime scene convincing. There's Adam's wife who sleeps with the pool guy, and then the large man who shows up at Adam's house looking for Adam only to fight off both the wife and the pool guy.This is a lot to set up, and it doesn't set up like the first sixty percent of a movie. It sets up like a television pilot that will have a minimum of eight more episodes to explore.Through all of this there end up two main storylines. The most prominent is Rita slipping into Betty's aunt's apartment and Betty deciding to help Rita discover who she is while, at the same time, going for some auditions. The other is the bit about Adam needing to bow to mysterious pressure to choose the actress he's never seen in the lead role. Where the original pilot ended, I'm convinced, is when Rita and Betty go to the house of a woman whose name Rita recalls, Diane Selwyn, and discover her forgotten corpse in her apartment bed. The way the scene ends feels like the way some Twin Peaks episodes end with a slow down in footage to a stop, ready for the credits to roll.It becomes all the more obvious that the new material completely takes over after this because suddenly there are bare breasts and cursing.My only problem with the film is that the first 90 minutes sets up so much that never comes to fruition in the final product. I end up focusing in on the hitman in particular, but what is actually in the final hour is amazing. That almost entirely functions as an extension of Betty and Rita's story, and this is where people begin to get lost.Lynch, presented with the opportunity to find some kind of ending to his pilot through the kindness and hard work of his producer but finding that all the sets were destroyed and the props gone, he had to come up with something completely new. So, he took the large canvas of the pilot and narrowed it down to Betty and Rita, and this is where things get really interesting.It's arguable that from the point they discover the body on is a dream, but there's another argument that everything up to that moment was a dream and everything that comes after is reality. Either way works because the movie is about the unreality of dreams, not just those we have asleep but those we have about our lives. In this particular instance, it's tied to the City of Dreams, Los Angeles itself. Whether you move forward or backward, we have our central pair of characters, Betty and Rita (or is that Diane and Camilla?) being confronted with their dreams falling apart. If I were to pick a direction, I'd say the backwards direction is more interesting.With heavy echoes of Ingmar Bergman's Persona where the line between two women blurs, Betty and Rita end up falling in love, going to a club called Club Silencio where they watch people lip synch as the announcer highlights the fake nature of the place, ending with Rebekah Del Rio synching to her own rendition of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"". When they get home they open a mysterious box Betty found in her purse at the club with a mysterious key that Rita has had since the beginning. Upon opening the box, Betty disappears, reappearing in Diane's apartment as Diane herself. This is either jumping forward or backward in time, but what's actually important is that Diane and Camilla (Rita's alternate) are in a relationship that's falling apart. Camilla is finding success as an actress while Diane is really just hanging onto Camilla's coattails. Even Adam, the director, is seducing Camilla willingly and successfully right in front of Diane.That we see Diane's corpse earlier in the film should tell the audience where this ends. The idea is fascinating as it plays out, though. This land of dreams can't come true for everyone. We see the bright glitter of Hollywood at its height with Camilla at her engagement party to Adam and then the forgotten refuse left behind as Diane finds her gun in her bedroom.So which is the dream and which is the reality? Is Betty the dream of Diane before she kills herself? Or is Diane the nightmare of Betty as she confronts the uglier side of Hollywood? There's really no answer because, again, it's not the point. Either forwards or backwards the same idea works. Lynch has consistently made movies about outsiders looking for acceptance their own way, and here he creates a character (either Betty or Diane) who wants acceptance into Hollywood and Rita/Camilla's life only to find that she cannot find a way in. Diane's end is a tragedy that is both the end of her story and the moment of realization for Betty that Hollywood is not the ideal she imagined it to be.This isn't the only meat of the movie, for sure. Betty has a great audition with an actor she's never met, and she's more alive and genuine in that moment than at any other point in the film (as Betty). She's most alive when she's pretending to be someone else, does that mean that she's actually someone else and not Betty? Okay, that kind of question is circular with no real meaning, but there's an interesting implication around a woman who is more genuine when she's someone else. Lynch calls his hoped for approach from audiences as ""feel-think"", and there's not much to dig through intellectually, but it's the sort of thing that feeds the overall idea in an implicit way.Again, as I wrap this up, I have to note that I think this movie would have worked better if Lynch had cleaned up the first hour and a half more. There's too much just hanging around that gets either no payoff whatsoever or single lines in the final hour. The hit man does get hired by Diane to kill Camilla, but the book he stole from the murder in the early part of the film is just there in the scene. The attention given to that wonderful bit of black comedy that opens the hitman in the film seems to come to pretty much nothing by the end. The actress forced on the director is seen in the final scenes, and little else. The Cowboy floats in and out of two scenes. They all feel like they're there to keep them from falling out completely instead of finding vital things for them to do to help advance the overall story. I wanted either a lot more or a bit less from them.That's a relatively small complaint against a film that has so much to chew on. It's a mystery box where the central idea is never in question, so it can engage two completely different sets of audiences who are looking for different things. The more literal minded can argue over the symbols and reality of each scene, but others can just appreciate the collapse of a woman's dreams in a city that David Lynch loves.It may not be one of Lynch's best considering due to the fractured nature of its production (an interesting juxtaposition to the production of Eraserhead), but it's still a meaty, engaging mystery.",Mulholland Drive
75,Spleen,A promisory note for an explanation scarcely worth the effort of looking up,7,10 August 2002,"I was among those whose first reaction was ""What the HELL was that all about?""  But I didn't stop there.  I cheated.  I looked up the answers. Believe me, you don't want to know what I found out; the solution to all the riddles is remarkably dull.  The only reason I couldn't have worked them out by myself, I think, is that I would have found it difficult to stoop so low as to come up with such a banal, catch-all explanation.But for form's sake: beware, spoilers ahead.The key is this: it's more or less all a dream.  Yes, I know: people say that about ""Lost Highway"", too, yet anyone who has seen that movie and seriously thought about it knows they're wrong.  The ""alternate version"" of the protagonist in ""Lost Highway"" is best thought of not as part of a randomly meandering dream, but as something real: a psychic projection of the hero's evil nature, or a doppleganger, or some such.  (My money's on the first option, but whatever.)  The horror in ""Lost Highway"" is that when the hero ""turns into someone else"" he really DOES turn into someone else; but here, the heroine merely ""turns into someone else"", i.e., fantasises about it.  Big deal.Nor is there any interesting explanation as to why these particular events form part of her dream, rather than other events.  This second failing is just as serious as the first.  Even if the vast central section of ""Lost Highway"" WAS all a mere dream, which it wasn't, there's still a cogent reason why any particular part of the dream is the way it is, determined by the parts of the story that AREN'T dreamt.  Not so here.  Why is the cowboy, someone Diane glimpses briefly at a party, such a sinister and powerful figure in the dream?  No reason; he might just as easily not have appeared in the dream at all, and the role he played in the dream might just as easily have been played by some other randomly chosen person, or not played at all by anyone.  Why is the blue box so important?  No reason; it might just as well have been a blue elephant, or a toenail clipper.  What's the significance of the face behind Winkie's who's ""controlling everything""? None; he's just some homeless guy; even in the dream, he's a red herring.Even leaving all this aside it's clear that this is a thin and flat film, a surprisingly bad and badly made work from someone whose previous two efforts (""Lost Highway"" and ""The Straight Story"") had both been superb.  Nothing stands out.  It's as if Lynch is chewing used gum - and the reason for this, I think, is that the movie is all about Hollywood.  ""Lost Highway"" awakened real fears.  ""Mulholland Drive"" is something remote from any interesting human experience or human fantasy, full of actors and directors and agents, whom Lynch (being too close too) can't bring himself to be honest about, and people outside Hollywood can't recognise.  Lynch is a strong enough director to make such material okay, marginally above average, sort of worth watching if you're in a charitable mood, but that's all he can do.",Mulholland Drive
76,Amyth47,Review # 400 : GORGEOUS. DARK. SURREAL. MULHOLLAND DR. IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVOURITES.,10,3 March 2019,"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠Mulholland Dr. is PERFECT Lynch.There is a beauty in the first viewing and an ugliness in the second. There's a LOT open to interpret here and that is the point of the film, according to me - for the viewer to have infinite interpretations simultaneously.So here's what I thought of it.Some of David Lynch's personal favourite movies are Sunset Blvd. (his #1) and Persona. I think the movie explores the fantasies of a young woman trapped by the illusions and grandeur of Hollywood - the glamour, the fame, the magic of the silver screen - she dreams and hopes to become a movie star some day.All of her dreams unfortunately are destroyed because it's a cut-throat world and she can't fulfil her big fantasy so she dreams up an even bigger nightmare to overshadow the fantasy.OR it's a movie within a movie about two women and the end is a wrap-up party.It's a Möbius-Strip and a must-watch for lovers of psychological movies.",Mulholland Drive
77,aimless-46,Reminds Me of Summer Camp,8,22 May 2005,"A summer camp staple during my youth was a story our counselors used to tell at night around the campfire. It involved a guest at a country estate who was woken each night by a disturbance in the courtyard. He rushed to his window just in time to see a spectral presence running from the property and down the road. It took 20-30 minutes to tell the story as the counselor would meticulously detail all six times this occurred even though the particular events were identical. After six nights the guest devised a trap and caught the specter who turned out to be the owner of the estate. Just before dying the owner agreed to explain the how and why of his bizarre activity on the condition that the guest promise to never reveal the secret. The story ended with the explanation that the guest kept his promise and never told anybody the secret. This caused a lot of groaning around the campfire by the first year campers and laughter from those who had heard the story the year before. We felt cheated by the story but had to admire the brazen manner in which we had just been conned. David Lynch took our old campfire story idea and made it into a feature film called ""Mulholland Drive"". For the first 80% of the film he constructs an elaborate and intriguing storyline which has the audience trying to guess the ending, wondering how what he can possibly tie all these disparate elements together into a coherent conclusion. One thing leads to another--but nothing leads anywhere.In the end he cheats and the movie is incomplete because it was not intended to be complete. But like the campfire story we do not really feel cheated because Lynch is absolutely brazen about his cheating, he does not back away from it. Screen writing is a whole lot easier when closure is not a goal.So don't watch this if you require a director who plays fair. But if you like a surreal dream in a highly stylized Hollywood film noir package you should enjoy this thing. I gave it a seven because of the cheating and because of the masterpiece it could have been if Lynch had been able to pull it together in the final 20 minutes. But I bumped it up to an eight because he is so unapologetic about taking the easy way out. If nothing else the first 80% shows that Lynch could make a straight film as good as ""L.A. Confidential"" if he wanted. And it's worth watching just for the audition scene where the singer performs ""Sixteen Reasons"". The scene begins with a tight shot, then backs out to a POV from inside the control booth, then backs out further and reveals the booth is a prop on a sound stage. So we have a live stage performance, that morphs into a recording session, and then morphs into a movie audition. And the movie itself is inside a movie. Are you confused yet? But this fits with the film because Lynch is telling the same story (trying to make it in Hollywood) with two different protagonists. The bubbly, optimistic Betty, with a support network and a good heart. And within Betty is the beat-up, worn-out Diane, who has abandoned all hope of success and become paranoid and vengeful.Perhaps more entertaining than the film itself are those posted comments that claim to have it all figured out. For example: ""once I got the basic meaning of the two segments, it all made sense. ALL OF IT. Every character, every scene, every prop had its purpose and it all made sense as a cohesive whole"". Who is dumber-the person who is totally clueless about the film or the person who wrote that comment?By the way Naomi Watts is so good in this thing that it is scary.",Mulholland Drive
78,ctomvelu1,What's in that box?,6,22 June 2010,"Read Brandt Sponseller's excellent review elsewhere here for some insight into this flawed TV movie. Yes, MULHOLLAND DRIVE was indeed a TV movie that was later expanded for a brief theatrical run. It is surreal to say the least, and as far as I can tell, it is Canadian director David Lynch's acerbic take on Hollywood and the creatures that inhabit it. Naomi Watts stars as a Hollywood-bound miss who goes to stay at an aunt's apartment, only to find a mysterious woman holed up there. The woman has amnesia, and the two try to figure out who's who and what's what. They also have a very nicely done love scene, which is one of the few reasons for seeing this sometimes nutty and disjointed flick. The other big reason for catching it is for the ""Silencio"" sequence,which takes place in a theater at a bizarre hour and where nothing is what it seems. The story, such as it is, is part murder mystery as well as a knock at the vapid Hollywood lifestyle. It is not told in linear fashion, and there's an awful lot of symbolism to mess with your mind. I'd say stick with BLUE VELVET, Lynch's superb reworking of a classic noir plot.",Mulholland Drive
79,JuguAbraham,"Interesting for a viewer who loves solving eye-candy puzzles, without any substantial takeaways",7,24 August 2016,"Interesting script and direction. A film about dreams and lives spiraling out of control. Interesting performances. If you like detective films, psychological studies and films like Memento, The Aura (Argentina), and Inception this would be in that league of intelligent cinema. But is the film uplifting and a gem, in the league of a Tarkovsky, a Zvyagintsev or a Kieslowski? I think not.But Lynch does have a sensitive ear for sound/music and an eye for color. But color coding was best done by Kieslowski (""Three colors"" trilogy).I prefer Malick, any day, to Lynch. Malick goes beyond Lynch's clever and sometimes admirable web of associations. within a person's mind. Malick is interested in forces outside the human mind; Lynch is anchored within the human mind with its dreams as the outermost orbit.",Mulholland Drive
80,lewiskendell,Prepare to go off the deep end...and love every second of the trip.,9,30 July 2010,"""Silencio"".An aspiring actress from out of town (Naomi Watts), a film director suffering from a series of bad luck (Justin Theroux), and a mysterious woman with a purse full of money, amnesia from an accident, and people searching for her (Laura Elena Harring), all intersect in Los Angeles. But something seem odd. Off. Strange. What's going on, and how are these people connected?Naomi Watts is my favorite actress, so there's absolutely no excuse for it to have taken so long for me to see this movie. Especially considering how fantastic Mulholland Drive is, and how great she is in it. From the very beginning, you have no idea what's going on. Strange things occur, and you're left wondering what in the heck is happening and who these people are. But the ambiguity never becomes frustrating. It only serves to make you more and more eager to continue on and see what everything is leading to. I literally said out loud at least three times, ""I have no idea what's going on, but this is awesome."" It's been a while since a movie has caught my attention so strongly from the very beginning and held it to the very end.Despite my adoration for Mulholland Drive, I'm vaguely aware of the fact that some people might find this movie ""too weird"". As I mentioned before, you're given a lot of scenes without the initial context to make sense of them, and I know that can annoy some people. The film is also quite surreal, at times, and while I may have found that scenes like those at the corral and Club Silencio (and really the entire last half-hour) to be incredible, I can (sort of) understand that they may be just flat out odd to some folks. So be warned, this movie is DIFFERENT. And yes, the all-caps really is necessary. If you only like your movies literal and straight-forward, do yourself a favor and choose a different movie.  I don't hand out ratings this high very often, but Mulholland Drive leaves me no choice. It's was so unexpectedly and unconventionally amazing (especially if it's your first David Lynch film, as it was for me), that I have no doubts that it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's startling, mesmerizing, and it'll bend your mind so far that it may never snap back to its original shape. I've seen nothing else like it. I'll admit that I can't help but wonder what the story would have been like without the hard left turn 2/3's of the way through (otherwise you'd be looking at a perfect rating), but this movie is a gem.",Mulholland Drive
81,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,I had a dream about this place.,10,15 January 2008,"Mulholland Drive is, in real life, a very long and meandering, twisting road in California. Mulholland Drive, the film, is a very long and meandering, twisted movie, which has a short but pivotal scene which takes place on the infamous road. A naive girl comes from Canada to stay at her aunt's apartment (hint: where is her aunt? where did she go, and why is she not at her own apartment?) and when she gets there, she finds a brunette in the shower, with complete amnesia, she can't remember anything- except that she was in an accident while going somewhere on Mulholland Drive. She and the mystery girl try to find out who she is and what exactly happened on Mulholland Drive. And where did the mystery girl get the thousands of dollars in cash in her purse? Why are these two guys trying to kill her? And what the hell does this little blue key fit? Along the way, we see two men have a bizarre experience (which is both genuinely creepy and intentionally funny) at a diner called Winkie's. A rather amusingly inept hit-man also figures into things somehow. And a film director named Adam Kesher is being threatened with death unless he casts a certain specific (unknown) actress in the lead of a new movie he's working on. As the Canadian and the amnesiac delve deeper into searching for her identity, the amnesiac starts to mirror the up-and-coming Canadian actress, even dying her hair blonde and cutting it like hers. They have another odd experience at a performance club called Silencio, when it starts to make sense, TO THEM. You, the viewer are still lost in space. But then, two thirds of the way into the movie, just when it starts to make sense to the characters, Lynch pulls the rug out from underneath his audience. In the last third of the film, we see the same actors playing different characters, as the plot lapses into a series of flashbacks, giving us the recent histories on the new characters we've been introduced to, via flashbacks. It is an absolutely brilliant, twisted nightmare, beautifully photographed on the streets of Hollywood and LA, with great acting by all involved. The kind of movie whose meaning is not readily apparent, and is all the more better for it. Watch Mulholland Drive once, IN ITS ENTIRETY, the have a look around the websites at the various different clues and theories about the film's plot and then watch it again. And again. And again. Long but not overlong, it's one of the very rare times when a movie actually seems to get better the more times it is watched, and only then can the viewer start to appreciate its many layered meaning and vague references.",Mulholland Drive
82,philip_vanderveken,It's all an illusion ... Hollywood is!!,10,22 November 2004,"David Lynch doesn't make movies that are easy to understand, they might even not be understood at all by some. It's like watching a modern painting. Every time you watch it, you'll see new things in it. This movie was the pilot of a new TV series like Twin Peaks, too bad that he never got the chance to make it. I'm sure it would have been great, but I guess Hollywood and the audience weren't ready for it yet. Or was it because he criticized Hollywood in it? For those who didn't understand the movie: It's about the people on and behind the scenes of Hollywood. It shows how nobody is who he or she seems to be, how some people's careers and lives are made and others are broken by the studio's bosses, the directors, their co-workers,... In fact it only shows how everything in Hollywood is nothing but an illusion.David Lynch knows how to build and keep the suspense in his movies, keeping you on the edge of your seat. He uses unusual camera angles, he jumps back and forth between scenes and combines it all with good music and sounds. I can only admire him for that and I give this masterpiece a 10/10.",Mulholland Drive
83,begob,This are the girl,10,3 November 2020,"A woman suffering amnesia after a car crash that foiled an attempt on her life is helped by a newly arrived Hollywood ingenue, but the search for her identity becomes strangely entwined with the ingenue's search for stardom.Dammit! Every time I come back to this movie there's a fresh interpretation floating around the internet. I had kinda settled on the notion that we're through the looking glass from the get-go, that Betty and Diane are two aspects of one entity, and that the only thing real in the story is the corpse in the bed. A tragedy of madness unwound in a mashed-up, deluded flash-before-the-eyes at the moment of death.But here comes another one, which effectively states that the linear plot (but not the story) comes to an end the moment the door of apartment 12 is opened to Betty's knock. I like this because it integrates just about every detail, including the apartment switch, which I had never got to grips with. On this interpretation, it's a commonplace, grubby and unhappy coming of age story, but enshrined in a brilliant piece of cinema using two main symbols that represent the Hollywood way. And it's come to this stage, hasn't it - that I'm more concerned not to give spoilers about the interpretation than I am about the movie! You can catch it in a one hour video on youtube by Twin Perfect.Just one more point. Seems to me the editing is progressive, moving from Betty's initial naivety with plain cuts on truncated scenes, to fades in/out of complex interactions and extreme distortion of images.Well, that's it from me. I'll be back in a couple of years after this amazing movie jumps me once more round back of a diner.",Mulholland Drive
84,moviewizguy,Umm...What?,8,26 April 2007,"A bright-eyed young actress travels to Hollywood, only to be ensnared in a dark conspiracy involving a woman who was nearly murdered, and now has amnesia because of a car crash. Eventually, both women are pulled into a psychotic illusion involving a dangerous blue box, a director named Adam Kesher, and the mysterious night club Silencio.Who? What? When? Where? Why? Well, those are the questions you'll ask when it ends. I'm fairly a confused person right now, knowing nothing that I've been through. I'm a simple-minded person, as you can tell so I don't know if this review will help you or not.Although very confusing, this film is a confusing, disturbing, and great film. Why great? It just makes you pay attention throughout the film because you don't know what's going on, hence you will be having a good time in this movie.Yes, and this film is also dark and disturbing. It actually might give me nightmares when I sleep. Oh, well. The acting by Laura Harring and Niomi Watts are very good.You don't want to watch this film because it might get too confusing, just watch it. I used the net to research and finally get some part of it. However, this is a great piece of work.",Mulholland Drive
85,stensson,Lynch as usual which means brilliant,8,9 August 2002,"Usually you don't have to watch many seconds before you realize you're watching a David Lynch movie. His style is obvious, but you don't get tired of it. There are many clues, which doesn't lead anywhere. Many scenes that you in the end don't know why they were there. Lynch gets through with it anyhow as always.Although his actors mostly performs in a very theatrical dreamlike way, it is rather easy to feel sympathy for their characters, although not always of course. These films are not intellectual. The best way of watching them is to be led through the dream and be glad that you don't appear in it.",Mulholland Drive
86,valadas,Interacting with the spectator,7,7 May 2004,"In this movie David Lynch follows the same path that gave us ""Twin Peaks"" or ""Lost Highway"" with the same criss-cross pattern of appearance and reality, dream (sometimes nightmare) and verity, sanity and madness, humour and drama, sentiment and coldness. But the atmosphere in ""Lost Highway"" was much more consistent and dense than here, keeping us all the time stuck to our seats in awe and suspense during the whole projection. This movie although made with talent, shows some weak points and some gaps in the story structure and in the criss-cross combination of several stories and possible clues of the plot. As usual in most of Lynch's movies the plot which requires the spectator's complicity to get to a possible solution that he himself can chose and discover in some kind of interaction. Lynch's talent is also present in the slow camera travellings in which it acts like one more character, accompanied by a terrific and obsessingly oppressive sound track making apparently harmless scenes appearing ominous. This style that consists in telling a story in which the conducting thread loses itself and is here and there broken in episodes that seem to have no relation to it, coming to the extreme of an almost complete rupture like it happens here in the last scenes of the movie, has much to do with the technique of the French school of the ""nouveau roman"" in which each scene has its own value and meaning leaving its interpretation and integration in the global plot to the reader. In short, I think that Lynch doesn't keep in this movie the density of his previous movies but even so it's worth to be seen.",Mulholland Drive
87,tomsview,Road subject to fog,7,10 September 2013,"""Mulholland Dr."" is a journey into David Lynch territory, and the tour does not come with maps. I did not approach this film as a Lynch fan. I'm still not sure if I am one. Fans of his work feel that they are armed with the passport, or at least the code that allows them to interpret his films. However, two and half-hours pass quickly – it's compelling, but frustrating.I gained a better understanding of the story from the Internet. Some critics charge Lynch with cheating his audience and some feel Lynch has opened a new, non-linear approach to cinematic story telling.Another group of reviewers claim that the character and identity exchanges that make the last part of the movie so confusing, are totally accessible to devotees of Lynch's work. However, for the uninitiated or those unable to solve Rubik's Cube in fifteen seconds, ""Mulholland Dr."" is a road shrouded in fog.After an automobile accident, a mysterious woman (Laura Harring) finds refuge in the apartment of a young actress, Betty Elms (Naomi Watts). Calling herself Rita – from a poster of Rita Hayworth on the wall – the woman cannot remember her real name or how she came to be there. The relentlessly upbeat and perky Betty befriends Rita, and sets out to help her find her true identity.Other episodes intersect with the central story: A man in a Winkies' diner tells another about a disturbing dream he has had that took place in the diner. A hit-man is forced to eliminate more and more people while attempting to recover a book of names. Movie director Adam Kesher's life spirals out of control when he resists pressure by Hollywood power brokers to cast a particular actress in his latest movie.Betty and Rita become lovers. Following this unexpected union is a twist that gives new meaning to the word – Betty is revealed as Diana Selwyn, and Rita as her lover Camilla Rhodes.These characters had appeared in other sequences played by different actresses; Diana was the waitress at the Winkies diner, played by Melissa Crider, and Melissa George played Carmilla in another manifestation of Rita's character – surely even Lynch must have been confused. The film attempts an almost impossible task of identity swapping. The discovery of Diana's body by Betty and Rita triggers the change of characters. Betty and Rita are figments of Diane Selwyn's imagination as though viewed in a troubled dream. Diane is suffering a mental breakdown caused by her obsessive, unrequited love for Carmilla who callously discards lovers as she moves on to new ones.There really is no eureka moment when the audience realises that there has been a major shift in focus. It is difficult during a first viewing to work out exactly what happened. Is the audience cheated? Not exactly, but by avoiding anything as conventional as a transition scene, Lynch could be guilty of a certain cynicism towards the audience.Lynch asked much of Naomi Watts and she gave it. So does Laura Harring as Rita / Carmilla. A full-frontal nude scene she performs underwent an interesting change for the DVD. Lynch digitally removed her pubic area from the sequence to stop exploitation on the Internet and in response to her sensitivity about the scene. Does this reveal a controlling side of the man? If he was that concerned, a nightie from the get-go would have been an option.There is much to admire about the film. The way characters are reinterpreted and distorted in Diane's dream to create a new reality is bold cinema – it's the execution that is the problem.At one point in the film, Adam Kesher meets a character called The Cowboy. The Cowboy warns Adam that he will see him one more time if he does good, or he will see him two more times if he does bad.""Mulholland Dr."" is such a bewildering experience that I'm still not sure how many times David Lynch should see The Cowboy.",Mulholland Drive
88,sme_no_densetsu,Bizarre and beautiful,9,17 April 2008,"Before I saw this film I hadn't seen any of David Lynch's work though I was well aware that he is an individualist with a flair for the surreal. This movie was like a breath of fresh air to me. If you're sick of the cookie-cutter films trotted out of Hollywood ad nauseam these days then ""Mulholland Dr."" is the cure.One of the keys to this film is the look. I don't even know how to describe it, so no wonder his films have their own adjective (Lynchian). More often than not the stellar visuals are paired with audio that complements them perfectly. The performance of the Spanish-language version of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" is one such example.The performances are all first-rate, with the two female leads being especially noteworthy. I don't know quite what to make of the plot but, boy, what a ride. This is one I'm definitely going to have to see again in order to sort out the details but, strangely, I enjoyed it immensely even though the latter developments utterly baffled me. That is the strength of the film's dream-like quality; it is so satisfyingly surreal that accurate interpretation is merely an afterthought.If you're the type of viewer that sticks to prosaic box office hits then this movie isn't for you. However, if you're looking for something with a little more depth and verve, this film delivers those in spades.Addendum (November 29, 2008): Upon seeing this film for a second time recently I have to admit that it did not hold up as well as I had hoped. Inevitably, much of the suspense had been drained, which hurt the film's atmosphere. That is a problem for a film that basically requires multiple viewings in order to make any sense out of it. So, I stand by my rating of 9 for the initial viewing but cannot deny that repeated viewings do not hold quite the same appeal. Therefore, my rating for a repeated viewing (should you choose to partake of it) would be an 8.",Mulholland Drive
89,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Mulholland Dr.; what the hell happened here?,10,16 July 2018,"David Lynch is the sort of filmmaker that approaches his movies with no nonsense; everything he puts into them is important and he wants you (the audience) to know that right from the start (with the exception of Dune). Mulholland Dr. has kept people guessing as to what the film is actually about, and what the hell the events on screen actually mean. Is this a dream, the vision of a crazed woman seeking Hollywood glamour and glory, a metaphor on studio executives abusing their power affecting the lives of EVERYONE around them, or could this all be a twisted spiritual sequel to Sunset Boulevard?Whatever you make of Mulholland Dr., there's no disputing that it's a memorably confronting neo-noir classic that's been dissected and assessed ever since it came out in 2001, and it's sure to keep raising questions instead of answering them like a regular movie would. Mulholland Dr. is not a mainstream movie; it's a film that famously transformed a failed television-pilot into a feature film, and this transformation actually benefited the struggling actress story-line that Lynch was going for in the first place. And Mulholland Dr. is a surprisingly strong LGBT movie that deserves to be seen by more of the modern LGBT community.This is a great film noir and an example of Lynch's skill in making celluloid dreams stay with you long after you've seen the movie through to the end. 5/5 stars.",Mulholland Drive

91,capkronos,Typical enigmatic puzzle from Lynch.,10,11 July 2002,"You could probably have a direct link into David Lynch's brain and still not figure out some of his films. That's really part of the fun and appeal--the gestation period that follows when viewers want to explore the options and meanings of what they've just seen. It works for me. I'm a big fan. One thing that stood out to me is the strong anti-Hollywood subtext. Take for instance when Betty (Naomi Watts) first arrives in L.A. as a fresh-faced, bright young thing. She's full of naivity and hope even when the troubled amnesiac ""Rita"" (Laura Harring) shows up at her pad with a scar on her head and a dark secret. The women set out to explore the mystery, develop a trusting bond and become lovers. It may all be a dream. This all changes when the women flip-flop characters and then we get a look at what life in shallow Hollywood can do to a person. Harring's ""Rita"" becomes Camilla, a devious bisexual actress who's taunts her lover Diane (Watts again) by flaunting her infidelities in front of her. The studio setting is painted as creepy and mysterious, yet oddly alluring. The film is full of biting commentary on the Hollywood system which I felt to be the core issue, but what do I know? Only Lynch can know for sure. The strong use of light blue and red all over the place instantly allude to good and evil simultaneously at work within the city. A scary witch-like vagrant pops up from time to time and may be the devil or may just be those cruel, life-crushing, superficial forces at work inside the Hollywood system that have claimed many victims over the years. There's a lot going on in the film, which is great. Movies that make you really think are rare nowadays. I'd also like to say that Naomi Watts is stunning in the dual role that requires her to run the gamut of emotions. Try not to melt during her breathy audition scene and try not to feel the sting of jealousy when she's betrayed by her lover. Wow! Laura Harring and Justin Theroux are also great and I was thrilled to see James Karen in a scene. The music by Angelo Badalamenti is haunting and gorgeous, as is the Del Rio song in Silencio. The photography and editing are also excellent. Don't miss it if you like Lynch or are sick of the brainless crap that dominates Hollywood cinema. Score: 9 out of 10.",Mulholland Drive
92,BrandtSponseller,"Not my favorite Lynch film, but very good and intriguing",8,28 February 2005,"After two brief scenes that at first seem unrelated to the rest of the film, we see a dark-haired, obviously rich beauty in the back of a limousine. Her driver stops at an odd location on Mulholland Drive, which is a twisting, thickly wooded two-lane road full of mansions overlooking Los Angeles. Just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turn around to kill her, two drag racing cars from the opposite direction come crashing into the limo. Only the dark-haired woman survives. She works her way down the ridge to Sunset Boulevard and hides in a vacationing woman's apartment. Shortly after, Betty (Naomi Watts), the vacationing woman's niece, shows up at the apartment and runs into the dark haired woman, who now has amnesia. The bulk of the first part of the film is Betty and the dark haired woman trying to figure out who she is, why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse. This is interspersed with oddly surreal threads about Hollywood producers and directors, with occasional forays into a land of hoodlums and prostitutes.The above may sound a bit complicated and disjointed, but that's not the half of it. The film is constructed so that the meaning will always be open to interpretation. It's basically guaranteed that you will not understand this film and you will not have very much confidence arriving at your own interpretation the first time around. Even if you have a lot of experience with like-minded films--such as Memento (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), The I Inside (2003) and The Butterfly Effect (2004)--you may not understand it on a second viewing, either. The studio was aware of this to the extent that they had director David Lynch write ""10 clues to unlocking this thriller"" and they put it on the back of the chapter listing insert in the DVD. Lynch being of a particular disposition, these clues are almost as cryptic as the film itself. It doesn't help when trying to figure it out in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex. It takes a very long time to figure out what parts are supposed to be ""real"" and there is a complex nesting of flashbacks in some sections, with only contextual clues that they're flashbacks.But is the film worth watching, or worth trying to figure out? That depends on your tastes, obviously. On a surface level, the film is certainly attractive if you are a fan of surrealism, although it will tend to seem a bit slow and overly disjointed to some viewers. But those qualities, and many other surrealist aspects of the film, are typical of Lynch. A prime Lynchian moment is the old couple in the beginning bizarrely smiling almost as if they're alien pod people trying to put on a front. If you're familiar with that style and like it, you'll find much to love here, although in many ways, Mulholland Drive is fairly understated for Lynch. It's also worth noting, for viewers who'll primarily be interested in it or who enjoy it just as much as other aspects, that Mulholland Drive has a quite steamy lesbian scene. It's not gratuitous, although I have no problems with gratuitousness, but is instead an important hinge in the film.Like all of Lynch's films, it's easy to become enraptured in his unique approach to every aspect of filmic art and his attention to detail. Any serious student of film (including ""armchair students""/""cinephiles"") should study Mulholland Drive; many will love it. Lynch doesn't let anything pass unmanipulated. He includes brilliant color schemes (such as the plethora of reds and pinks) with important symbolism. He makes unusual use of sound, such as the ringing telephone carrying over into the section of score that follows it (when Betty first arrives at the airport). He directs his actors to deliver their lines in a plethora of bizarre ways, such as his characteristic odd pauses. He lets his odd and surprising sense of humor poke through, such as the name ""Winkie's"", and the ""Hot Dogs--made for Pinks"" sign that provides a clue to some of the color symbolism.Lynch's attention to detail in production design provides important, subtle clues throughout the film to help one unlock the meaning. It's interesting to note that Lynch even apparently demands that the DVD programming be unusual--there are no chapters on the disc; you must either watch the film in real time or fast forward or rewind to get back to particular points.If the surrealism and veiled meaning of the film are attractive to you, or if you're just fond of ""puzzles"", then Mulholland Drive is well worth watching for that aspect. There is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film, at least on a broad, generalized level. I won't recount the standard interpretation here--it is worth researching, but only after you've seen the film a couple times and have reached your own conclusions. Many articles and monographs have been written on the film and interpretations; there are even websites dedicated to it.For my money, however, although I generally love Lynch and find many things about Mulholland Drive attractive, it is not quite a 10 for me, at least not yet (I have a feeling that my score could still rise on subsequent viewings). To me, though, the ""twist"" aspect of the film is done much better in other works such as The I Inside and The Butterfly Effect. Mulholland Drive is more attractive to me for its surface surrealistic touches, but the plot doesn't carry them as well as some of Lynch's other films.Still, Mulholland Drive is certainly recommended for the right crowd. If you're serious about film and do not mind having to think about what you watch (as if those two would not necessarily coincide), you shouldn't miss this one.",Mulholland Drive
93,lambiepie-2,"David, David, David! Cheers and Bravo!",10,28 November 2002,"I have to be honest. I was a cheerleader for the Mulholland Drive project ever since I went to the advertising upfronts at ABC and didn't see it on the fall schedule. From that moment on, I knew David Lynch had  something special. This surprised me, I actually think it's brilliant and wonderful.David Lynch is an acquired taste for some, including me. I saw ""Eraserhead"" on a VHS at a party in High School and I couldn't ""get it"" to save my life. Then David Lynch did other projects which I couldn't understand for the life of me.

98,mentalcritic,Lynch simply being Lynch,8,22 January 2006,"David Lynch has, in his own funny way, become sort of like a cinematic McDonald's. You know exactly what you are going to get before you order, and in some way, the dishes are all alike in spite of some fundamental differences. In a Lynch film, you know you are going to get a lot of surreal imagery, stories that would make sense if you could take the pieces and rearrange the order, or soundscapes that promote a creeping sense of unease. Sometimes all of the above. But then, Lynch must also have quite a lot of talent as a director, given that he is able to coax decent and genuinely good performances out of two women who used to appear in Please Go Away. Critics of the film have attacked it for being an excuse to show minimally-simulated lesbian sex scenes or making no sense, and I cannot deny that they have some cred in a sense. Without reading an explanation or theory of the plot in advance, Mulholland Dr. tends to make little sense. However, unlike Eraserhead, it does not allow for thousands of theories that may not coincide with what Lynch had in mind.Many scenes in the film are referenced later, or even in advance, and some are repeated from a different perspective. What makes Mulholland Dr. watchable is the theory that it is the story of a young woman's emotional breakdown as her career stumbles into a quick decline. Originally made as a pilot for a TV series, it appears to be a series of reflections on experiences in the director's life. The illusion and perceived glitz of Hollywood is contrasted with its hidden squalor and dirty politics. If one simply sees it in this way, then the film is otherwise just a string of bizarre coincidental images. Lynch has given a series of clues in order to unlock the hidden meaning of the film, but I honestly believe he neither knows nor cares about any hidden message himself. Not that he is deliberately confusing the audience to hide a lack of skill. Rather, he is simply feeding his own legend in order to promote the story. Exactly what the point of scenes such as the Ryan Entertainment meeting is, he would rather we just make up for ourselves. You have to respect a director who is willing to do that.As I mentioned, the film contains performances from two women who appeared in Please Go Away, the television series that has come to symbolise everything I loathe about Australia, its culture, and its people. Naomi Watts is the more prominent of the two, and there is no way one would guess from watching her in this film that she was somehow involved in that utter talent vortex. In a strange way, it is her wide-eyed, innocent portrayal of a woman new to this strange land called Los Angeles that keeps the viewer focused. The real star of the show, however, is Laura Elena Harring, who has no connection whatsoever to the aforementioned soap opera, and it shows. Starting the film as a mousy, frightened woman with no memory of who or what she is, at least half the shocks and revelations of the plot come from her. Justin Theroux provides the rest of the film's heart as the director who simply wants to retain artistic control, but slowly transforms through the film when he is harshly reminded of who has the real power in Hollywood. It has been suggested that this is an autobiographical character based on Lynch's reflections on the production of Dune, which would not surprise me.By far the most puzzling and interesting sequence of the film is the play in the club Silencio. It is worth sitting through this sequence a few times in order to catch everything that Geno Silva says during his monologue. I do not speak Spanish fluently enough to understand how the statements made in the language during the song affect the plot, but it would not surprise me to learn that much of the entire plot is revealed in this sequence. Another memorable scene occurs when a mob heavy comes to the Kesher house, in search of the esteemed director. A lot of people who wanted to punch Billy Ray Cyrus in the face for Achy Breaky Heart will live vicariously through this scene. Many who suffered through the introduction of Lorraine Kesher will also find this scene quite satisfying. I cannot reveal the most satisfying scene in the film, however, as it is basically the end of the film and just left me dumbfounded when I first saw it, as I suspect Lynch intended. Then again, Lynch and dumbfounded often belong in the same sentence where reaction is concerned.Out of ten, I gave Mulholland Dr. an eight. It suffers somewhat from its TV pilot origins, and a few plot threads seem to be left quite loose, but it remains by far Lynch's most accessible and satisfying work, at least from what I have seen. Even if you despise other Lynch films, as Roger Ebert seems to do, you might just find Mulholland Dr. strangely rewarding, as Roger Ebert also seems to do. In fact, Ebert says it best with a quote from his review: ""the less sense it makes, the more we can't stop watching it"". Amen, Roger.",Mulholland Drive
99,bmacv,"The boulevard of broken dreams as Emerald City, with Lynch pulling the levers behind the scrims",9,1 September 2003,"Moviegoers from around the world respond to the names of streets they've never walked or driven down: Hollywood and Vine, Sunset Boulevard, Mulholland Drive - staple locales in films since their beginning. The first clue in David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. (and it's a grab-bag of clues, many if not most of them pointing to ambiguous answers) lies in its title. He uses the abbreviation 'Dr.' to summon up not so much an address as another movie that also used the short form as its title, another fable about Hollywood dreams, dashed or unfulfilled: Sunset Blvd.Several strands of plot are superimposed one upon another, often but not reliably interlocking. The dominant ones concern Laura Elena Harring as 'Rita' (a name she steals from a framed poster for Gilda), who has lost her memory after a car crash during what seems to have been a contract hit on her life, and Naomi Watts as 'Betty,' a wide-eyed kid from small-town Canada come to California to try her luck in The Industry. (Quotation marks around their names indicate that these identities are at best tentative.)A third major plot line belongs to Justin Theroux, a young, hot-shot director who's casting a movie - a piece of nostalgic '50s kitsch (though the jitterbuggers under Mulholland Dr.'s titles suggest the late '40s). His own inclinations are thwarted by what seem to be backers from organized crime, though behind them operates an even more sinister presence, right at the vanishing point where conspiracy thrillers cross over into sci-fi. When Theroux balks, he ends up having a very bad day (all his money electronically vanishes, and he finds his wife in bed with pool-guy Billy Ray Cyrus -- maybe the last time he's been sighted, except in Branson, Missouri).When Watts arrives at the posh garden apartment her traveling aunt lets her borrow, she finds Harring cowering inside. They become friends (and eventually more) who try to solve the mystery of Harring's lost identity. That's not as easy as it sounds, for Lynch is playing a high-stakes truth-and-illusion game, where facts are as slippery and mutable as dreams, or in this case nightmares. (It's a movie that demands, but may not deserve, as much exegesis as Vladimir Nabokov's dazzling conundrum Pale Fire - it lacks that novel's essential rigor.)Watts improbably aces a convenient screen-test and seems about to shoot to the top of the A-list - possibly starring in Theroux's movie. Harring's memory, meanwhile, starts functioning; she thinks she may be 'Diana Selwyn,' living in another courtyard bungalow several notches down the scale of affluence from the one where she's currently snuggling with Watts. Then one night she wakes up babbling in Spanish and decides it's time to find out what a mysterious key in her possession might unlock. The pair dashes off, in the middle of the night, to an underground cabaret in an unseemly part of town.Here Mulholland Dr. strips its gears, reversing abruptly from floodlit glamor and Nancy-Drewish mysteries into the grim reality of dashed hopes and broken dreams, of addiction and despair. What has gone before appears to have been a masochistic, wish-fulfilling reverie - actually, a masturbatory fantasy - on the part of Watts (no longer Betty, she's now the missing Selwyn, jilted by her rising actress/lover Camilla Rhodes - Harring). Other characters shift identities as well: Concierge of the upscale garden-court Ann Miller, replete with spit-curls and garbed in Chinoiserie, turns into the mother of Theroux, who's engaged, to Watts' chagrin, to Harring. And so it goes....David Lynch is a master technician of the movie medium, a shatteringly original talent who leaves little persuasive evidence that he knows entirely what he's doing. These contradictions came to the fore in Twin Peaks, a pinnacle of 'event television.' The two-hour premiere proved unsettling but always engrossing, directed with glacial perfection. But as the series progressed, it grew more and more incoherent - laughable. Lynch never found a way out (the series just ended).Mulholland Dr., too, started as a television project; when that fell through, and was recut into a feature film, he may have been forced to cook up something that could pass for a resolution. Whether he could have come up with a better one with the time that a TV series would have bought him is open to debate. But the one we have is an infuriating tangle of loose ends. (An early scene about a trigger-happy lowlife, for but one instance, seems only to pay homage to Quentin Tarantino and goes nowhere.)Part of the problem lies in Lynch's oneiric approach to the medium: More than any American director, he works along the shifting perspectives of dreams, the loony logic of the unconscious. Yet one man's dreams may be nightmares for the rest of us. Too many themes dredged from Lynch's id recur, uneasily, in movies from Eraserhead on: The heavily draped, windowless rooms; the ogres and grotesques and vermin-like tiny people; the cartoonish characters, like The Cowboy, who all but carry bullhorns blaring 'symbol;' the bizarre theater performances; the queasy descents into black holes that open out into whole new universes. He reverts to these signature tropes when he isn't sure where to go next.And yet, If we're even half-willing, Lynch can really work us over, boring into our skulls and slithering under our skins like nobody else. He shows a wizardly grasp of the doubleness (duplicity?) of things - the horror just under the humdrum, the macabre that's the flip side of the mundane. Nothing is so freighted with the unspeakable as sex (and in his sadistic eroticism Lynch is neck-and-neck with Brian De Palma, whose contemporaneous Femme Fatale was another violent and voluptuous exercise in multiple realities). Mulholland Dr. can be as forbidding yet enticing a fantasy world as the Emerald City, even though we realize that it's an elaborate con-game - that the old humbug Lynch is pushing our buttons, knowingly, gleefully.",Mulholland Drive
100,mattymatt4ever,Very enigmatic,8,3 May 2002,"Now, I'm not a huge David Lynch fan, and I understand it's moderately important to acquire a taste for his films before criticizing them.  I've seen ""Blue Velvet""--an unpleasant film that probably makes sense to Lynch efficianados, but has no appeal to me--and ""Lost Highway""--a dull, overlong piece that's way beyond comprehension.  I sometimes question whether or not Lynch really has talent.  Well, I found ""Mulholland Dr."" to be very intriguing.  After two viewings, it still has me confused.  Nevertheless, it's well-done, extremely well-acted and very interesting.  Yes, it's a strange film.  But if a movie keeps you glued to the screen, anticipating what will happen next, for 2 hours and 30 minutes...obviously it's doing its job.If there's anything I have to say, ""Mulholland Dr."" IS like nothing you'll ever see!  After watching one conventional movie after another, this movie should be a breath of fresh air.  Naomi Watts is an extremely beautiful actress--I'm talking BREATHTAKINGLY gorgeous!--and her nomination for Best Actress in the Golden Globes was very well-deserved.  She is extremely charismatic and has an impeccable charm that is reminiscent of actresses of early cinema.  I'll definitely remember her after this performance.  On the other hand, Laura Harring's performance is uneven.  Though also extremely beautiful, her American accent noticeably drifts from time to time, and her struggling to cover up her foreign accent hinders her performance at times. But I must say, she has a smooookin' bod!  Watch the lesbian love scene and you'll see.  Watts and Harring do have 2 pretty intense sex scenes, but they're both done in good taste.  The scenes seem pretty natural, rather than gratuitous, even though it can only be convincing between 2 women. Face it, you won't see Mel Gibson and Danny Glover get into bed together, one things lead to another and they end up...well, that's disgusting. Anyway, those scenes are pretty hot and though I don't view this is as a softcore porn flick, I was quite stimulated by the sight of 2 beautiful naked women making love.Another fine actor in this well-assembled cast is Justin Thoreoaux, who I've probably seen before but never really acknowledged.  He is also a terrific actor.  And y'all remember one-hit wonder Billy Ray Cyrus?  Mr. Achy Breaky Heart?  Well, he appears in an amusing cameo.  He's not a bad actor, and since his music career obviously didn't pan out maybe he can take a crack at the movie biz.The music is terrific.  Though I don't always think highly of Lynch's work, he always chooses great music for his soundtrack.  Obviously, music plays an integral role in his work.  I love that song Camilla Rhodes sings during the audition.  I still can't get that song out of my head.It's hard to describe elements of the plot without giving too much away. All I will say is it's intriguing and full of mystery and will keep you guessing.  I will say, that was one hell of a curve ball Lynch threw at the end, though.  I still couldn't figure out that twisted ending.  I've heard theories that maybe the whole film is a dream.  It makes quite a bit of sense.  There's a lot of dream-like elements to this story.  But then I stop and ponder...""What was that box for?""  If it's all a dream, what purpose did the box serve?  Even 2 viewings aren't enough for a movie like this.  I'll probably either rent this movie again or buy it and continue watching it over and over again.  It's good to watch a movie in which you uncover different elements in further viewings.  This movie remains a mystery to me, and probably will to everybody else.Still, I felt there were certain pretentions existent.  What was the point of that cowboy?  And did we really have to watch that opera singer sing for a whole 4 minutes or so?  Like most respected directors, Lynch felt he can get away with a few self-indulgences.I will regard this as a unique, unforgettable film, but I cannot regard it as brilliant on those grounds alone.  It still leaves me baffled, and some scenes are too enigmatic for their own good.  But it's intriguing and it's interesting and you will be blown away.  See it for yourself!My score:  8 (out of 10)",Mulholland Drive
101,Fernando-Rodrigues,Hollywood: City of Dreams,9,24 April 2021,"It's Lynch at his best. This one is tricky and entertaining. It has amazing performances and a well-built atmosphere. It's also nostalgic, simply delicious to watch.",Mulholland Drive
102,Andy-296,Lynch's best film,10,14 September 2007,"The first time I saw Mullholland Drive, I was impressed by it, but also more than a little confused, like many viewers, specially in the second part of the movie. After watching it two more times, I believe it is a true masterpiece, with a wonderful clockwork screenplay: many things that look arbitrary in a first viewing, came neatly into place after repeated sightings. The movie is structured in two parts (SPOILERS INCLUDED, don't read if you haven't yet seen it): a real part and a dream part. While the real part comes first chronologically, Lynch shows the dream first. In the ""real"" part, Diane (Naomi Watts) is one of those many girls that arrived in Hollywood from small towns throughout North America dreaming of getting a big break in the silver screen. Unfortunately for her, she is a mediocre actress. In a casting, she meets another actress called Camila (Laura Harring), who gets the main role. They become friends, get to live together, and eventually fall in love. Camila becomes successful in town, and she helps Diane in getting small roles in the movies she stars in. But Camila falls in love with one of her directors, Adam, so she and Diane splits bitterly. Some time later, Camila invites Diane to a party, where she is humiliated by the guests, and becomes silently enraged when Camila and Adam become engaged. In that party, she mets a few individuals (a man with a cowboy hat, Adam's mother) that would later appear in her dreams, in another roles. (Here Lynch deftly understands the logic of dreams, where people one knows usually appear under different names or roles). After the party, Diane hires a hit-man to kill Camila. He tells her that when the job is done, he will drop a blue key under her door. When Diane later finds the key and becomes aware than Camila is dead, she becomes remorseful, and shots herself. As she agonizes between life and death, Diane has a last dream, which is the first part of the movie. In the dream, Diane is the great actress she wishes she has been. As in the real part, she arrives in Hollywood for a movie career, but unlike reality, in the dream she is talented and successful. In her apartment, she founds an amnesic woman (who has the face of Camila). As for Adam, since she hates him for being engaged with Camila, she imagines him in horrible situations, cheated by his wife, being forced by mobsters in making his movies in a way he doesn't like. The cowboy Diane met at the party appears here as scaring Adam into picking another actress for the main role in the movie. The hit-man she hired is presented as impossibly clumsy, perhaps in her secret desire that he didn't do his job well. There are many things more, but I hope you get the idea of the structure present in the movie, and why it is not arbitrary but has its own impeccable logic. This is Lynch's best film, with a superb screenplay, and a nifty understanding of dream logic.",Mulholland Drive
103,gftbiloxi,In The Eye of the Beholder,9,1 April 2005,"I came to MULHOLLAND DRIVE with extreme reluctance. Although I've seen most of Lynch's work, it has been more by accident than by design, and I had no expectation of great interest in the film. For Lynch is an extremely divisive director: you either like his work or you do not, and by and large I fall into the latter category. So I sympathize with those who loathe everything about the film--but at the same time I am surprised by how much I myself admired it.Opening with an attempted murder thwarted by an unexpected car-crash, the film presents us with a beautiful woman (Laura Harring) who stumbles into Los Angeles in shock and suffering from amnesia. Using the name ""Rita,"" she crosses paths with pert and pretty Betty Elms (Naomi Watts), new to the city and in search of a film career. Betty quickly decides to shelter Rita, and the two women begin to search for Rita's true identity.A number of subplots, seemingly random incidents, and bizarre events complicate the basic premise; even so, I think most viewers will be able to buy into the film and find themselves extremely curious about the film's approaching conclusion. But therein lies the rub, for it is exactly at this point that the film suddenly deconstructs and forces you to completely reevaluate everything you've previously seen.A number of recent films, including the extremely popular SIXTH SENSE and THE OTHERS, have used a similar device, a sudden twist that spins your basic perception of the overall story. In both cases, however, these were logical extensions of the basic plot; the device in MULHOLLAND DRIVE, however, is not, and it does not so much spin perception as it completely overturns and then completely reinterprets the entire film up to that point. And there are only two possible reactions: jaw-dropping astonishment or a savage disgust with the whole thing.There have been endless interpretations and analyses of this film, and many people complain that they don't understand it. I may be running against the tide here, but I have to say that you shouldn't try to ""understand"" MULHOLLAND DRIVE; instead, accept it as a journey into an extremely disturbed mind as it plays games with itself. For with this film, Lynch essentially takes us inside madness itself, an insanity that dreams Hollywood dreams grown into monsters of the subconscious.Yes, I do think there is much to admire here in spite of several very obvious flaws--not the least of which is a distinct difference in tone as the film shifts between portions originally planned for television and portions filmed when Lynch realized he could salvage the project as a feature film. But at the same time, admiring is not necessarily liking: MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a very dark place, and for myself one visit was enough.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Mulholland Drive
104,stamper,A film that is like sleeping,7,4 April 2003,"The nice thing about this film is, that you can discuss it for hours with other people who have seen it. That fact however, is also the only thing which is bad about this movie. Since you are never quite sure what you've just seen, you're really not that sure how good the film was. Sure the acting and directing were good, but what was it all about? Well I think there are two approaches to making sense of this film. The first one would be to try and piece the fragments together into a story and the second one would be to accept what you have seen as a fact. What the latter means I will get to in a minute, but I first want to remind you that different directors want to make you feel different things. (possible spoilers ahead) Some want to make you experience laughter, others sadness and yet others want you to experience a dream. You see I do not think that there is a story behind the inconsistencies, I think the whole film was a depiction of a dream. Have you never had a dream, that made no sense, but being weird? Have you never had a dream that was disturbing yet inexplicable? Did the fact that the events didn't really occur make it less thrilling? Did it not leave you dazed and confused? Mulholland Dr. is such a dream. If you've never had one of those dreams before you can now rent one. If you've had such a dream, this is your chance to experience yet another one, which you are not likely to forget as fast as most of your own dreams. (possible spoilers end) For those who want to understand Mulholland Dr., ask David Lynch, for those who like to wonder, continue to do so.

106,Angry_Arguer,Video Voyeur,10,6 May 2004,"David Lynch has comfortably sat on my ""Top 10 Directors"" for the last dozen years or so and for a very good reason.  He insists on twisting our reality into his surreality.  One man's banal TV show or simple joy becomes Lynch's devilish delight.This is your only spoiler warning...Yes, this is the real Best Director of 2001.  We had two of the world's finest craftsmen (Scott, Lynch), two interesting wannabes (Altman, Jackson), and one stew-for-brains.  And who won?  Take a big fat guess.Anyway, enough Academy-bashing, Lynch isn't solely focused on social commentary or visual splendor.  They help, but aren't necessary in his work. No, he's interested in twisting our perspectives.  Hollywood is presented as people with poor dialog and worse logic.  The director character (of course) is the driving force.Complaints often state that this is confusing, but I had no problem deciphering the contents.  It's about parallel & entwined lives, reincarnation, fantasizing, and ""trading spaces.""  I know that doesn't make much sense, but Lynch gets a kick each time we go ""HUH?!""  That's his ulterior motive, not entertaining with cheap tearjerkers like the talentless Howard.We see events not as omniscient beings (like in a DePalma movie), but as voyeurs.  We peer over people's shoulders and shuffle through hallways like a P.I.  Our observations contain what little information the scene wants us to have.  Meanwhile, we have films within films and infusions of greed. That's intelligent work.So this is definitely a well-crafted piece full of Lynch-isms.  I recommend it to writers and fans of 'The Shining.'  Kubrick wanted this for his movie, but his energy and focus was dying.  The music is also competent.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...",Mulholland Drive
107,Rogue-32,The Impossible Dream,9,31 October 2002,"Been into Lynch since Eraserhead, which I saw in an actual theatre many years back and came away positive I'd seen something quite spectacular and original. I've watched it several times on VHS since then, and I've seen all of his subsequent films more than once as well - it seems to be a requirement with them.I've seen Mulholland Dr. 5 times now - once in a theatre in Hollywood the weekend it opened and 4 more times on cable and/or DVD. I'm convinced that the entire first two-thirds of the movie is Diane's dream, from the very beginning, with the jitterbug dancing (Diane won a jitterbug contest, we learn later). She becomes 'Betty' in her dream, juxtaposing her name with the name she saw on the waitress's tag at Winkie's when she was paying the hit-man guy to kill Camilla.Here's what confused me about this concept the first and second times I saw the movie and made me doubt if I was right: generally, in a dream, YOU are in every sequence, or at least your consciousness is there, watching. In this dream, though, Diane is not in all the sequences. This threw me off. But I think I've got it: Diane created the whole thing in her mind as a MOVIE, with other characters besides herself and Camilla.Great performances here, of course, particularly from Naomi Watts, whom I had never seen before. I've made it a point to check out every film she's done since; she is one of the best actors working today, plain and simple. Not sure I'd agree to meet her up on Mulholland Dr., though.",Mulholland Drive
108,mario_c,Lost hopes and dreams in a twisted surreal puzzle,10,28 June 2010,"I won't try to explain this movie, the plot or the characters, because the two most voted reviews here on IMDb do it very well and there're a few more sites on the Internet that also do it. All I can say is that the very first time I watched it, back in 2002, I didn't understand the plot, like anyone else (I suppose!), and I just start realizing it for myself when I watched it again today, passed all these years, for the third time. My conclusions were very close to the reviews mentioned. I just failed in a few details, which have little importance. What matters is that I came very close to the most important subject of the film: It's all about frustration, anger, jealousy, sadness, remorse and lost hopes and dreams all together to end in one single word: suicide! That's what really resumes MULHOLLAND DRIVE! Of course the plot is twisted, allegoric, symbolic and at parts even poetic and dreamful, but it's all part of the very particular and peculiar David Lynch's cinematographic universe. David Lynch's movies are full of symbols, enigmatic characters, and weird scenarios, like it all was just a part of a surreal puzzle. That's what I most love in this director and what makes me say with pride that he's my favorite director! Of all types of cinema! And what I really love about him and his movies is all this iconography and the visual elements and/or characters he creates to represent all the evilness, dirty and perversity that dwells in the Human mind, or to be more generic, in the Human condition In Mulholand Drive, these elements and characters are present, as they were in BLUE VELVET, TWIN PEAKS, or LOST HIGHWAY, some of them change, some of them are the same The enigmatic red curtains or the mysterious little man are two examples often used by Lynch. The ""Cabin of Fire"" in LOST HIGHWAY or the ""Club Silencio"" here on MULHOLLAND DRIVE are two more examples of these Lynchian allegories.The best two scenes in this film to me are precisely the minutes of ""illusion"" both girls pass inside the weird ""Club Silencio"", and the very last scene of the movie when those little old man and woman quickly transform themselves into those creepy monsters of guilt, remorse and despair that lead the main character to commit suicide! That last scene is sinister and weird! And even today when I watched it again, perfectly knowing what would happen, I couldn't avoid this chilling impact! In MULHOLLAND DRIVE I think David Lynch creates something that we can really call a masterpiece, because it has plenty of elements and ideas of his previous movies, as said, but it's all done in such incredible puzzle that turns it very difficult to figure it all out at the very first look.It's a 10/10 of course!",Mulholland Drive

Hiding in a bush she takes the chance to enter the apartment house of a departing stranger.David Lynch is a name that you almost have to pause after saying. He comes with more baggage than Elton John on a short skiing trip! While the man has something having (in my opinion) produced two great movies in The Elephant Man and Wild At Heart - and some others that are not at all bad. However he is in an extended period of disintegration and decay.His direction of Dune (a simple action movie that Lynch treated like it was a talk piece!) made his name in to an industry joke. Careers have been ended for less. Naturally he blamed others!I am a believer that the audience should have half a chance of understanding what is going on. At least things should be explained (hinted at even!) later. Lynch doesn't. I am not saying all cinema has to be linear, indeed many great movies are from that, but we deserve our chance because it is our money he wants (and don't tell him he doesn't because he tells interviewers that he is a staunch capitalist Republican).The story of how this film came from a junked TV series is actually clear from the length of one the actresses hair. It wouldn't grow that much in the course of any movie shoot! TV execs wouldn't pick it up for a reason, the reason being that you have to know what you are buying - how could they be anything other than confused? Only French (the people that think Jerry Lewis is a genius remember!) money saved the day.This world is full of movies and the fact that this is mediocre isn't anything unusual. The tragedy is that this could have been a classic with more control and better editing. The opening is really quite excellent and I hoped that Lynch had learnt his lesson and could keep it going, but no, he gets bored with it and starts his weirdness for the sake of weirdness trip. It isn't even original weirdness just bits culled from previous products.As we reach the end Lynch has decided that we don't even have to see what is going on and the soundtrack goes muddy at some points too. These things would be considered amateurish in other people's products, but skimmed over in the minds of many friendly critics. Before I try and solve a puzzle I have to believe that the puzzle is worth solving. This movie that isn't worth solving because no matter how much work you put in, I am sure I would find parts left over. There is no answer only theories.I am sad that the chance of a great movie has been wasted rather like a man stranded on a dessert island that has chopped up a boat to make a raft out of it.

111,ofpsmith,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.",9,10 June 2019,"David Lynch has an interesting relationship with Hollywood, to say the least. Its clear that he has the utmost respect for classic Hollywood but holds little of this reverence for the Hollywood of today. Its no surprise, therefore, that one of his favorite movies of all time in Billy Wilder's 1950 masterpiece Sunset Boulevard (both this film and that one are, of course, named after roads in Los Angeles.) Betty Elms (Noami Watts) is an aspiring actress who moves to Los Angeles to become a movie star. A basic story so far, though Betty has more than one leg up over the actresses, nannies, clerks, and other girls in the same city with the same dream. Her aunt Ruth (Maya Bond) has more than one amenity for her use, including her old Spanish villa style apartment. Things get serious though when an unnamed dark haired sole survivor of a car accident (Laura Harring) arrives in Betty's new apartment, completely unaware of who she is. Suffering from amnesia, she takes to calling herself Rita after looking at a poster of Rita Hayworth's Gilda (1946) on the wall of the kitchen. The two search for who she really is, eventually with Rita suddenly spitting out the name ""Diane Selwyn"" as a possible clue. Concurrently Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) is a film director whose latest production has recently been taken over the (I assume) Mafia who pressure him into casting Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George) in the lead role, despite his reluctance. Frustrated by this hostile takeover his production, he takes his anger out on their limousine before driving home to the Stahl house to discover that his wife is having an affair. Taking his anger out on both of them he returns to downtown Los Angeles and stays in what is possibly the sketchiest hotel I've ever seen before being told that his credit card has been canceled. By the second half of the film everything is revealed to be either a dream or an extremely distorted memory had by the real Diane Selwyn (Watts), the real version of who Betty is. Depressed and washed up, Diane is clearly a failed actress, a possible conclusion for Betty. Rita is revealed to be the real Camilla Rhodes, once a partner of Diane who has now largely discarded her for opulence and fame in the Home of the Movies. The film's genius juxtaposing of the good and bad of Hollywood really comes out into play in the two main episodes. The first is clearly a homage to the classic image and the second is what it is/was like in the early 2000s. For example we get glimpses of Betty's aunt's Spanish villa apartment (which are particularly numerous in that part of the town) as well as the apartment complex inhabited by the real Diane proves to show us the point. Mulholland Drive, much like its spiritual predecessor Sunset Boulevard, is the perfect image of Hollywood, for all of its ups and downs.",Mulholland Drive
112,vostf,Magnificent directing but a Lynch-hokum ending,7,24 November 2001,"It's not so easy to get in the film. You have the time to make the most of the frames, the actresses... the directing to put it in a nutshell. Lynch builds several parallel stories round the main one and it pays off as several very good scenes: a funny one (the two guys discussing in the office or how to commit a clean murder), a very good one about acting (my personal favorite) and a very hot one (for that one I would perhaps forgive Lynch for all the mess he adds near the end).Unfortunately when you feel you like the story (that is when Lynch develops the main story without digression) it's blown by what I call Lynch-hokum. Something those who won't go back and watch Eraserhead are sure to dislike. It's like a mess in some very perturbed artist's brain. Something that doesn't interest me until it makes a masterpiece.For Mulholland Drive to be a masterpiece it would have to change for a less heavy-elliptic ending. As for me I don't care to be among those fans of Lynch who can't explain you this ending but just repeat he is a genius with popping eyes. If what Lynch wants to tell in the movie is too complex, well he can take more time or find some writer to finish a story he doesn't know how it shall come to an end.Overall a disappointment (as a full-fledged movie experience not as a Lynch movie - Eraserhead is very really much more annoying) on account of the last 20 minutes.",Mulholland Drive
113,RJBurke1942,"Where it's the death of dreams, or just a nightmare before death?",9,26 July 2006,"This is a thriller that grabs you from the first scene to the last. For this review, I won't discuss much of the plot; better you watch the whole movie and enjoy the trip. Instead, I will outline the underpinnings of the story and provide a resolution  at least, how I see it.If you haven't seen the movie, then you may not want to read any further.The difficulty with the film, according to the many reviews here (and elsewhere), is the structure, with its many plot twists and turns. For those who know Lynch's style, however, you're well prepared for his convolutions, the out-of-sync narrative, the creepy camera work through darkened corridors, the odd-ball characters, the seemingly impossible situations and symbols...Although, being prepared doesn't necessarily mean ultimate comprehension: Lynch, after all, doesn't go out of his way to help anybody unravel any of his thrillers, particularly the one prior, Lost Highway (1997) and, most recently, Inland Empire (2006).Mulholland Drive sits between those two, being yet another exploration of how the mind works  or how Lynch (and others) thinks it works  under the most extreme conditions. Again, based upon the reviews here (and elsewhere), there are many differing opinions  just as there are always many interpretations about any work of art. I think it's likely, however, that every artist has a personal interpretation about his/her own piece of work i.e. the one that is true. Recall that Lynch is on record as saying (I paraphrase here) that his films are examples of art in motion. Hence others will no doubt see the truth of this film differently.Let me briefly discuss the apparent story first. As a longtime observer of Hollywood, Lynch takes a simple premise: what can happen to a young, bright, intelligent girl aching to be a star? That's been done so many times before, it's almost banal: Morning Glory (1933), Stage Door (1937), A Star is Born (1937 and many remakes), All About Eve (1950), Frances (1982), and so on.Lynch, in his inimitable fashion, turns that premise into a nightmarish vision of seedy power plays between producers, directors and actors, coupled with a gut-wrenching mystery concerning a young woman, suffering from amnesia resulting from a severe auto collision. She has a bag full of money and a couple of hit men after her. She stumbles from the accident and hides in the apartment of a young and hopeful actor. After hearing the amnesiac's story, the actor joins forces with the hapless woman and the intrepid two set out together to solve the mystery of the money and the hit men.Now, as a story, it works, despite the confusing plot line: it's tense, exciting, mysterious, threatening, sexy, violent, ironic, funny  in fact, all those things we all come to expect in thrillers. It's the sort of stuff (the stuff of dreams and nightmares) many directors do well: the late Hitchcock, Scorsese, De Palma, Mann, Friedkin and many others have churned out such for years.Lynch, however, always likes to mislead and misdirect the viewer's attention from the real story behind the story. So Mulholland Drive, I suggest, has more in common with at least two other films: Donnie Darko (2001) and Jacob's Ladder (1990)  and, while I think of it, perhaps also with a nod to Heaven Can Wait (1943), where Henry Van Cleeve (Don Ameche) has another stab at indulging his sexual fantasies before he dies.The first two films explored the last jumbled thoughts of the central character during the throes of death, while HCW extended the idea to a comedic second chance, and quite simplistically. As we all know, many say that your life flashes before your eyes at the point of dying. So, I think Lynch took that idea and constructed the Mulholland Drive narrative using the last agonized thoughts of Betty/Diane (Naomi watts) as she tried to justify her murderous nature  just as Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) constructed his fantasy as the 747 engine falls on him, and as Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) gasps his last on the operating table in Vietnam.For me, it's the only solution that makes sense, bringing complete narrative closure. The cast and the acting are, as you would expect, up to the demands placed upon them by Lynch: all in all, a superb production and presentation. The violence and sex are never gratuitous, although some may be repelled by the lesbian sex scenes.As a subtext, Lynch once again implicitly condemns the excesses of the Hollywood system and how it tends to subvert all that is good and fine about the art of film and acting, often resulting in real-life personal tragedy for some participants. But, that's life, more or less, in just about any profession, I reckon. In Hollywood, it's just more visible...Recommended for all fans of thrillers and a must-see, of course, for Lynch fans.",Mulholland Drive
114,Christian_Dimartino,"David Lynch's greatest film, a triumph on everyone's behalf, one of the best films of 2001.",10,15 June 2010,"Director/creator David Lynch is a genius. This is the man who did The Elephant man, Dune(which I never saw but heard it was disgusting), and created Twin Peaks.After years, it took David Lynch to come up with something extraordinary. Something that you'll never see. A force and film like no other.That film is Mulholland Dr. Mulholland Dr. is a movie like no other. It is very intriguing, at time funny, very weird, and very entertaining and very interesting. Though some of the plot elements don't make a lot of sense, no other film director could conjure something like this. Genius like this.Laura Harring plays an actress who is in her limo on Mulholland Dr. when she gets into a car accident. She soon gets amnesia. She meets Betty(played by Naomi Watts), a chipper wannabe actress who tries to help her find out who she is.Meanwhile, Justin Theroux plays a film director who is told that he has to cast a nobody for the leading part in his new film. There is lots of other stuff going on too. People are looking for Harring's character.Well, that is what you think the plot is about. It is kind of, but the real plot doesn't kick in until the last half hour. Nothing and nobody is what it seems as you find out in this film. When I say nobody, I mean it.In the climax, some of the plot elements come together. Some of them don't though and you don't understand some of them either. But you can forgive Lynch, because deep down you know that what he has written is just too smart for us.The performances are good. My favorite is from Justin Theroux(Theroux who wrote Iron man 2 and Tropic thunder). This is such a good film. It's a film that you have to watch over and over and over again, and though you may not get it, it gets more fun as you watch it. The film is also at times erotic. There is a lesbian thing going on between Watts and Harring. Watts is also very good in this film. This is Lynch's best film ,without a doubt. It's his most interesting, his most original, and though it clocks in at about 2 hours and 20 minutes, every minute is engaging. Don't worry about the length. It doesn't matter here. This is an amazing movie. One of the best films of 2001, and the best film in everyone's career.Mulholland Dr.:A+",Mulholland Drive
115,anselmdaniel,A Hazed Look at Hollywood,8,20 June 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Mulholland Drive is directed by David Lynch and stars Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harding. It is the story of a woman named Betty as she helps an amnesiac woman reclaim her identity. In between this main arc are characters dealing with their own problems. After three-fourths of the movie, the plot focuses on a different set of main characters as the circumstances change.Mulholland Drive blurs the line with what the audience expects out of a neo-noir movie. It becomes difficult to follow with images and arcs that appear impossible. One of these is the transition that no longer focuses on Betty and the amnesiac woman. They become different characters. The other supporting characters seemingly remain the same. Audiences have to pay attention in order to understand the story.The overall style of the movie aimed at making the audience feel uncomfortable. The first three-fourths of the movie has Betty easily achieving her goals. In the last fourth of the movie, Naomi Watts' character suffers constantly .It is almost her personal hell she is living as she barely gets through the day. The sub plots of a hitman are humorous and seemingly do not make much sense until the end.The directing of this movie is great. David Lynch's style is perfect for a movie such as this. There is much of this movie that is open to the viewer's interpretation. The acting is also top notch. Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harding are up to the standard of the directing. Even the supporting cast does a great job with their scenes.Mulholland Drive is a difficult movie to enjoy. Its an incredibly niche movie that has almost no action scenes and derives its enjoyment from understanding of the plot. Attempting to understand the movie takes some effort.I highly recommend Mulholland Drive.Grade: A",Mulholland Drive
116,gigan-92,"""I had a dream about this place.""",6,3 December 2011,"Mulholland Drive ( David Lynch, 2001), one of the most ambiguous films to be unleashed upon contemporary audiences, dare one say ""abstract"" even. In an era where simplicity is preferred over mystery and intrigue, the average audience member may find such a film angering in all respects. It resembles the classic noir genre, in so much that the infamous street Sunset Boulevard even appears in the movie as an ominous homage to the Billy Wilder film of the same name. Like that 1950 film, this movie's themes and tone is dark, but nowhere near as formulaic, per say. Classic film noir still relied on a certain pattern of events and character niches; the femme fatale, the unsuspecting victim most often our male protagonist and of course the incorruptible detective figure. This narrative method follows the invisible style, making it generally easy to understand. Mulholland Drive breaks many of these rules without a second glance, clarity being at the very bottom of its intentions if at all. Director David Lynch sets this in motion in a number of ways.The music by Angelo Badalamenti electronic yet menacing, and creates a mood of a near horror-film like aura.One of the most startling traits of Mulholland Drive is its complete disregard for the traditional Hollywood narrative style. Clarity, it ignores in throughout the movie, as new characters and plot lines are constantly introduced, some not followed up on till much later. The unity is leaves one even more bewilderment. Over an hour into the movie one still has no real idea how all these characters are connected, and certain events and objects even mean. The characters themselves are left to the willful imagination of the audience, as the story progresses it giving off the feeling of a mystery combined with pressing psychological puzzles. The goals of the many characters are very obscure, and the threatening world around them is even more mysterious. As for the style of the story telling, many of the house hold techniques are used: such as the foreshadowing when the ominous stranger, Louise Bonner, warns Naomi Watts of impending ""danger"". Closure is practically rhetorical in the film and in the same sense as Donnie Darko (Richard Kelly, 2001) most is left to the viewers to discern.In the same fashion as Sunset Boulevard (Billy Wilder, 1950), one of the focal points of the film appears to be the decadence of Hollywood. The overhead shots of the city are accompanied by surreal, nightmare like music. The top brass of the industry appear inhuman, pompous and over all intimidating. Note the low angle shot of the apparent executive Mr. Roque. We rarely seem, and when we do no other figure is allowed to be in his presence apparently. The portrayal of Hollywood has many homages to the way it was portrayed by Wilder; with the apartments being dirty looking with their drab browns and dirty to look everything. In the daylight scenes, where it can be hard to use low-key lighting without delving into the extreme-gloomy Tim Burton trademark, the cinematographer Peter Deming uses this filthy look to the setting to establish the dark mood. Another particularly hard-hitting aspect would be the loss of innocence. As Naomi Watts rehearses her role with ""Rita"" (Laura Harring), she delivers the dialogue in an overly-loud cliché manner, but in the rehearsal with the studio heads, she becomes a whole another person it seems. The medium shot of the first rehearsal is replaced in the second one with a sensuous medium close-up, and the excellence of her acting there is fueled by pure unrestrained sexuality. Compared to her naïve depiction up until this scene, one would struggle to connect the two scenes.This is just a small taste of the complex mystery world Lynch sets up in his cryptic film. Lighting, setting and the way the characters act still are saying something, but the way the plot moves makes it a struggling endeavor to understand. In all its zaniness, one important theme to grasp is the freedom of artistic tactics in film making. From the dawn of Hollywood to this day the general consensus is that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation. There is no such rule because the clarity of the movie is unrelated to the art of it. The way the film is edited, credit to Mary Sweeney, plays an undeniable role in the film's perplexing beauty and terror to an extent.",Mulholland Drive

118,movieguy1021,Mulholland Drive 8/10,8,5 November 2002,"In the year of the trippy movies, here's one that outdoes Memento. Mulholland Drive is a movie that knows it's weird and forces us to enjoy it and think about it, which it does.Naomi Watts is a bubbly new actress coming to Hollywood to try to make it big named Betty. However, in her aunt's apartment where she's staying, she finds Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Rita doesn't remember anything about herself, so Betty tries to help her. The less you know, the more you'll enjoy it.David Lynch shows us some seemingly unrelated scenes, one about a man killing his friend, another about a monster behind a restaurant. They all come together somehow...but how? I really had no idea, and I still don't. If you sit back and keep your eyes glued to the screen, you'll have a blast.Everything is pretty much straight forward until about 2/3 of the way through, when Rita and Betty...profess their love for each other. Then nothing is sacred and we have no idea what is happening, from a club where everything is recorded to a blue box. That blue box is the bane of my existence...someone please tell me what it's for! I've read some articles about symbolism, scroll down past the review for what I think about this movie.The actors are all good, but not as exceptional as everyone says. Justin Theroux plays a director which seems to be another totally different sideplot until the ending. Mulholland Drive is also quite funny in places, especially when Billy Ray Cyrus comes in.What else to say? Mulholland Drive isn't one you can say a lot about, except it's great, trippy, and worthwhile and something that you'll never forget.Rated R for nudity and homosexual situations.My rating: 8/10
MY TAKE ON THE MOVIE:Obviously, this is going to have SPOILERS, so don't read ahead unless you've seen the movie.BETTY/DIANE: Diane is a real person who came to Hollywood for the same reason Betty came in Diane's dream. When her jitterbug days were over, she worked at Winkie's and her life is now miserable. Her friend and lover Camilla is famous and she's jealous, which is why she's going to have Camilla killed.RITA/CAMILLA: Rita is Betty's lover and friend in Diane's dream, but the roles are sort of reversed. Since Diane is Betty, she wanted to have the spotlight instead of Camilla/Rita. Her dream is what she wanted it to be like.CLUB SILENCIO: When the M.C. says ""it is an illusion"", the best I could think of is that Diane's dream is an illusion. When Rita is mumbling in Spanish, it kind of called her to the club.THE BOX: Hoo boy. The box was a portal between reality and virtual reality (so to speak). When Rita opened the box, the Cowboy work Diane up, a transport between the dream world and the real world. When Diane opens the drawer to get the gun, the box is visible, saying that death and life are two different worlds.THE COWBOY: Um...could it be that the cowboy represented everything that wasn't right in Diane's life? The cowboy made sure that Camilla starred in the movie, and the cowboy woke up Diane, taking her away from her dream that she loved, since it is everything she wanted.There you have it, I think. Of course these aren't what everybody thinks, so post your thoughts on the message board.",Mulholland Drive
119,jlthornb51,Mystifying Masterpiece,9,2 June 2015,"Stunning visually and emotionally, this is this auteur's incredible saga of an innocent girl in Hollywood pursuing dreams and finding herself in a nightmare. Filled with fascinating cinematic touches and innumerable stylistically mesmerizing film moments that are simply too many to count. Often its all overwhelming in its twisting of reality and bizarre side trips. It is nothing less than a pure celebration of the personal film maker and illustrates what motion picture art is capable of when an artist is given leave to fulfill his vision. Director Lynch can be self-indulgent at times but that's not the case here. Haunting imagery and individual screen moments will stay with the audience all their lives because they are so powerful. Just to pick one is when the two young women protagonists visit an all night Los Angeles theater and Spanish singer Rebekah Del Rio performs a spine chilling rendition of Roy Orbison's ""Crying."" It's one of the most strangely moving scenes ever filmed and will bring tears to the eyes of anyone with a soul. A disturbing, beautiful film that is flawed yet sublime, it is what's sometimes called a ""chipped masterpiece.""",Mulholland Drive
120,WriterDave,The Pinnacle of a Career of a Genius,10,21 December 2001,"Mulholland Drive-10/10-What can be said about a film that is arguably the crowning achievement of the career of a genius? What is so amazing about this puzzle box of a movie is how easily it can be explained. The wicked kicker is how many possible viable explanations there may be. Like Memento you may lose sleep over it, and it had me and the three people I saw it with arguing the entire thirty minute ride home from the theater over just what exactly it all meant. As a true testament to its power, we all wanted to see it again immediately for closer inspection of finer plot points, which may make our break our compeating theories. If you are a die-hard Lynch fan and need a gauger of just where this one falls in his opus, it is by far his greatest puzzle-box movie easily surpassing Lost Highway, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, and Wild at Heart. This may be his zenith, and overall it makes his top three best films period, hovering right there with Blue Velvet and The Elephant Man.Essentially, this film is a meditation on the power of movies and the ever foggier blurring of reality and fantasy. What could be erroneously misconstrued as a hate letter to Hollywood and a brutal critique is actually an unflinching and romantic testament to Hollywood's raw power and ability to change how we view our lives. Lynch summed it up best when he said, 'This is a love story in the city of dreams.'*WARNING: POTENTIAL SPOILERS* Now here's where the average viewer is going to need some help. This movie is both figuratively and literally a psychoanalyst's dream. But one does not need to be an expert in Freudian psychology and dream analysis to figure it all out. I shall give two hints, or rather two things to keep in mind. Part of this film is dream, there are clues everywhere, but what parts actually are dream and what parts are reality is fodder for an endless debate. Secondly, you should be trying to identify certain characters as manifestations of the tri-component personality theory (1. The Id-our inner desires, our uncontrollable animal instincts. 2. The Ego-that which tried to control and keep things balanced and in harmony. 3. The super-ego-that which we imagine is actually controlling our actions, the 'dark force' we think is behind everything.)The stars are truly compelling, and David Lynch has become the master of emoting feelings out of facial expressions and silent interludes. Naomi Watts is clearly a great talent who is deliberately acting bad (unlike Patricia Arquette in Lost Highway, a bad actress deliberately acting bad). She looks like Tea Leoni's spunky kid sister with a dark secret. Laura Elena Harring looks like Catherine Zeta-Jones' Hispanic cousin, and although not as compelling as Isabella Rosallini in Blue Velvet, is still able to keep your attention and sympathies even through the most horrid of scenes.In the end you will have laughed, gasped, been shocked, been appalled, been completely mesmerized by scenes of beauty and scenes of horror, and ultimately fallen in love with whatever driving force is behind this film and hate David Lynch for confusing you all the same.I can not recommend this movie any more highly. It is David Lynch doing what David Lynch does best, and that's all we can ever ask for from such a talent.",Mulholland Drive

He makes you smell the film as a kind of experience that every viewer experiences in his own way.

One of the best films of the 21st century.",Mulholland Drive
122,asda-man,entiendes? ¡No!,10,2 February 2013,"A lot of people say that 'Rosebud' is the greatest mystery from Hollywood, but actually I think that Mulholland Drive is. I've never experienced anything quite like it. Its plot is slow-moving and sometimes feels unconnected to anything, yet it's too engrossing to look away. Mulholland Drive is one of the most intriguing films I've ever had the pleasure to watch and it's one that demands viewing multiple times. It's that type of film where you think that everything will be explained to you at the end (like The Skin I Live In) however, being a David Lynch film, this doesn't happen and the film is all the better for it.Once the film had finished I hadn't a clue what I'd just watched, yet I couldn't wait to get onto that wonderful thing called Google and find the answers! The ten clues in the DVD also did not help one bit! It forces you to analyse everything and makes you realise what an astonishingly clever many David Lynch is. Every scene has a purpose, it just requires strong thought which is why a lot of people would instantly disregard this film as meaningless rubbish. However, if you dig deeper you may find yourself in awe at one of the most intricate plots ever established.I loved the whole metaphor for the Hollywood dream being a lie. Words can't describe how clever this film is. Any film that has a whole website dedicated to a whole range of crack-pot explanations is surely a masterpiece, and I truly believe that Mulholland Drive is. It stops becoming a film and turns into art. An extremely interesting and involving art-piece that I found myself being sucked into. The mystery is just captivating, with various scenes that seem like they've just been shoved in like the hit-man scene (which is hilarious) yet you can't stop watching it! It's very difficult to put into words.Reading various explanations only makes me appreciate this film more, and the amount of thought and care that has gone into it. Naomi Watts puts on a brilliant performance and I found myself completely captivated by her story. There are scenes that seem to go on for such a long time, such as the remarkable audition scene, however it's scenes like this which give Mulholland Drive such a dream-like atmosphere and pulls you into the story even deeper. The club Silencio goes on for an awful long time, yet I wasn't bored, just astonished at the film's atmosphere. There's something about it.Of course the film is fabulously directed and I can see myself becoming more of a fan of David Lynch now that I've seen the brilliant Elephant Man and the good but flawed Wild at Heart. He's certainly very unique and this film is unlike any other I've seen before. It's a film that will make you perplexed but also gripped. At a hefty two and a half hours long I was never bored and just wanted to see it all again! Mulholland Drive really is a masterpiece that will get your mind boggling like a boggle champ. It's incredibly haunting with bizarre imagery that is sure to always find a place wedged in your mind. It's one of those films that stays with you, and you don't really want it to leave either.",Mulholland Drive
123,oOoBarracuda,Mulholland Dr.,10,30 May 2017,"No piece of art has ever had as profound an impact on my life than Mulholland Dr. I say, in a very literal way, that Mulholland Dr. changed my life.I had never looked at cinema as an art form before, I actually had hardly looked at cinema before. I grew up in a single parent home with a childhood filled with independence and responsibility. Needless to say, there was no time for films or television. I was that person on the other side of mouth open stares hearing ""how have you never seen (insert film name here)"" I don't begrudge my childhood, I read a lot and enjoyed time with my friends, started working at a young age and never through about movies much. I was always out of the pop culture loop all the way through high school. I worked more than full-time in politics before college which led me to start my undergraduate work when I was 20. I took enough credits to need a signature from an academic adviser and in all the hustle of meetings and trying to gain approval for taking on so many hours I had forgotten even signing up for what I thought the most inconsequential class would be: Introduction to Film Studies. Mulholland Dr., which many consider David Lynch's masterpiece, is even gaining traction as one of the best films ever made. Released in 2001, Mulholland Dr. stars Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, and Justin Theroux. The film follows a woman after a car accident leaves her amnesiac with her only lifeline being a naive woman who just moved to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams of being an actress after winning a dance contest in her hometown. The longer the two women are together the more they discover more about the murder attempt against the amnesiac woman who has taken to calling herself Rita (Laura Harring) Her naive friend Betty (Naomi Watts) looks at the whole ordeal as an adventure despite the fact that Rita's life hangs in the balance. Rita is even willing to put her acting dreams aside to attend to Rita and engage in some amateur sleuthing. From my first viewing, I have never cared whether or not I understood what was going on in Mulholland Dr., nor did I ever look at the plot as a puzzle that needed to be pieced together. I enjoy what David Lynch does with his art and am pleased to simply experience his output. Of course, at this point in my life, I have whizzed through Lynch's entire filmography multiple times, and even through Mulholland Dr. isn't my favorite Lynch film, I have no problem admitting that it is probably his masterpiece. Lynch was on another level. Every aspect, each scene is perfect visual mastery. The one place that I find the most resistance to the perfection of the film are the people who claim that the opening scene is ""weird for the sake of being weird"" and unnecessary to the film. I wholeheartedly disagree with that assessment. The scene shows an insight into just how naive Betty was because we see her seem to truly believe that winning this dance contest was going to open doors in Hollywood for her. One of my favorite aspects of David Lynch's work is the fact that throughout his entire filmography you can see a similar thread running through each of his features yet he is not that director that is trying to recreate any of his previous films. I appreciate the newness of each of Lynch's films yet the familiarity of what I love about his work. I can't think of a more introspective filmmaker more capable of exploring an individual's failings in life and how it could have played out differently had career aspirations been realized better than David Lynch. The way in which he displays repressed fears and mixes past and present, proving part of our memories to be false is not only an exceptional example of filmmaking but an exceptional example of artistry. It's incredible, on paper, nothing about Mulholland Dr. seems as if it will make sense, yet the complete product is perfect. The seamless way Lynch transitions between two realizations of a life is incredible. David Lynch is my all-time favorite filmmaker, yet, I find that I must be in the proper mindset to enjoy many of his films. Mulholland Dr., however, while it is not my favorite Lynch film, is one that I can watch anytime and will always be all-in on. Fun fact: my personal favorite tracking shot in cinema history is tucked inside Mulholland Dr., the shot into Club Silencio is just beautiful. The whole film is incredible, and I firmly believe it is one of the best films of all-time. I don't know what my life would be like if I hadn't accidentally ended up in a film class on a semester when a Lynch film was being screened. I became a cinephile because of Mulholland Dr. and I couldn't be more thankful to Lynch and his art for inspiring that change in my existence. I am so thankful to David Lynch for Mulholland Dr., more thankful to David Lynch for Eraserhead, and the most thankful to David Lynch for bringing cinema alive to my eyes and heart.I never did take that Shakespeare course, but I did take three more film studies courses. Thank you David Lynch.",Mulholland Drive
124,Rickting,Maddeningly brilliant,10,11 March 2016,"I loved Mulholland Drive. Simultaneously, I kind of hated it if that makes any sense at all, which it probably doesn't. Like this movie. MD is made up of loads of random and seemingly irrelevant scenes with one rug pull after another, but the core storyline involves an aspiring actress trying to help an amnesiac find the answers behind the car crash that gave her amnesia. An art-house, surrealist movie, this only becomes more and more confusing as it goes along and trying to work out what on earth it's about is like trying to do an advanced physics exam while riding a roller-coaster while listening to heavy metal. Yet it's fantastic. It truly is. It's one of the best movies of the 2000s. The performances are superb, the direction is excellent, the screenplay is ingeniously constructed and best of all, it's not all meaningless, flat surrealism. There is a compelling narrative and emotional centre here. On a thematic level, this movie is fascinating and only becomes more intriguing- and thus more maddening- as it goes along. This is the first film by David Lynch I've watched, but with only one film he's proved that he has unnatural ability to bring avant-garde surrealism into the mainstream and make it less an exercise in unique style and more as a fascinating way of exploring powerful story lines and themes, and blurring the line between dreams and reality. I now want to see the rest of his filmography. This will annoy a lot of people and it certainly annoyed me, but it's a fantastically done movie and left me reflecting on it for days. Therefore, I have no choice but to give it my highest ranking.10/10",Mulholland Drive

Mullholand Drive on the other hand seemed to follow a trajectory of a complex plot until the last half hour or so when it just twisted in on itself and began to make absolutely no sense that I could discern.

126,dragokin,who needs movies that need explaining?,5,3 March 2013,"Mulholland Drive is a turning-point of David Lynch's work. My impression is that it is the last movie in which he cared about the contents. The narrative is non-linear, but at least there is a story, not abstract muddling as in Inland Empire, for example.The surrealism of Mulholland Drive has been it's main attraction and the biggest issue at the same time. The characters change appearance, bodies and even come back from the dead. But after a while this seems to be thinly veiled lack of story development.David Lynch has refused to comment on the movie's meaning. This might have been a sign that there were symbols to be deciphered. On the other hand it might have meant that there was no meaning behind Mulholland Drive.In any case, this movie will be remembered in the history of cinema, so it is up to the viewers to determine what it intended to say.",Mulholland Drive

And just Laura Hurring and Justin Theroux did a good job, all the others where pretty not so good in acting, they were unnatural, I'm sorry.Soundtrack: there is not so much during the movie, but those songs that there are are good.Conclusions: since reality is blended with fantasy it's pretty much a mayhem comprehend it all immediately.

129,bregund,Second viewing years later and now I get it,9,12 August 2021,"I saw this film on its release and maybe I was just too young and stupid to understand it, because I thought it was boring back then. It didn't make any sense to me, but I saw it again just recently and it blew my mind, perhaps the perspective of time and life experience finally allowed me to see the film for what it really is. It's still confusing, don't get me wrong, but when I remind myself that Lynch began his career as an artist, seeing his work from that point of view brings much more context to the story. It's like when you go to the museum and stumble across an exhibit, and the art really connects with you, you can see the ideas and concepts presented in ways that make it seem that the artist is speaking to you. I lack the vocabulary to put this film into words, and that's the reason that I wrote this review, to show that yes, the director did communicate with this viewer, even though it took twenty years.EDIT: As I sit here thinking about the film, two of my favorite parts are the most clever visual cues in the film: in the dream sequence, the blue key is a stylized version of a blue key, the kind of key that you might dream about, because no real key looks like that. The second time we see the key, in the real world, it's a normal blue key. This attention to detail is rather fascinating, and both times the key is featured prominently.

130,jordan2240,Not for me,4,15 April 2007,"When I spend 2 1/2 hours watching a movie, I sure as heck would like to have some idea of what it was about. This is not such a movie. I believe this was nothing more than an attempt to disguise lunacy as genius. It's been done before (""Lost in Translation"" anyone). I certainly don't mind having to think about what I'm watching, but give me ""Memento,"" ""Requiem for a Dream,"" ""Irreversible,"" or any of a number of others over this tripe. If anyone watching this had any idea of what was going through Mr. Lynch's mind at the time, then my hat's certainly off to you. On the plus side, as others have mentioned, the performance of Naomi Watts is incredible, and the film might be worth watching for that alone. But I wouldn't bother trying to understand it.

132,chaswe-28402,Homage to Bergman,10,23 July 2020,"A skinny, ordinary girl from Ontario, probably with dull, fat, ugly, boring, crushing parents, wins a jitterbug contest, the highlight of her short life. Her aunt dies and leaves her a real slice of cash, which she takes to Hollywood to bankroll her, she hopes, into the silver screen bigtime. Although she is skinny and ordinary, she has an outsize imagination, and something inside her struggling to get expressed. Unfortunately, she gets used by a luscious bi-sexual actress femme, which sends her reeling. She can't cope with being cut out, falls into a phantastic depression, experiences delusions and hallucinations, hires a hitman, apparently to hit the lost lover, but possibly also to give her a gun, which she uses for something else. This isn't what I saw the first time round, but what I saw the second time round.This is a very sad story, cunningly told. It self-references Lynch's previous work, notably Blue Velvet (the creeping into someone else's apartment --- like in the Raymond Carver story, the lip-synched singing, the tacky fast food joint, etc); as well as many other films, Chinatown, Gilda, The Godfather, even The Big Lebowski (the cowboy, the tacky fast food joint). But the real homage, imvho, is to Bergman's The Silence. The dying lesbian (in Bergman she's got an incestuous thing about her sister), the sexed-up, man-hunting, callous sister, the strange 90% empty theatre, the masturbation, and especially Silencio! There is no real answer, it's all bleak. The blue box seems to represent the film industry. Wasn't there an old British movie called The Magic Box, about the inventor of moving pictures?
However, there seems to be another story mixed up in the first one, which only touches it tangentially. Did Betty also imagine the rough scenes in Adam's house, and the mafia-type control-freaks dictating the casting? Anyway, it's all very entertaining, very surreal, extremely well acted, brilliantly spliced, keeps you guessing (the first time), great stuff, Lynch, keep it up.",Mulholland Drive
133,Angeneer,Brilliant,10,19 September 2005,"In Mulholland Drive, David Lynch produced his best movie to date and one of my favorite movies ever. I like it so much because it's one of those rare cases where every expectation I have when I sit in front of the silver screen is fulfilled. It has a clever plot, which makes you actually think and not switch off your brain, it has fantastic performances, especially from the two female leads, it has great, great music (Llorando a capella is divine!), beautiful photography and expert directing. And most of all, it takes you away from your seat to a 2-hour fantasy trip. Explanations of what is actually going on you can easily find everywhere. However, I'm sure Lynch wants YOU to build the story and not simply digest something that someone else has chewed for you.",Mulholland Drive
134,bsinc,??????????????,5,15 August 2002,"Read the title of my review, you'll get the picture. But not literally, you sure as hell won't get Mulholland Dr. From the reviews I've read nobody has. On one side there's the Lynch fans who swear this is his greatest work, and on the other there's us who think that sometimes movie tickets should handed out for free. Because this movie isn't worth whatever amount you have to pay for a movie ticket, it isn't even a movie come to think of it, it's just this completely unedited, uncut, unshaped piece of celluloid that has no meaning whatsoever. Believe you me, WHATSOEVER. It is one of the most pointless movies ever made. But don't get me wrong, I loved ""Lost highway"", I admired ""Twin Peaks"", etc, because there was a point in there somewhere. After the end credits the audience just wouldn't get up, the same happened when I saw the cube, they were just bedazzled by the movie itself and cursed Lynch. ""How David Lynch didn't get lynched after this one"", proclaimed an utterly upset man behind me. He was absolutely right, as if Lynch did this on purpose, a ""movie"" that has no meaning, no point, no story, no connection between scenes, just to piss of the viewer, but squeazing in a couple of sexy scenes between this really amazing brunette and a goody goody blonde just to satisfy the average male. And that's exactly my point, a pointless movie should be treated with the same attitude",Mulholland Drive
135,romanorum1,A Young Woman's Disintegrated Mind,9,25 September 2013,"To understand this great movie, discount nearly all of its first three- fourths, and maybe more, as most of the earlier scenes after the opening credits are imaginary. This fact is very disconcerting to viewers, who generally like a clear-cut narrative. But when one views a David Lynch film, he/she must be prepared and understand that the director's work is often non-linear and sometimes non-chronological, and symbolic (especially metaphorical). For instance, just after the jitterbug dance, the movie camera focuses on sheets and a blanket, and we hear deep breathing, the significance of deep sleep, a dreamlike state. The first three-quarters: ""The Dream"" (Illusion): The ESCAPE of Brunette ""Camilla Rhodes"" (Laura Harring) from her murderers and her consequent amnesia never happened.  Coco (Ann Miller) is not the Havenhurst apartment manager (explained later).  ""Betty Elms"" does not exist; she is merely Diane Selwyn's alter-ego, possibly a dominant personality.  The Winkie diner scene with the semi-human creature lurking behind an alley is unreal. Could be taken as representative of Diane/Betty's evil persona.  The Hollywood meeting with the hooligan brothers, who insist upon blonde Camilla Rhodes, never happened. It is Betty's excuse for failure, and she hates Adam (Justin Theroux) the director. Lynch is probably castigating Hollywood for its countless sins, like tyrannical moguls (Mr. Roque), despotic directors, and infamous casting couches.  Hatchet-man Joe Messing's rather clumsy murder of three people is escapist Betty's imagination.  ""Rita"" never found ""clean"" cash in her handbag (explained later).  Blonde hooker Laney's scene with Joe as a pimp at Pink's is fantasy, as Betty considers brunette Camilla's promiscuity as helping her career (dreamed as a prostitute).  Adam Kesher, who lives at 6980 Mulholland Drive, is an insufferable director with a cheating wife. Betty detests him and would delight in his misfortunes.  ""Betty"" remembers the waitress' name tag at Winkie's restaurant as ""Diane"" (incorrect, explanation later).  The enormous tough-looking guy (acted by Tony Longo) who barges into Adam's house (inquiring about the damaged limo) is imagined.  Adam Kesher, after evacuating his house, perhaps stayed at the seedy Park Hotel.  Louise Bonner says that ""Someone is in trouble!"" (a premonition, but delusional)  The cowboy is strange, polite, and unreal (flickering light). Obviously speaking in the deadpan way as directed, he convinces Adam to say, ""This is the girl."" Old-fashioned cowboys were Hollywood's good guys, and this one even wears a white hat initially. He represents reality.  The audition with Jimmy Katz (Chad Everett) really happened but not in the manner that Betty desired. Actually she failed.  Blonde Camilla Rhodes screen test: A blonde gets the main part for ""The Sylvia North Story"" (imaginary). The rock 'n' roll songs are of the early 1960s (nostalgia for then teen-aged Lynch?). Betty flees when she spots Adam (his rejection of her).  2590 Sierra Bonita, apt. 17: Partially factual, but the dead woman on the bed isn't Camilla, nor was it found by ""Betty"" or ""Rita.""  The two lesbian sex scenes really did happen between Diane and Camilla, not ""Betty"" and ""Rita"" (explanation later).  Club Silencio, is the page-turner in the movie, when the truth is revealed. The magician says, ""It is an illusion."" Betty shakes uncontrollably because she is awakening from her pleasant fantasy dream to the awful truth. A significant flaw in the first part is Betty's imperfect memory. Betty's true self is exposed when Camilla opens the blue box, revealing that reality has surfaced. The blue key represents the murder. Now the real story as told in the opening setting and as elucidated in the last quarter. The Truth (Lynch pulls the plug and divulges the real characters of earlier scenes):Pretty, wide-eyed but naïve Diane Selwyn (Naomi Watts), who won a jitterbug contest (jitterbug = a popular swing-dance in the 1930s and 1940s, less so in the 1950s), has won a Hollywood audition. Like countless others she dreams of being a great movie star. With the cash inherited from her dead aunt Ruth, she bids goodbye to her (skeptical?) guardians and departs Deep River, Ontario (NW of Ottawa - in other words, from nowhere). But duplicitous La-La land is more often one of nightmares. Disappointingly, she never succeeds, and ekes out a living from small movie roles. Diane, a homosexual, has a relationship with brunette Camilla Rhodes, bisexual and promiscuous. Camilla Rhodes catches the attention of now divorced director Adam Kesher, who wants to marry her, a situation disconcerting to jealous Diane. At the party, we learn that Adam is the son of Coco, who was never the apartment manager. While drinking an espresso (""SOS"" cup), Diane spots a man whom she later imagines as a hooligan (Castigliane means ""punishing liana,"" {vine}; Castigleone would have been a better name as leone = ""lion""). Director Lynch may be castigating Hollywood (or Betty's mind may be stereotyping Italians). The engagement announcement agitates Diane, who is further enraged when Camilla kisses the unnamed blonde (not really Camilla Rhodes). So, in Diane's dream, Camilla becomes ""Rita."" The engagement is the last straw, and at Winkie's, Diane with ""dirty"" cash hires hit-man Joe to murder Camilla. The waitress' name tag reads ""Betty,"" not ""Diane."" Diane, tormented, is going insane; she even fantasizes deceased Camilla's return in her drab apartment. The Cowboy wakes up ""Betty"" (not a corpse) to reality. The semi-human creature, Diane's evil persona, holds the empty blue box (her future). Detectives search for ragged and despondent Diane. Haunted by bizarre images of her mocking guardians, whom she has failed, she reaches for her bedside pistol, aims, and fires.Unlike the fictional Diane, Naomi Watts became a big star, and deservedly so. The film features fine set-pieces and music score.",Mulholland Drive

I found the first hour and a half or so gripping, funny and rather brilliant; the last hour felt some combination of indulgent, bizarrely intense, boring and erotic. If that sounds like a contradiction in terms, then that's the point. It's clearly about dreams, fantasy, making films, watching films and celebrity culture. Or maybe it's none of those, about nothing other than itself. What is certain is the exceptional performance from Naomi Watts.",Mulholland Drive
137,Bogey Man,"Get ready for Mulholland Drive, a drive you won't easily forget",10,30 September 2002,"David Lynch's never finished TV project/pilot turned into this movie, Mulholland Drive (2001) after more money was given by new producer and additional scenes filmed and the whole thing re-edited. I agree with Lynch that it is perhaps better not quite understand everything completely in the mystery, because if so, we lose something inside ourselves even if we don't know it. I won't go into trying to explain what exactly happens in the story and who is after all who, I will write about this piece of cinema and what Lynch has managed to give us this time with the magic of his art; his films are much more than just solving new and complex mysteries.Without spoiling anything, I can only tell that Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring) are the two leads here. Betty is a young and excited girl traveling to Hollywood for hope of the film role of her life as she arrives to her aunt's apartment in the City of Dreams..Or nightmares? Soon after she meets the mysterious Rita unexpectedly in an unexpected place, the latter state of the City seems more valid. More characters are introduced all the time, many think it is gratuitous and just mixing the viewer's mind little more but that's not the case: if the viewer accepts to sit through the film with care and really concentrate on it, it all makes sense and all the happenings and characters are given explanations for their existence and motives, no matter how mysterious they seem, look and are.Of course the two leads are incredible and beautiful as angels again. Lynch loves beauty and purifying and relieving elements in his films, and usually they are in the form of a beautiful and sensitive female. Betty's light on the top of her head in the beginning really tells who is going to be the angel of the show in that side of the reality and consciousness. But what's the strongest element of beauty and stunning atmosphere in the film is the music by Angelo Badalamenti and how the camera goes with the music and sounds already familiar with Badalamenti from the earlier films he's composed for Lynch. It is not hard to shed some tears during these scenes of cinematic magic and sensitivity, and Twin Peaks also is a great example of this. Lynch and Badalamenti really are extraordinary couple giving power to each other's work and effort, and the result is always larger than life and worth the shed tears and moments of total amazement.The cinematographer Peter Deming has shot also films like Lynch's Lost Highway (1997) and more recently From Hell (2001) for the Hughes brothers and their Jack the Ripper adaptation with some gorgeous images and settings in the London in which Hell and terror was on the loose in the form of human being. Deming's work in Mulholland Drive is also extraordinary with the incredible scenes shot at night and especially inside apartment(s). The scene in which Rita and Betty suddenly experience ""something"" which makes them wake at night is among the most outstanding bits of camera work I've ever seen as the ""living darkness"" is completely under control of Lynch and the cinematographer. It is about little things that the whole scene would go into a messy blur and nonsense, but not in this case, because in Lynch's films, darkness and menacingly empty and lightness rooms are important characters even though the film's human characters don't necessarily know it, and most importantly, Lynch controls this darkness and emptiness all the time so there's nothing there which isn't supposed to be there.
Lost Highway has some incredibly shocking and frightening images and segments even though it is not any horror film. Lynch can create menacing and scary images and illusions of things which are not menacing or scary themselves, normal old human beings for example. But in Lynch's world, even the most familiar and safe things may turn into threatening monsters who will haunt you if they are not kept in the darkness and in the other side. Some scenes in Mulholland Drive are also stunningly powerful and scary with the strong usage of soundtrack and other elements which give Lynch's cinema its power. A dead body itself isn't necessarily scary or evil, but if human nature's evil sides have been activated and used, then nothing is safe or trustworthy and definitely not dead and harmless.That is again one theme in the film, or one theme I managed to find after just one theatrical viewing. Mulholland Drive has bad thoughts and deeds by its characters because selfish and bitter human being is weak and grabs a gun. This element of evil is strong, but it is also (occasionally, not all the time) handled with almost surprisingly obvious irony as, for example, one little criminal loser really messes things up at the beginning of the film! That cannot be seen seriously nor it is meant to be; During these scenes, Lynch really wants to smile at himself in the mirror, and also the brief discussion between Robert Forster and other police officer at the beginning isn't the less memorable bit of that irony! Maybe..Mulholland Drive is also a film about sweet love which turns into a series of jealousy and wicked thoughts which lead to wicked deeds. Love can be a beautiful thing, but human nature and world can destroy it and its participants. Even in that situation man should know what ""love"" is as he/she decides how to react to the situation, but in Lynch's world humans can be and are as rotten inside as in real world and thus the nightmare has its roots created. In Lynch's films there are always the characters who seem to be completely good and pure (Betty) so all his characters are not necessarily evil and wicked, not even inside and ""un-actively."" Still the message from his films about humans and our nature comes very clearly visible through those elements of wickedness and evil which are contrasted with the elements of purity, how things fortunately can and could be.Mulholland Drive is another piece of Lynch magic which can be and desires to be seen and experienced several times without losing any of its power and importance as an achievement of cinematic surrealism. This should be seen definitely on big screen but sadly too often after the theatrical run that is not possible, but if in the future the possibility occurs, then I'd warmly recommend to take advantage of it for all those who understand and appreciate Lynch's work, as he, too, did and does his films to be seen in the theatre, because there his soundtrack and imagery achieves their full impact and level of the beyond, which cannot fully be achieved in home on video. Lynch takes us every time to his weird and wonderful (and often very horrific) world which isn't too far away from our safe and familiar place we live in every day. Another 10/10 miracle for David Lynch.",Mulholland Drive
138,charchuk,"Bizarre, puzzling, and very Lynch",10,30 August 2007,"I knew it would be bizarre, baffling, and frustrating going in, and that's exactly what I got. I knew from various reviews that it wasn't straight-forward at all, but I knew that I liked Lynch already, so I was interested in how I would like it. And, like the two Lynch films I've watched before, I'm having trouble pinning a grade down. I also know that this is the most obsessed I've been with a film of this ilk after a first-time watch since Donnie Darko.It's so hard to define why I loved it so much. I suppose because it's a combination of so many bizarre story ideas that I love - surreal realities (Stay, Jacob's Ladder), tangled film noir (L.A. Confidential, Double Indemnity), strange time shifts (Twelve Monkeys, Memento) and fantastic visuals (Eternal Sunshine, Brazil). It's definitely a lot like the aforementioned Donnie Darko, but it's also very different from it. It's a puzzle movie wrapped in a visual feast, and sprinkled with that Lynch touch. It really was quite amazing.At the same time, I felt like I'm missing something. The main interpretation of the film (first 2/3 a dream, last third reality) fits well, but also leaves a lot out. So many strangely placed scenes and colourful characters that come out of nowhere. I mean, Robert Forster is given the 'and' billing but gets only one scene and a few lines. And the two guys at the diner near the beginning? It's just a very weird experience.I have to say, though, that I loved the experience. It's one of those films where you are in awe the first time you watch it; where a blind viewing is key to your enjoyment. I certainly wouldn't have liked it as much if I had known what was going on. Trying to figure it out is the fun of this film, and every other puzzle movie. It may not be enjoyable for some, but I loved it.",Mulholland Drive
139,rooee,Dreamboat,8,25 January 2011,"Star ratings are irrelevant at the best of times, never more so than with a film that can only really be enjoyed by subscribing to its writer-director's modus operandi. After that it's a process of unravelling. On a surface level Mulholland Drive, looking like a Sunset Strip murder melodrama, seems shallow and schlocky. Which is, of course, half the point.A film set in an ostentatious city of extremes, the action shifts from mystery, through horror and farce, to tragedy with unshowy elegance. Lynch's techniques might be bamboozling, but this can be seen as a simple, sad tale of a starstruck loner, Diane (Naomi Watts), spurned by love, and now in love with an impossible dream. What emerges from Lynch's seductive, oneiric aesthetic is a powerful, angry attack on the poisonous hierarchy of celebrity. This is about the obliteration of the individual; the destruction of one woman's sense of self.Diane, as her imagined alter-ego Betty, conjures a dreamworld in which she arrives, starry-eyed, in the City of Angels, and finds a fallen angel: ""Rita"" (Laura Harring), a beauty in the classic Hayworth mould, who has lost her memory after a car accident. In her fantasy, Diane/Betty not only lives a life of intrigue and wealth, but also retains her integrity - both in terms of her acting ability and in the grace she shows toward her secret roommate. In her fantasy, Betty is as strong as the jealousy that sucks the life from Diane. Those she hates - specifically, Rita's director and lover, Adam (Justin Theroux) - are condemned to squalor and emasculation. Betty satisfies Rita sexually. Betty makes Rita whole, and Betty is loved for it.There's dread in droves. A blind woman comes to the door, but she cannot wake Betty. There is a ""monster"" lurking behind Winkie's Diner, which could be the embodiment of Betty's fear. Fairy tale motifs abound: keys to open curiosities, and dangerous red in abundance. But poor Betty is blinded by the stars.Lynch dallies once more with the Moebius strip narrative. Is this what hell looks like - to relive our life on the fragments of memory, shattered like a skull by a self-inflicted bullet? Or is Lynch simply shuffling the narrative pack, portraying these dreadful events as an abstract artist envisions the horror of death, in a way that movies will never quite manage? As the camera explores the catacombs behind the façade of the boulevard like a prowling creature, Lynch's sense of space and light has never been better. We are guests in the grey area between waking and sleep, only to find it's been painted all gaudy. Scenes - such as when Adam is summoned to a ranch to take counsel with a sage cowboy - are seemingly conjured by Betty in the way one recalls a conversation in a dream: rationalised, making purposeful the philosophical, retrospectively plotting a narrative, writing our own film. Perhaps that's the delight of Mulholland Drive: in filling the gaps, we are allowed to make the film our own.",Mulholland Drive

The love story and angle that is revealed is what really drives the film.This may be my favorite Hollywood genre - point of view storytelling.Now the weird characters really will throw you off...

In fact if some of those issues were resolved, I'd rate this a 10.The cowboy? The normal looking man describing his nightmare to his psychiatrist at the diner?

That's what life is like in the world of David Lynch. It's a radiant world of jealousy and fear. Partnered up, in more ways than one, with the lovely Laura Harring, Naomi Watts is among the brightest stars in this gloomy universe. The camera loves her as she climbs through a tiny window come magical plot hole in a two-piece tailored suit that was a tad tight to begin with. It's a moment that, just by itself, outshines many a lesser director's entire work. ""Mulholland Dr."" is rich in such moments, from the priceless diner déja vu and director Adam Kesher's (Justin Theroux) encounter with the mysterious cowboy (Lafayette Montgomery) right down to what must be the most discerning Espresso tasting in motion picture history (featuring a cameo by composer Angelo Badalamenti as coffee-crazy mobster Luigi Castigliani). About two-thirds through a fairly conventional tale of a small-town girl out of her element in big LA, Betty's quest veers onto a final stretch of mystery and madness. Shiny. Sexy. Startling.

While I was watching the film and trying to understand, there was more than one moment where I could imagine Lynch sitting somewhere, watching us and laughing sadistically.But I don't grudge him that pleasure. Lynch has done a great job in thrilling his audience, which is actually not so easy any more. There are unforgettable scenes in `Mulholland Dr.', some of them even funny.But, although this film is almost beyond any possible criticism there is a bit left to criticise about it. If I hadn't known that it is a TV series pilot that was later re-cut as a movie for cinema, I could have guessed. Although I am far from `understanding' the deep meaning of the movie (to manage that, I would have to watch it a second time), I feel that there are somewhat too many unnecessary features, too much short scenes filmed just anyhow. And it's a pity that TV stations refused to produce Lynchs mystery series because as such it would have been absolutely brilliant and I would have watched every single episode. In cinema, `Mulholland Dr.' is also a great experience. But there is that one drop of bitterness that it actually doesn't belong there.",Mulholland Drive

The movie is long, 2 1/2 hours, but the pace builds, keeps you involved and progressively interested. Something his recent films have just failed to do. I have to laugh at the people who wrote negative comments, and would bet they are the same Martians who loved an infantile headache like Moulin Rouge.

It involves a homeless man towards the beginning of the of the movie. The acting is fantastic. Naomi Watts and Laura Harring are great as the leads and everyone else was brilliant as well.

In other words he listens to his instincts and if he thought about his decisions he could figure out why he chose them but he decides not to analyze his art and just go for it. Luckily for us he is a genuine artist and it works. Because of this, everything makes sense because he's allowing his subconscious to come through so everything is honest. He's not contrived and everything comes from the right place.The symbolism doesn't extend far past the movie. Basically the last half an hour is reality and the first two hours are the dream. In short we see the fantasize version first and then we get the explanation.In chronological order: Betty has just put the hit out on her ex-girlfriend who she's very angry with. And while she's sleeping she has a dream fantasized of how she got to this point. Things are exaggerated and she fills in the gaps of certain events based off her limited knowledge and uses only her perception to explain them. She wakes up and her ex has been killed. She has obviously been depressed for a while and she put the hit out in haste, this wasn't who she used to be. As her dream has freshly reminded her of how far she has strayed. The hobo in her dream is the bottom of the bottom. And that's where she is now. The old people that dropped her off are where she started. Her personification of the bottom/evil unleashes her humble beginnings, in her mind/her feelings and overcome with grief and depression of broken dreams, she kills herself.That's it. This is the Hollywood story to the extreme. Why is the Cowboy a cowboy? It's not for whatever reason that all these film analyst say. It's because it's weird, or because he stands out. When she sees him in real life it's during the restaurant scene where she is really mad and wants terrible things to happen to her ex's new boyfriend. And he walks by the Camilla of the dream/two people that not only cause Adam pain but also are connected in the dream because the cowboy directly is connected to her.That's why his story is the way it is. She hates him and wants to put him through hell so she does.Basically the genius of this movie is that the backstory is presented in a way never before seen. It's not as it happened or even from the main characters point of view. Its how they perceived them. Exaggerated by emotions with some fantasizing. I can't think of a movie that does it like this.My mind was blown when I found out this was originally a TV show pilot that they finished after the fact. Everything is so tight and meaningful that I couldn't figure how all of this wasn't thought of at once. It made me question if Lynch was really the genius I thought he was or if this movie was pieced together. Of course I realized that that was crazy.I do wonder how differently this would have played out if it was convinced as a movie first. I'm sure we wouldn't get many of the character intro scenes of the minor characters and all of that. I'm sure it would have been much different.I wonder if they'll make this a TV show one day. It could be interesting",Mulholland Drive
149,gary-444,A Masterpiece,10,11 October 2009,"This film's birth pangs as a failed TV pilot make the end result even more remarkable. Over a year later, Director David Lynch picks up the pieces (literally), shoots new scenes and then produces not only his finest film to date but one of the all - time greats of modern cinema.Detailed analysis, and a fine double disc DVD set with abundant interviews, can be found elsewhere.But for the uninitiated, the story opens with a beautiful woman who staggers away from a car wreck with memory loss and the tale of how her subsequent fortunes intertwine with those of the young woman whose temporary home she stumbles across.Twin female leads,Naomi Watts and Laura Harring offer tour de force performances as beautiful, mysterious, sexy and dangerous women seemingly skitting between reality and a strange, ethereal world which we cannot quite place.Nothing is quite what it seems, clues and false trails abound, ad the viewer is kept guessing till the end, and beyond.A majestic music score,and stunning, lush, beautiful cinematography combines with a literate script and obtuse plot to create atmosphere, excitement and uncertainty.The girl's make-up and dress is invariably immaculate strenghtening the ambiguity of the story line.The irony that a film so removed from Hollywood convention should be set in Hollywood is sweet indeed.A masterpiece which will be appreciated by film students and aficionados for years to come.",Mulholland Drive
150,XxEthanHuntxX,Mulholland Drive,6,13 June 2020,"Here he is again, David Flynch, with is shenanigans. In this one, a bit more understandable but still lets you wonder off without him and requires an open mind. I developed an interesting dreamlike feeling for its wondrous path and illusive images and fierce. The introduction confuses, amuses and frightens to about the same extent. ""Mulholland Drive"" is now a fairly straightforward and engaging story in classic film noir style - albeit with the inevitable Lynch elements scattered a little everywhere. It takes place in Hollywood, and is in many ways about the dream factory. About what life often can be like in movies and how we therefore think it should be in reality.",Mulholland Drive
151,x_manicure_x,A unique experience,10,24 August 2021,"""Mulholland Dr."" is by far the most complete expression of David Lynch's cinema. It has everything that made his films memorable but still manages to be accessible for most viewers (you will need to rewatch a couple of times, but at least we are far from the apparent close-to-nonsense of ""Inland Empire""). A lot of people claim that the last 45 minutes prevented the film from becoming a real masterpiece and made it confusing for the sake of it, but it's quite the opposite. Surely the unsettling and surreal atmosphere that permeates the film is valuable, but those last 45 minutes are the ones that give a real weight and meaning to so many details and lines. They are essential to save the first half from being just a cheesy mystery movie with a unique atmosphere.It has been one of my favorite movies for ages, but it took me over fifteen years to finally relate to the character. I guess I am finally old enough to feel the bitter taste of failure and self-delusion.",Mulholland Drive
152,smakawhat,"This is (for a Lynch film) very straight forward, and one of the best of the year",9,14 October 2001,"For a David Lynch film (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Eraserhead, Twin Peaks TV Series) this is a pretty simple story.  Most people are getting caught up in the 'what the?, and the huh?' factor when in reality it is pretty straight forward.  I will not give the story away due to spoiling the film, only saying that half of the film is a dream sequence [mocking a cliched hollywood story], the rest afterwards takes place kind of in flashbacks explaining everything (an NO it is not difficult to figure out).  The only other thing I can say is that it also portrays the idea of the dark side of Hollywood in the way actors are abused and repeatedly humiliated in the 'business'.  This is without question one of the best films of the year.I can only say that this film had me glued to my seat.  The lead actresses were so perfect and accompanied by a great soundtrack which set the perfect tone.  Lynch goes for a very complete film noir with dark rooms, shadows, even some 40's hairstyles and even the shots outside in the daylight seem mysterious and eerie.  Complemented by Lynch's dark humour, this film also has many funny moments, and some of the most memorable bizarre characters (following up on the Twin Peaks like-ness) I've ever seen on screen.This is definatly the year for film noir since 2 of the best films this year are this one and Memento.  For those who are not 'getting it' it's kind of unfortunate and they are probably reading too much into it particularly the first half.  If you REALLY want to be confused go see Eraserhead (which this movie borrows alot from in style).Great scenes, Great mood, Great look, Great feel, Great casting, Great concept.  I had a blast with this film but others may not due to Lynch's qwerkyness.  Some like it, some don't I myself have never been a huge fan of Lynch, but when I think back to how much I liked Eraserhead, Wild At Heart, The Straight Story, and now this film, I think I will seek him out more often (with the exception of Dune).  One of the best films of the year.Rating 9 out of 10",Mulholland Drive
153,mlraymond,"Sad, strange mystery about heartbreak and loss",9,6 November 2006,"I have read literally dozens of differing views as to what this story is really about, and the significance of various details. Without recapping the plot at length, it tells the apparently simple story of an eager young aspiring actress arriving in Hollywood, hoping to find stardom, and getting drawn into a baffling and eerie mystery. There are many typically odd David Lynch touches and peculiar characters, events ,the meaning of which is unclear, and dialogue that can best be described as unenlightening. SPOILERS AHEAD: The core of the movie is Naomi Watts' character Betty/Diane, and her performance is simply overwhelming. I have seldom been as moved as during two scenes with her lover Rita/Camilla ,played by the stunning Laura Elena Harring. The first is the tender and sensuous love scene ,that shows the desire, hesitation and hope of someone desperately in love with someone who may not fully return that love. The yearning for love and acceptance is tangible in that scene, and is breathtaking in its simple beauty. The other great scene with the two ill fated lovers is their witnessing of the heartrending solo by the female vocalist at the strange nightclub Silencio. As the two women begin to weep at the impassioned song of sorrow and loss, and the realization that their own doomed relationship is at an end, many viewers will find themselves shedding tears as well. It is an overpowering scene of the pain of lost love, and the end of a dream. It's almost too much for the viewer to bear, so much have we come to care about these two women. It's the spooky visuals and strange, unsettling characters that the movie is best known for, but at the very heart of the movie is this theme of love and loss, and that is what gives it its power to hold the audience in its strange spell.",Mulholland Drive
154,jmbwithcats,A Puzzle Without Pieces,8,25 May 2006,"After watching Mulholland Drive I felt I loved it, but I had no idea why.Perhaps because it made me feel better knowing this movie reflected the same confusion I often feel in my own life, grasping at straws for answers, are the straws even real? That gives some comfort.At times I thought I was putting together a puzzle made from the parts of 12 different puzzles. An over use of directing techniques betrays the film's seams, tearing at the plot until all that is left is a convoluted mess. ""We don't stop here..."" I enjoy figuring out a movie for myself, but you have to have enough to go on to put the puzzle together. This montage more than movie, clings to madness like a sensory deprived post apocalyptic sycophant with a tit in their mouth, suckling wide-eyed on the dregs of a vast and empty mother.Naomi Watts was brilliant, and that is what stays with you after the movie is over. Her acting, depth of emotion... who was she? Who was Betty? Who was anyone? Were they even real? Was she? Who was Diane? Who Was Betty? A film of uncovering cosmic futility and the mortal coil, or something else?When the film begins we witness to a scene. A drive down Mulholland at night with a dark haired beautiful woman. She says.. ""we don't stop here."" The car is hit head on by partying teens driving too fast.She survives, and stumbles down into Hollywood bleeding, suffering from amnesia when she meets Naomi Wattses character, or does she?Naomi then reenacts this scene without the car accident, as though they are the same person reliving the same experience, but since the first doesn't know she's dead (amnesia), she becomes the other woman (Watts) to replay it for her?And what of Aunt Ruth? Who kills herself in the end? Were all the women Aunt Ruth playing out different time lines? Reflecting on each other until ultimately despondent, she commits suicide?I really have no idea what this movie is about lol.",Mulholland Drive
155,Dockelektro,One of the most mind-bending movies ever,10,22 August 2002,"SPOILERS AHEADWhat is after all the structure of this movie? It's really not that hard to realize, after a few viewings:Diane Selwyn has came from Deep River, Ontario. She dreamt of becoming a big movie star in the city dreams come true - Hollywood. But the producers never thought too much of her, and she never got the main roles. In one movie, she met Camilla Rhodes, which took the main role she was pursuing, and pitifully casted Diane as a supporting actress. Diane fell in love with Camilla, and they started a relationship. But it's a hard life - Camilla begins a relationship with Adam Kesher, the movie's director. This is too much for Diane, and she hires a killer to assassinate Camilla. She then stays at home and falls asleep. She now dreams she is called Betty Elms and she is starting all over again. Everything is right in this dream world: Betty has a magnificent house all for herself and everybody is nice to her, the director Adam Kesher is having a real bad time, her audition is a success and most of all, the woman that resembles the real-life Camilla, and tries to remember who she was before the accident she had in Mulholland Drive, falls in love with her. But this dream will end. And at the club silencio, the truth will be revealed, and when the blue key opens the blue box, Betty will become Diane again.
At her home, Diane finds the blue key that the killer said he would leave when he finished the job. Therefore, Camilla is dead. This is too much for Diane, which shoots herself. David Lynch has created his greatest masterpiece right here, a wittily edited movie which makes us dive into the realms of our dreams and our minds. The story above is just the starting point to see this movie and analysing all the more obscure aspects once more like the real meaning of the club silencio, the importance of the cowboy, the old lady that appears at Betty's door, and that blue box. David Lynch gave a few useful tips, but the best way to solve this is by means of dialogue with other passionated viewers of the movie. This is a magnificent achievement in aspects, and I must say that after this, Naomi Watts can't pass unnoticed again - she gives one of the best character transformations ever, sometimes you'll wonder if it's really the same person. 10 out of 10, this movie deserves no less. A work of genius.",Mulholland Drive
156,brenttraft,Mulholland Drive's secrets unveiled (SPOILERS),10,27 October 2001,"Unlike most films, Mulholland Drive needs to be interpreted like a novel rather than just watched. To be sure, there are events that take place; but the significance and context of those events are what makes this film mean different things to different people. I will try to explain the three most popular interpretations.1. The easiest and most common interpretation is that the first part of the film is a dream, and the last half hour is reality. Before the opening credits, we see a montage of Betty with the elderly couple, then the jitterbug sequence, then some red bed sheets and pillow. The bed sheets and pillow signify that what we are about to see is a dream. In the dream, Rita gets amnesia after a car crash and she is helped by her friend Betty. Betty is smart, pretty, confident, and a talented actress. In trying to find out Rita's true identity, they fall in love. But then the dream turns to a nightmare as they go to a club called Silencio, where Betty comes into possession of a blue box which Rita has the key that opens it. When the dream is over, we find out the dreamer is Diane, who played the role of Betty in the dream. Her ex-lover Camilla was Rita in the dream. In this reality, Diane is not successful or confident, but Camilla is the stunning and successful one. Camilla has ended their relationship, so out of jealousy and envy, Diane pays a hit-man to kill her. After the murder, she is overcome with guilt and kills herself.2. In this interpretation, both the women are dead but do not realize it. There have been a couple of movies in the last few years to use this sort of plot device. Diane's dream of the first part of the movie is a dream within a dream. You will notice that all the plot threads start while Rita is sleeping. It is because it is her dream also. The elderly couple with Betty before the opening credits are her companions on her plane trip. They represent spirits of the netherworld. At the end of the movie they take her back. At Silencio, they see a singer die on stage, but they can still hear her voice. This is symbolic of them realizing they are dead but still conscience. The blue box represents the soul. Rita has the key, but she needs Betty in order to get the blue box. Once she opens the blue box, she is transported to where people go when they die. After that, Diane wakes up and thinks she has been dreaming. Virtually all of the last half hour of the movie is either flashback or delusion. Betty's blue box is owned by the evil person behind the coffee shop, placed in a wrinkled paper bag like it was garbage. The guardians of the netherworld chase after Betty. Betty escapes by killing herself. There is a montage at the end where Betty and Rita are together. This could mean that Camilla has forgiven her and they are together in the afterlife.3. The two women are the same person or one is an alter-ego of the other. There have been a couple of films in the past year to use this plot device also. One of the important parts in this interpretation is that Diane is told she will find a blue key when the murder is done. But in the dream it is Rita who has the key and the money. In the first part of the movie, Rita is the dreamer and Betty is the alter-ego. After she wakes up, Diane is real and Camilla is the alter-ego. The alter-ego is always the successful and talented one. The montage at the end where the two women are together signifies that the duel personalities have consolidated.I realize I did not go into a lot of detail to argue for any of these interpretations, but if you watch the film closely, you will find things to support each interpretation. I believe all three are equally valid but I do not know which one David Lynch intended. Not that it matters. If you have seen Mulholland Drive, but did not really understand it, then I encourage you to see it again with these things in mind and pay close attention to the details.",Mulholland Drive
157,mnpollio,Near masterpiece that degenerates into an incoherent mess,5,29 December 2006,"The first two-thirds of this film feature some of the best directing David Lynch has ever done. Aspiring starlet Naomi Watts arrives in Hollywood to stay in her aunt's apartment and discovers amnesiac Lara Elena Harring taking refuge there. In between auditions, Watts assists Harring in getting to the bottom of the accident that left her with amnesia and the identity of the shadowy people pursuing her. Various other subplots encircle the central thread including a perky landlady, a cuckolded director and a police investigation. The film is alternately surreal, darkly humorous and creepy. Watts, in particular, is magnificent in a breakthrough role as the inquisitive starlet. She is incredibly appealing, gutsy and sexy. Unfortunately, the latter third of the film collapses in on itself into an incoherent and ludicrous jumble of death, lesbianism, logic loopholes and loose ends, with Lynch repeating many of the same plot contrivances that he perpetrated in the equally incoherent Lost Highways. It is rare to see such a promising and deftly rendered production take such an immediate and sharp downward spiral. Part of the problem could conceivably be that the film was initially intended as the pilot for a TV series that was not picked up. Lynch then tacked on a crummy non-conclusion filled with gratuitous sex, nudity and violence, which fails to answer any of the mysteries presented in the early passages and nicely sabotages the fine performances.",Mulholland Drive
158,B24,Comment Nr. 1179,1,26 September 2003,"Can you believe that over a thousand comments have already been delivered about this piece of work? That begs the question all over again. What it comes down to is that either this is a stupendous work of art or another one of Lynch's tricks.I tend not to appreciate works of art presented as works of art. They posit logical polarities that have nothing to do with external points of view, relying instead on constant internal self-reference. ""Memento"" comes to mind. Rather like the snake eating it's tail.Puncturing pomposity is not all that difficult, and some of the previous posts have done it admirably. I particularly like the one addressed to us from ""Wellville Colorado."" On the other hand, I sympathize with others who have difficulty seeing through the premise and construct this film, and wonder if there is something wrong with them for not liking it.Come on, just say you don't like it. The bogey man won't get you.",Mulholland Drive
159,Eternality,"Lynch has made cryptic cinema his very own and an art form, and all the better for it.",10,12 July 2010,"Say what you want about David Lynch, but he remains one of the world's most idiosyncratic filmmakers. Love him or hate him, his works could be strange, beautiful, and extreme at the same time. But there is no doubt that Lynch's cinema is one-of-a-kind. It is difficult not to have an opinion after viewing his films. The Oscar-nominated director of The Elephant Man (1980) and Blue Velvet (1986) is rewarded with another Oscar nomination for Best Director for this film, which has since regain a newfound appreciation after frustrating viewers a decade ago.Mulholland Dr. could tie with Blue Velvet as Lynch's magnum opus. Weird, horrific, and most of all, haunting, it is an experience that defies expectations. Written by Lynch himself, Mulholland Dr. could either be the most brilliant film conceived by the most bizarre of human minds, or the most useless, illogical, and downright unfathomable ever.The plot of Mulholland Dr. is not crucial to understanding what the director's vision for the film is (thankfully, as I wouldn't know where to start). Lynch takes two simple concepts of dreams and reality, and draws up a complex relationship between them. He merges them together, then dissects them, then attempts to turn them into each other. And if that is not enough, he confuses us further by not establishing which is which in the first place. When the dust settles (if it does), the question to ask is: Does it all make sense? Does it even suppose to make sense? Curiously, Mulholland Dr. works more effectively as a film when it is left to vagueness and the bewilderment of the viewer. Apparently, it works even better when one is puzzled and comprehends the ""puzzlement"" as key to appreciating Lynch's dark, twisted tale. Even if the film is picked apart and understood with clarity, it still stands firm and strong as a near-perfect piece of storytelling, one that is surprisingly without any discernible loopholes.The performances by the cast are generally excellent. The chemistry between the two lead actresses – Naomi Watts and Laura Harring – is outstanding and provides the film with a strong emotional core. Watts, in particular, makes her acting breakthrough here, with a daring performance that is perhaps only second to her career-best display in Alejandro Inarritu's 21 Grams (2003). There is some controversy over the quite explicit homosexuality portrayed by the two leads. However, under Lynch's assured direction, it becomes integral to the building of character relations in the ""dream"" half of the film, and the instigation of tragedy in the ""reality"" half.The intoxicating music by Angelo Badalamenti adds a sense of the unknown to the film, appearing to come from deep within the mystery that is Mulholland Dr., rather than as an aural accompaniment to its dreamscapes and nightmares. There is a noirish quality to Lynch's film that makes it visually captivating, and atmospherically dense. There is also the feeling that all is not right in Hollywood, where the film is set, and in which it tries to satirize.Even though Lynch gives us a shocking climax that concludes the film powerfully, in essence, it is still incomplete. There is no ending really. In fact, it is a pseudo-ending because Mulholland Dr. works like an endless cycle filled with Lynchian ambiguity and his brand of ""hallucinatory (in)sanity"". Each round brings one deeper into what seems like a bottomless abyss, raising questions on the temporality of reality and dreams, and the ""reality"" of imagination. With Mulholland Dr., Lynch has made cryptic cinema his very own and an art form, and all the better for it. This is the cinematic equivalent of the ultimate Rubik's cube.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",Mulholland Drive

3. The cinematography is fairly simple, especially the first-person camera movements which do wonders in creating tension and suspense.
4. The humour is expertly inserted, funny, as well as not confusing in relation to the overall thriller theme.
5. The lighting does fantastically in adding to the ominous mood, and it provides for some beautiful shots.
6. Both Naomi Watts (Betty/ Diane Selwyn) and Laura Harring (Rita/ Camilla Rhodes) deliver brilliant performances.
7. The twist is revealed masterfully, as well as the seemingly disparate vignettes being brought together, within the last 20 minutes. It's pure mastery from David Lynch (Director).

165,Jacques98,Mulholland Dr.: The Tale of the Blurry Dildo,2,10 September 2009,"Here is the only point I want to get across in this entire review: Watching Mulholland Dr. made me feel like an adult forced to see a children's film.For every 1 parent that takes their toddler to see an adult (aka, violent or sexual) film, there are 10 parents that silently that scream foul. Perhaps, in the social safety of their own home, on their computer, they'll type up a bitter ""Middle-Age Angst Comment"" on their message board of choice. Perhaps, if they're pseudo-intellectual, they'll type of a cute little review of the film and self-publish it on all the websites like the one I'm using right now. Either way, their predictable message is always the same: ""Movies ruin kids' innocence! (Even if I saw A Clockwork Orange when I was 3, and it didn't affect me one bit, they will HURT your children!)"" I'm not here to debate this (unintentionally hilarious) group of parents, but, rather, I want to use their argument to help illustrate my point about Mulholland Dr.Mulholland Dr. made me feel like an adult forced to see a children's film. Instead of destroying my innocence and adding complexity to my thinking (as the loss of innocence always does), I feel like it made me just a little bit dumber.First of all, do not assume I'm one of the thousands of people who didn't understand this film. I got it. I understood it. Before attempting to write this review, I even read official sites and threads dedicated to understanding it, just to make sure I wasn't missing any of the ""brilliance"". I didn't.Like all surrealist films, Mulholland Dr. is childish in concept. At root value, it uses the exact same plot as The Wizard of Oz, but adds some sex to make it seem more ""mature"". The only thing that makes the film hard to understand is the stupid scenes where David Lynch uses cheap camera/storytelling tricks to force confusion. Or, to force weirdness, if you prefer that word.Think of the entire film way. Someone tells you that they hid a dildo in a box, somewhere in the United States. Then they tell you to find it. They give you a couple vague clues hidden in a film, and you're off.Two problems: (1) Why should you even care? It's a dildo. That's exactly how I felt about this film. Why should I even care about these characters? They're just flat characters presented in a way that will eventually shock the viewer with David Lynch's oh-so-horrifying portrayal of a sexual topic that is about as common and accepted in the real word as ""Racism is BAD!"" There's nothing to care about here. It's sex. How many times have I seen cliché sex scenes in a movie? Thousands, millions. I just don't care. (2) This method of mystery is childish. In Mulholland Dr., Lynch does not create a complex story whatsoever; he just creates a story that is visually hard to follow. If you showed me a picture of a walrus zoomed up close, I wouldn't know what it was. If you create a typical Wizard of Oz rip-off, place the camera just off-center, obscuring the important bits, I don't know what it is. That doesn't mean it's complex. It means it's childish. It's just a child that steals another child's lunch money and plays Keep Away with it.This is why Mulholland Dr. offers absolutely nothing original. It's a story that has been done before; it is just filmed a little out of focus. This kind of pseudo-originality is even less complex than Tarantino, who is a director who I only bring up because he seems to be hated a lot by Lynch fans, for whatever reason. Tarantino takes unoriginal concepts and pumps them up with original scenes and ideas and stories. Lynch just takes unoriginal stories and makes them a little blurry.Regardless of the predicable story, the film is pathetic, even on a visual level. The acting is hokey, which is something that I think Lynch intends, but it only adds to the children's film concept. Hokey doesn't equal weird; it just equals: ""Dude, seriously, when are you going to grow up . . . ?"" Also, it's boring as hell. I can be patient if the story is original, but when you know everything that is going to happen, and have seen every scene before, I just don't care. Because of this, Mulholland Dr. was one of the most boring films I've ever seen. Not to mention that Lynch takes his blessed time by having characters stare at each other stupidly, like they're auditioning for a bad parody of Napoleon Dynamite.In conclusion, let me say this: I can't tell the difference between directors anymore. I watch audio commentaries every time they're available on a DVD, whether I liked the movie or not. There may be a few exceptions, but 99% of directors say the same things. They look the same. They wear the same glasses. They have the same ideas on what is good. They all appear to have an understanding of what is ""cliché"", but there is always a plethora of clichés in their films. They all have the nonconformist attitude, but they all make the same unoriginal movies.David Lynch is supposedly one of the most brilliant and weird directors in history. Maybe the popular opinion backs up that statement. Maybe the critics back up that opinion. But, really, folks, David Lynch is just a face in the crowd of surrealist directors. With Mulholland Dr., he adds absolutely nothing new to the table. Because of his popularity, all he does is sit a little higher at the table than the no-name directors that did what he did, long before he did, much better than he did.2/10",Mulholland Drive

167,Mr Parker,"""No hay banda!""",10,4 January 2005,"I absolutely love this movie. I can watch this movie on a loop. Describing it would rob the first-time viewer of a great cinematic experience and would probably annoy those who've already seen it, so I won't bother.The acting in this movie is incredible. Naomi Watts righteously deserved an Oscar for her role here but hey, since when do the Academy members give awards to those who truly deserve it? Everyone else in the movie delivers, especially Justin Theroux and Laura Elena Harring. Same goes for David Lynch who quite simply, has made a film so incredible that he may not be able to top himself. Sad to say but I believe it to be true. Roger Ebert said it best when he said in regards to this film that ""the best movie of the year wasn't nominated for best picture"". I couldn't agree more. I have faith in Lynch to continue making great movies but this movie in particular treads the fine line between being accessible and inaccessible so well that I just think it'd be an impossible feat for him to redo. On a side note, I think that this film has the creepiest scene I have ever seen in a movie. That scene in the diner is an exercise in pure terror. I love the fact that this movie steers completely away from the formulaic chock that Hollywood seems so at ease with. Films like these show that there is still life in the creative process. I'll take a movie like this over 98% of what comes out of the system these days. If you happen or have happened to watch this movie and feel lost or confused by it, don't fret. There is plenty of material online to help you unlock the secrets of this wondrous puzzle box and every viewing of this movie only serves to intrigue you more and more.RATING: ***** out of *****.",Mulholland Drive
168,galileo3,A masterpiece of modern cinema,10,24 September 2010,"Mulholland Drive (2001)Number 1 - 2001 Number 1 - 2000sTop 10 - All Time There is no other director like David Lynch. His films can only be described as Lynchian. No other adjective is adequate, and that is a compliment. The man's films are an antidote to the orthodox mode of artistic expression: [1] beginning, [2] middle, [3] end. While the vast majority of pictures, since the beginning of the cinema, begin by introducing a number of characters and navigate us through a story from beginning to end, with (usually) some resolution, Lynch's best films offer no linearity, no reliable characters (Who is that person? Does that person exist? Is that person many different characters?), and offer no comfortable resolution (Did anything happen? Is this reality or is this dream? What the f*ck?). To many ""conventional"" filmgoers, that is too much to handle. A film like Eraserhead, Lost Highway, or Mulholland Drive, is anathema to the senses, and for many, that avenue of filmmaking is foreclosed; no thank youBut to those who are able and willing to enter the rabbit-hole, they will (or should) emerge liberated, frustrated, frightened, puzzled and utterly exhilarated. Lynch's modus operandi is that life is mysterious, random, inexplicably violent, strange and, well, non-linear. So why should the cinema be any different? Mulholland Drive, David Lynch's ultimate masterpiece, and one of the greatest works ever committed to celluloid, incorporates, in equal measure, the weird and wonderful, on a canvas that blurs consciousness from unconsciousness, and reality from dream (is there a difference?). It is a singular cinematic experience of the purest kind. This much can be said, without faltering into confusion and error. It tells the story of an aspiring actress, Betty (she may not be Betty), who arrives in Los Angeles, from Canada (she may not have arrived from Canada at all), and settles in her aunt's apartment in Hollywood (an apartment that smells and feels Old Hollywood, something which reminds us of Sunset Boulevard). Soon after her arrival, Betty befriends, a beauty woman with amnesia, who apparently had a serious car accident on Mulholland Drive. From thereon I hesitate to say much more. We are shown several stories and characters, a film director, a mysterious wheel- chaired bound film executive (or something) that resides in shadows behind a glass screen in his office, a ""cowboy"", a blue goblin, a mysterious woman, a surreal theatre, and, well, other things. Lynch himself, released ""10 Clues to Unlocking This Thriller""; these are: ""[1] Pay particular attention in the beginning of the film: At least two clues are revealed before the credits. [2] Notice appearances of the red lampshade. [3] Can you hear the title of the film that Adam Kessler is auditioning actresses for? Is it mentioned again? [4] An accident is a terrible event – notice the location of the accident. [5] Who gives a key, and why? [6] Notice the robe, the ashtray, the coffee cup. [7] What is felt, realized and gathered at Club Silencio? [8] Did talent alone help Camilla? [9] Note the occurrences surrounding the man behind Winkie's. [10] Where is Aunt Ruth?""My suspicion is that these clues are only further tools to fall deeper into the mystery. There is no concrete meaning to be unlocked: 1+1 does not equal 2 in this film; why should it? Human beings are pattern- seeking mammals: we seek order in everything – the universe, life, love – sometimes our curiosity is satisfied through reason and discovery (science), others through fear and superstition (faith). Lynch knows how to play to our weaknesses, and often manages, quite skilfully to terrify us along the way. Mulholland Drive is above all, a beautiful exercise in filmmaking – it is a gorgeous film – it is literally intoxicating. If you seek meaning, the best we can do (I think) is to extract certain overarching themes: human identity, broken dreams and poisonous fame, and human frailty. After that you are on your own. This film needs to be experienced; it is an astounding experience, and if you don't buy it, then go and watch Pearl Harbour""SilencioSilencioSilencio""",Mulholland Drive

For now its a 7.5. The movie possesses (but not exactly in equal parts) both bizarre, and conventional scenes. The bizarre is sometines very bizarre, but maybe less so if you begin to look at it through the lens of dreamscape or even psychosis. (I can't figure out which, or whether its both.) In any case despite its non-linear narrative, and at times convulted story, it is not a movie I personally can easily dismiss. The main reason being that I find it fairly entertaining. But maybe not consistently entertaining. I must add though that Naomi Watts does a great job with everything she's given to do, which actually amounts to three roles and not just one. Anyways, the film is worth watching even if just too develope your own theory as to what it all means.",Mulholland Drive
171,MovieGuy109,"Powerful, spellbinding David Lynch film",9,25 November 2011,"Mulholland Dr.-***1/2- Excellent- Directed by: David Lynch. Written by: David Lynch, Starring: Naomi Watts, Laura Elena Harring, Justin Theroux, Ann Miller, Scott Wulf, Robert Forster, Brent Briscoe, Dan Hedaya, Michael Des Barres, Billy Ray Cyrus, Katharine Towne, Lee Grant, James Karen, Chad Everett.Lynch directs yet another bizarre, steamy, and overall masterful thriller about a young actress (Watts in her best performance yet) who arrives in Hollywood with big dreams when she meets an amnesiac woman (Harring) who is involved in a complex and disturbing mystery.Surreal like the body of most of Lynch's work but this is one of his best films. The mystery of the film is what grabs us. Lynch's use of first person point of view and slowly zooming up on objects give us a great feeling of dream-like horror. It is Hitchcock-type suspense until the first two-thirds are over. Then it dives into pure Lynch originality full of disturbing violent images and shocking eroticism.Watts's character changes from a friendly and bubbly young lady to a dark and perverted woman. Her character completely changes and if we look at this change of character or the plot in general as consistent, then it will make no sense. Lynch's film may be one whole dream though I believe it that Watts's original personality was the dream and her other personality was her reality, but she refused to accept it.The plot can be interpreted multiple ways but what is undeniable is Lynch's strength in dream-like eroticism which he effectively displays through the relationship between Watts and Harring. He is also great in his satirical points on his portrait of contemporary Hollywood, which is a contradiction of his usual small town setting. This is a great thriller with excellent performances by all and a filmmaker with plenty of dream-like images that are frighteningly realistic.",Mulholland Drive
172,asifahsankhan,Beware what you dream for... Silencio...,10,2 June 2017,"David Lynch (One of my personal favourite directors) is a true indie film maker. He makes his movies his way and never seems too concerned with whether or not they're accessible or will find an audience. But every few years, one breaks through and goes beyond his own cult audience, hitting hard with mainstream success. Movies like Blue Velvet (1986 movie) and Lost Highway (1997 movie) will pop up, and remind regular movies goers that the dude who made Twin Peaks (TV series) is still around. The last movie of his that I remember breaking through big, was Mulholland Drive the 2001 movie.Lynch's themes are wild and unconventional: dreams materialised; crazy thought bubbles brought to life. Whereas Orson Welles' great film begins with a brief moment of surrealism – involving a snow globe and the cryptic word ""Rosebud"" – but then proceeds in a more straight-forward manner, Lynch maintains the surreal atmosphere throughout. In this sense Mulholland Drive picks up where Citizen Kane left off. Its dream-like qualities give rise to many confusing and unexplained things that naturally encourage interpretation. But as critic Roger Ebert, one of the film's greatest champions noted: ""There is no explanation. There may not even be a mystery.""The best explanation is a long one which would suggest the old couple are judges of the jitterbug contest that Betty won and then at the end, signs of her innocent past come back to terrorise her. It answers some of the smaller puzzles, too, such as: who is Jennifer Syme, the woman the film is dedicated to? (An actress who appeared in Lost Highway, who died in a car accident.) The movie is hypnotic; we're drawn along as if one thing leads to another but nothing leads anywhere, and that's even before the characters start to fracture and recombine like flesh caught in a kaleidoscope. Mulholland Drive isn't like Memento, where if you watch closely enough you can hope to explain the mystery. There is no explanation. There may not even be a mystery.Perhaps it is no coincidence that David Lynch's mind-bending mystery-drama Mulholland Drive has been named by BBC Culture's critics' poll as the best film of the century so far. Its very roots lie in television: the film began as a failed TV pilot and was salvaged into feature-length format. If you've seen David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, chances are you've been arguing about it ever since. How is Diane, the failed actor, related to Betty, the fresh-faced wannabe? Was the end really the beginning? What was the significance of the creepy nightclub Silencio, and what was in that mysterious blue box? Who were the laughing elderly couple, and what did the cowboy have to do with anything? Is there a deeper meaning – or is it a mistake to try too hard to decipher anything that David Lynch does?'Mulholland Drive,' is such a film which even its most ardent fans admit is as maddeningly baffling as it is mesmerising, despite being named the greatest film of the 21st century by BBC, just to let you guys know: that it took me 4 months to figure out the plot.Sorry for the spoiler. It's also a reason why it's one of the 'Weirdest films of all time!'Silencio...",Mulholland Drive

I can guarantee you that nothing will make sense when you leave the theatre. Saying that, I could not help but be captivated at the unusual. Characters came and went which made no sense but you are sure   everything will make sense by the end of the movie. Wrong!  I can't recommend the film even though David Lynch is one of my favorite directors. He writes like he thinks and it is totally confusing at times. To me, a movie must make some kind of sense.

175,Chaves7777,This is the girl,10,22 December 2006,"David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" is a confuse movie. So if you try to see it you have to think first in this: No matter if you see all the movie and you don't understand some points, is important that you know that you're not have the most super mind in all the earth to understand all the things in the act. Besides, this movie is for that... because is a mystery that you must resolve. For that reason, the director give to the audience Ten clues to discover the mystery.All that i say is enough to affirming that the work is maybe more than a masterpiece. ""Mulholland Drive"" or (i write it just for curiosity) the Spanish title ""Sueños, misterios y secretos"" (Dreams, mysteries and secrets) is a really an excellent film. Besides an amazing soundtrack. Other thing that i love of this film is the cast. I don't have any idea before watch the film that the beautiful Naomi Watts are the girl of the cover that i always see. Other person from the cast that surprise was the apparition of the veteran Ann Miller as the character of Coco.""Mulholland Drive"" is a film that with all the glamour of the classic Hollywood, gives a story of personality, mysteries and all that the crazy and distinguished mind of David Lynch can give to us.* Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any",Mulholland Drive

I never learn my lesson, I keep expecting David Lynch to make understandable crime/thrillers, but he always does the same thing - he makes a good start with an intriguing premise but then can't resist loading it up with dreams, altered reality and out-and-out barminess. We decided to watch this after seeing a TV review of it, and the 'strange blue key' had us wondering if it might be worth a watch. And it was, up to about half way through when Lynch started messing it all about. And who the heck was 'The Cowboy' and what was he there for, what purpose did he serve? Nah, Lynch just makes it up as he goes along, safe in the knowledge that his fans will lap it up and pretend to get it. We gave up even trying to follow it in the second hour. We were also thinking about 'Lost Highway', but reading the resume of that film it seems to suffer from the same thing. Never again, I'll give Lynch a wide berth from now on. I gave it three points because of the nice photography.",Mulholland Drive
177,brianberta,A haunting Lynch film with a deep meaning,9,26 July 2016,"David Lynch is a filmmaker known for the absurdity of his films. However, he is also really good at inserting highly complex story lines into his movies. Every time I re-watch one of his films, I feel like I understand them a little more. More complex events which didn't make any sense to me or meant nothing to me on my first viewing feel creative once I come up with a good explanation to them. This, in turn, made Lynch a really great filmmaker. It gave his films more staying power.After a car crash renders a woman named Rita amnesiac, she partners up with a woman named Betty hoping to become a Hollywood actress as they search for answers across L.A., encountering several bizarre events in the process.There is a widely accepted broad explanation of the film. However, even after you look it up, the film still has a lot of staying power. There are several other scenes from the film which appear to go deeper, and this gives it more staying power. However, no matter how much you look up, it still always seems like there is more to learn from the film, and it still keeps you coming back. The film is constructed so that it will always be open to interpretation. Every time you first watch the movie, your initial explanation always seems off, and it's hard to feel comfortable with it without watching it more times. This movie finds a great balance between reality and fantasy. It sounds very cryptic at first. However, after you pay attention to a few clues in the film, you start to form a basic idea of what's happening, and you should be able to go off from that and expand your interpretation of the film.Like most Lynch films, this is very complicated. Lynch finds many ways of giving hints to its meaning in many possible ways. He has brilliant cinematography which includes a red and pink color scheme (this is important symbolism). He also has weird set pieces which seem out of place. One of them is when they investigate an apartment where someone named ""Diane Selwyn"" supposedly lives. They find a disturbing scene there which gives a frightening clue to what the film means. Also, there is a blue box and a key which seems very odd and out of place. It makes the viewer wonder what its purpose of being in the film is. Lynch made it so that every single event from the film which seemed out of place to the storyline gave somewhat of a hint to what the film meant. I liked how Lynch did this as I thought that it was a clever method. He left subtle hints that were easily noticeable, but they weren't too obvious that they gave the films' meaning away.This film also has many scary scenes. The diner scene is perhaps the most famous one. It was very suspenseful. The viewer knew that something bad might happen. However, they also had a slight feeling of confidence that they would be fine. As tension got higher, the viewer knew that anything could go wrong, and that sense of confidence kept on dwindling. However, it was still hanging on in the back of their minds. The payoff of that scene worked very well since the buildup was really good. Also, the ending scene was very terrifying as well. The lighting and camera-work made it very unnerving, and the viewer was probably horrified. Lynch made no attempts to show suspense or to build up the tension here. He just put the payoff right at the beginning of the scene to show the viewer what they had to be terrified of. The result was a terrifying sight. Also, I found that there were some scenes which seemed scarier on repeat viewings as I got to expand my interpretation of the film. Overall, this film provided a great amount of terror.The soundtrack to this film was really good. It was very ominous. Also, it contributed really well to the sense of mystery that the film had. The intro when it shows Rita's car moving down the highway feels like a haunting way to start off the film. Not only is the soundtrack dark and ominous, but it also can be emotional at times, especially with the ""Love Theme"". Songs from it carry several different emotions. It fits in perfectly with the movie.In conclusion, this movie is amazing. I'm not sure if it's my idea of a masterpiece (although, I feel like my rating for it could rise on future viewings), but it's still very good. It has very good ambiguity and it leaves a few clues big enough to make the viewer enjoy it a lot more on future viewings. It also has many scary scenes which can make it haunting at times, especially after you learn a bit more about its plot. It expertly represents Lynch's talent at making complicated and weird films. When ""Sight & Sound"" published their 2012 edition of the top 250 best movies ever made, this film ranked at #28. I still like Eraserhead a little more, but I can understand the praise for this film. It accomplishes a lot, and it may grow on me over time as well (that was what Eraserhead did after all).",Mulholland Drive

I felt happy I did not know anything about the plot before watching it because it could have spoiled the surprise. All I can say is that it stands with the movies like Memento which show that human brain or human psyche or human imagination is far too complicated to understand than we think. Driven by terrific performance of Naomi Watts under the splendid direction of David Lynch, movies leaves you with a lot of doubts and questions.

182,Afracious,"Mystery, abstract, arcane, sublime",10,16 January 2002,"I have just returned from seeing Mulholland Drive for the first time. It's been a long wait for it to show at a cinema relatively close to me in England, and it was worth the wait. It's a film that is best watched than described (most of you will have seen it anyway), so I'll keep this as brief as I can because there's so much to discover for the first (and second)-time spectator. It's a film that is at first, and for quite a way through it, seemingly straightforward. Straight from the opening sequence there are some of the many clues in the film. A group of young people are dancing and then three whitened figures are projected onto the dancers. This is relevant. The main narrative follows a beautiful lady who we first see in the back seat of a limo at night. The car stops and a man in the car produces a gun. The limo is then hit by a speeding car. The lady stumbles from the wreckage and later finds herself at a house where she meets a budding actress who has come from Ontario, and who met an eccentric old couple on her flight. The lady from the limo is suffering from amnesia and the aspiring actress is to help her discover her identity. There are many other adjuncts - a man in a diner tells another man about a strange figure he has dreamt of who resides behind the diner (who we then see). There's a comical scene involving a hit man. A film director with an unfaithful wife is being leaned on by some executives who insist that a certain actress must appear in his film. There's a mysterious and menacing figure called the Cowboy (not dissimilar to the Mystery Man in Lost Highway). There's more, there's much more. It's during the last reel when the main narrative twists and the film delves into deeper ambiguous territory. There's an arcane box (similar to the one in Buñuel's Belle du Jour). The curtains, sparks of electricity, sound and smoke are classic Lynch. The atmospheric music by Angelo Badalamenti (who also appears in a scene involving an espresso and a napkin) is as accomplished and appropriate as ever. I don't want to say anything else except to recommend that those of you who haven't seen it do so as soon as possible. This is a treat for fans of surreal films. I'm looking forward to seeing it again soon and purchasing the DVD.",Mulholland Drive

Yet the realities of the dream world have the tendency to eventually turn into a nightmare, a nightmare which is too real to be lived in... Welcome to a David Lynch picture, where nothing is as it seems, and Lynchian logic reigns to leave you befuddled, mystified, mouth agape when the curtain falls and silence spreads. Mulholland Drive is a movie which engulfs the viewer in its intricate mystery plot like no other and leaves you with a load of memorable, haunting or outright shocking images you will never forget. You might be caught off guard by the true nature of the underlying mystery, and the denouement will keep you mesmerized for sure, making a re-watch essential, yet rewarding experience. As often with an eccentric filmmaker's work, this is a movie to only get going in your head once it's already over, and if you're willing to get immersed in it.Lynch's masterpiece invites to dig deeper, to uncover new layers, hidden references, multiple interpretations. The film is as psychologically profound as it is visually stunning and while it draws its fascination from what appears surreal at first glance, it is nevertheless firmly embedded in a reality that won't let us go, blood-curdling as it might turn out, a reality full of hopes, dreams, obsessions, fear, you name it. ""Mulholland Drive"" is packed with great imagery, dark humor, wonderful music and bizarre twists and turns and stars Naomi Watts in her most brilliant role.

I knew this film is going to be strange because of all the reviews it got but man, that was way too bizarre. Was the director on crack when he made this film? I'm still mystified by it up until now. This is definitely one of those films that requires second viewing and some internet consultations.OK. So the first part of the film can be easily followed. Its basically about a woman who had amnesia and this woman Betty takes her in in her aunt's apartment and then inside the purse of the woman with amnesia there's loads of money. Puzzled, Betty and Rita (the woman) decides to follow some leads and track down her real identity. There's some subplots involved concerning a Hollywood director (Justin Theroux) struggling to find a lead actress in his new film and then there's this hit-man who is I think looking for the money and then there's a guy who died because he saw a bum in a dumpster (a lol moment) which is totally unrelated to the story.But then, when the moment Rita drops the blue box it all goes to crazy town and I was like this little kid confused and clueless and all alone. Right up until the last frame, you will be confused. I don't think any person could understand it first viewing.David Lynch, who is known for making really weird movies, captures what it is like inside a dream. This is what the movie is in a nutshell: a dream. Its so bizarre and haywire. But if you watch it closely and observe, I mean really observe it all makes sense. I just viewed it for the second time just now and I completely understood it now. And from what I've seen , its beautiful. Its like a jigsaw puzzle, before you see the complete picture you must first piece all the puzzle and the reward is very glorious. The acting is just superb. Naomi Watts is a complete stand out. She really stood among the rest. The others were pretty good too. The directing is just plain excellent. David Lynch among other ""weird"" directors like Gondry, will go down as one of my favorite directors ever.Mulholland Dr. is excellent overall. Therefore it gets an 8.",Mulholland Drive

I really don't know how it's possible to enjoy his movies. ""Mulholland Drive"" is no exception. OK, It's better than ""Blue Velvet"", but the main difference is that I didn't fell asleep during this one. In fact, I got excited about it for the first hour or so. Although there were lots of scenes I never understood at all, the main plot seemed interesting enough. The atmosphere in the movie was also interesting. But that was before I had seen the whole film. At the end, I didn't have a clue about anything. A hint for you, Lynch: Movies are meant to entertain, not to irritate the viewer with tons of really hard riddles. I have read some persons ways of 'solving' this movie, and I have to say that it was VERY complicated, and I could never done that myself. 'Solving' movies like this are not for normal people, no doubt about that.",Mulholland Drive
186,alexzhivkov,inexplicably terrible,4,30 November 2020,"I'm giving it 4 just for the acting. Everything else really sucks. What was the whole point of the movie? Oh, wait! I know - to confuse you and... that's it. The ending was awful, the whole movie is just a mess.",Mulholland Drive
187,Tiger_Mark,"You lost me, David.",5,29 October 2001,"Let me first say that I thought ""Blue Velvet"" was one of the greatest movies ever. I loved that film and I kind of became a Lynch fan as a result. I was a little letdown by ""Wild At Heart"", I thought it was all style and no substance. I was more letdown by ""Lost Highway"", one of the worst movies ever made. I did not care for ""Dune"" or ""The Straight Cut"" (I think that was the lawn mower movie?). Well, it got me thinking, is Lynch in a rut? Or is he just not much of a filmmaker? Well, I am going with the second one. The man cannot tell a story, he can't. He has to get far out and carried away, because it conceals the fact that the story is not nearly as clever as he would have you believe. I know there are a lot of these ""artist"" types that are going to tell me that I am not advanced enough to understand the nuances of this last story, but that is a bunch of crap. Mulholland Drive comes apart like a poorly wrapped christmas present. I wanted very badly to like this film and I would say that I was going to go thumbs up through the first hour and fortyfive minutes. However, this film falls apart so badly in the last 45 minutes, that I went thumbs down. It is a classic style of filmmaking. Come up with some nonsense ending and let all of the self professed artists out there read their own ending into the film. Of course if you were to ask Lynch what the ending meant, he would have no idea what to say. Probably give you some bull about interpreting the art on your own. Yeah right! Fool me once, shame on you, fool me four times, shame on me. Be advised, this is more Lynch nonsense that will leave you shaking your head as you ponder asking for your money back. If you are one of Lynch's brilliant disciples that can interpret his psychotic illusions, have a good time. But save your ""how deep"" lines for your buddies at the coffee house.",Mulholland Drive
188,ryan_kuhn,What The Heck Did I Just Watch?,8,13 February 2005,"That David Lynch, one has to wonder if he even knows what his films and TV shows are about. The man who brought us Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, and Eraserhead directs Mulholland Drive, a movie that makes no sense what-so-ever, and any attempt to figure out what exactly happens is an exercise in madness. There is no point in me describing the plot, it is too difficult to explain, it just has to be experienced. Naomi Watts plays a peppy twenty-something year old from the Midwest who goes to LA to become an actress. Laura Harring plays some woman who was in an accident while in a limo and loses her memory. She doesn't even know who she is. Beyond that, what is real and what is not is hard to figure out, but Dan Hedaya, Robert Forster, and Ann Miller are featured as background players. There is loads, let me repeat LOADS of symbolism in Mulholland Drive, but what everything means is open to interpretation. I think the last half of the movie is a dream, and if you remember your dreams, sometimes time and space are warped, nothing is linear. That is what makes the most sense to me. Also, I think the first half of the movie is about how Hollywood is a horrible place to make a living, but that could only be one way at looking at it. Mulholland Drive is not a movie in the sense most people think of movies. Instead, Mulholland Drive is a piece of art that has to be looked at critically, interpreted as the meaning that the painter hides deep in the movie is hard to finger. David Lynch has always worked in symbolic, strange, out-there methods, and Mulholland Drive is no different. The lasting part of the movie that stayed with me the longest was the soundtrack. Very little music, instead deep, almost so low you can't hear it noises make up the background, as if the boom mikes were sitting too close to amplifiers or some other interfering device. It is unsettling to have to listen to that for the entire movie, and adds to the uneasiness that is the movie. It is a difficult movie to get through, but by the end of it, perhaps you have learned something about yourself, or you could turn to your friend and ask ""what the heck did I just watch?""",Mulholland Drive
189,vailsy,David Lynch must be smiling..,8,7 December 2007,"..at the 101 ways that people try to dissect and piece together this movie i've watched his film just twice, and on the second viewing i didn't try to concentrate on details i might have missed first time round. but instead just tried to relax about standard narrative structure and soak in the emotional content of the movie. 'don't think feeeel'! my conclusion is that this movie most certainly is not about love, it is 100% about obsession, jealousy, envy and all of those darker emotions acting-wise Naomi Watts has the most to do here, and does a tremendous job. most of all i like the scene where she is acting as if she is acting. pretty incredible actually",Mulholland Drive
190,blacklist-1,"Wonderfully weird, masterfully told and made from for me the genius David Lynch!",10,5 February 2010,"Until recently I had never heard of this film Mulholland Drive let alone the director David Lynch until only a couple of weeks ago.I heard about Lynch from my class teacher who is a massive fan of his movies. He told me that Mulholland drive was a very confusing film so I decided to give it a watch before the lecture to try and better understand it I watched it and I was initially confused as the plot is very difficult to follow but when it finished I was so intrigued to find out what the movie meant I got a couple of books out about it and I eventually think figured it out.This is an incredible film, unique, refreshing and intelligent, which nowadays is not what Hollywood gives. Lynch directs Mulholland Drive with a nightmarish quality incorporating the theme of dreams and psychology into the mix.The story starts off with a woman in an accident in a limousine when two cars with youths in who are drag racing crash into them. The woman who stumbles out makes it to an empty house where Betty played by Naomi Watts is staying as it's rented out by her aunt. Betty is an actress who wants to make it big in Hollywood. Initially she finds the women who calls herself 'Rita' played by Laura Harring. Betty decides to help her figure out who she is as Rita has lost her memory. With Rita she had a handbag and in it they find lots of money and a blue key. Betty helps Rita trace herself to a woman she thinks she remembers whose called Diane who may have gave her the key but when they track her down she's been murdered. Meanwhile Betty and Rita grow closer and fall in love.A separate story is that the one of the youths who crashed into the limousine at the beginning is shown doing a hit on three people for a book, whilst a producer Adam Kesher played by Jason Theroux who Betty was going to audition for a part in his movie ends up going on the run from the mafia after refusing to cast a girl Camilla Rhodes they want but eventually he accepts. This all takes place within about about 110 minutes of the movie, which more all less makes sense then in the last forty minutes everything you thought you knew turns on it's head. When Betty and Rita have slept together Rita murmurs the name of a club in her sleep so her and Betty go to an early morning show to see what she can remember. When they get back Rita and Betty go to her room and Rita gets out a blue box, which the key fits in but at this point Betty had disappeared from the room and when Rita opens the box it's empty that when the film becomes bizarre but in a brilliant way.Okay here goes the character of Betty (Watts) becomes the character of Diane who was found dead by Betty. Diane is in love with Rita who now becomes Camilla who she met on a set of a film. Camilla has been helping her get roles in movies and they have fallen in love. Unfortunately Camilla has been sleeping around and eventually ends up being engaged to Jason. Diane becomes devastated as Camilla calls things off so Diane hires a hit-man who was the youth in the car at the start and who did the hit on those three people to kill Camilla. He does but in the end she feels so guilty for what she has done that she kills herself. Basically the real story was of Diane falling in love with Camilla but her ending it as she is engaged to Adam and Diane wanting to kill Camilla and does as she also ends up killing herself. The first two thirds of the film is her twisted fantasy of how she wanted it to be with her and Camilla. David Lynch is an amazing director and deserves to be up there with Spielburg, Eastwood and Cameron. Mulholland Drive cleverly manipulates the audiences expectations subtly so they have to figure out the puzzle themselves. I was totally shocked by the twists when I figured it out as there a lot of false red herrings. The portrayal of the human condition of dreams, reality, insanity build from love and betrayal is explored in superb depth. The lighting is of that film noir 1940s expression which is wonderfully artistic. The music is beautiful, powerful and though provoking which added the tension and suspense to the scenes. There isn't much dialogue and there are long pauses between character's interaction but through visually there body language and the way they say it depending on what is happening in the film progresses the story. The acting as well, Jason Theroux gives a good performance and so does Laura Harring, but Naomi Watts steals the movie, her first acting role this was and it made her. She deserved it. Here she gives the performance of a lifetime, worthy of an Oscar. It's one of the finest performance I have ever seen on film. One scene that stands out is the love scene with her and Harring aches with passion and believability but throughout Watts is totally convincing whether wanting to help Ruth in her fantasy or her menacing jealously in her reality.Lynch has made a perfect film which is daring, unique and wonderfully complex with intelligence. He knows how to bring out the best in his actors and the lighting and the music is truly gorgeous. I will call this a David Lynch masterpiece. After Mulholland Drive I am going to watch more of his films. Something tells me Lynch may join my list of best ever directors. One of the greatest films I've seen and one I can't wait to view again. A truly remarkable film experience.",Mulholland Drive
191,ab-2,"A great ""thinking"" movie",10,8 December 2001,"I thought Mulholland Dr. was one pretty good film because it makes you think. I just saw the movie and when I came out, I had so many answers to what some parts of the movie were supposed to mean. Mulholland Dr. will make you think and it should. While the films genre is a drama-mystery, there also some parts that will scare because it will make you wonder what will happen next. One scene sent a tingle down my spine just because I was wondering what would happen next. I overall, recommend this movie to an older audience, 16 and older because younger kids might find the film boring.10/10",Mulholland Drive
192,tapio_hietamaki,An unsettling dream,10,2 March 2013,"David Lynch has an instantly recognizable style with his ambiguous extreme close-up shots, deep and rich colors and slow, dream-like dialog. Mulholland Drive uses these to great effect and has a good story to boot. The film will leave you asking many questions, or just baffled beyond words, but if you re-watch it, look for the right clues and have a decent understanding of symbolism and storytelling techniques, it's possible to decipher the meaning of the film. (Though I didn't -- I just checked online what other people thought.)Mulholland Drive features amazing performances by all of its actors, but most of all Naomi Watts in the double lead role (kind of.) She shows such a great variety of emotions it's hard to believe they come from the same person.The film is at times frighteningly scary, and it has a habit of turning to weird and dark places very suddenly. But it also has a great sense of humor. The dialog is witty and the scenes loaded with irony and self-parody.",Mulholland Drive
193,jay4stein79-1,Superb,10,31 March 2006,"A lot of people love David Lynch. I count myself among that group. However, I am not an uncritical supporter of this man's oeuvre. I can say, without fear of censure, that Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, the Straight Story, and Mulholland Drive are unrivaled masterpieces. The others are lesser films--Eraserhead is, though an auspicious debut, immature; Elephant Man is dull; Dune is lugubrious; and Lost Highway is an abomination and one of the worst films I've ever seen. Blue Velvet and Mulholland are two of the best films I've ever seen-- Mulholland in particular. What's wonderful about this film? Everything. I saw it the first time at the Cork Film Festival in 2001, just after it opened in the states. The screen was huge and the theatre dark. When those joyriders come screeching down through the Hollywood Hills, I knew I was in for something special. I can't say that I completely understood everything the first time I saw Mulholland, but I grasped most of what was going one. To those that say this film is too confusing, I say you're not paying close enough attention and by that I mean you must have fallen asleep for part of it. The movie really isn't that difficult to follow, ultimately, unless you've never seen a movie with a dream sequence or a flashback or an out of sequence narrative. Show of hands: How many of you have seen Pulp Fiction? If you've seen that film, you can follow this one. I'm not going to explain what I think happened because ultimately it doesn't matter. The world Lynch creates in this film is amazing and complete. It's a comic book-Los Angeles or one from another dimension. It's a fantasy-land. You have to lose yourself in it and be taken over by the tone of the film and its imagery. If you do that, the film will guide you through its more opaque convolutions. The acting, cinematography, and overall mood are amazing here and this is probably Lynch's most assured film (if not my favorite). However, it's a terrible place to start, if you're unfamiliar with him. Start with The Straight Story (his most mature film) and move onto Blue Velvet (my personal favorite but a very raw film). Then, you'll probably be ready for Mulholland.",Mulholland Drive
194,llihilloh,"This film is without a doubt, the worst I have ever seen.",1,30 November 2002,"Everyone seems to love 'Mulholland Dr.' for reasons that I will apparently never understand.  I had been wanting to see this movie for a while and I finally did.  Not only did I lose $3.50 to Hollywood Video, but I think that I actually lost brain cells in the viewing of this entirely overrated garbage that should have been left on the cutting room floor. 
First off, how this trash made it onto the Top 250 list (it's currently 128) is beyond me.  I've read many critics' reviews just because I wanted to see if there was anyone else in the world that agreed with me by saying that 'Mulholland Dr.' should never have been made.  Well, I didn't have too much luck.What exactly was David Lynch on when he was sitting in the director's chair? Now this is the first film by Lynch that I have ever seen, so naturally a couple of people might think that it is unfair to judge him by going off of only one movie.  I don't care what anybody says, he's a terrible director and you couldn't pay me (well, I suppose if the price was right...) to view any of his other films.I'll be honest, I thought that the film was going to be really good due to the first ten minutes alone.  It started off slow but I figured that it would pick up and be non-stop action from then on out.  Wrong.  It dragged on and on and I continued to check the clock about every two minutes just to make sure that I was still awake.  I was on the verge of slipping into a deep sleep many of times.  I was actually still interested in 'Mulholland Dr.' up to the point where Betty finds Rita in her aunt's apartment.  It was all downhill from there.The acting was surprisingly good.  Too bad it was wasted on such an awful project.  Naomi Watts is fairly good to watch.  She was a bit annoying at times, but I would see her again in one of her other films.  Laura Elena Harring was so bad.  It seems unreasonable to come down on her when I rave about Watts' performance, but it's not my fault that she was boring to watch.  Justin Theroux was entertaining.  His character was a mess, but I still enjoyed him.  The cast was good, could have been better, alright, it was average.'Mulholland Dr.' is freaky.  It is down right weird.  We all know that.  The thing is, is that there are entirely too many twists and turns.  Lynch doesn't know when to stop.  It looks as if he wanted the entire film to be set as a complete 'illusion' instead of just random parts here and there. Well, why didn't he?  He got me so confused that I gave up and didn't care less if I even saw the last minutes of it.  I did, though.  The film is a wild ride of turns and twists of events that turn out to be nothing more than disappointments.  The script itself is terrible.  The majority of the writing was silly and stupid, yet some of it was actually bearable.  It definitely needed work on. Well, would you look at that.  Lynch, as it just so happened, was also the writer of the film.  Surprise, surprise.  So, this movie managed to weasle a '1' out of me.  I'd have given it a -10 if I felt it would have made a difference.  But since there isn't a '0' or anything less than that, a '1' is what it gets.I've seen some pretty terrible films throughout the years, but 'Mulholland Dr.' definitely takes the prize home.  This dreadfully long movie drags on and on and manages to accomplish absolutely nothing.  The cast is okay, though it would have gone over better with a different set of actors.  The writing is horrible.  There are too many twists and turns set at every corner in order for anything really interesting to develope.  David Lynch is a joke and should be ashamed of himself for creating such an awful picture. The ending and basically the entire 145 minutes is confusing.  'Mulholland Dr.' is the worst film that I have ever seen. Avoid this one at all costs!",Mulholland Drive
195,pere-25366,A truly unique and dreamlike viewing experience,9,12 October 2017,"I can honestly say after watching Mulholland Dr. (2001) that I've never seen anything quite like this... it helps to come into this film with the sole expectation that you are entering a dreamworld. Rather than being presented a straightforward plot with conventional tropes and rules, we are given from Lynch a succession of images, ideas and sensations - in that sense, Mulholland Dr. (2001) really feels closer to a dream than a movie.To say that David Lynch has a unique cinematic style would be an understatement - as a result, his films can be extremely hit or miss with people. But here, everything just seems to come together so well - the disquieting music coupled with the dreamlike surroundings creates a nightmarish and otherworldly environment to which you simply become a part of. Lynch re-creates the place we all see in our dreams that feels so real and yet is only a part of our subconscious.There are many highlights in the film (the acting from Naomi Watts and Laura Harring specifically is outstanding) but what resonated the most with me was the beautiful imagery Lynch has crafted in this film. Ambitious in its deliberate approach to avoid conventional plot elements, the pieces of the film are so hard to put together that trying to do so would simply be futile. People have tried to solve its mysteries and contrivances but MD is meant to be left in its bare, enigmatic fragments. Upon finishing the film, I was left with the same feeling I have waking up from an amazing dream: Unsure of what I had witnessed but stuck reminiscing at the mystery and beauty of it all. And until this point, I had never seen anything quite like this surreal, neo-noir experience. I seriously doubt I will ever come across anything like it again. This is great filmmaking by Lynch and his indisputable masterpiece.",Mulholland Drive
196,senortuffy,Totally bizarre .... but good,7,30 September 2003,"A David Lynch film is kinda like taking acid.  There are moments of ecstasy, moments of unease, and moments when you're not sure what's real and what isn't.  You kinda have an intuitive feel of what's going on but you can't explain it in words.  You just have to go with the flow.The concept of movies within movies has been done before.  Maurizio Nichetti made a very humorous film, ""The Icicle Thief"" (1989), by warping reality with this technique and reminding us how silly modern life is.  Here, David Lynch presents us with a darker vision of modern Hollywood by blending different lives with one another.I can't say for sure what it all means, but it's an interesting trip.",Mulholland Drive
197,kergillian,The way The Lost Highway SHOULD have been done!,8,26 May 2002,"I'd heard so many wonderful things about this movie, so my expectations were high, especially since I was really disappointed with the Lost Highway. And this certainly met my expectations, though I perhaps don't think it's quite as good as most of my friends do.David Lynch is certainly an acquired taste. And I've been hooked since I first saw Blue Velvet, which remains one of my all time favourite movies. And I was one of the many who was distraught when Twin Peaks ended (especially on such a frustrating note!!) This movie will definitely please the fans. it's cryptic, full of hidden clues and the inevitable Lynchian message about life and the world, and specifically in this film: Hollywood. And his commentary is strange, deep and at times hilariously wicked. The two scenes that particularly floored me were the assassination slapstick, Lynch style; and the Naomi Watts audition scene.However, the film had a tendency to get TOO cryptic. And I'm not talking about the Lost Highway type of character switch, but of the many scenes which didn't seem to have ANYTHING to do with the film, involving characters that didn't seem to fit in. Some explained themselves a little as the movie progressed (the assassin for example, though that hilarious aforementioned scene still didn't really make sense to me plot-wise), other never really did. And the very ending (which I won't spoil) was a real letdown for me, as Lynch seemed to be trying too hard with it, a sort of cheezy artsy ending that I haven't seen from him before except as satire.Still, this was a Lynch film, and a GOOD one. It was completely unpredictable, with great acting (check out Billy Ray Cyrus as the poolboy turned adulterer, Gene). And even if David Lynch's deep inner lesbian fantasies were a tad overdone, so be it (the scenes were at least really sensual and not plastic soft-core trailer trash). So although it's a bit too caught up in itself, the movie was a thrilling jumble of eerily connected pieces. It could have been connected JUST a bit more smoothly, but c'est la vie.  8/10.",Mulholland Drive

Take a look at the Box Office details of his ""crimes"" and you will understand what I mean.",Mulholland Drive
199,duce122,Rarely does any picture make such an impact...,9,26 October 2002,"Rarely does any picture make such an impact on the way people think and react to things than the 2001 film entitled Mulholland Drive, directed by David Lynch. Lynch has made a name for himself by creating dark and weird films that will pluck at one's nerves. Mulholland Drive is no exception and should be considered, in my opinion, as one of the best films in the history of cinema. Mulholland Drive is anchored by the incredible performance of Naomi Watts, who plays an up-and-coming actress who stumbles upon another woman who cannot remember who she is. This amnesic reaction is due to a fatal car accident on Mulholland Drive early that evening. We are also introduced to several supporting characters and countless subplots. The movie plays out like a dream world, with several scenes having little or nothing to do with the `plot.' Without getting into too much detail and giving the secrets away, the film is about 3/4ths over when it takes a complete 360º turn. The plot, its characters, and the situations seem to completely change and as I was watching the remainder of Mulholland Drive, I was wondering why Lynch was playing with my mind this way. Eventually, I got frustrated and looked up some key plot points on the Internet and eventually, everything became clear. I watched Mulholland Drive a second time and realized how much sense this seemingly incomprehensible film actually made. Lynch is a complete genius for being able to toy with the minds of countless viewers, only to laugh in their face and say `I can't believe you were this stupid not to figure this film out.' Mulholland Drive does something most films don't: plays with your mind and leaves you with a blank stare, wondering how you could let a film pluck at your nerves.",Mulholland Drive
200,Jakemcclake,Beyond Cryptic,7,26 September 2017,"It is difficult to determine the plot of Mulholland Drive. There are a number of explanations of the plot on the internet. No one explanation is entirely satisfactory.Some have the plot/story mostly explained. However, there will always be some holes, some things that do not get explained, even with the very best explanation.Some people say figuring out what is taking place in the movie, takes the fun out of the movie. Therefore, just watch it, and know that is it meant to be cryptic and let it be.There is a scene just before the opening credits, that shows a room out of focus, then the camera moves over and focuses on a sleeping individual. I believe that scene is the best explanation of the movie. Someone who has an out of focus view, of the world is sleeping and dreaming. That person's dream is out of touch and out of focus with reality because that person's world is out of touch with reality.Many people see this as a story of Diane Selwyn, in the first half of the movie she is sleeping and dreaming, that she is Betty and meets Rita. Then we see her reality in the second half as a bitter and failed actress who orders a hit on someone and eventually kills herself. There are still hundreds of unanswered questions with this explanation, so...There are many other explanations to this movie, including that this is a horror movie, meant to shock and scare us but the main horror is that we the audience do not know what is going one and as we continue to watch instead of understanding more, we see more things to confuse us.The big positive is that this movie made me look for explanations, however, no one explanation completely explains...anything about the movie, and every explanation can be proved wrong...so...Most importantly, when I watch a movie, I look for an uplift... but this is far from uplifting...and any explanation fails to be uplifiting so...silencio.",Mulholland Drive
201,schroederagustavo,Mesmerizing,10,5 August 2020,"Mulholland Drive is, I think, the rare kind of movie that's better to experience than to watch. It's the type of film that's better if you just go along with it, without trying to make much sense out of everything, because you will be mostly disappointed if you try to do that. This is a movie about the unconscious and the dream state, it's perhaps the best movie of its kind, a very good movie. In a way, the entire movie acts as a dream. And just like in a dream, the best way to experience it is to just go along for the ride and once you wake up, you can think about what happened and what it all meant. There are many great individual scenes in the film and most of them don't seem to relate that well to the rest of the film, but much like the dream, Lynch attempts to place great individual scenes, loosely connected to one another to form a broader message. It's filled with amazing direction and great performances, particularly by Naomi Watts, a great soundtrack and a great score. My only little complaint with the movie, and I suppose this is a critique I have in general with David Lynch, is that it seems to me the conscious attempt to make his movies more confusing is very apparent when you watch them. And while Mulholland Drive is the best movie I've seen him direct (I've only seen Blue Velvet and Eraserhead before), it's still evident how he is consciously trying to portray the unconscious. And he may very well be the best to do so and this movie may be the greatest example of attempting to do just that. To portray the dream state in a film. However, I think it shows that he is consciously is trying to manipulate the narrative to make it feel that way, the film seems to me as if he shot it linearly and then mixed it and filled it with a bunch of stuff to fit the narrative of it being like a dream. But still, it's a very good movie, must-watch.",Mulholland Drive
202,teh_mode,Mind-Bendingly Brilliant,9,24 November 2006,"Whatever one might make of the mysterious meanings behind David Lynch's enigmatic neo-noir, one thing is almost inarguable about Mulholland Drive: Every second of it is perfectly rendered into a beautifully spooky Rubik's cube of a movie. At the heart of it's narrative lies a young woman apparently named Bettie. She has travelled from Cananda to pursue a fairy-tale like career as a movie star in Hollywood. Upon her trails she encounters a dark haired woman who, after suffering a car crash, has a case of amnesia. Agreeing to help the woman regain her true consciousness, the movie then proceeds to unravel a simmeringly dark tale of reality and unreality, within the realms of movie stardom. Or perhaps not. Since Lynch remains tight-lipped about the movie's true interpretation (if there really is one) even if you find yourself completely bewildered by the mind-bending narrative, don't let that get in the way of your sheer enjoyment of this feature. It is mesmerising stuff.",Mulholland Drive
203,NateManD,"Unlock the mystery, Lynch Style!",10,6 August 2005,"""Muholland Drive"" is definitely a puzzle. Although I understood the basic plot twist during my second viewing, I still watched it again and the minor details made so much more sense. The beginning of the film deals with a girl with amnesia. After a car accident, she can't remember who she is. She stays with the sweet and naive Betty and names herself Rita. Betty, played by the gorgeous Naomi Watts, is an actress who has just moved to Hollywood for a big break. She tries to help Rita find out who she really is. Along the way we meet a ruthless producer, and witness many various strange nonsense like situations. All feel like a disjointed dream. Who can forget that creepy bum behind the restaurant dumpster holding a sort of Pandora's's box? Then the film becomes very confusing towards the end with a flashback and out of sequence style. I won't ruin the surprise, but I'll give you a couple of hints for the latter parts of the film. (WARNING, STOP READING IF YOU HAVEN""T SEEN THE FILM YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) (SPOILER ALERT, STOP READING, if you want to figure it out on your own) 1.) Think, is everyone the same person throughout the whole film? 2.) Think about the scene where the cowboy walks in Diane's house and tells her to ""wake up"". 3.) Now, think about the films tag-line describing Hollywood. 4.)Also pay attention to Diane's coffee mug and robe before the on the couch sex scene with her and Camela. These 4 things are very important for you the viewer or detective trying to unlock the mystery. (OK IT'S SAFE TO READ NOW FOR NEW VIEWERS!) David Lynch has not only created a flawless surreal masterpiece of mystery. In a Kenneth Anger like fashion, Lynch also creates a satire that makes fun of Hollywood. You got to respect a director like David Lynch who screws with the viewer's mind, mocks Hollywood and still gets nominated for an academy award. I don't think anyone else could do that? And so well too! Even after unlocking the films mystery, there is still many things left unexplained. This opens the door to subconscious thought and leaves viewers to explore different interpretations. ""Muholland Drive"" is a great film that provokes much discussion.",Mulholland Drive
204,athena24,The Most complicated movie I ever saw.,8,9 September 2005,"I didn't understand this movie when I saw it, but I had a feeling that there is some logic in this movie. I had no patience to see it again, so I read some reviews to figure it out. What a mistake. This movie has a brilliant idea, that was perfectly retold when thinking of it backwards. All the details that I thought to be 'holes in the plot' during the movie, appeared to be the clues to it's solution. I guess I have underrated David Lynch as director (although this is his first movie that I saw). The cinematography and the soundtrack are truly awesome and stylish. I just wish it wasn't so complicated and would be a little bit more approachable.",Mulholland Drive
205,macpet49-1,"""In my beginning is my end.."" TS Eliot",5,12 July 2017,"Lynches films usually garner interest because of his beautiful leading ladies (most of talent) and photography but he is NOT a great director. His plots are all stolen mix-matched pieces of Hitchcock, TV shows etc. ground up into a bland chopped meat that ends up saying nothing. What makes them really amateur are his long corny vignettes everyone wants to embellish on and call deep and mysterious or ironic messages about society. A girl staring at a mechanical bird in a tree or a young aspiring actress mouthing lines from 40s/50s films like ""I'm going to be a famous actress!"" then giggling like an idiot. People walk through his films reciting his lines like they are just doing a first reading (not even) and have never acted before. There's a high school play feeling about his films. They either reflect an immature, autistic mind or some imagery only he is aware of and cannot seem to communicate. He's not even amusing like John Waters. What a waste or talent and money!? In the end we can only appreciate them on the level of porn--mindlessly watching while masturbating.",Mulholland Drive
206,pekinman,"Hey, pretty girl... time to wake up.",10,16 June 2008,"Mulholland Drive is, to date, David Lynch's most perfectly executed film. It is the most effective demonstration of alternative universes he's yet accomplished.The first two times I viewed Mulholland Drive I was trying to figure something out. I put it away for a long time. Several years later, now, I have re-watched it, after a marathon viewing of the entire Twin Peaks series. This inundation of Lynch-World helped me to relax into Mulholland Drive and let it flow over me. I simply watched without thinking and, though nothing was made clear, it did make some sort of profound sense. It is about dreams, about who we think we are, who we actually might be, who we want to be and who we really are NOT. Numerology, magic, astrology and Eastern mysticism have always played a part in Lynch's work. In Mulholland Drive those elements fuse and result in a perfect whole, perfect within the context of its own existence. There is no mystery beyond what the viewers create in their own minds out their own pre- dispositions and prejudices. To have chosen Hollywood, especially Mulholland Drive, as the focus for this vision was particularly stunning for someone, like me, who worked and lived there for several years, experiencing the complete delusion of the place, the profound sadness of most of its inhabitants and the vaingloriousness of its masters. Hollywood is heaven and hell, mostly the latter, for people like 'Betty/Diane' (Naomi Watts).Nothing more can be said about the plot. The bits and pieces of it are beautiful, evocative. Scenes like that at the Silenzio Club with Rebecca del Rio singing that haunting acapella song. The moment when the girls open the blue box and 'Betty' vanishes, changing time and space in a moment. All that has gone before has been a dream leading to another dream. It's lovely to behold and is deeply satisfying, once you have let go of trying to figure out what, if anything, is going on, plot- wise.There are some splendid performances to enjoy. Naomi Watts is astonishing, a range like no other actress I can think of off-hand. Laura Harring is not only fabulously beautiful but also as great an actress as Watts, well almost. And it is SO wonderful that Lynch brought in Ann Miller for her last stand on film. The best way to approach this film is to watch it like Disney's 'Fantasia' and forget all pre- conceived notions of what a movie is supposed to be, based on all the mediocre, fatuous and vanity-driven crap coming at us out of Hollywood all the time. When the sad day comes when we will sum up David Lynch's work 'Mulholland Drive' will, I predict, be assessed as his greatest masterpiece.My favorite bit, of many, is when Angelo Badalamenti (playing, Luigi Catigliani) spits out his espresso into a handkerchief. An immortal Lynch moment.",Mulholland Drive
207,howie73,Lynch's key film,10,15 March 2005,"With an opening segment that imitates the music and cinematography of Todd Haynes's Safe (1995), David Lynch uses dream, myth and warped notions of reality to tell the fractured story of a failed bit-part Hollywood actress/waitress, Diane Selwyn, let down by fame and her own demons and obsessed with Camilla Rhodes, who is engaged to hotshot director Adam Kesher.The film effectively takes place in Diane's drug-fueled head; we are witness to her crazy distortions, her wish-fulfillments, regrets, obsessions and fears. Using the dream narrative as a way of presenting two notions of reality in conflict, Lynch does not simplify the opposition between reality and fantasy but actively entangles them. The last 45 minutes are as dream-like as what came before; and the troublesome air of detached, otherworldly ambiguity still pervades, fracturing the seemingly secure distinction between reality and dream we expect to see in films about nightmares and dreams.Lynch's film borrows from many films, old and new, but ultimately is a film unlike any other with the exception of the director's own Lost Highway and Blue Velvet. It constantly challenges the viewer to interpret what is seen, not only intuitively but intellectually. Yet it is not as pretentious as one would have imagined because Lynch makes us sympathize with the protagonist despite her murderous deeds - an element that was missing in all of his other films except the Straight Story. He does this by presenting Diane's dream alter-ego, Betty, as a wholesome Canadian farm girl destined for fame. Lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that affirms and negates in equal measure. Are Camilla and Diane really lovers or just friends? Who is the blue-lady? What does she signify? Who is the bum behind Winkies? What is the significance of the rotting corpse at Sierra Bonita? Does Aunt Ruth really exist? Is silencio an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self-referential take on the film's status as fiction? Lynch isn't prepared to answer any question he poses, choosing instead to present his ""love story in the city of dreams"" as a set of interconnected abstractions and motifs.The acting is top rate, especially Naomi Watts as Diane Selwyn/Betty, who is yet to eclipse this performance. Laura Harring has the requisite Hayworthesque allure as Camilla/Rita, while Adam Theroux as Adam brings an freewheeling arrogance and sublimated paranoid aggression to his role. It was staggering and a grave injustice that not one of them was even nominated for an Academy Award.This is a film that demands to be seen and analyzed closely. The mystery at the heart of the film remains in Lynch's hands but half the fun is finding consistent ideas from the maze of seeming incongruities that he presents. Upon closer inspection there is a definite sense of a puzzle, perhaps an incomplete jigsaw that teases us with closure but denies the imaginary plenitude of narrative coherence. Ultimately, this is Lynch's key film.",Mulholland Drive
208,w-71474,Psychological personality analysis,10,15 April 2020,"Prior statement: As a landmark and unique film in the history of suspense films, ""Muhran Dao"" is almost as complex and deep as any previous work. It is also the most famous masterpiece of David Lynch. I have n't heard of anyone who can read this movie again. Most people (99%) are completely turned away by this movie. Many times, this film is also hidden by many people because of obscurity, and the audience is limited. However, the glory of the gods will not be covered after all. On the recommendation list of any suspense film, ""Muhland Road"" will always be Is the most important part. So please watch the movie before watching the movie review, otherwise you will miss it and it will be a long time before such a movie appears next time. I hope that all officials will watch the movie and read it again, and if they feel that the writing is not bad, I hope they can give a few sentences of comments, which is also a bit of hard support.
Popularization of theory: The entire ""Muhran Dao"" can be said to be a movie version of ""Analysis of Dreams"" and other books, annotating Freund's theory with the movie's movies. If you are familiar with these theories or you are afraid of trouble, you can skip them first. I will mark the theories that I rely on to analyze the plots and let the officials compare and observe them. However, to understand ""Muhran Road"", the following theoretical support is indispensable.
Freud believes:1. The spiritual level of human beings is divided into consciousness, preconsciousness and subconsciousness from shallow to deep. Some people's psychological activities can be perceived by themselves. As long as we focus our attention, we will find that there is a continuous flow of ideas, images or emotions in our hearts. This kind of psychological activity that can be realized by ourselves is called consciousness. However, some instinctive impulses, suppressed desires or vitality occur in an unconscious potential, because they do not conform to social morals and their own reason, they cannot enter the consciousness and are perceived by the individual, this latent undetectable thought , Mentality, desire and other psychological activities are called subconscious. It is the intermediary link between subconscious and consciousness. Memories about events and experiences that can be extracted with proper effort or attention. The human heart has an inspection function, that is, the human spirit will suppress those unreasonable memories and desires, let them stay in the subconscious, and make people no longer remember, so these are the things we most easily forget, For example, who we have humiliated, who cheated, who borrowed the money and did not pay back. However, the inspection function will be weakened. When the person is in a coma or sleep, the inspection function will be weakened, so those potential desires will come out and be mixed into consciousness to form a dream. Therefore, dreams are the fulfillment of wishes.
However, this mixing of potential desires must be disguised, otherwise the inspection function will still be found, so the dream scene is different from the real desires. And the more unwilling to be recognized by society or contrary to values, the more disguised and distorted.2. Personality is divided into three parts: the self, the self and the superego.3. The psychological defense mechanism is a defensive function of the self. In many cases, there are often contradictions and conflicts between the superego and the self and the self and the reality. At this time, people will feel pain and anxiety. At this time, the self can Unconsciously, in some way, adjust the relationship between a conflicting party, so that the superego's supervision can be accepted, and at the same time, the desire of the self can be satisfied in some form, thereby alleviating anxiety and eliminating pain. This is Self-defense mechanism.",Mulholland Drive
209,TheEtherWalk,The most terrifying movie ever made,10,4 February 2010,"David Lynch's films are like abstract paintings. They may look simple on the surface, but the more you look, the more they seem to have eerie meanings behind them, told in alien tongues and perhaps wholly unsolvable. Mulholland drives begins with two women, an actress played by Naomi Watts, and a woman who loses her memory in a car crash and winds up needing the other's help, played by Laura Harring. Together they try to piece together who she is, and things start to get stranger as the characters try to unravel a mystery beyond comprehension. Justin Theroux shows up as a young director whose life begins to fall apart after he makes a casting decision against the wills of some very strange men who drink expensive coffee. His sections of the film give some comic relief, even though he is trapped in the same inexplicable nightmare as the women. The plot itself isn't really important to follow, and since it is quite confusing and fragmented, you can simply let the experience of the film wash over you without worrying about understanding it as you would a normal story.Despite it's surreal overtones and disjointed structure, this movie has some great insights into the (un)realities of Hollywood. It is both a homage to film noir and a cautionary tale of fame and jealousy. Betty (Watts) is a young up and coming actress who seems to have her whole life ahead of her, and a golden glow around her head. Lynch uses an interesting technique when she is first introduced, by dubbing all the lines in ADR. This has the effect of making the acting seem horrible, but there's a purpose. The scene is unreal in it's bright happiness, and the two people she is with continue to smile unnaturally when they leave. Without giving too much away, Betty's persona evolves over the course of the film, and really lets Naomi Watts show a great range of emotions, from purposefully naive to broken and haggard. When Betty goes to an audition, and acts brilliantly, the difference between her acting and her real persona is staggering, and shows you how good of a performance it really is by Watts. The audition scene also shows how fantasy becomes her reality, and this has parallels across the entire film. Nothing is truly what it seems, and the seemingly innocent relationship between the two women starts to drift into darker territory as reality steadily seeps through. When the truth is finally revealed, you will realize that Mulholland Drive has taken you from naive bliss straight to the horrors of Hell.Lynch is a master of subtle film-making. Instead of using music in some scenes, he uses low-pitched background noises. He used these in Eraserhead as well, and they are a great way of making an atmosphere of anxious tension. However the musical score by Angelo Badalamenti is spellbinding. The cinematography is brilliant as well, using blur effects, first-person perspectives and strange close-ups to draw you right into the movie. One scene in particular draws the viewer's attention because at first it seems to be completely removed from the main storyline, and it is. But since Lynch does nothing by accident, this means it is the most important scene in the movie. (In an interview he refers to this type of scene as the ""duck's eye"".) A man tells his friend that he had a dream about this restaurant, and that there's a man waiting behind it, a creature of sheer horror. So they go outside to see if the man is there. Just like there may be a man behind the diner, there is a presence, an ineffable malevolent force lurking behind every frame, word and scene of this movie. I know of no other film able to create such a profound uneasiness, as if some otherworldly revelation were near at hand.The film is also visually stunning, with the colour blue mysteriously permeating many scenes, and the set designs and dialogue containing little clues throughout the film. The mystery is as compelling as it is chilling. Even though there may be no answer to what's really going on in the movie, you will want to watch it more than once to figure out all the different layers, and they are mostly cohesive if you look at it right. Some say it is just a dream and reality juxtaposed, but it's so much more than that. There is another whole layer of inexplicable, subconscious terror permeating the film, and just when you think you have it all figured out, the last scene explodes like a final question in an impossible riddle. Mulholland Drive is a fully realized world of harrowing suspense and dreamlike unreality. There are moments in this film that are so psychologically affecting that they will never leave your mind, and it's final images will leave you shellshocked. Overall it is a roller-coaster of emotions and an endlessly intriguing puzzle. Lynch's storied career may well have hit it's peak with this, an absolute masterpiece.",Mulholland Drive
210,travisimo,One Weird Dream,9,27 February 2004,"After watching Mulholland Drive, I just wondered, ""What in the world did I just watch?!"" Even though I was confused and perplexed during the movie (particularly the second half), I was still gripped by what I was watching. I especially enjoyed Naomi Watts' performance, especially considering her character(s) goes from one extreme to the next.Unlike most movies I've seen, Mulholland Drive made me think afterwards and made me want to research it out. I found Salon.com's assessment of the movie to be most helpful and interesting. It may not be 100% correct, but it did shed some light on the story.This movie was also the first time I've ever watched anything from the cult director David Lynch. Say whatever you want about Mr. Lynch, but for better or for worse, you definitely know when you're watching one of his movies. Most directors don't really stick out to me. They are talented, yes, but their contribution to a movie doesn't necessarily mean I can obviously notice their personal touch. David Lynch has his own offbeat style that's very recognizable, much like Stanley Kubrick and Quentin Tarantino. You may love David Lynch's style or you may be baffled by it (or both), but you know that a David Lynch movie is not going to be a run-of-the-mill picture.Overall, I'd say that Mulholland Drive is definitely a unique movie, which is probably an understatement. The story, while confusing, has a lot of depth to it if you ever want to research it out. The acting is well done, headed by Naomi Watts' powerful dual performance and Laura Harring's strong, quiet performance. Like the story, the direction is confusing, but it does stick out. As for the visuals, they will stick in your head for quite a while. I think Roger Ebert said it best that after watching Mulholland Drive, you'll tell your friends that you watched the strangest movie, much like you would tell them that you had the strangest dream.My IMDb Rating: 9/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A- (Almost Perfect)",Mulholland Drive
211,marissas75,A puzzle well worth exploring,9,5 July 2006,"""Mulholland Drive"" is one of the most critically acclaimed movies of this decade, as well as one of the most talked-about. Its dreamlike ambiguity and refusal to explain itself (director David Lynch will only discuss the movie in the most cryptic terms) guarantees that viewers will always debate it. Not bad for something that started out as a failed TV pilot.At first, ""Mulholland Drive"" has standard mystery elements to it, such as the gorgeous amnesiac brunette (Laura Elena Harring) who calls herself ""Rita"" after Rita Hayworth, and the sparkly blonde aspiring actress, Betty (Naomi Watts) who thinks it would be fun to make like Nancy Drew and help Rita discover her true identity. You can easily see how this set-up could have become a TV show, which only makes the movie's twists more astonishing. But even in the earlier, sunnier parts of the movie, things lurk in the shadowsbehind dumpsters, in corporate offices or cheap apartmentsand eventually these physical and psychological demons take control. Characters switch identities, people and objects return in surprising ways, and the already complicated puzzle becomes about ten times stranger. I won't say too much more about ""Mulholland Drive""'s mysteries, because you can easily find theories, explanations, and debates online. (What did people ever do when they watched these kinds of ambiguous movies before the Internet?) Perhaps the biggest clue is one of the movie's themes: this is Los Angeles, a city where fantasy seems more real than reality does.Watts made her name with her accomplished performance here. She goes from over-the-top wholesomeness to romantic passion to self-loathing despair, and succeeds at the tricky task of being an actress playing an actress in Betty's stunning audition scene. But I'm surprised that Harring hasn't found comparable success: not only is she beautiful, she makes for a touchingly vulnerable Rita. The baffling nature of ""Mulholland Drive"" is not alone what makes it a great movie. Rather, the best part of the movie is that it is captivating and entertaining enough to make you want to decipher it. Sequences such as the ""Club Silencio"" centerpiece are so vivid and haunting that it's a pleasure to try to figure out how they fit into the overall scheme.",Mulholland Drive
212,lingmeister,Absolutely mind blowing,9,29 May 2002,"This movie is the perfect venue for David Lynch's style.  He could go as strange as he wants because under the given circumstances, it is totally plausible.When I started watching the movie, I found the character Betty totally unbelievable, thinking that is not the Hollywood that any newcomer encounters.  Instead, she should be wasting away somewhere or doing tricks at Sunset Blvd.  Toward the end, I realizes how right I was in thinking that way.Once could watch this film countless times and pick up the little symbolism in each scene, but it shouldn't take more than one sitting to understand it, and once you get the general outline, you realize nothing is as it seems.  I picked it up right away, but given this being a Lynch film, I wasn't sure which one was reality and which one wasn't.  But toward the end, one realizes which one is real due to the character superimpositions.After the nice little movie ""The Straight Story,""  David Lynch is back in full force.",Mulholland Drive
213,rmarkd,"Haunting, beautiful. I can't stop thinking about it.",9,6 November 2001,"First, let me say I've never seen a Lynch film, but was forewarned to the strangeness. Second, let me say I'm not an artsy movie snob, so I don't automatically like a movie I don't get.That being said, Mulholland Drive has been stuck in my mind for three days, and the more I think about it, the more I love it. The more I think about it, the more I want to think about it. After the movie, I was in a non drug-induced daze for two hours. While trying to sleep, it kept me up until midnight, then 1AM on the next night (not too late, but these are weeknights).So, what's it all about? Well, part of the fun is finding out yourself since some stuff is vague and subject to individual interpretation. I give my 2 cents below. But basically, we mainly follow two women in LA. One is a pretty, almost too bubbly blonde, looking to be an actress. The second is a mysterious brunette (Rita) with amnesia from a car accident. Beth helps Rita figure out her mystery while also starting her acting career. Then, something happens throws all of the above in the sh**can.Yeah, doesn't sound like much, and I wish I could grab everyone serious about watching movies by the shoulders and tell them to watch this movie. There is a mystery behind it, a bizarre ""normalcy"" (the overabundant smiling), a mid movie twist, and one scene with a lone woman playing a Spanish version of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" which is hauntingly beautiful and worth the price of the movie ticket alone. Like the movie, I can't get the song out of my mind.I'll admit that many will not like this movie and even say that I cannot defend this movie. You either like it or don't understand how anyone can. I love it, and I'm not going to argue why. However, what I will say is that it's not as open-ended and unintelligible as it seems.Remember that dreams need a different interpretation and that thoughts in reality can become distorted in dreams. Below are my thoughts on the movie which will surely be different a week from now.It's not perfect, but it's close. If I could give a 9.9, I would, but IMDB-wise, it's a 9/10. Beautiful, haunting. I wish I could sit there and watch it again for the first time.SPOILERS!!! PLEASE DO NOT READ ON UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN IT AT LEAST ONCE, PREFERABLY TWICE. Note: These aren't truths, but my opinions. *Plot: It's a flashback. Diane dreams herself to be Beth and Camilla to be Rita. Near the end is reality, though mixed with some dreams. *Diane: Central character. In reality, she came to LA with hopes of making it big. She falls in unrequitted love with Camilla. Her dreams fall apart and she dreams the first part of the movie. *Beth: What Diane wanted to be, a sweet girl who could turn on the sexuality when needed (ie. her and the old guy. Damn erotic scene!) *Camilla: Glamorous superstar who used her charms with the director to win her part. She might have also used her charms on Diane. *Rita: What Diane wished Camilla was. Rita was lost, scared, dependent on Beth. Beth was confident, helpful. *The Camilla Conspiracy: Diane needed a reason as to why Camilla was chosen over her. In her dream, it was a secret conspiracy. She even showed Adam's interest in her, but that he could do nothing. *the cowboy: In reality, just a character caught in a glance. He's nothing. However, in a dream, things get changed around. He becomes a major player in why Camilla was picked. *Beth and Rita romantically: Diane was rejected by Camilla. In her dream, Beth told Rita she was in love with her and Rita reciprocated (and how!). It was how Beth wanted it to be. *Llorando (the song) and Silencio: ??? Perhaps a signification of the dream about to end (sometimes when I'm about to wake, my dream changes). The play kept going back to things being an illusion, like the dream. Llorando was Beth's realization of her sadness, played in Spanish because Camilla was (I think) *The box: portal to reality. *The clumsy killer: in reality, he kills Camilla. She has him in mind, but in her dream, portrays him as a bungling idiot. *Coco: In reality, a cold woman who couldn't care less about Beth. In the dream, a caring motherlike figure. *The scary face dude: ?? *The dead girl in the room: ?? *Why Rita wanted to change her hair: ?? *Billy Ray Cyrus: Absolutely no clue. Again, look at the dream as the way Beth wants it to be, remembering that dreams are distorted visuals of the sub-conscious mind. Things need to be interpreted. *The little people:Lastly, I may be totally wrong in all of this and welcome others' opinions.

214,hippiedj,"Signature Lynch, but what if instead the two leads were MALE?",7,15 May 2002,"First and foremost: Mulholland Drive is indeed a beautiful film, despite what may seem like me bitching somewhat within the next several paragraphs. Just read on...I'm glad I saw Mulholland Drive and yes, I enjoyed it. To an extent. David Lynch is a master of the surreal, and it seems to me that by bowing to the current ""hot lesbian fantasy"" trend, he messed up. If Lynch wanted to be more bold and make the bizarre story of Mulholland Drive more mysterious and intriguing, he could have tried putting two males as the lead characters. Ah, you say that's box office poison, well I say Mulholland Drive wasn't expected to be a blockbuster to begin with (the same goes for his other films). Lynch needs to keep on his toes to be more original with each film, and by doing what so many OTHER films are doing and trying to make ANOTHER film with lipstick lesbians is getting tired very fast.It's funny that some people are gushing about how beautiful the two love scenes are in the film. I think these are people like Roger Ebert, who automatically gives a thumbs up to any film with a lesbian element. I actually laughed throughout one of the two scenes, as Laura Elena Harring's gravity-defying breasts were just too much of a distraction. Looked like any soft core scene you can catch late night on Cinemax. In that second scene where she lay there saying ""You drive me wild,"" while her breasts are pointing straight up... it's impossible to keep a straight face after that. It would just have made more sense to have these characters as men, as it is SET in Hollywood and the gay male sensibility would be more appropriate. Apparently though it's only those that seek comfort in Howard Stern and The Man Show that would have been uncomfortable watching those two ""love"" scenes the way I feel they should have been.Still, Mulholland Drive is one of those fun Lynch puzzle pieces that keeps you thinking and forces you to go back and view a few more times to figure things out. Which is why too that his philosophy that DVDs should not have chapter stops is a big mistake -- for a 2 1/2 hour film, a DVD without chapter stops is a frustrating thing. You can't go back to certain scenes to reassess clues. And the fact that Universal wants (at its first retail release) $32.99 for it (though I'm sure many of you like me paid about $22.99), no chapter stops and basically no extras is not a smart thing to do to fans of Lynch. At least the Blue Velvet DVD thru MGM had a nifty easter egg on it.Since the film was originally made as a pilot for the ABC network, it's almost obvious where the film goes off on a wilder tangent for the theatrical production. Still, the cinematography is flawless, Angelo Badalementi's score is once again unique, and even if you're left scratching your head it's worth the experience. How in the HECK did Lynch get Ann Miller to be in this film! (How did he get Hope Lange for Blue Velvet?) I was glad that Lynch offered 10 clues on the DVD packaging to help you with the story, but I'm still figuring some of them out. Just as in Twin Peaks, I believe sometimes things that are ""clues"" aren't really that at all, but just weirdness that exists within the film and not having actual relevance to solving it.You can say I have a love/hate thing going on with Mulholland Drive. I know for sure though, if Lynch continues to make more films that get closer and closer to Spice Channel productions, then I'll be jumping OFF the Lynch bandwagon for sure.",Mulholland Drive
215,mbhgkmsgg,An endless mystery,10,13 November 2020,"Well, where do I even start? Mulholland Drive is easily on the most bizarre, fascinating and perplexing movies that I have ever seen. And I have a feeling that it will stay on my mind for a very long time. I haven't been able to stop thinking about what I saw. And no matter how much I think about it, I just can't seem to find an explanation that I like. Indeed, I'm almost certain that I will never find such an explanation.Is it a dream? Is it real? Is any of it real? Who knows. I certainly don't. I love how innocent the movie is after the events of the first scene. Two friends living and enjoying their lives. I also love how a chance encounter at a diner completely turns the movie around. That was also the point where I became completely enchanted by the film I was watching. But perhaps the thing I love the most is the moment the key finally enters the lock. Because that's where the movie really does a complete 180, that's also where my mind just about resigned itself.No matter how many explanations and interpretations I read - and trust me, I read many - I can't seem to find one that satisfies me. As soon as the movie finished, I had to go and read what other people had thought it meant. Was I completely wrong? Or was I on the right track? As it turns out, nobody seems to be any closer to an answer than I am.
I thought that either the first half of the film was a dream, or that Betty/Diane had gone crazy and was unable to identify her real self from her fantasized self. There are certain moments in the film that support these theories.However, the more I think about this film and the longer I ponder these different possibilities, the less certain I become of them. And therein lies the beauty of Mulholland Drive. It is filled with endless possibilities and interpretations. No matter how many times I see this film, I doubt that I will ever be any closer to finding an explanation that satisfies me. And that's what makes it so great. We can all spend countless hours trying to find the ""real"" meaning of this film without making any progress. But as soon as we accept the fact that it doesn't exist, and we instead try to find some personal meaning, we can, perhaps, feel satisfied.I can't fault those who say that this of one of the best films of this new millennia, perhaps even one of the best of all time. Mulholland Drive manages to be a mystery film that never solves its own mystery nor its meaning. It leaves us with countless interpretations and paths, and no matter which one we choose, we will never really know whether we are right or wrong.",Mulholland Drive
216,lostintwinpeaks,"Lynch's Best Since ""Blue Velvet""",10,16 June 2002,"While ""Wild At Heart"", ""Twin Peaks"" - The TV Series, ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"", and ""Lost Highway"", among others, were all excellent this ranks as Lynch's best since his divine ""Blue Velvet"", arguably the first real American surrealist film.Many of the people I've watched this with (i've seen it a few times) have dismissed it as silly and shallow, just a - to quote one friend - ""movie with no plot disguised as a weird film noir"".Not at all. If anything this movie is a deep and indeed deeply interesting & intoxicating exploration of human life and - of course - Hollywood!Too easily dismissed as a simple ""it turned out to be all a dream"" movie, this is best left to the individual (with the help of Lynch's 10 clues) to figure out, and interpret on their own. Everyone will have a different opinion for what Lynch's (including many of his trademarks - red drapes, unusual characters like the Cowboy, etc.) symbolism means, his clues, strange plot twists, etc.The direction and script as usual with Lynch are both top-notch, the photography is stunning, and the cast is excellent, particularly Naomi Watts, who gives a fantastic levelled performance both as the sweetly innocent & idealistic Betty and as the troubled bitter Diane.A stunning mystery thriller/romantic drama that is in itself a mystery to unfold. When a movie can let the audience participate and interact with it to an extent such as this, it is quite simply marvellous.Have fun figuring it out! And enjoy!",Mulholland Drive

218,guyb,What a letdown,5,14 April 2002,"We've been big fans of Lynch ever since ""Twin Peaks.""  We were very excited to finally see the release of the DVD of Mulholland Dr.   The first 2 hours were great film noir.  But the last half hour really threw us a curve. There was no resolution of all the usual wierd Lynch subplots and characters.   We couldn't even follow the main plot and characters.  We were just exhausted by the end with no satisfaction.   The DVD didn't have an commentary option nor chapter selection (very unsual), so you had no chance to go back and try to figure it out.  What a shame.",Mulholland Drive
219,Balthazar-5,A magnificent masterpiece,9,11 March 2002,"Where would the cinema be without David Lynch? Mulholland Drive is just the latest in what must be the most ambitious directorial career in mainstream (well, fully funded) American cinema. Lynch is the only filmmaker who seems willing to actually use what is one of the cinema's most unique features - namely the freedom to represent actions in non-cohesive space-time frames. In this case, (trying not to spoil) the film has a very unusual relationship to the mind of one of the characters. So what we are watching is not so much what happens (or doesn't happen) as the response of one of the characters to it.Yes, Keaton has done it. Yes Bunuel (sorry about the tilde) has done it. Yes Resnais has done it... but Lynch makes it part of his universe.",Mulholland Drive
220,kyle_c,*** 1/2 out of ****,8,8 September 2002,"""Mulholland Drive"" is a movie that, like most of Lynch's work, will tend to polarize its audiences.  Many find the seemingly senseless plot to be unnecessarily confusing and annoying.  Others, like me, find the dreamlike atmosphere and nightmarish tone of the movie to be fascinating.  Either way, everybody will agree that the movie doesn't really resolve itself in the end, but that isn't really the point of the movie.  If you can just appreciate the excellent direction and acting, and try to ignore the fact that it doesn't really make sense, you will enjoy this movie.",Mulholland Drive

Throughout the movie I was trying to piece things together and I just can't but I can't stop watching it either, the less it makes sense the more I want it. It doesn't matter how hard you try to piece this together it will all make sense in the end once it all connects you will see just how brilliant David Lynch really is, just surrender yourself to it.",Mulholland Drive
222,jcanettis,A Film That Blows Your Mind,10,13 July 2006,"Here is a film that will leave you wondering of what has really happened in it, and yet keep you highly amazed and excited. David Lynch has achieved this difficult combination with his masterpiece ""Mulholland Drive"".The story in the beginning is quite straightforward: A girl (Harring) narrowly escapes her murder thanks to a car accident that kills her would-be killers. However, the accident brings amnesia to her, so she wanders aimlessly around, until she finds refuge to a house. In this house, Betty, an aspiring young actress (Watts) takes her under her protection and tries to help her find out what has happened. From some point onward, however, nothing is straightforward anymore: Who is really the girl? Who is really Betty? How are the two of them connected? The movie is open to several interpretations, but after reading some excellent IMDb message board postings, it was easy for me to come up with a solid conclusion of what has really happened. Of course, I am not going to reveal it here, as I will spoil the magic of this excellent film! What I can say however, is that David Lynch has produced a film that is full of symbolism, hidden clues, and art. Although it is basically a ""crime"" film, in practice it is far beyond that. Dream and reality are intertwined, and in the end everything is turned upside down.The performances of the two lead actresses could not be better suited for this film: They are both excellent and fit perfectly in their roles. Of course, acting is good across the board, as well.Lynch's definitely best movie: 10/10.",Mulholland Drive
223,DonaldDooD,"Just Because You Can Be Original, Doesn't Mean You Should Be",4,17 August 2014,"If it weren't for Mulholland Dr.'s gimmicks, I don't think many would like it. The characters are flat, boring, and undefined. Its supposed to be a tragic tale, but I barely know anything about our main, so I'm not too concerned she shot herself. But Mulholland Dr amuses people because of its unique progression, its dream-like tone, and its mystery begging to be solved. But what's our reward for solving the puzzle? Although Lynch's style makes everything open to interpretation, the majority of the film doesn't seem to have any importance to the universe's reality. Its a vision of what could have been, almost a satire of television shows. But it turns out the reality for our main character is far darker. So we spent most of the movie being fed a lie, the reality obfuscated for whatever reason. Even in the few minutes we are closer to the truth, the strange characters and events persist. While intriguing and unsettling, it made me feel like I was viewing Betty from the wrong end of binoculars. And no matter how good your film is acted, written, shot, or produced, without a solid cast, let alone a lead, I'm unimpressed.Angry art snobs, desperate to defend their worshiped pieces, will complain that viewers want their messages on a silver platter. But they are too far up on their high horses to realize that artistic opinion is subjective, and if everything is art, than nothing is art. Not everything acclaimed needs to be respected by everyone. As a criticism of Hollywood, so much is lost to the bizarre structure. As a mystery, there is little reason for me to solve a puzzle where the pieces aren't even defined. Its a distraction, with a few good moments, but at the end of the day, this film didn't stick with me.",Mulholland Drive
224,stevetseitz,Not entirely unsuccessful.,7,22 April 2002,"Some elements of this film seemed beneath David Lynch and almost had a Coen Bros. feel to them. On the other hand, a dark subject matter like this would scare most directors off. Excellent performances and subtle editing and cinematography set this movie apart from standard Hollywood fare and yet the film with it's lavish sets and locations can't help but remind the viewer of a Hollywood era that has come and gone. The film seems to falter only after climaxing prematurely and slowly fades, but it won't fade from our memory just yet.",Mulholland Drive

Dude doesnt give a s*it who likes his films & never explains anything. From the start, this film introduces weird characters & scenes that dont make sense. The last hour feels like a Drug addict is on an acid trip & having the craziest nightmares. But the last 10 mins made me realize there is unparalleled brilliance in all this incoherent madness. I had so many questions so I turned to Internet for answers & I was blown away. Apart from a ballistic performance from Naomi Watts & Great Music, this film has a brilliant non-linear narrative which erases the boundary between reality & dream.

226,ansharora-12638,Silencio!,9,12 August 2020,"Shh! David Lynch hates it when people try to understand his movie and then spread the word. For me, it was like 2001:A Space Odyssey. Confusing at times, craftfully made and left you haunted by the end. It is not a movie which will give you the answers by the end of the movie in 30 minutes or so, it is a thriller which will keep going on until the last minute of the movie.According to me, no it was not vague or just a series of jumbled events. I know this movie had a meaning and I know the doe-eyed Naomi Watts was dreaming for half of the movie and she killed Camilla because she was her ex-lover and she was marrying her director leaving Naomi. So, that's why the ""2 detectives"" came looking for her and that's why at the end she decided to kill herself because of the fear and the lunacy she was experiencing knowing how guilty she was. David Lynch's movie is open to discussion but better not discussed. There are still some things I didn't clarify about the movie and I would like to keep it that way because I want you to think 2 weeks after watching this movie, while eating your eggs and bacon that ""who was Aunt Ruthie? How was Rita/Camilla amnesiac? Where was the accident? What was the director doing? Who was the real actress in the movie?Let your imagination run amock. But, focus on your life, work and family too.Cheers.",Mulholland Drive

229,jimi99,what it's about,10,4 April 2003,"SPOILER: That is, if there can be a spoiler for a film that has so many interpretations.  However, if everyone can agree that the central character (indeed, the ONLY character) has committed suicide, the film can only be interpreted as this soul's struggle in the bardo/afterlife to escape from that particular life, to let go of it after examining it and the karma it has accumulated.  Regardless of one's view of the ""afterlife"" one must assume that the soul must go through some kind of hell to shed the personality and the human life's ""sins"" to be able to let go and enter ""heaven"".  This is thought of in many religious traditions as a dream, the Big Sleep as it were, from which there is no awakening beyond liberation or rebirth.  I believe that David Lynch has read, even studied, the Book of the Dead, and in this intensely spiritual film, has left the realm of human sleeping dreams of his other films, and entered the realm of the between-life state, in a most brilliant way that cannot be apprehended intellectually but, because it has been shown to be such a popular movie, is communicated directly and understood through the unconscious, the collective unconscious that knows the truth of this teaching.There are some elements of the film that can only be understood through Mr. Lynch's unconscious, which is appropriate in that it is a personal meditation on death, first and foremost.  Some elements are cinematic, some are probably riffs that Lynch and his collaborators came up with, coyote-like, cosmic jokes with no punch-lines, or a million punch-lines. The bardo is inhabited by demons and guides, sometimes cloaked in the same guise, like the old couple, who in life were probably someone the lost soul had flown into LA with, memories of the past life no longer filtered through the conscious memory of the living, but seen as just a dream, one that must be worked out for the soul to go onward.The physical location of Mulholland Drive is very much a bardo for probably many souls, including this poor woman who came to Hollywood with hopes and ideals, fell into a lesbian affair with a woman whose career is taking off as hers is failing, and kills herself.  How she deals with it afterwards is what Lynch's supremely important work is all about.",Mulholland Drive
230,shaid,Who is Rita? Who cares...,3,25 March 2002,"*May contain spoilers* *May contain spoilers*David Lynch has always had an eye for the strange and the bizarre. Most of his films are full with eccentric characters and have enough clues to fill some extra films. So the real question is whether or not you can relate to his characters. If the answer is yes(like in : The Straight Story or The Elephant Man), than you will like the film. If not(like in: Blue Velvet or Wild at Heart) than you are in troubles.This film, which is hard to describe exactly about what it is without revealing too much of the plot, begins with a car accident which leads to a loss of memory by a woman, which later we will know as Rita(Laura Harring). She is helped by an aspired actress called Betty(Namoi Watts). From now on it's free ride in the world of David Lynch. As usual it is full of characters that come and disappear never to be seen again. As always it is full with clues that suppose to help you solve the mystery. That is if you pay attention closely. However nothing can help you if the 2 main characters are simply boring and not interesting enough for you to care. And that for me was the low point of the film. I couldn't stand the main characters. I couldn't care less who is Rita or what is she hiding from and I couldn't stand the irritating Betty. So for me the film was lost at the moment I realized that I don't like the main characters. From here it was easy to see that the film(originally a pilot for a series, which was rejected by ABC and was extended to film)is nothing but re-telling of old things which Lynch himself has done better before(see Twin Peaks) and therefore boring.It is interesting to see that a film as boring as this one, has produced so many interpretations, that in itself suppose to help people understand the film better. Some of these interpretations are better and more interesting than the film itself. So here is another one: The first part of the film is a dream. In a dream you take things from reality and place them in another order. In some cases you make your life in the dream a better place than your real life. In the 2nd part of the film we get to know the ""real"" story. And the relation between reality and dream can provide for another film. But Lynch is not interested in that. He just want to play with his characters and with the audience. He seems to have succeeded. Most of the audience like the film very much. I didn't. As far as I am concerned it was a waste of time and money. There were 2 points that stood above the film: The beautiful music(as always) from Angelo Badalamenti and the cinematography. But that's not enough to hold a film for 145 minute.In short avoid. Unless you are a fan of David Lynch. If you are, you will find here plenty of what you like.",Mulholland Drive
231,marydm-43470,Apex cinematic experience,10,29 April 2019,"Forget looking for plots, interpretations of who is who and who is doing what to whom. Mulholland Drive is not like that.
It's a unique and divinely inspired mad piece of cinema, living and dictating its own terms.
Every scene is a feast of mood, suggestiveness, emotional depth and subconscious impact. You don't watch a movie like Mulholland Drive, you allow yourself to become immersed in its flow.
An immersive cinematic experience. That's the best way to describe it and to experience it. There are technical gems in every scene one can write volumes about. Revenge on a faithless wife in the form of pink paint poured into her jewellery box full of jewellery? Oh yeah!
I've lost count of how many times I've watched Mulholland Drive. It's as surprising as the very first time.

I cannot get enough of David Lynch, he's really one of the only director's who is not influenced by the Hollywood propaganda, a propaganda that ruins artistic movies such as this one.  I do not consider this movie surreal though, I really thought that it was well done, but surrealism to me is more like a dream like stature where your falling down a black hole and can't get out of it.  I consider Jan Svankmeir the clay animator more of a surrealist than this movie was.  Mulholland Drive a mystery perhaps, but not a surrealist movie.  Great movie from start to finish, especially the scene where it hints out the bad dream sequence with the two guys sitting in the restaurant.  Great job Lynch.",Mulholland Drive

234,Kashmirgrey,Strange Just To Be Strange Is Ho-Hum,5,7 September 2007,"Let's be honest. David Lynch films are cult films and cult films are popular because their cult films. It doesn't mean that they're very good film making. ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""... I rest my case.Initially, Lynch's method for generating ideas seemed to be: a) Drop acid. b) Remember your trip. c) Make a movie out of it.Now the method seems to have changed to: a) Drop acid. b) Watch one of your own films. c) Pretend that what you saw is something new. d) Make a new movie out of it.Granted, I am intrigued by Lynch's films, but then I have never dropped acid. Is there some connection there? Perhaps, but once you see one Lynch film then you have basically seen them all. They're all bizarre, but I suspect only for the mere sake of being bizarre. Further, Lynch has done the same ""bizarre"" over and over to the point that it isn't even bizarre anymore. He's become his own cliché.For me, ""Mulholland Dr."", of all the Lynch films, was one of his better efforts. It did not have the snail pace of some of his others, such as ""Lost Highway"". Naomi Watts was excellent in her portrayal of a Hollywood hopeful who cares for a strange woman suffering from amnesia. The story floats around their relationship and their investigatory efforts to discover the woman's identity.Just as in other Lynch films, people trade bodies, lives are threatened, devilish figures speak in riddles slowly, and women get naked. To the latter, the couple of scenes with Watts and Laura Harring getting down and Sapphoian might delight the nude-celeb groupies out there, but beyond that, they are shamefully... embarrassingly gratuitous. C'mon!",Mulholland Drive
235,pik923,Why?,8,11 August 2012,"I give it a rating of 7 because the acting is great! It was an important film for many cast and crew members and yes it won awards. What bothers me the most is why are homosexual men and women STILL accepted on the screen if they are portrayed as crazy, or murderers, psychopaths, etc etc etc. Yes of course it gave a certain edginess to the film - wasn't that the whole idea? But still - David Lynch - you should do better than that! Really! It gets boring to see these roles produced over and over and over and over again.With that said, the film is interesting, there are some wonderful moments in the film, and I enjoy film noir, which is the wrong term for this film - how can it be film noir when it's in color? But then again, ahhhh all those young film makers.The film could have been even more glorious if shot in black and white, but then we wouldn't have seen pink - hmmmm.And the film is also very choppy - you have to go beyond beyond beyond to grasp the context of the film, because it is sometimes so far out into the world of David Lynch, one doesn't know what happened. I think, unfortunately, every one got nervous because of time factors, so editing was done to keep it within 2.5 hours, which again is unfortunate. I think if the film was able to play out longer, then the story line would be more comprehensible and much more interesting....but then again...If there is a director's cut and a DVD with David's editing and how he wanted the film to really be seen, I would like to see that one....however that would not remove the stigma, the heaviness and unfortunate script of lesbian lovers gone mad.",Mulholland Drive
236,AbhiMathews,Don't mix dreams for reality,3,16 November 2014,"Fantasies play a large but sometimes secretive role in our lives. Imagination is so strong we become blinded by it at times, and it can certainly make for an entertaining story.Mullholland Dr. is a series of inconclusive scenes—starting from the elusive opening to the realization that we can't run from our demons. Whether it's for the unique perspective or thick plot, this film will definitely entertain and challenge viewers. Although this film has a lot of great features, the acting and development at various points of the movie were both lacklustre. The oddity and stark change in emotions of the characters was also incredulous. It arguably adds to the entire mystery, but pulls away from the viewing experience and makes the story feel forced. Lynch is certainly a great director with tricks up his sleeves, but playing them all at once and in poor combination convolutes the story unnecessarily. Surrealism is best when uncultured, but this movie tries to encapsulate different premises and then head a completely contrived direction afterwards. Not a bad idea itself, but execution is key. It is certainly a film worth watching even if just for the interesting perspective, but flaws throughout Mulholland Dr. make it difficult to enjoy.",Mulholland Drive
237,moimoichan6,Silenzio,10,26 February 2007,"There's certainly a lot to tell about ""Mulholand Dr."", and many theories to create around Roy Orbisson, a Twist contest, some whisperings in the dark, kiss me deadly, TV shows or pink painting, but the wisest thing to do is certainly not to speak about the movie, in order to hide the false keys and to forgot them, endlessly lost into the labyrinth's mind of the movie.But, for I have a minimum of lines to write, let's talk about the fear that desperately haunts every Lynch's character (and maybe every movie character) : the fear of nonexistence. It happens in a theater this time, where a ghostly woman sings a Spanish version of ""Crying"". The two heroines, one last time Betty and Rita, listen to the song, and fallow the lyrics. They're beginning to cry. ""Silenzio"" makes them realize that the reality of their world isn't so efficient, that Betty's dream of cinema may only be that : a dream. The time to wake up has arrive for the pretty girl. And then, everything goes backward, like the midget of ""Twin Peaks"". The crescendo of love is now over and the disillusion begins : poor Betty and Rita, you're only interpretations, phantasms of a Hollywood dream, of a fiction that's about to destroy you. And if that destruction is your only justification, it also dooms you forever.There are no freedom of choices for the characters of this movie, that just fallows an unpredictable (yet over rational script), witch plays with improbable symbols to edict his fatum (like death as a blue key or suicide as a blue box ?). All they have left is this fear of nonexistence. It always comes, in Lynch's movies, from a first deception : the reality never really fits the dream. Here, it's a swing contest that brought Betty to Hollywood, but the dream word's reality looks a lot like a nightmare of disillusion, where the only thing you can do to survive, is to imagine a new life, a ""film noir"" world where you pretend to be someone else. That's why to me this movie carries an infinite sadness, especially when you realize that the innocence and naivety of Betty at the beginning of the movie is only and illusion, and that reality has already transforms he in something horrible.But the movie is far more than an illustration of this beautiful theme, and really can be see as Lynch's absolute masterpiece (maybe with ""Lost Highway"", but ""Mulholland Dr."" has the great advantage to have a more coherent narrative structure, whereas ""Lost Highway"", witch deals with madness, doesn't really make any sense in the end). After all this, there is ""Ed's black book"", two producers drinking café, ""60 reasons why I love you"", and almost as much things to enumerate if you want to have a fair idea of the film. But I think there's already too much talking about this move, so I'll just say ""Silenzio"".",Mulholland Drive
238,darkjosh,Lynch's Mind-Spinning Masterpiece,9,11 April 2002,"If you've never seen a David Lynch film, you've never seen the kind of disorienting and hypnotic power film can be capable of.  There's no other director like him, no other filmmaker who creates disquiet, illusion, and an uncomfortable atmosphere as he does.   In Mullholland Dr., Lynch's most complex work to date, he has fashioned all of the ideas that intrigued in Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, and Lost Highway into a maddening, surrealistic, and dreamlike tapestry; the audience may or may not know what's happening, but  they are glued to the screen trying logically fit the pieces of the puzzle into an understandable fusion.I realize I've said nothing about the plot of the film, because its so labyrinthine and mind-boggling that it can't be described justifiably in a single review.  The basic storyline however, begins with an actress (Laura Harring) about to be killed by her drivers on Mulholland Dr when a speeding car collides with her limo, leaving her with amnesia.  At the same time, Betty (Watts), an aspiring actress oozing sweetness arrives in Los Angeles from Canada.  They meet at her apartment, and Betty attempts to help ""Rita"" (a name she adopts from a movie poster) regain her identity.Lynch outdoes himself in such cryptic, confusing, sometimes hilarious, but most often odd scenes as a mafioso/film producer spews out his espresso while his partner inexplicably yells out, ""Help me! Help me!""a jealous director coats his cheating wife's jewelry in pink paint, and an evening excursion to a nightclub that climaxes with a heartbreaking rendition of a Roy Orbison song in Spanish.The first 2 hours or so of the movie seem conspicuously solvable, but t a point during all of the story shifts or unravels.  Identities change, some characters disappear, reappear, simply don't come back at all, or maybe become one.  The audience feels jerked around, manipulated, but intrigued by it all.  Logically, we want to know what is going on and try to put all of the pieces together.  There are so many pieces however, that it is nearly impossible to look at the proceedings in a logical sense.This film is not for those who want a straightforward story with a beginning, conflicts, heroes and villains that might as well have name tags on them, or resolutions with a neat and tidy ending.  They key to getting any kind of understanding is to simply let it flow through you the first time you watch it (multiple viewings are required, as with most Lynch films) and understand that much of it is dreamlike, so as with dreams, may have happened or may not have.  You may get it of you may not.  Regardless, it's a fascinating and recommendable journey that's been masterfully created by David Lynch.  9 out of 10",Mulholland Drive
239,zolaaar,Mulholland Drive? That's where I was going!,10,29 April 2005,"The case history of 'Mulholland Dr.' is known: What should had been another excursion (after 'Twin Peaks') into the rivaled field of TV-series ended up abruptly after completing the pilot. It was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment. Lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started new shootings to finish a completely new feature film. The result: One of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade which can be ranked among the best works of David Lynch. His earlier movies 'Eraserhead', 'Blue Velvet' or 'Wild at Heart' kept aloof in an irritating way which hustled the viewer into the role of a voyeur, but never involved him as part of the plot happening such as here.'Mulholland Dr.' is a puzzle where pieces are missing, others obviously were taken from 'Eraserhead' and 'Lost Highway', but it never seemed to be unfinished work. In the internet I came across with a lot of instructions and essays to explain this film. I am aware now that it loses its magic when you try to decipher it completely. All those detailed solution explanations are not only waste but also the questionable attempt to offer an answer where no such thing is completely required. Imagine this scenario: A little child is dissecting his teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specific of that bear lies. Is it because it wants to destroy his toy? Does the secret lie in the teddy bear or actually in the heart of the child? Transferring this to 'Mulholland Dr.' it means innocence is one of the most important conditions to watch and appreciate it.David Lynch succeeds not only to picture the surface of human behavior life but also to grapple with everything beneath that. Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - all that what remains unspoken; emotions that are often repressed. 'Mulholland Dr.' has the intensity calling for a cast that completely takes issue with the substance. Actresses and actors who are ready to follow the visions of the director selflessly.Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux solve their task in such an impressing way that you wouldn't want or couldn't imagine another cast. While their acting at the beginning seems to be a little superimposed you soon will realize that this stereo typing is set in with a purpose to manipulate the viewer and to baffle him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible.When you claim the criterion of a well made film in being able to lose yourself and dive into what you see on screen than Lynch succeeded in making a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that manifest David Lynch's status as one of the most important, creative and courageous directors of the present. Like every film maker who go beyond the limits he is confronted with criticism and ignorance. This will fade as soon as you find the individual key to Lynch's world of films. 'Mulholland Dr.' is more than just a sleeper  it is a must see for everyone who loves ambitious cinema. And besides, the film is a pay-off with Hollywood, in form and content, which in that distinctness was hardly dared before.",Mulholland Drive

It is confusing and convoluted but compelling. The movie should be seen in the theater to appreciate the beauty of the filming but you have to rent it later if you hope to make any sense of it.Part of the problem yet an incredibly unique idea is having the cast play different roles in what are sometimes dream sequences, sometimes flashbacks and sometimes just the regular story. Which by the way isn't really that much. The two leads are involved in a lesbian relationship which Watts takes more seriously and gets dumped when Harring gets to be full fledged star. So naturally she hires a hit man to kill her ex-lover and the film actually starts with the botched attempt on Harring's life.Then the dreams and flashbacks come along with the audience left to figure out what order they belong in.I've heard Lynch described as surrealistic by some while others say he just clips portions of a movie together in any sequence to seem ""artsy"".
I don't know the answer to that but I have to say Lynch is consistently confusing and this film is typical of his work but certainly superior to the vastly overrated ""Blue Velvet""/I gave this 7 out 10 bearing in mind that it should be seen twice or more. 2 1/2 out 4 if you are at the theater and don't want to bother.",Mulholland Drive

243,danjakubik,"An extremely interesting, intelligent, imaginative and absorbing psychological mystery thriller",10,13 August 2010,"""Mulholland Drive"", 2001. Written and Directed by: David Lynch. * * * *This is one of the most expertly directed, imaginative and fascinating psychological mystery drama films I've ever seen. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I really admire this film. I consider it a masterpiece. Made in Lynch's signature dreamlike, dark, weird and complicated storytelling style, involving changed and uncertain identities and character relationships. As a bonus, Lynch manages to skillfully add and execute a scene of dark humor into the story. It's a film to pay close attention to, with clues presented from beginning to end.""Mulholland Drive"" is similar to the weird ""Lost Highway"", 1997, which most critics dismissed as mediocre. Both have strange and complicated characters and stories. Personally, I liked ""Lost Highway"", but admit it's shortcomings. It's all style and not much else. ""Mulholland Drive"" is superior mainly for it's superior direction. For it's genre, it's more engaging and convincing.Clearly, Lynch has mastered his unusual and very unique storytelling style and technique with this film. Lynch's ability to set up scenes of troubled characters in strange circumstances and the acting performance he gets out of them is especially impressive. Naomi Watts and Laura Harring both give very good acting performances, making memorable impressions for the film year of 2001. Another impressive, haunting and hypnotic music score from Angelo Badalamenti.The story of ""Mulholland Drive"" is set in present day Los Angeles and concerns a young woman who suffers from memory loss after a car accident. She befriends a hopeful and optimistic woman newly arrived and seeking acting auditions in Hollywood. This is not quite the truth. The real story is very different. The film is very non-linear and thematic. Very much a thinking person's kind of film. Part real life, part fantasy, part dream and part hallucination. ""Mulholland Drive"" is all of these things. There's a lot of different layers, elements, ideas, characters and themes in the film and it all doesn't come completely together until the chilling sequence of the final minutes of the film. This scene really threw me off a lot, the first time I saw it. That's just Lynch's style. To mystify and hypnotize the audience all the way through and then through in a radical, bizarre twist at the end. I consider myself of above average intelligence and to be highly visually attentive. It took me several viewings of the film to better understand exactly what happened in the story and the meaning and relationship of all these different characters to the two lead characters (Watts and Harring).Nominated for a Best Director Academy Award, nominated for The Golden Palm at Cannes and winner of the Best Director award at Cannes. This film deserved more Academy Award nominations than it received, only Best Director. My guess is the film is simply too weird for Hollywood to fully acknowledge. At least Hollywood gave Lynch a Best Director nomination. Screenplay, cinematography, sound, music score and the lead acting performances of Watts and Harring are all excellent, yet the film received no nominations at all, in these very obvious and deserving categories. Overall, the film looks great. It's hard to believe the budget for this film was only $7 million dollars, far below the typical budget of a Hollywood film of 2001. A must see for any discerning, serious film buff.",Mulholland Drive
244,Oberrated,David Lynch is a beautiful mad-man.,8,5 June 2017,"'Mulholland Drive' goes beyond the conventional film. Mystery thrillers typically challenge their viewers but this one takes it way farther. As one timeline seems to become clear, another one is presented and causes viewers to attempt to piece what they knew previously into what they are newly learning. Not only is it a whole new set of events, it is a constant barrage of twists and turns. With this said, not only is this already a challenging concept, the first story already is strange and confusing to start. Adding in a new series of events only throws its audience another curve-ball. The film challenges its audience from the very start and demands to be thought of well after the film ends. David Lynch created a challenging piece of film in the form of 'Mulholland Drive' and good luck trying to figure his madness out during the film or even after the viewing is over.-- Oberrated --",Mulholland Drive
245,Blondie_,"Brilliant, but you have to be a Lynch fan to enjoy it",10,2 January 2002,"Despite it's confusion, I enjoyed this movie and it is my second Lynch favorite behind Blue Velvet. The plot synopsis is pretty easy to get when you understand that it is a story told from the POV of a dream. This movie will not please those that like straight-forward, concrete films. In the way that the stories in dreams are muddled and out of sequence, so be it with this film. Naomi Watts was absolutely incredible, and her name had better be on the Oscar nominee list in February. But Oscar often shuns movies that are interesting and unusual, so don't count on it, very unfortunately.",Mulholland Drive
246,miro-6,"8,3? Impossible",7,2 May 2002,"It is totally impossible that such ""original"" movie could be appreciated so much by so many people. Impossible. We can go on believing that those are real votes? I can't",Mulholland Drive
247,RolloTomasi,Welcome to the mind of David Lynch,9,1 November 2001,"Many words could describe ""Mulholland Drive"": interesting, unnerving, strange. I'll avoid throwing around terms like 'mind-bending' or 'original.' I can't tell if something is original if I don't completely understand it. It may be exactly like something else for all I know, were I to piece this all together. Something tells me I should be glad I don't understand the way David Lynch's mind works.My suspicion is that Lynch neither wants, nor cares if the audience understands this. This is his vision. He had complete control over this project so what you see is exactly what he wants you to see. Audiences haven't seemed put off by the incomprehensible plot, if it can even be called a plot. I do know that there is sense to be made of this. Out there. Somewhere.When we're first introduced to Naomi Watts' character, Betty, she's an aspiring actress just arriving in Hollywood, ready to go out on auditions. She describes to 'Coco' her landlady how she'd never even been out of Ontario before and now she's in this ""dream place."" That line floats over our heads with little consequence but it's the key to this whole thing. Los Angeles is a dream. It's realities are stranger than any fiction a lunatic could make up. The entire film is this character imagining the way things might have been, and remembering things that happened. This is all intermingled with real events she did not witness. At the end, you'll find yourself guessing what was real and what was imagined. And who people really are.This project represents another personal triumph for this respected film artist. His best work is of the experimental kind, which ""Mulholland"" is. ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Twin Peaks"" also come to mind. Lynch is pleased because he didn't have to compromise anything. He did not re-edit ""Mulholland"" to 'dumb it down' to a level that could be more easily understood by a larger portion of the audience. His last film was totally linear, simple, followed the rules, and was rated G. On his latest, Lynch more than makes up for these departures.    Somehow, and I believe this effect to be intentional, I didn't want it to end. The images and music, lighting, photography, performances, for some reason leave you wanting more. You're not anticipating where the story will go next but rather, what you'll see next, where you'll be taken next.Lynch isn't trying to be weird. He just sees the world that much differently and happens to know how to translate that vision to film. I don't see a Best Picture nomination for this, but a Best Director Oscar nomination is likely, given Lynch's obvious control over this material and execution of his vision.   Though the story of ""Mulholland Falls"" is still lost to me, I have managed to figure out what it's about. If anyone else who reads this wants to contradict me, feel free--I have only begun my study of this film. Film history may show that this film is a manifestation of the way David Lynch sees the town in which he works. It's not a protest, but simply, one perspective. There have been many films about the clash between dreams and reality in Tinseltown. This is the Lynch version. There's nothing political or high-minded this, it's just pure unadulterated filmmaking. Lynch has outsmarted everyone except himself and that is what matters most.Grade: A-",Mulholland Drive
248,evilmatt-3,I couldn't take my eyes off it,9,13 October 2001,"I had the misfortune of REALLY having to go to the bathroom about halfway through this movie.  It was unfortunate because there was just no way I could stop watching _Mulholland Drive_.  This is Lynch at the top of his game: subtle, engaging, and creepy as hell.  Lynch's latest is pure joy to watch and listen to; the tension is almost too thick to breathe in some places.  The dialogue is the best I've seen in a Lynch film: well-paced and meaningful throughout.Narratively and thematically, this movie is very typically Lynch.  It is very reminiscent of _Lost Highway_, but better done and definitely scarier. In fact, just about everything in this movie contributes to a sick discomfort that refuses to let go, until, finally, the audience is allowed to comprehend the illusion when the credits roll.Excellent.  I hope they at least release THIS ONE on DVD.",Mulholland Drive
249,eddiez61,"The Rosetta Stone To David Lynch's Mind, Amazing...",9,22 September 2011,"Puzzles can really tie up your mind. After hours, days, years of toiling to resolve a conundrum you may abandon it, defeated. But a good puzzle - a truly great one - will always beckon you back mercilessly. After first experiencing Mulholland Drive in 2001 I was completely baffled. Had the 2 1/2 hours of cinematic hysteria merely been a hoax? A highly stylized scam? Could it be that this confounding, bewildering pantomime of Classic Hollywood tropes only been contrived to taunt me? That's certainly what it felt like, sitting there in that velvety shrine as the credits rolled past. Had I been conned? Deceived, duped, swindled? Or had I missed something? I decided, as did my group of fellow film goers - because we somehow intuited that David Lynch had wanted us to be so initially mystified - that we had best reexamine this daunting riddle. We sat through another showing that very same night & damn if we weren't just as flummoxed afterward. No one had a convincing theory to explain the relentless parade of captivating confusion that we'd just again witnessed. The solution, apparently, was going to require some diligence.Deciphering this film became a chronic challenge for my group of determined detectives. Over the next 3 or 4 weeks we spent countless hours analyzing, discussing, dissecting, & debating its meaning, but nothing felt conclusive. Eventually we watched the queer dark spectacle yet again & came away with a whole fresh crop of notions, but these all soon withered under the intense heat of our examinations. We would ruthlessly eviscerate one another's forced & impractical conjectures. We each began clinging defensively, helplessly, to our own feeble theory, mechanically repeating it to one another in a tragic display of denial. We were all stumped but refused to accept it. It started to get ugly, even vicious, as we'd denigrate one another in our fury to be relieved of this terrible burden. We had to desist or we'd all end up with our throats torn out.Fast forward five years to the low key, un-hyped, nearly unnoticed release of INLAND EMPIRE & the 3 core members of that old gang of Lynch fans. We were going to a Special Screening at a specially selected theater to which a friend of a friend had connections & we'd be among the very first in the entire tri-state area to attend Lynch's latest cinematic psychic assault. We were as giddy as school girls, but strangely, undeniably, we were all unusually polite with one another. We were treating each other rather gingerly, as though tip-toeing around some unseen sleeping monster. The heavy weight of our old Mulholland Drive encumbrance was upon us once again, but no one spoke of it. At least not then, not till after we had experienced that unbelievably, impossibly gargantuan Goliath of a mind f#@% that is INLAND EMPIRE.INLAND EMPIRE so utterly crushed us, so completely destroyed us. Our awareness, our consciousness, our wit, our entire being - thoroughly pulverized. It was astonishing just how nullified we were by what we had just witnesses, had just endured. Our minds were arid, desolate, vacant expanses of vacuous nothingness. What WAS that?!! A horrendous demonic courier from the deepest, vilest recesses of David's Gothic psyche had just delivered to us a most outrageously sinister parcel that was now demanding to be inspected. It felt as though I had been immersed in a vat of pure uncut dread. A cloying, claustrophobic curtain of doom had descended, obliterating all light of reason. That unrelenting barrage of horrific paranoia had overwhelmed me with an unbearably thick avalanche of hopelessness. This was going to be a very hard movie to ""get"", is what we all three were thinking.I have veered off here onto the INLAND EMPIRE trail because it had inadvertently rekindled our debates of Mulholland Drive. We seemed to sense that perhaps there may possibly be a key to unlocking Mulholland somewhere in the dense, impenetrable quagmire of INLAND EMPIRE. But where, and in what form would it be, and how would we even recognize it? Gaining entrance to INLAND EMPIRE was just too intimidating, and so soon, by default, we focused again on Mulholland Drive. Someone suggested that there seemed to be something of a circular form to its structure, but was clueless as to a point of entry. That phrase ""Point of Entry"" echoed in my gauzy mind, and then I recalled something that the agitated Polish men at the beginning of INLAND EMPIRE were discussing so emphatically: A way in. A way in to WHAT, I pondered? A way into the Rabbit Hole? What does that mean? I dunno. A way into America? Maybe. A way into the meaning of that damn movie?! Hmmm... AHA! OMFG! Lynch, you devious, sick bastard! I think I'm onto something here, I thought to myself. And indeed, I was because soon, and very effectively, I was scaling that formidable facade that had so discouraged me with its pretension to impenetrability. As I figured & felt my way into the INLAND EMPIRE labyrinth, I became aware of a very definite, precise mechanism at work in the action of its structure. The astounding realization of just exactly WHY INLAND EMPIRE was initially so impossible to fathom ignited within me a tremendous realization of just exactly what was also going on with Mulholland Drive. I began to test this theory, to see if the parts lined up, and it all very soon clicked perfectly into place. WOW! The whole film, rearranged & reconstructed in my mind, had gelled into a superbly coherent, fiendishly rational tale. Amazing! Absolutely gorgeous, the elegant beauty of its convoluted design. Mulholland Drive Solved!!! I didn't tell my two friends what I had discovered for at least one week, I was savoring that sweet rich feeling of superiority. It eventually occurred to me that they both might be doing the same...",Mulholland Drive
250,Naoufel_B,Blue is for imagination.,10,6 May 2021,"""A man's attitude determines, to a large extent, how his life will be.""I consider this as Lynch's Masterpiece for many reasons, first of all it has an exceptional score and sound design, an impressive work of cinematography that enhanced the story and gave the film its distinctive mood and look, and finally David Lynch's unique artistic vision. In Mulholland Drive, Lynch put together a tragic and twisted story set in a typical Hollywood atmosphere in which he explores in a non-straightforward narrative the themes of darkness, horror, fame, love and tragedy. And by using many distorted and hypnotizing sequences to shift between dreams and reality, Lynch sublimely crafted one of his most unique and outstanding storylines.Mulholland Dr. Will always be an astonishing and extraordinary piece of work.",Mulholland Drive
251,stephenlovelette,Top Notch David Lynch,8,29 June 2014,"This blue box lacks a bow.Yes, my Proverbial Audience, if you watch Mulholland Drive, expect no packaged narratives.It's been about an hour, and the thought wheels are still rolling on this one, which is always a good sign.There's only one question to ask.Are you willing to take the half hour afterward to find out what you saw?If the answer's no, rethink this one.That being said, there are probably fans out there who've never looked into interpretations of the plot. I couldn't live with myself, but there must be.I'm alluding to the disjointed narrative woven through David Lynch's writing and directing. His use of different shooting styles and camera angles is pretty amazing.For some reason it has a very 90's feel to it, despite its theatrical release in 2001.The film runs a little too long and is thoroughly confusing. It's not 'intentional obfuscation for the sole purpose of confusing the audience.' That's misleading, and I don't think it happens all that often.For years, I would have argued the pointlessness in the ending of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I still contend that it's an overall bore, and the dull slog is not worth the thoughtful and rather brilliant implications of the ending. It's perplexing as all get out, but now that I've read about what Stanley was going for, I can appreciate the virtue of his intent.Although I'm not a big fan of Blue Velvet, I appreciate what Lynch tries to do in his movies.Even after understanding the common interpretations of the plot, there still remains a feeling like something's missing. It's very similar to how I felt after Blue Velvet, but my preference lies with Mulholland Drive.MD was originally conceived as a television show, and this is where much of the plot falls apart. Lynch had to compact a narrative intended for an entire season into a feature film. Many question whether the final film can be classified as a complete narrative.I wish I could answer that question. I'm not sure and have done too much research already. Perhaps I'll get back on that some day.I had to have the answer, and felt satisfied by it. I'm not necessarily ecstatic about the explanation but it works, and it's fine; an original idea at the very least. I found the plot development compelling regardless.Hey, I got a thing for elaborate high-stakes storytelling. I find it thought provoking and puzzling. I enjoy the whirlwind of disjointed moments, the coil and release of the tension spring.I adore the chase for comprehension, the errant cuts, the inexplicable in the real, the terror and indecision. Keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat certainly counts for something.Mulholland, I find, is reminiscent of Robert Altman's Short Cuts from 1993. Except not nearly as boring.It gives off a bit of a Pulp Fiction vibe (particularly in terms of the disjointed narrative).I'm also reminded of Sharon Stone's character in Basic Instinct with Laura Harring's role as Rita. They're both portraits of the typical femme fatale who sexually prey on their victims.Naomi Watts is great in MD; she's playing a difficult role here and executes it convincingly. Really, I mean, this is some tough stuff!Overall, I enjoy Mulholland Drive. It's ghostly, ethereal and compelling. The material's gritty and tense, but befuddling.Despite the incomplete narrative, Lynch offers his audience a thought provoking experience unlike any other.Nonetheless, the story is mysterious and enticing, and if you like movies it's worth a shot.I'm finishing this review the following morning, and still thinking about it.What does that say about the film as a whole?",Mulholland Drive
252,Andres24,"One image, one mystery",10,23 January 2003,"Excellent!!! Masterpiece!!.  This intrigue story leads us to several opinions about the plot.  One woman with a blackout due to an accident, another woman who wants to be a star in Hollywood, a director with a star confined to his picture.  All together in one masterpiece. It is a mystery.

There are a lot of very interesting elements in this film but I did not buy the package. There are a couple of scenes which clearly have NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY and while one can speculate as to the artistic reason for their inclusion a canvas of the several hundred reviews on this site will show they remained unexplained. This film can best be described as a deliberate attempt to confuse and I cannot recommend to anyone that they spend the money to see it. Why not simply walk out halfway through the next film you go to and then guess what the rest of the movie was about?

254,sethmlanders,Best Mystery Movie I've Seen in a Long Time!,10,2 September 2013,"I never knew that such a suspenseful plot that had both horror and romantic elements made me feel different spiritually, after watching. This movie has more questions than answers, folks, so it's not for everyone. There are too many ways to interpret the story. Just pay attention, figure out the differences between perceptions that transitions between reality & dreams, enjoy the performances, and you'll have a darkly wonderful night!Recently, I read a review that Roger Ebert (R.I.P.) posted about the film saying, ""There is no explanation. There may not even be a mystery"" and he was sure as heck right about that! There was so much inspirational passion behind Mr. Lynch's mind, he's eccentric in his craft and determined in his vision. Although the movie is nearly flawless, you're more than welcome to fast forward the certain redundant/uncomfortable parts (such as Rita saying ""Silencio"" a million times or Betty's audition where she makes out with an old fart), but besides that, this was an experimental project that amazed me. Focus closely on the blue key, anything related to murder, and the all the elements that slowly come together.It gets a 10/10 in my book and if only David Lynch won that Oscar.

They have to make a little bit of sense to the audience. Just a little, OK? This one started off very confusingly and I was thinking that as time progressed the pieces would all fit together. That was a foolish thought, as it turned out. The pieces didn't so much fit together as disintegrate.So perhaps David was trying to tell me that I shouldn't make such assumptions, that things don't always fit together. Well congratulations, pal, you've made your point. Problem is, I already knew that. Everyone knows that. But when I watch a film, I want to be entertained. With this one I gave up after an hour and started reading a book.",Mulholland Drive
256,shahrad,What do you expect to see?,10,18 February 2002,"Wow! Mulholland Drive is so weird. I can even say that this is the weirdest movie I've ever seen. It's totally a dream. Probably a nightmare. But a fascinating one. I didn't want the movie to finish at all. There's no sign of logic in this film. Of course, MD in comparison to Lost highway is more colorful and believable. Sometimes you try to figure out something, but before you get the point, something strange happens and tears all your realization apart.
In my opinion, this movie doesn't have only one point, but so many. At one point, I suppose, the movie tries to show the darkest part of the human soul. An innocence, which turns to madness. Naomi watts who plays as ambitious Diane, came to Hollywood to become a movie star. A sex symbol Just like Rita Heyworth. But, everything appears to be different. Hollywood is not a place she happen to know. And somehow, she become desperate. I think that she were fallen in love with the director, But someone else(Rita played by Laura Harring), wins his heart. So, Diane neither succeeds in becoming a star nor winning the director's heart(and so many other things). Well, all her complexes appears as a dream. Maybe Rita is Diane's other self. Her second character. She envies Rita and undeliberately makes her, her other character just to revenge her. In another way, she's revenging herself. At this time, Diane's envy to Rita leads Rita to have sexual relationship with her. As a matter of fact, it's Diane who's making love to herself. With this undeliberate act, Diane avoids Rita to fall in love with the director and on the other hand, she satisfies her complexes. Of course, these were what I got from parts of the movie. There are many characters in this film which remain unknown to us.MD is full of vague things. Even if you understand most of the events and make sense out of them, there's many other things left to understand.  
As a conclusion, we're confronting with human psyche. Mulholland Dr. is a deep social and psychological movie. David Lynch presents one of the most colorful, mysterious, surrealistic and artistic film in cinema history. Despite its weirdness and unlogical atmosphere, you can not stop watching it. The sex scene of the film is one of the greatest sex scenes I've ever seen. This scene is so emotional. Just look at the way the kiss each other.

And no, I don't mean to imply there was anything sexy in Eraserhead, but there is a sexual undertone to all Lynch films, including The Elephant Man (though I don't recall such an undertone in Dune or The Straight Story ...). In this one, Twin Peaks and of course Blue Velvet it is front and center, an indelible part of the ""story,"" such as it is, as a whole.For those seeking a truly Lynchian experience, this one's hard to beat -- but I'd generally recommend it to his fans only.",Mulholland Drive

While Naomi Watts and Laura Harring both excel, I find myself wondering why Ms Harring has not had more big roles in recent times as she is obviously a very talented and beautiful actress. I also thought that Anne Miller was well cast as the apartment block manager and she displayed a great deal of that ""Hollywood charm"" that is completely lacking in modern cinema.David Lynch as a director is quite special. The way he layers a story and his quirky photography make it obvious who is at the reins here. But as he he done many times before, he forgets that the cinema is first and foremost a place to tell a story. If one makes a story difficult to follow that doesn't always make it art. Lynch is capable of telling a great story with films like ""The Elephant Man"", but he's gone off on a bender here trying to appease God knows who.There will be many who didn't understand the film trying to point out out the genius, the relevance or even the brilliance of this movie, but they are kidding themselves. It is painfully obvious that a re-edit of this film, while removing some of Lynch's style, would transform this film into the masterpiece it could have been. As it stands, watching Mulholland Dr. is too difficult and asks too much of its audience.Despite all of these shortcomings, I actually liked the film as I thought the actors did an incredible job. It's just that it could have been so much better. It could have been a classic.",Mulholland Drive
261,Laitue_Gonflable,Lynch is a genius,8,21 July 2003,"*Possible Spoilers Within*I can't quite work out whether I love or hate this movie, and I think that's how it's supposed to be; there are those who love it and those who hate it, and those like me, who just can't make up their mind because they're still absolutely bewildered by it.Up until about 90 minutes into this film, I was sitting there, quietly enjoying it, very comfortable in my rather naive assumption that all the bizarre loose ends and non-sensical information would be made sense of in the end. Unlike my brother, I didn't make the mistake of opening the DVD case and looking at Lynch's ""clues"" to solve the mystery and so I was quite happy believing that it would unravel itself to me. Boy, was I wrong.But why should that make me hate it? The film is extremely well made, and it's thoroughly original. In fact, it is one of the most unique films of all time. The script is intriguing, the direction captivating, the performances stunning. And yet, has there ever been a film that leaves you with a more hollow and unfulfilled feeling than Mulholland Drive?I don't know. I'm not hear to answer or, indeed, ask any questions, but I have to say that whichever way you look at it, David Lynch is indeed, and undeniably, a genius. He's written a piece so dazzling and startling in its complexity that it is doubtful it will ever be solved. He forces us to give it a double-take, a second viewing, and then a third and a fourth. And after four we begin to get the feeling that there is no solution. Just like those conspiracy theories surrounding the JFK assassination, there is not one theory that completely answers every clue, and there never will be. I am sure that Lynch himself doesn't know the answer to this movie; all he knows is that he's sitting in a room in Hollywood next to a huge sack of money labelled ""Mulholland Drive Subsequent Rentals"" with a huge grin on his face. He wins in so many ways with this film, because it is just that, a winner. Five stars out of five.",Mulholland Drive
262,maxastree,excellent film on many levels,8,29 April 2016,"After ""Lost Highway"", a crime/romantic betrayal story punctuated by pretentious meta-narrative and probably very nearly containing Rob Zombie tunes at one point, Lynch came back a few years later with this picture, easily his most absorbing, memorable and emotionally satisfying reworking of the crime/romance theme since he established his presence with ""Blue Velvet"" decades ago.Mulholland Drive features Betty, a wholesome, suburban wannabe actress vacationing in Hollywood at her wealthy aunts apartment, who's working out of town on a movie. A voluptuous, olive skinned woman appears to be cowering in the apartment, dazed with concussion. The rest of the film is in essence a series of vignettes and spiralling, increasingly angst-ridden scenes showing Betty's manipulation and betrayal by Rita, who appears to be either a Hollywood socialite or possibly a sex worker with dangerous criminal connections.Laura Harring plays Rita's character perfectly, a previous national beauty pageant winner, Harring was also hit in the skull in a traumatizing bullet wound incident as a child. The films dramatic core is about the shifting character dynamic from naive friendship to lesbian manipulation and romantic failure.The second element to Mulholland Drives success is the age-old theme of ""seedy show-business""; a class of wealthy, corrupt film producers are shown in cahoots with organized crime, who in turn are in cahoots with common street criminals. While the concept is nothing new due to Hollywoods historic ties with the Mafia during its golden age, Lynch's typical combination of mystery, melodrama and fascinatingly strange symbolism make this film one of the best pictures of its decade.",Mulholland Drive
263,andyetris,Not one of Lynch's Best,3,28 June 2002,"I'm not sure it IS possible to write a spoiler for a David Lynch film! Nevertheless, I am going to refer to the film's key element, a major change in direction:This disappointing effort by director David Lynch gives us two plotlines to choose from - a thriller about a plucky ingenue trying to solve a crime, and a story of frustrated ambition in Hollywood.  It's also full of references to Stanley Kubrick's much better film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"".I love David Lynch, and it would be hard for me to choose between ""Eraserhead"" and ""Blue Velvet"" for his best film.  ""Eraserhead"" works as a disturbing fantasy, filled with multi-interpretable elements but a discernible theme of anxiety and responsibility.  ""Blue Velvet"" works as a straightforward thriller with weird overtones.  This film gestures to both, but, unable to take the thriller part seriously, leaves us with the vastly less interesting theme of frustrated-ambition, interlarded with stream-of-consciousness fantasies.  It's all cross-referenced back to the first plotline, but unfortunately, THAT was the best part of the film!Basically, I'm just not interested in sitting through 2 1/2 hours of the fantasies of a frustrated starlet.  If you are, this mud's for you.",Mulholland Drive
264,Snoopy1,Forgettable,1,2 December 2002,"Slight spoilers.  I wanted to like this movie.  I really did, for my ex-boyfriend's sake, and for the fact that David Lynch is apparently considered a genius.  But the movie was just dreadfully boring.  I don't know how it made the imdb's top 150 because it seems like the general consensus here was that  it wasn't particularly good.As I recall, the acting was sort of lackidasical, as if the actors wanted to be somewhere else.  The lesbian scene seemed awkward and out of place...it didn't belong in the movie, it seemed like Lynch just put it there just for the sake of arousing the male viewers.  It lended nothing whatsoever to the plot.  I never did finish watching the movie, because the lesbian scene fueled a fight between my boyfriend and I when I told him that I thought it had nothing to do with the plot and was, in a way sexist.  I now cringe whenever I hear the name David Lynch and I don't think I'll be viewing any of his other movies.  Unless someone could convince me that his other movies are more worth my while.",Mulholland Drive

Attempting to elevate itself into a typical art college discussion group that if you don't get it you are 'outside of the clique' exemplifies the condescending approach taken, delivered and passed on by the small number of radiohead fan base who 'sense the provocative and exhilarating direction taken' (not my words). Don't get me started on Radiohead, who are the worst band ever elevated to cult status by the pure fluke of enough art college students deeming their life is worthless because their parents only bought them a PS2 and not an XBox or a Wii!!!

266,Aditya_Gokhale,Marvellous!,10,18 December 2005,"David Lynch is my favourite director. He makes movies just like I've always wanted them to be! Mulholland Drive is one of Lynch's best...right up there with my other Lynch favourites, Lost Highway and Eraserhead.However, like all his other works, this will appeal only to a few people who are ready to accept such movies. People looking for conventional, fast paced entertainers, will be disappointed.Saying anything about the plot would mean giving most of the story away, but I shall roughly state that it is about a girl called Betty (Naomi Watts) who arrives in Hollywood to star in the movies. She meets Laura Harring who has lost her memory because of a car accident.Mulholland Drive is a work of art. The cinematography is excellent. The plot is complex, but it all falls into place towards the end, provided you pay attention to the finer details. It can be completely understood; if not during the first viewing, definitely in the second or the third! There are countless memorable moments, some of which haunt you and stay in your head long after the movie ends; special mention of the terrific score (composed by Angelo Badalamenti who also appears in a brief role) that complements these scenes beautifully.Naomi Watts delivers a stunning performance, which should've at least received an Oscar nomination. The gorgeous Laura Elena Harring is also very convincing in her role.David Lynch was nominated for an Oscar for Best Director during the 2001 Academy Awards for this movie. Ron Howard won for ""A Beautiful Mind"" at that time....! I totally understand that, because Mulholland Drive is just too good for everyone to digest.Highly recommended for movie buffs with an open mind and lovers of the unconventional!",Mulholland Drive
267,superboy478,The Best Time of My Life!,10,25 April 2002,"I was traveling through Boulder, Colorado and while I was there, I found out that the movie critic Roger Ebert was at the University of Colorado, so I went to see what he was there for. Apparently, he was hosting the movie Mulholland Drive. Monday, he showed the entire movie from begining to end. For the rest of the week (starting on Tuesday and ending on Friday), he let the audience and himself study (basically comment) each shot of the movie and try to puzzle everything together. It was the best time of my life because while I was there, I met Roger Ebert and got to talk to him. Plus, I thought that he chose the right movie to show us. I'd never seen Mulholland Drive and didn't know who was in it, what it was about, nothing. But, by the end, I thought it was a masterpiece.The movie starts out with a woman (Laura Harring) ending up in a brutal car accident that leaves her with amnesia. She sneaks to a house and meets a wanna be actress named Betty (Naomi Watts). Together, Betty and the woman try to figure out the identity of the woman. Along the way, Betty and the woman fall in love with eachother.I honestly say, that nothing can be spoiled or explained clearly about this movie. You have to see it yourself in order to figure it out. The DVD will list 10 clues by director David Lynch (Blue Velvet, Eraserhead) that will help you solve the movies story and background.The movie was very confusing, but at the same time, I was extremely impressed with it. It was very good and very entertaining. Its a movie that will mess with your mind, but by the end, you will be able to figure out what the hell was up as long as you pay attention.I wanna say, very special thanks to Roger Ebert for being a good host and listener as well as choosing a good movie to show us. Thank You Roger!",Mulholland Drive

Who died, who lived, who wasn't really there?  I guess you could have about a billion conversations on this movie to decide what way it really went down.  Kind of put this one in the realm of Audition.  There were some scenes that made absolutely zero sense but I was told that was to be explained away in the tv series that never occurred.  Well, I guess I can just make up my own story and fight with all the other movie goers at what they actually saw.This is a nine out of ten for me because I had too many loose ends to tie up.",Mulholland Drive
269,kimi_layercake,Over-Rated Piece Of Fantasy Story Telling,4,1 August 2010,"Starting with a confession,like most of David Lynch's movies,this movie ALSO made little sense to me. Can't say whether it was the erratic storyline,confusing climax,too many unnecessary characters or just that it's a David Lynch's movie, I didn't get the movie. Surprisingly,I see most people citing similar reviews about the movie,but still the movie is rated in IMDb's Top 250 Movies. I just can't see the meaning of giving this movie so high rating when one cannot make the head-tail out of it.As per the casting,like I said,too many characters.The principal characters were Naomi Watts and Laura Harring.Besides these two,there were unnecessary characters,presence of whom was simply redundant or meaningless.Having said that,Naomi Watts was phenomenal in her performance with good backing from Laura Harring,who looks awesome in the movie.This movie has too many drawbacks to be even considered as a good movie,forget being one of the Top 250 Movies ever made.The story is completely senseless.Lengthwise,it stretches near to 2 and 1/2 hrs.Seventy percent of the movie characters' presence is unaccounted for.Whether it's a thriller or neo-noir or crime movie,I ain't clear.God knows,why critics like movies which no one's understands.Overall,watch it if you are attracted by the ratings.But remember,don't blame me that I didn't warned you.It's just so pathetic.My Verdict:4/10",Mulholland Drive
270,lucianomarzo92,David Lynch's Mulholland Drive,9,10 September 2010,"Let me go ahead and say that I am a David Lynch fan. I've seen many of his movies. That being said, I was very impressed with Mulholland Drive, but I don't think its quite his best film. It is well-made, but I believe The Straight Story and Blue Velvet are his best movies. Both of these movies lack the depth and complexity of Mulholland Drive, but I think I prefer the director's straightforward style of film-making over his fragmented style. All the same Mulholland Drive is one of his better movies, if not his third best after Blue Velvet and the Straight Story.Mulholland Drive is a strange film. The whole movie is very dream-like and surreal, qualities that enhance the film very much. It also has exceptional acting, and very good directing. Just the fact that David Lynch could pull off such complicated storytelling proves his talent as a film maker. The story and plot of Mulholland Dr. are actually very simple on the surface, but it is told in such a way as to make the viewer think.Mulholland Drive takes place in Los Angelos and there are many characters in the film, but it focuses mainly on three characters: a young aspiring actress named Betty, and brunette named Rita, and a director named Adam who is trying to make a movie. The three of these characters' stories are told separately, but their lives eventually come together.The main conflict in the movie is between Rita and Camila. Rita meets Camila in an apartment. Rita has just been in a car accident and cannot remember who she is or what she is doing. Rita and Camila soon become friends. Camila feels like she should help Rita. She talks to her and tries to sort things out. But Rita is very confused, much like the audience. Camila wants to star in Adam's movie, but Adam does not approve of her.The relationship between Camila and Rita is very intriguing. It is what helps keep the movie going. The movie takes a while to get into, because it starts off rather slow-paced, dark, and convoluted. Some people won't like this. They would prefer a movie more lively and easy to follow. Although this film mostly comes together by the end, it still leaves a lot of unanswered questions. This is the neat thing about the movie though; it gets you thinking. I analyzed the movie and tried to sort it out in my head for about a week after I saw it.Some people may ask, ""Should you really have to do all that for a movie? Shouldn't it just be about relaxing?"" And yes, this point does have merit. There is a fine line between difficult to follow and baffling. But movies like this provide people with a lot of fun to come up with different theories of what really happened. Mulholland Drive has many strengths. It has excellent cinematography, talented storytelling, good acting, and has a very good soundtrack. Mulholland Drive's strengths far outweighed its weaknesses, but all the same the movie did have its flaws. For one, it left a lot to speculation but didn't leave much to the imagination. This movie has graphic sexual content that may ruin the movie for some people. It didn't bother that much but the movie still could have had a little more subtlety. My one true gripe with the movie was that it was a little too grim. The amusement in this movie is slim to none. Blue Velvet is for the most part a pretty serious movie but it still includes comic relief. Mulholland Drive could have used a few light-hearted scenes, just to help loosen up some of the tension in the movie.I understand that the dark atmosphere was supposed to help tell the story. The ominous nature of Mulholland Dr. was appropriate for the story, but at times it was a little overwhelming. The movie comes across as a just a bit too stark because of this. The movie was also a bit confusing towards the end- it could have used more editing, and could have had more focus on the protagonist. As cool as the switching from one story to the next was, we never really got to know our protagonist, played by Naomi Watts, very well. In fact, probably only half the movie included her. Mulholland Drive is a movie that most people probably wouldn't fully understand the first time around. Upon its first viewing there are a few evident flaws in it, but I think its one of those movies that would be much better the second time. The first time you;re so busy trying to figure out what the heck is going on that its hard to really enjoy it. Overall, I would recommend Mulholland Drive to anyone who likes David Lynch. Fans of the directer, and fans of artistic films will probably like this movie. As for everyone else, this movie is not a crowd-pleaser. Its not the most enjoyable movie either. The style of the movie resembles that of a nightmare and it is rather depressing. Although it does leave you feeling enlightened, it may also leave you feeling a little gloomy. But it is an original and imaginative film. And it has transfixing visuals, skillful directing, and strong performances.",Mulholland Drive
271,fnorful,For Twin Peaks fans...others beware!,8,12 February 2002,"I thought that liking Blue Velvet and seeing some merit in Dune would be enough, but unfortunately not.  This is a tough introduction to what (I'm told) Lynch is usually ""about"".  At the end of the movie I was angry at wasting 2 1/4 hours of my life, but then became interested in figuring out the plot and what the many (very well done!) parts might mean.  Lots of parts.My explanation doesn't match anyone else's I've heard, which is why this made such a great movie for our monthly film group.  Everyone who liked it was a big fan of Twin Peaks, so their expectations were certainly tempered.I'll planning to see it again with a Lynch fan; perhaps become a fan myself.

273,Supachewy,David Lynch Likes to Play With Your Mind,9,16 October 2010,"The psychological thriller Mulholland Dr. is directed by David Lynch and stars Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, and Justin Theroux. The film takes place in modern day Hollywood.A young woman Rita (Harring) is in a limousine that gets crashed into by a bunch of crazy kids driving and loses her memory. She wanders around the streets of Hollywood until she enters an apartment complex while the residents of the apartment she goes into are leaving. Then the apartment owners niece, Bette (Watts), stays at the apartment hoping to become a movie star. When Bette finds Rita she tries to help her discover who she really is and go around Los Angeles looking for clues. Adam Kesher (Theroux) is a film director and is being forced by some unknown threatening people to cast an actress into the lead role of his new film. Adam is very angry by this and goes home early to discover that his wife is cheating on him with Billy Ray Cyrus. Adam has much bigger problems than that though because he is being followed by some very bad people...The writing by David Lynch for this film is masterful. This film is completely unique and no other writer can write like Lynch. Everything about this crazy, twisted film is pure genius, what I love about it most is the first time that I saw it I was thinking the whole time this movie seems really bad but I can't stop watching because I secretly love it. The complexity of the plot is so complex that no one has even found out how complex it is yet. Just a brilliant script and if you see this film you are either going to love it or hate it. And if you watch it and you like it then it just hasn't sunk in yet that you actually love it.David Lynch's direction is as insane as his writing, and that is obviously a good thing. The shots are absolutely stunning, and this is one of the few films I find addicting. After I watched this film the first time I said to myself I must watch something else of David Lynch's direction. He really knows how to get great performances from his actors, and a lot of people say they are acting poorly but they are supposed to be and they are doing it extremely well.As I said in the last paragraph the acting was really good, but easily the weakest part of the film. Naomi Watts made me love her after seeing this movie because she is just so good the whole way through, I would elaborate more on it but that would kind of give spoilers. Laura Harring was alright, nothing too special though but she wasn't really supposed to be. There was nothing wrong with her performance though but she could have added a little more depth to it. The same really goes for Justin Theroux as well, he did fine but he could have added more. The supporting cast all did great, giving exactly as they were supposed to and supplying a lot of mystery with their performances.Overall I give this film a solid 9/10. It is a must see for anyone who wants to get their mind bended, much more than this summer's Inception. After you see this film I suggest you see Lynch's Inland Empire which will completely destroy your mind, I still have no clue what that film is even about.",Mulholland Drive

Precise, Random, Pervert, Americana. All words that in one way or another seem to describe the contents of this wonderful mystery box of a film. I was stricken by the films structure, its precise randomness. Something that seems contradictory but it is exactly what MD is. Each scene feels as if it is its own little story that works wonderfully by itself yet at the same time they all serve the over all narrative. The other thing that comes to mind is the films approach to its fictionalized world. Its post modern plastic melo-dramatic silly t.v. show world. Its all great fun, but I can imagine how it would put some people off. ""are they for real?"" Well no they're not...keep watching. Its ironic that when the narrative seemingly falls apart towards the end that this is when things all come together. It might not make since at first but if the ride is this fun then you will take it again and maybe it will seem a bit clearer. Suffice to say I have fun with this film.",Mulholland Drive

It's deliberately confusing and baffling, full of plot points that apparently go nowhere, disjointed vignettes that are entertaining while they last, but leave you wondering how they're possibly connected to the rest of the movie at all, and mysteries with no explanation.

277,ayric,So far best in 2001,9,21 December 2001,"It would normally be disappointing to see that David Lynch is back to his usual style after making The Straight Story, which is his best movie so far. It would be disappointing if it wasn't for the fact that he has made a ""Lynch movie"" better than any other ""Lynch movie"". Mulholland Drive can in many ways be compared to Lost Highway (1997), but Lynch has refined his style since then and presents a much more satisfying film this time. I am not a fan of confusing films. This film is as confusing as they come, and still I absolutely loved it. This is not a movie you have to fully understand to enjoy, as every scene and every character boils with entertainment. There have been speculations from prominent film critics that the film cannot be understood; that it is merely a dreamlike mix of scenes. I do not share this view as I believe I understood most of the basics of the film, but it is definitely a film one can re-view a few times.

279,IOBdennis,Who's on first; What's on second...,10,30 May 2002,"Clearly David Lynch's best film to date and clearly a Lynch puzzler, this film is like a companion piece to ""The Lost Highway"" in many ways. Symbolically, it is the destination.  It's also a female version.  (BTW, what's with the Laura Harring fuzzy pudenda scene?  Was that the result of the producers, the director, or Blockbuster?  The DVD version I rented has a scene in it in which a very badly airbrushed pubic region almost steals the scene.  It was distracting, whoever did it.) There are also symbolic links to ""Eraserhead"" (in heaven, everything's all right); ""Twin Peaks"" (midget in bordello/in movieland); and even a symbolic link or two to Ingmar Bergman's (sp?) ""The Silence."" and ""Persona."" Do we even have an homage here to ""Pulp Fiction"" in the Winkie's scenes?  And do we have a little inside joke about Hollywood cops and ""Dragnet""? I know someone will say that I'm digging pretty deep, but I couldn't help making these connections while I watched the film.Naomi Watts' performance is staggeringly excellent.  Her acting range is unbelievable!  But in a film that made no surface-sense, I kept wondering how Rita/Camilla had such wonderful clothes when she/they?walked away from the crash with just a handbag.  Surely Betty/Diane didn't have those kinds of clothes in her/their closet(s).  But then again, was Betty with Rita or Camilla or was Diane with Rita or Camilla?  I-don't-know's on third.  But Naomi Watts!  What a great actress!!And once again Lynch makes the most common everyday objects terrifying. Granted, he has an effective film score to help.

David Lynch has this gift for making films that are long and tedious and yet so fascinating that one ends up watching them over again to try and figure out what exactly happened in them. Mulholland Drive is no different. The only thing I can say about Mulholland Drive is that is is David Lynch's twisted take on the typical Hollywood Starlet story. The whole experience is just very disturbing. Everything in Mulholland Drive has to be paid attention to. Everything that happens in this movie is significant to the story and missing one piece can result in not getting the puzzle. You have been warned!,Mulholland Drive

If this is art reflecting society then I fear for its existence.

There are lots of theories about the film being a dream, and other's where it's not.

Only an absolute master could craft such a film.

285,sonnyschlaegel,"I didn't like the story very much, but the way it's told is interesting",6,3 April 2007,"If you're a fan of David Lynch, skip this comment. Watch the movie instead, you'll love it.I don't think the story is very interesting. A young actress comes to Hollywood, starts a career, and has a love affair with another actress. Of course that's not the whole story, but most of it, and I think it could have been better.But the way the story is told is interesting in my opinion. The sequence of events isn't linear, and a lot of points weren't shown directly but through symbols. It was different from everything I've seen before.However, that doesn't make it a truly great movie in my opinion. Judging from what I've read, nobody or nearly nobody understood the meaning of it without watching it at least twice or without reading some hints (or full interpretations). That's not the way it should be in my opinion. The mystery should be solved at the end of the movie; that would be less frustrating. There were some other points that I didn't like. The first part has some dragging passages, and the second part seems rushed at some points. I guess it's because the first part was filmed as a TV-pilot but wasn't accepted and the second part was then added to make it a feature film; so the second part is much shorter than it was intended to be (too short in my opinion); it was intended to be a (mini-) series (see the 'trivia'-section). Perhaps the series would also have offered a solution (in addition to a better pacing).Though there are some good hints (in the movie) that may help one to find a good (or the right) interpretation, there are also some points that are too misleading in my opinion. For example, when Betty and Rita meet Diane's neighbour, she recognizes neither of them. That may be o.k. (and was probably intended) if you consider the context of that passage, but it's still too misleading in my opinion.All in all it's o.k., but could have been better in my opinion.

Mimicry being the sincerest form of flattery.My only criticism is that a lot of crap from the aborted TV series was left in. The dwarf gangster, who just disappears half way through, and the pointless scenes with Adam, which you can fast forward through and lose nothing. Plus the scenes with the tramp and the dreamer guy. How were they possibly related to Diane's POV ? They could only be seen by the omniscient director not her character.But still. This wreaks your head and is still there days later.

I expected a fantastic looking film that would be confusing and somewhat frustrating.  It is confusing, but somehow it is never frustrating.  What makes this movie great is the same thing that would make a poem great, and that is this:If one hundred people read a great poem, all of them would have a different interpretation of what it meant.  Well, that goes for this movie.  It isn't frustrating because it is consistent in its surrealism.  From start to finish the images and happenings are all quite bizarre(especially the last half hour).  That is what makes it all so captivating, and the consistency provides each viewer the opportunity to try and piece it together.  You don't have to, but for me it is like a puzzle, and I want to solve it.  I have my own theories as to what it is all about, but I bet whatever you come up with will be completely different.  That is what makes this movie so unique and gripping.  Normally I wouldn't go for a movie like this, but when its this well done you can't help but fall under its spell.  9 out of 10.",Mulholland Drive

291,EThompsonUMD,"David Lynch, The Blue-Haired Muse and Master of the Macabre",10,14 April 2002,"Spoiler Alert - although this is a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it is to completely explain.'Mulholland Drive' is by far the most successful expression of David Lynch's cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his 'Twin Peaks' TV series. As Lynch enthusiasts know, his is a style and vision uniquely blended from film noir, horror movies, surrealism, and parapsychology  with a healthy dose of postmodern self-consciousness and black humor thrown in for good measure. All these elements are richly at work in 'Mulholland Drive,' making for a riveting, hair-raising, and highly satisfying film experience  especially if one does not become overly obsessed with trying to make all the plot pieces fit into a logical, mystery-unraveling whole.The film features wonderful performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring in the lead roles of young women whose lives intersect in various ways amid a Hollywood setting that is itself an hallucinated blend of contemporary reality, retro '50s nostalgia, and satirical self-aggrandizement. Their seemingly random initial meeting occurs after the film's opening scene, in which Harring's character escapes an attempt on her life thanks to a fortuitous, not to mention horrific, automobile accident. Staggering down the hillside from Mulholland Drive to Sunset Boulevard (the two most archetypal of Hollywood thoroughfares), she finds her way to the very apartment that Betty (Naomi Watts) is about to sublet from her 'Aunt Ruth,' a purportedly successful actress who is off to Canada to begin a new movie. As we later learn, Betty had herself arrived from Deep River, Ontario, shortly after winning a jitterbug contest.A highly energetic and stylized flashback to the contest forms one of two pre-credit prologue sequences that frame Betty's descent from the clichéd would-be-starlet's bright-eyed innocence to the debauched madness of spurned lover and going nowhere bit-part actress. Unable to remember her own name, the Harring character adopts the name 'Rita' from a movie poster for the film noir classic 'Gilda' that adorns Aunt Ruth's apartment. (Actually, it turns out Aunt Ruth has long since deceased and whose apartment we're really in is a good question to be resolved in future viewings.) Anyway, Betty determines to help Rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in Rita's purse. The two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to Rita's true identity. They also, by the way, become lovers, at one point radiating such an incendiary chemistry that I cannot recall its equal in mainstream treatments of Lesbian lover affairs (if a Lynch movie can ever be designated 'mainstream').At the local Winkies restaurant (a recurring location fraught with dream-like significance behind its grubby realistic facade), Rita's attention is caught by a waitress's name-tag reading 'Diane.' This leads her to a recollection of someone named 'Diane Selwyn,' whose apartment the two women soon visit and, at Betty's insistence, break into. I won't reveal what they find within, but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage Lynchian creepiness. Subsequently, Rita wakes in night sweats speaking Spanish and hurrying Betty to an all-night magic show/theater called 'Silencio,' where the arts of illusion and lip/instrumental- syncing are practiced with manic intensity and where the Blue- Haired Lady, as she is noted in the end credits, reigns as the presiding Muse. Framed by the blue-lit, red-curtained Silencio Theatre, the blue-haired lady occupies the last shot in the film, perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination  rather like Steven's ""man with the blue guitar"" as filtered through bad- drug surrealism.During the Silencio sequence, and as Rebekah Del Rio cameo lip-syncs her own powerful Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's 'Crying'), a shattering epiphany occurs when Betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in Rita's purse. Even if we do not delve too deeply into the Freudian sexual symbolism of purses, the moment is a singularly Hitchcockian one in that the matching of the key and box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings. Not the least of these reversals is the discovery that Betty is the sought-for Diane Selwyn and the spurned lover of Camilla Rhodes (i.e. Rita). Camilla in turn is a Latin femme fatale movie star to whom Diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and, more significantly, to whom she is emotionally subjugated.After these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie is not so straightforwardly resolved as in 'Vertigo.' While bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much, if not all, of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of Diane herself, other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from 'Twin Peaks,' including Michael J. Anderson reprising his unearthly dwarfish powers and a Bob- variant who hangs out behind Winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id-like associations.However one fits the pieces together, though, the whole of 'Mulholland Drive' is much greater  and more mysterious  than the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive, provocative, and pleasurably disturbing mind trip. What's more, the film's cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospherics, the acting superb, and the directing /editing masterful. This may well have been the unacknowledged Best Picture of 2001 among major American releases.",Mulholland Drive
292,ghost-9,"Extremely over-rated, full of gimmicks, smoke and mirrors.",3,18 December 2002,"Mulholland Dr. entertained me a few times and I felt there were a couple of genuinely interesting scenes but I found the film as a whole to be boring and full of gimmicks.  A couple of cleaver scenes do not save a bad film.  I felt my time watching it was genuinely wasted and if the director was to offer me my money back, I'd gladly take it.  If you liked it, I have no problem with that, but I did not. I think the public is mistaking purposeful weirdness for creativity.  I don't think it takes that much creativity to be ""surrealistic"".

295,sashamyshkina,Surrealist cinema at its finest.,9,4 May 2021,"Strange, dark and glamorous, Mulholland Drive is probably what you get when you look up the definition of ""surrealist neo-noir mystery"" in a dictionary, and it's a movie that will linger on your mind for a long timeMulholland Drive is certainly a strange one, but it's very typical of David Lynch's style. It was with this movie that he perfected non-chronological storytelling, something which is very hard to do without boring your audience. I think that I knew what was happening until about 3/4 of the way through the movie, until everything flew out of the window and I spent the end of the movie trying to make head or tails of it. Only after coming here and joining the swathes of other people trying to interpret it, and reading the answers of the very helpful Q&A people, did I get it. To be honest, that pretty much accurately sums up my experience of watching all of Lynch's films.There's something so perfect, yet so jarring, about the atmosphere of this movie. I mean, it's unmistakably Lynchian in that facet - sleek and neo-noir, with a strange kin of beauty to it, and very dark undertones. I'm aware that this was supposed to be a TV pilot, and somehow I feel like it works as both. I definitely see the story going further, and based off of the masterpiece that was Twin Peaks, I think that Mulholland Drive would have done equally well as a series. That said, I did like the film's almost non-ending - yes, in theory it was (sort of) wrapped up, but you're still left wondering, for hours or even days, ""what in the name of hell was all of that?"". But again, that's the beauty of all of his films.Mulholland Drive is a dream captured in a movie - well, not quite - more like a dream that is actually a nightmare in disguise. It's absolutely captivating, and especially the scenes of the mysterious Silencio nightclub and the whirlwind ending further this intrigue.A beautiful, yet nightmarish, mystery that's the epitome of Lynch.-Sasha.",Mulholland Drive

A perfect, perfect film.",Mulholland Drive
297,varun_120,A wild goose chase,3,28 February 2012,"I am quite a generous reviewer. I am giving this a 3/10. I am kind of biased towards Naomi, otherwise this doesn't deserve more than a zero. As a lot of people may say this movie is very complicated, it gives away clues, you have to find them and you have to decipher the truth. Really, this is horse s#it.The movie is nothing but a set of loose & lousy acts put together and called a movie. There is no worse thing in a suspense movie in which a murder happens, you watch the entire damn movie, but the director doesn't bother to show you who the murderer was( Exception to this is a movie ' Memories of a murder',which was a breathtaking movie).I'd like to discuss this movie in brief. In the beginning an accident occurs, which leaves Laura Harring amnesiac. She sneaks into Naomi Watt's aunt's house. Naomi is a wannabe actress. She tries to help Laura to find, who she is and what really happened that night when accident happened.I am not going to say much about the rest- the dream, the reality, the hallucination and blah, blah, blah. As a lot of reviewers came up with a simple thing that Naomi ( Diane) is in love Laura ( Camila). But Diane can't become a big star, but Camilla becomes one. Then she is all set to be married to the director. Diane can't take it that her love is spurned by Camilla, so hires a guy to kill her and after that can't get over this guilt and also the shame of not living up to the expectations of her parents that she couldn't become a successful actress,so she kills herself.What I said above is a general interpretation of all the reviewers. But I can come up with another one that Diane couldn't become as successful actress as Camilla, so she might have killed her, and then tried to put this thing into her head that she might have had an affair with the director, to become a successful actress. She might not have been able to digest her failure and Camilla's success. That's why she may have dreamed about Camila's affair with the director.The director didn't bother to unravel anything, so we are all free to make our own interpretations. This is just like a painting of a dot ( mere dot) we go to have a look at, at the museum.One guy says this is the beginning of something spectacular, one may say this is the end of life and another may say after pondering a lot that this is just a fu**ing dot.I was amazed to see why it is so highly rated on IMDb. Pretentious people will say i figured it out. But actually there is nothing to be figured out. You are all free to make any interpretations you want. The film was directed by David Lynch, and got away with it once again. Had it been a novice director, he wouldn't have been allowed to direct a movie in his life ever again.How dare these so called intelligent directors to make such kinds of garbage. This works because everyone wants to save his face, by pretending to have understood the film. But actually there is nothing to be understood, this thing should at least be understood by the audience.As I already said, this film won't satisfy your answers, so reluctantly you will have to make up your own answers. Apart from a wild goose chase, this film is lousy & boring as hell. Laura Harring just looked like a beautiful dumb girl in the film. Naomi acts well (as she always does), but there is no script in the film, so she can't do anything about it. And also, Naomi was told by David Lynch to overact.This film was so frustrating that even a person who doesn't have an account on IMDb, will be forced to register and slam this pretentious trash. So, at least the film is successful in something.",Mulholland Drive
298,Craig-9,An Infuriating Film,9,5 December 2001,"For the first two-thirds or so, _Mulholland Drive_ is a great film, an enthralling experience.  Despite the presence of several loose ends and characters who are never revisited, the story is riveting and drags you along for the ride, almost against your will.  Then, the whole, flimsy house of cards collapses and we're treated to an absolutely incomprehensible conclusion in which people switch identities, etc., etc. 
In _Lost Highway_, this switch actually made some sort of sense, but here, it seems like nothing so much as a sudden realization on David Lynch's part that he must come up with some sort of conclusion, some way to wrap things up.  If this wasn't a Lynch film, critics would be absolutely merciless in tearing it to shreds.  But because the great David Lynch is the director, everyone assumes there must be some method to the madness. 
At the screening I attended, an old man in front of me said, rather loudly, as the credits rolled, ""What the hell was that?"" and the whole theater erupted in wild laughter.  He was verbalizing the reaction of many of us. 
Now, I'm a David Lynch fan through and through and will always be front and center at the release of each of his films, but this was a very disappointing experience.  It's too bad this wasn't picked up as a television series--there are moments of brilliance on display here and you can see where an extended series might have gone.

It somehow demands to be seen again, and I can't put my finger on why. So I'll stick to telling you what I know.Things I love about Mulholland Drive: 1) The way it looks. It's one of the best-shot films I've seen in several years. I can't remember seeing such seductively vivid colours in a movie, and the camera work contributes a great deal to the ominous mood (kudos to Peter Deming).2) Angelo Badalamenti's invaluable music, which comes out dark whether it's foreboding or up tempo.3) Naomi Watts, who apparently wholly embraced Lynch's vision and came up with a great, nuanced interpretation of her character.4) Justin Theroux's witty performance. He seemed to be on the same wavelength as Lynch, and he really inhabits his character.5) Finally, what makes Mulholland Drive the experience that it is, is that it casts a spell. There's no better way to put it, but this is what David Lynch does when he's at his best (Eraserhead, The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, the Twin Peaks episodes he directed). He creates moments that can only be described as film poetry. Moments he imbues with a mysterious, unexplainable power, such as a man in a diner describing a nightmare he had; Betty's audition scene; the moment when Betty and Adam's eyes lock on the movie set; or Betty and Rita's oddly emotional experience in the club Silencio.All that being said, I could have lived without Mr. Roque and the Cowboy, characters probably meant to add to the film's mood of mystery, whose too-obvious oddness instead ends up disrupting said mood.",Mulholland Drive

302,Netscape_Navigator,this movie is an INK BLOT,5,15 February 2006,"This movie is in IMDb's top 250 list, and it shouldn't be. There are many movies that I disagree with being on that list, but I can start to understand why they're there. For starters, they're movies with coherent plots that don't require ""clues"" from the director himself to understand.I first saw this movie about a year and a half ago, the plot was so unnecessarily twisted and the ending so unresolved and incomprehensible that I just assumed that I had missed something along the way, and didn't bother with this again for a year and a half. Well, this movie is so highly regarded, I figured I'd better be fair and give this another shot. This time there was no confusing it, I was left with violent feelings toward the director. Make that FIVE hours of my life David Lynch has stolen.People who defend this movie claim it has one of the most intricate, multi-faceted story lines ever, and that that's the beauty of the movie, the symbolism and all that crap. Had the director not given you those 10 clues, would you have figured it out yourself? Well if you did, then that's your version of the story, and chances are, you're wrong. There are many movies that are open-ended and left to the viewer to interpret, but the difference here is that this ENTIRE movie is open, not just the ending. You might as well let people write their own scripts if it's gonna be like that. That's like showing an inkblot to people, only the mentally deranged will declare that black blotch a masterpiece.Any movie that requires external intervention to even start to grasp meanings behind it is the result of a poor effort. Your movie has failed if it can't stand up on its own, and instead, relies on its viewers to take a trip to the fourth dimension in search of answers and return sweating and out of breath with the most convoluted explanations of symbolism. I think it's safe to say that your movie is reaching a bit if we need to do that.You know what, all arguments are moot when we consider the fact that this movie was the result of a failed pilot for ABC. When ABC declined to pick this up for a series, David Lynch then went back a year later and added more scenes and turned it into a movie. What we're left with is not some grand idea or vision that was meticulously planned out, no, this piece of crap is nothing more than what was able to be SALVAGED from his original 8 million dollar failed effort. And people are calling this a masterpiece...

Somewhere buried in the first two pages of the IMDB user comments is a detailed explanation of the second half.  Put shortly, the deceptively smooth narrative of the first half is a dream.  The second half is the waking state, told in a series of lurching flashbacks from the moment that Naomi Watts character wakes up.  The events that happen in the narrative present tense are Betty waking, noticing the key and killing herself.  The rest of the second half tumbles back and forth in the real world, connect events and names to the first by following a kind of half-awake, dream logic.  Most of it coheres once you see that.  The first half is a twisted fantasy from an embittered and spent person and the second half is the semi-coherent recollection of the events that triggered her dream.I thought it was an awfully clever thing to do with a bunch of footage that couldn't find a proper home.Some people hate or are sick of Lynch's fiction - with its hints of unknowable plots, dramatic sexual passions, dark ladies and so on.

The story is wandering and starts off very mysterious and intriguing. That is all very quickly traded for schlocky scenes about the seedy side of making movies and 50s nostalgia. The only common thread is the fantastic nude scenes. Any mystery you want solved devolves into boring scenes about the others involved rather than the main characters we are introduced to. The actors in this film deserve the most praise. They kept things interesting and played the heck out of these roles. Good movie, not great. Needed to make a bit more sense to be great.

Mulholland Drive is a movie which includes criticism about Hollywood and filmmaking.  Watch the movie and observe the various directing styles.  How does the story change when Betty reaches Los Angeles?  It looks like a bad movie like Showgirls.  But other times, MD is moody like an independent film, and sometimes it's weird with long wide lens shots and a floating camera like a David Lynch film: so is MD telling one story from the several different POVs?  Is it showing us how Hollywood might butcher something but how an independent filmmaker might shoot a story and how Lynch sees it, all running together in a linear plotline???  Like Rashomon, but without the obvious separation of storytellers---And it's a story about Hollywood and the business of filmmaking. Sometimes Hollywood looks like the Mob, and sometimes it's just business; Sometimes Betty is in our story, and sometimes she's in one of the other director's stories....and what about the key?  Is it blue because the French distributor of the film has a blue logo?  Is the commentary about how difficult it is to make a film woven into the story?  I'm only at the one hour mark on the DVD, but that's my view so far......should I even comment before the film is over?  Of course not, but Lynch didn't allow chapter stops in the DVD, so I'm stopping intentionally and giving my opinion before I even know what the whole story is....Mulholland Drive (to me) is a story given to us as if by three different directors: independent, Hollywood Big Budget, and Lynch, and it includes backstory commentary on how Hollywood bullies filmmakers......but again, I'm only at the 1:00:00 mark..........",Mulholland Drive
308,vbz,"Master & Margarita meets Vertigo - bold, brilliant stuff!",10,10 January 2002,"Don't call it a comeback, he's been here for years - and hopefully for many more years to come - David Lynch is truly the only remaining American director from that great 70's generation who is still capable of enthralling his audience. He knows well that they have seen everything, every imaginable plot twist, and yet he manages to surpass any and all expectations, to disregard all convention and lovingly proceed with a vision uniquely his - the trademark dreamscape with layers of sinister perversion underneath. We are pulled in, and emerge some 2+ hours later from a sensual experience more enjoyable and powerful than any intoxicant. At first, a scorching, hellish version of Los Angeles is presented, where strange, supernatural, possibly infernal characters interfere with the status quo of comically drawn Hollywood types - much like the opening chapters of the famous Bulgakov novel where the devil and his companions come to Moscow and wreak havoc in the literary circles. The local powers that be are ridiculed in a very similar fashion. But before one has time to get comfortable with the narrative's course, a torrid relationship bursts on the scene and suddenly we are in a very different place, physically and emotionally. After a hypnotic climax (Llorando will indeed make you weep), comes the equally bizzare denouement which purposefully leaves more questions than answers.Still, the end result is enormously satisfying - various parts of the film linger for days, weeks... Exquisite style and color, old-fashioned Hitchcockian camerawork, effective use of seemingly innocent 50's pop (Sixteen Reasons never sounded creepier) as counterpoint to Lynch's dark brushstrokes all work to near-perfection.

Certainly this film is unusual - Lynch doesn't disappoint in presenting a surreal, dreamlike montage lacking any clear plot progression - but it doesn't suffer from the apparently disjointed story-telling. If anything, it benefits from it. Your choice as to how you view the film, I tend to read it as fantasy/dream/illusion first, reality last. The fantasy juxtaposed against the grim reality of Tinseltown. Anyways, much to think and talk about here. That, at the end of the day, is how I ultimately judge a good film. If I leave it provoked, thoughtful and different somehow it has been effective. My vote 8/10 (almost a 9)",Mulholland Drive
311,ruffinelli_ro,Pretty lousy.,2,3 June 2010,"Everybody debates whether this movie makes sense or not. But, if the movie does make sense, is it automatically good? Well, the answer is no.I think this movie is about some girl that wanted to become an actress. Later she met other girl in some random set and falls for her. But when the girl got the part, and cheated on her, the main character enraged with jealousy and envy hired a hit-man. She then felt guilty of her girlfriend's death, so she started dreaming a different and somewhat happier development of events.Even if this was supposed to be a girl's dream sequence or something completely different, I felt it was a boring movie. The way the plot is being presented didn't work for me. But don't get me wrong, I love clever movies with smart plots and non conventional characters. On the other hand the use of a ""complicated"" plot presented in a confusing way in this case, seemed just like a desperate attempt to make the movie look smart. This film was even more presumptuous than Blue velvet, which I think was another bad film that tried too hard to become a transgressor of movie standards.I recommended this film before I even saw it, just because it has a high spot on IMDb's top 250. I will never do that again.",Mulholland Drive
312,Preston-10,The cinematic equivalent of Finnegans Wake,10,29 July 2002,"Mulholland Drive is the cinematic equivalent of Finnegans Wake, not just because Lynch created a film that transcends most typical cinematic conventions, but because he seems to have created an entirely new genre all to itself. Mulholland Drive is a puzzle within a puzzle, it has no plot, no beginning, no end, no overall theme, no structure. And yet it has enough structure for any person to have a rough idea of what's going on, granted if one looked closer. It's as if, and you know this can be taken literally, Lynch took his entire television series, cut random reels, put them in a box, and randomly edited one reel with the next. A lot of people have a problem with Mulholland Drive for the very fact that it was intended for T.V. According to their logic, how can you praise a film that came from a television series, when it never premiered on...well...television. I say, why not? The Hollywood of Mulholland Drive seems to have more in common with their criticisms then they would care to admit. In Lynch's movie, the film industry turns out careless bubble gum entertainment, while the industry itself is controlled by a closed society where all of the artistic decisions are pre-arranged, and sometimes by coercive means. If only more artists could learn from Lynch's example. No wonder Mulholland drive never made it to television, it's too good for a medium where every other show involves a court case, a ""reality theme"", or family foibles. I say why a court drama? Why not a film about the context of their dreams? In essence, Lynch hasn't created a film about film, Mulholland Drive...is film itself.",Mulholland Drive

It is cynical and cold, until it surprises you by stirring up emotions you didn't even know were being targetted. I won't waffle on any more, because if you haven't seen it already, indulge yourself.

315,radmanart,Sad but true interpretation of this movie by me,10,3 February 2018,"Sad but true meaning of this movie: No matter how many times I see the movie Mulholland Drive; I am more amazed every time. My wife and I had to drive many miles to see the movie when it first came out in a theater. It had limited theaters that the film was showing in the Dallas Morning News. I guess I was a huge David Lynch fan since Lost Highway https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Highway_(film). When we arrived at the theater that was showing the movie Mulholland Drive; I was amazed at how nice it was. The sound quality was very good; I remember the bass and loudness shook the room it was playing in. When we got done watching the long enthralling move; I could barely see straight. I remember having a hard time finding my way out of the theater. We actually went around the whole theater trying to find the door out. I felt dizzy, even high; after seeing the movie and making my way back to the car. When I searched the internet around that time and to the present; I could barely find any info on the subject. Now there is allot of interpretations on the movie's meaning. The Wikipedia page has grown enormous since then. If you are ever in a waiting room or something, and you need to kill some time on you phone; look it up on Wikipedia; it is a good long interesting read. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_(film) I think it is about two ghosts the haunt Hollywood. The ghosts relive their lives and how they first met. It is funny how Ghost Box recordings always work best with celebrity's. www.prrsociety.org/ghostbox.html Maybe the celebrity's possess this new found way of speaking through the afterlife. I think the movie is about a lesbian couple who's love is so strong it will not die. I think lesbians possess the most power to love each other transcending all other love. I think when two women love each other it becomes something different than normal explainable love. Women love like no other species on earth. Women possess the power to love far better than men. The two main stars in Mulholland Drive represent that love to me. Two women who's love for each other would not die; even after death. Of course since such love is normally despised and shunned; it almost explains why such a love would resonate past death upon the plain that is our pitiful existence.",Mulholland Drive
316,adam-may-bower,The best film of the 21st Century,10,2 June 2018,"'Mulholland Drive' is effortlessly one of the best films of the 21st century. Genius director David Lynch takes his audience head first into a surreal, neo-noir world full of complex characters, nightmarish imagery and amazing soundtrack (everything you'd expect from Lynch) and after the credits close you feel like you have just woken up from a dream that is both terrifying and beautiful. Naomi Watts delivers one of the most unforgettable performances in film history and captivates the audience in every scene she is in, while being backed up from wonderful performances by Laura Harring and Justin Theroux. Angelo Badalamenti's haunting score greatly contributes to the atmosphere of the film, as well as several stand out songs such as ""Sixteen Reasons"" by Connie Stevens and ""Llorando"" by Rebekah Del Rio. While mainstream audiences may be put off by the slow-moving plot line and many unanswered questions, 'Mulholland Drive' offers a compelling and thought-provoking storyline for those who dare.",Mulholland Drive
317,God-12,Tediously failed attempt to be clever.,2,20 April 2002,"I am sorry I was mislead by reviewers to see this bit of tedious nonsense. It clearly is trying far too hard to be clever - and failing. The situations do not convince, the acting is poor and the hollywood references both obvious and naive. The plot is straightforward, once you see the game being played and actions are signalled well in advance.I really think that this is a modern version of the 'Emperor's New Clothes'. Pretending to like it, or see some profundity in it may seem necessary if you are surrounded by other poseurs doing the same - resist the temptation.If you want a good bit of surreal action go to see Amilie - it succeeds in every point where this film fails.",Mulholland Drive
318,Sisiutil,"Quirky, unconventional, challenging--typical Lynch, typically brilliant",9,7 November 2004,"*SPOILER ALERT*It's almost impossible to discuss this film without divulging spoilers. But you really should experience it without any preconceptions. Suffice it to say that I highly recommend the film. If you've enjoyed Lynch's work before, you'll probably love Mulholland Dr.; if you're not familiar with his movies but like an unconventional film experience that challenges your intelligence, you'll probably love it; but if you prefer conventional stories that don't require you to engage your cerebrum beyond paying attention, you'll probably hate it. Anyway, if it sounds like you'd like it, go out and see it and don't read any further. Okay. The first clue that you are NOT in for a conventional film experience is when the words ""A Film By David Lynch"" appear on the screen in the film's opening seconds. Unlike the much more widely-lauded Tarantino, with who he shares a penchant for non-linear narratives, Lynch is not content to merely let his film be a mere bloody and foul-mouthed homage to a number of B-movie genres. No, Lynch is, as he always does, going to challenge his audience--delighting many and royally ticking off others. Lynch spends nearly two hours gradually building up a complex narrative--a mystery with some typically Lynchian quirks--and the characters in it, all the while suffusing the events on the screen with an ominous sense of foreboding and dread. Then he takes an unexpected left turn, deconstructing everything that went before. The result is breathtaking, and unlike most modern films that you can dissect in mere minutes, this one could keep you arguing for weeks. Lynch is willing to take chances that make most other film-makers wet their shorts. He allows the camera to linger longer on a particular shot than most of today's ADD-ridden, MTV-trained directors are willing to do. He's unafraid to use unusual camera angles, or to try to find the disturbing qualities in mundane, ordinary inanimate objects. Brian De Palma spent most of the 80s trying to be Hitchcock's successor and failed; Lynch is the Master's true heir. He gets great performances from his cast, too. Harring and Theroux are both strong, but Naomi Watts is the real stand-out, showing incredible depth and range. No wonder this role put her on the map, and deservedly so.There's a lot of discussion about making sense of the film's abrupt narrative change, but I got it within minutes, on the first viewing. All the clues were there. I'm more interested in what the film's about.Most of Lynch's work (especially his two other best-known works, ""Twin Peaks"" and ""Blue Velvet"") portrays the dichotomy of America: cheery, neighborly, painfully naive optimism on the one hand; and a dark, seedy and dangerous underbelly on the other. With that perspective, it's amazing that it took him so long to make a movie about Hollywood. The first part of the film is not just a dream, it's an illusion, and that's what Hollywood is all about. And we don't just love and cherish those illusions, we need them desperately. When Betty/Diane's illusions are stripped from her, when she sees the hypocrisy of Hollywood, it doesn't bring enlightenment. She and the one person she loves most are both destroyed in the process. As a result, we end up seeing the first two hours of the movie as Diane's desperate, final attempt to reboot her life. She attempts to live it out as it should have been, as it could have been. But reality intrudes. She's had the blindfold pulled from her eyes, and she's not just seen her worst, ugliest side, she's set it loose upon her ex-lover and eventually herself.This is dark, even horrific stuff, and tragic as well. It's also damn brilliant.",Mulholland Drive

He took a rather straight forward story and then when the show was canceled, he turned that story into a dream and then wrote another story around it.  It's not a bad idea and it worked fairly well.  However, this is not a perfect movie, so I really don't understand why some people get orgasmic over it.  I also don't understand why so many of the people who loved this movie consider all of the red herrings and unanswered questions to be positive things.  To me, they are just weirdness thrown in for the sake of weirdness.  Some of it was entertaining, however, so I can't fault him too much for that.The bottom line is that I was entertained for the whole movie and intrigued enough by the ending to watch it again for more clues.  I'm kind of disappointed in the whole ""it was a dream"" side of things, as I see that as a huge cop out, story telling-wise.  But, as dream stories go, this one isn't bad.  I'm not a Hollywood insider, but I expect that the satire angle works at that level.  I also appreciate the risks involved.  Most work, but some don't.  8/10 stars.",Mulholland Drive
321,orangeisthenewawesome,Terrific...but needs to be watched a few times,9,7 January 2009,"This was my first David Lynch film so I was not fully prepared for what to expect. I also saw it on video so I was able to watch it, read about it online, and then watch it a few more times in a small span of time.Now that I understand the movie, I recognize its brilliance. There are numerous interpretations as to whether or not the events of the film are shown in or out of sequence. This can be highly confusing for a viewer. Once you get past that, you notice the meticulously intertwined character arcs, the symbolism, the significance of seemingly insignificant scenes. The story, while simple, is powerful and dark. I never got bored. The acting is PHENOMENAL, particularly that of Naomi Watts. This was her breakthrough role for a reason - she shows amazing versatility and range in portraying the complicated character of Diane. The supporting performances were fine - no one stood out but no one was awful either. See it but be prepared to not fully understand it til you see it a few more times.",Mulholland Drive
322,snow0r,Contains mild mental anguish.,8,1 February 2006,"Well well well. David Lynch's Mulholland Drive does, at first, appear all over the place. It appears relatively slow moving for the first quarter. It seems to be a mix of disconnected, poorly acted, irrelevant scenes (what *was* the psychiatrist in the diner scene about?) but unfortunately, it is far from that. From the outset Lynch riddles Mulholland Drive with clues as to what is really going on...it is just up to the viewer to play close attention.Suddenly things pick up. People get shot, there are laughs, there's a ridiculously over-the-top Mafia subplot, and there are lesbians. And then it all goes to Hell with Club Silencio. Just as you think you're starting to pick it up, Betty has a fit, and Lynch pulls his audience through a mentally devastating final quarter, complete with a maze of skipping timeframes, symbolism, and crazy old people.The end kills you. ""Silencio"". You know it's going to end like that (probably the only thing you can actually call before it happens) and then you sit there and try to wrap your head around it. Lynch leaves clues, literally (in the box), and metaphorically (in the film), and even with these, it's impossible to completely understand absolutely everything. I looked it up; there are loads of internet sites explaining what you've just witnessed (but none of them cover that blue box...) and you feel better for understanding it (although part of you wishes you got it yourself), and I think only then can you really appreciate it. Watching it without understanding it or trying to understand it results in dismissives (""what?"" ""it's crap"" and so on) but enjoying Mulholland Drive comes through understanding, be it self-deduced or taught.Unfortunately the complicated thematic workings somewhat overshadow what is a quite special performance from Naomi Watts, playing the roles of amateur small-town wannabe actress and jealous lover brilliantly, a performance complimented by the timid temptress of Laura Harring and Justin Theroux's arrogant yet cool director (jewellry in paint? awesome). It's difficult to keep up and notice anything else.If you put in the time to understand it, or at least find out about it, you'll enjoy it. If you don't, you won't. It's as simple as that.",Mulholland Drive
323,daved-3,"Dull, plodding, pedantic",3,24 November 2001,"This film makes no sense.  I could stop my review there, but seeing as this film is currently taking up space in the top 250 that would be better used by Weekend at Bernie's, let me repeat--there is absolutely no linear narrative thread running through the course of this motion picture.  David Lynch is too busy filming things out of focus to bother with thinking up a ""plot."" I suppose that would be fine in something interesting happened while we were being taken on this non-linear trip, but aside from a couple of lesbian scenes featuring two very good looking women, nothing remotely interesting happens in well over two hours.  Despite its excessively long running length, the film shows signs of major editing--for example, Robert Forster gets star billing and shows up in one scene for about 30 seconds.The acting isn't bad, but since it all takes place in an emotional void it is impossible to tell what the actors are supposed to be conveying most of the time.  Is the director laid-back?  too frighten for words?  Really Cool? Stoned?  Planning a counter-move?  Who can tell if this is good acting or not?I would love to know if anyone out there who rated this film higher than a five could tell me the plot.  I sort of doubt it.",Mulholland Drive

328,MovieFanGuyy,Mulholland Drive is easily David Lynch's masterpiece.,10,1 July 2010,"David Lynch has always been one of my favorite directors. From Eraserhead, to Twin Peaks to Lost Highway, he has never disappointed. To say his films are weird are an understatement as his films definitely have an acquired taste.Mulholland Drive, which was released back in 2001, was originally another television pilot which was going to be used by ABC, after the resounding success of Twin Peaks in the early 1990s. However, the network found the episode a little too strange for their taste, so they decided to pass it up. Lynch, being the visionary that he is, found international funding and was able to make his truly weird vision for one of the most unique films of the last several years.Betty Elms has just arrived in Los Angeles from Ontario Canada with dreams of stardom in her mind. She stays at her aunt's apartment and has an audition immediately scheduled. Another mysterious woman, named nicknamed Rita, is found after a car accident with no memory of who she is, but all we know about her is that she has a lot of the mob's money in her purse.In all Lynch glory, the tables are turned on both characters and nothing is what is really seems. Characters and situations are not what they seem, and this is a film that needs to be seen several times to figure out the clues as the the real meaning of the ending of the film.All I can say is that I hope that Lynch can continue making great movies as he has not had a big mainstream hit since 1999's The Straight Story, his first and only G rated film.Mulholland Drive, definitely a film for true Lynch fans, and definitely not to be missed.",Mulholland Drive

From the poems of Sappho circa 630 - 570 BCE, Lesbos, Greece.Lynch you are a tease! As of late, a great fan of David Lynch's work, I finally got round to watching ""Mulholland Drive"". There is a turning point in the course of the film where everything appears to be thrown up in the air and any assumed understanding of the multiple strands plot, disappears. It's the point where someone may justifiably scream ""What the hell is going on?"". Persevere and you will be rewarded! Not everything makes sense, some scenes in my view are meaningless in terms of plot relevance, such as the cowboy random appearances, the reckless and clumsy contract killer shooting mistakenly through a wall and carrying on killing irrelevant people, the bizarre mafioso espresso coffee spitting scene, the young man with the dream-come-true fear at Winkie's, but curiously enough they don't appear to be out of place in the film. I am sure seasoned cinematography critics could explain these easily but in my view the film is a fantasy, a dream with some nightmarish undertones. And, in dreams or fantasies we don't have to explain everything. In most cases we wouldn't be able to, anyway!What came to mind as I was watching Diane/Betty moving along the non-linear flow of the film, were notions of innocence, aspiration, love, passion, failure, reality, disappointment, jealousy, hate, envy, rage, vengeance, remorse, retribution, (old couple resembling the goddesses of retribution, Erinyes, tormenting the wrong-doers). Do these words bring to mind the human condition? Not the mainstream feature film but it wasn't meant to be. It challenged me immensely but in a nice way, tantamount to that of trying to solve an engrossing riddle or puzzle. Have I fully understood what was really intended by David Lynch? Most probably not, but I believe I have arrived at a conclusion good enough to make me appreciate this masterfully made psychological Sapphic and enigmatic thriller. I enjoyed it and that's what matters to me.It could be considered as the second instalment in a trilogy of psychological dream-like mystery thrillers, with the first being ""Lost Highway – 1997"" and the third ""Inland Empire – 2006"".Some reviewers have brought the gory and sick ""Hellraiser"" into their reviews here. Why? Different genres! And as for the box thing, if they were to be fair and just, then surely it is Pandora that should be suing Clive Barker for copyright infringement!My only criticism must unreservedly go to the DVD release owners who ""forgot"" to add subtitles and chapters, in this edition by studio CANAL, Optimum HOME.

David Lynch back on form with an endlessly fascinating movie that takes you by the hand and leads you down the darkest alley-ways of human trauma and psychosis, and yet, at the same time, manages to evoke an overwhelming sense of compassion and sadness.
Refreshingly too, a film that is actually filmic and which understands the grammar and language of cinema, and, (as is always the case with David Lynch), one that knows how to use the soundtrack as an artistic adjunct rather than merely as a means of carrying dialogue and playing music.
I have always yearned to see a film that captures the truly dark, downside of Hollywood and this is almost it, but how stunningly it reminds us that this City of Angels has probably broken far more hearts than it has ever made happy. To have set it all in the 50s (that most under-rated of decades which in many ways, was far more revolutionary and potentially subversive than any subsequent ones) was a master-stroke - from the adroit, neat, sexy skill of the opening jitterbug dancers to the rag-doll parody of a Mick Jagger in less than two decades - the road map is all here; in heart-breaking Technicolor and bright Max Factor lipstick and nail varnish.",Mulholland Drive

Well, why watch these odd stage performances for nearly 10 minutes if they are not actually saying anything? This movie is certainly not in my taste. Yes, I guess my precoded male genome found certain scenes to be of a very primitive interest... but that is not what makes a good movie or makes me vote for it one way or the other.

Then also, I just didn't get a lot of the stuff that was going on later... maybe it's the fast forward buttons fault, but anyway.

334,MiloMindbender,Style over substance,1,24 December 2001,"Without a doubt this was the worst movie I've seen all year.  DavidLynch may have showed promise in his first film ""Eraserhead"" andhis feature debut ""Blue Velvet"".  However, since then, he has failedto create anything memorable or interesting.  Like ""Lost Highway"",Mulholland Drive"" fetishizes style and comes off as one big bore.The acting is the worst I've seen in a major film this year (with theexception of the blonde's acting scenes), the scenes are socontrived as to be laughable, and the plot is paper thin.
Yes, contrary to many reviews, the film does have a plot, and whenyou take away all the style, you see that it is one that has been triedmany times before & to much better effect.  ""Memento"" is a farbetter play on time and loss of memory, and is much cleverer in itsportrayal of these themes.  ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" succeedsin capturing the feel of earlier noir, while adding a contemporarytwist and is a far superior film to boot.   Because the acting iswooden, scenes are completely random & little beyond the plotthat isn't trite or cliche, ""Mulholland Drive"" has no tension,suspense or really anything to grip the viewers attention outside ofslick set designs (which aren't really that slick anyway) and so itcan not really be considered film noir. Finally, ""HeavenlyCreatures"" is a much more competent portrait of love evolvingbetween 2 girls, who at the same time build their own idiosyncraticworld around them.As in all of his other movies except The Straight Story, David Lynchtries to masquerade the fact that the film has little substance andno inherent worth by screwing around with the narrative &characters.  This device may have been interesting earlier in hiscareer, but by now it has become one big fat bore.  I found myselfyawning through most of the movie and would have walked outafter half an hour, had I gone alone.Others have claimed that the movie captures LA, both the town andthe movie industry, but I found that it did neither.  It's attempt atsatire was so obvious that its barbs against the biz really had nobite, but were really just one more tired cliche.  If you really want to see creepiness on film, there are much betterchoices.  Cronenberg is a far superior film maker to David Lynchand any of his films (except for Crash) would be far better choicesthan this tired mess.

OK, I am a professional pianist/composer/arranger (jazz-oriented, mostly, TV music, studio orchestras backing up singers, jazz player with my quintet).Some movies I consider very good:  ""To Kill a Mockingbird""; 12 Angry Men; Usual Suspects; Memento; The Sleepers; Strange Days; The Fight Club; Strangers On A Train; Come on! I was shocked to find that everything I found just terribly awful in this film has been nominated (???) to awards:  Utterly non-believable dialogue; exasperated slowliness (please, don't tell me it was on purpose!!!); awful music score (which, BTW, disappears quite a lot which makes it ""Europeanish""); gratuitious rather long softcore Lesbian sex scenes; awful acting; laughable characters; confusion, confusion, confusion (get sober, Lynch!).

It also is the best American movie of the last 5 years, although the fact that it does not have any particularly close competitors in this respect can be viewed as a reflection on Hollywood. It does not hurt that Laura Elena Harring is a drop-dead gorgeous actress and one that has not been seen too often in the movies.The plot is not particularly easy to understand, but an excellent, comprehensive explanation is given in The Perfect Vison magazine, Issue 42 (May/June 2002). The plot DOES make sense and one can reflect appropriately upon the capabilities of critics who wrote that it makes no sense to them.",Mulholland Drive

339,supernma,You won't get it on the first watch,10,26 July 2010,"Avant-garde director David Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr."" is an eye-popping, sultry, mesmerizing experience that ultimately requires all kinds of mental gymnastics and deep thinking in order to solve a teasing, dare I say sexy, enigma. Certainly not for the casual moviegoer, Lynch employs candy-like colors, deep focus, and other optical tricks to disorient the viewer. Watching the film is as close as you'll get to hellucinating with out the aid of hellicinogens.To explain the story and plot in a way that would make sense would be impossible without completely giving it all away (not to mention several detailed paragraphs). Therefore, I'm just going to focus on the technical aspects. The acting is superb, with even the most minor characters delivering solid performances. Of course, Naomi Watts carries the film and truly demonstrates the caliber of her skills in a part that demands heavy emotions. The look of the film, as described earlier, is fantastic and endlessly interesting fascinated; you find yourself staring at the screen like a child in a toy store. The direction and writing is some of the best in recent cinematic history. Lynch somehow manages to continuously and relentlessly build suspense during even the most seemingly calm or mundane scenes, and the eerily twisted score by Angelo Badalamenti helps drive this constant feeling of anxiousness.I wish I could say a lot more about the film, but literally every aspect of it is so important and critical to understanding the film that to discuss it could spoil the experience. Just put your thinking cap on and don't look away.",Mulholland Drive
340,jwpappas,The Movie is a 10 BUT the DVD is a 0! Don't waste your $$,10,13 April 2002,"I loved Lynch's dream/nightmare of LA. I saw ""Muholland Drive"" twice in the theatre & was eagerly anticipating the DVD release. Boy was I shocked & outraged when I popped it into my DVD player.  DO NOT BUY THE CURRENT DVD VERSION!! There are NO CHAPTERS!! The entire film is one chapter! For a film like this in which total film geeks (like me) will want to access certain scenes, that is ridiculous. If ""Dude Where's My Car?"" can have chapters so should ""Muholland Drive"". This is not a problem with this particular DVD--when I went to return the film I was told that was the way it was released. The Tower Records in the East Village is getting a LOT of returns of the ""Muholland Drive"" DVD for this very reason. Wait until Criterion or another reputable DVD company issues it. What a bummer!",Mulholland Drive
341,The Movie Buff,A good experiment gone terribly wrong,5,19 April 2002,"The plot outline of mulholland drive is excellent, though it stole the idea from memento, which was better told and overall a better movie.     Mulholland drive starts off in the middle of a story, and then continues on and ends at the beginning of the story.  The movie started off slow, with not enough dialogue.  Then it started to capture me and I was almost completely sucked in to the movie.  Then, of course, stupid David Lynch goes into 20 plus minutes of pure garbage.  He is purposely trying to deceive the audience, and have it so that they dont know what is going on.  Whereas in memento, though it was very complex, the audience is always given the ""chance"" to understand what is going on, Mulholland drive purposely tries to confuse you.  There were also too many art film scenes that could have been left out, such as the two girls in the theater.  They presented nothing to the movie, only confusion.      When looking back, it was a good story, after seeing the end, leading to the end, is where the movie went wrong.  However the movie is worth viewing but dont fall into the trap of thinking that if you watch it again it will make more sense, trust me, it doesnt.  The reason for this is that the overrated director doesnt want in to make sense.",Mulholland Drive

I was not bored, this is not a boring movie, but all I can say is that having seen all of Lynch movies...there is nothing new here. If you are familiar with Lynch's movies you'll know what I mean, creepy characters, a great score, extreme close ups, great looking women, freaky men, first rate acting, and a story that keeps dragging you in because if it is this good then the payoff is going to be great...but no great payoff. As always a couple of memorable scenes, a hit that gets insanely screwed up, club Silencio, and many more. I am not sorry I saw it, but with all the hype I expected more.",Mulholland Drive
343,aakash-karkare,A great trip down the darkest corridors of the mind,9,22 November 2010,"I don't know how to write a review for this film. It challenges the conventional methods of storytelling. There is no way to tell what it is trying to say. We don't even know where it begins or where it ends. We don't know if it is reality,fiction,fantasy,science fiction, dream or what else. All we know is that it is Lynch film and with Lynch that is all you can be sure of.Terry Pratchett says how good stories start at different points in the universe but collide at one point and that is where they get interesting. Lynch seems to follow this but at the point they collide something tremendous happens and suddenly everything is upside down.Mullholland Dr. opens with a surreal dance sequence and then the camera pans to a car accident. We see only one survivor who is now an amnesiac with a bag of money. At this point it can be any normal detective story. It could have been a great film noir. But suddenly all these other things begin to happen. The movie has its own atmosphere. It is central to the telling of the story. There is brilliant use of lighting and colour. In some scenes you could literally frame them and it would look like a great little surreal painting. The acting is outstanding. Both the leads have very good chemistry and play their roles really well especially Naomi Watts. Also the score makes the movie more surreal, more fascinating, it involves you completely in the plot.Mullholland Dr. is an extremely fascinating trip into the lives of two women. One an aspiring actress and the other an amnesiac. There is romantic tension and it slowly builds into a very poignant sex scene where Naomi's character keeps repeating that she loves Rita. And after that point things begin to fall apart.There could be number of interpretations to what happens after wards but that is the beauty of the movie. You can watch it again and again. It is so densely layered and rich in detail that you never get bored. It is tremendously engrossing and a very rich and rewarding movie watching experience.]For me you could say it is about the fragility of life. Anything can suddenly crack or break and your whole life turns upside down. Like the key and the box are such trivial things but they were opened and something terrible happened.Or I sometimes think that the box was an outlet to a parallel universe and when it opened everything turned upside down since we descend into it with the camera. Maybe it was like Pandora's box. Lynch has created one of the best movies of recent times with Mullholland Dr.",Mulholland Drive
344,panchodh_12,A movie to be re-watched,9,20 May 2016,"This is a mesmerizing movie, and a narrative masterpiece. But also, let's face it, it is a failed TV-pilot. This duality is central to Mulholland Drive, and it is present throughout the movie. It is hard to tell where the genius begins and the failure ends, which is probably what makes it so fascinating. Why does a certain subplot seem so lame? Why is a certain character behaving in such a cliché way? Are they symbolizing a super-stylized version of reality constructed by a failed actress' subconscious or are we just watching the takes of a failed, bad TV project? Of course, then came the interpretations. And some of them make a lot of sense. I think the whole ""It is all Diane's dream"" does make sense to a certain extent, yet at the same time it is, at least, very fascinating that the most surreal, irrational scenes (the last half an hour) are the ones which are supposed to be taking place in the ""real"" word.Though, at the end of the day, the take-home message of this film is, what is the real world? Mulholland Drive tackles the issue that has pervaded art since antiquity, of how to mimic the real world so to convince the audience, how to play God with a bunch of props and actors. The words spoken at the Club Silencio resonate in the viewer after the closing credits: there is no orchestra, it's just a recording. Our senses think they are in front of something real, but it is no more than an artifact.This is indeed, a classic of our time. And as such, it is a must-watch. But don't expect to understand it at the first time. Because, in the end, there's not much to be understood. As a public, we demand rationality, clarity and coherent plot lines from film-makers; and Lynch's answer to that demand is a surrealistic reminder that movies, just like real life, are not always what we want them to be.",Mulholland Drive
345,awalter1,Nancy Drew goes to Hollywood.,10,25 September 2001,"The young and beautiful but naive Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) leaves her home in Ontario for Hollywood and immediately finds herself mixed up with a mysterious amnesiac woman who calls herself Rita (Laura Harring).  Betty has come to tinseltown hoping to become an actress, and, while trying to help Rita recover her identity, Betty crosses paths with film director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux).  Slowly a bizarre love triangle unfolds between the three characters, and Betty finds herself in an inescapable nightmare that may just be of her own making.After his surprisingly successful experiment with sentimental American heartland drama in `The Straight Story,' director David Lynch returns with panache to the psycho-surreal territory he has claimed as his own. `Mulholland Drive' creates a new neighborhood in Lynchville bordered closely by `Fire Walk With Me' and `Lost Highway,' and echoes of those two films are heard throughout `Mulholland Drive.'  Here are eerie archetypal messengers, an illusionist, mysterious puzzles and keys,  an inexplicable corpse, malignant evil, and the most terrifying of dreams.Lynch's cast is, as usual, excellently suited to the strange goings-on.  The three leads give subtly nuanced performances and are surrounded at all times by a number of excellent supporting actors.  Dan Hedaya and Robert Forster have very small parts, as do Michael J. `Twin Peaks' Anderson, Ann Miller (a veteran of old Hollywood), and Lynch's longtime musical collaborator Angelo Badalamenti--but all of them add a wonderful spice to their scenes.  Richard Green as the Magician and Layfayette Montgomery as the Cowboy both create defining and unforgettable Lynch characters. Two other spectacular features of the film bear mentioning.  First is the soundtrack, which does a great deal to enhance the film's mood, from Badalamenti's typically brooding numbers and supporting tunes by Lynch and John Neff to the heartrending performance of Roy Orbison's `Crying' sung in Spanish,  a capella, by Rebekah Del Rio.  Second is the delicious non-linear plot, evoking inevitable associations with `Lost Highway.'  Anyone who had trouble with `Lost Highway,' however, should not stay away from `Mulholland Drive.'  While one cannot promise that `Mulholland Drive' will be easier to swallow, comparing the two films will certainly do much to illuminate the exquisite madness of Lynch's method.",Mulholland Drive
346,geraldclare,Pretentious Claptrap,3,27 May 2002,"I kept wondering how much money the film made, hoping that if it did poorly the outcome would be that no one would ever give David Lynch the money to make a film again.  I've been an anti-fan of his since Twin Peaks went the way of all Lynch projects, into pseudo-artiness and clunky mythos.Naomi Watts gave a great performance I thought, but what a laughable rediculous predictable script. So you take John Waters, remove sense of humor and irony, inject pretentions of artistry and, voila, David Lynch. When John Waters has actors acting woodenly, he does so with tongue in cheek. Lynch seems indifferent to acting, as if he thinks photography and symbolism are all that are required. Someone should tell him he is not the American Ingmar Bergman, though he seems to wish he was.He should probably be filming television commercials or music videos.Come on, the hideous face and the guy that drops dead at the sight of it... what the hell was that supposed to be? A reference to satan? To the nightmare of existence, or just an emblem of Lynch's unconscious?
Phooey!",Mulholland Drive
347,erikgloor,"Ode to, biting criticism of Hollywood",9,19 October 2001,"No, none of it makes a bit of sense. None of it. Not until the end. Not until you're walking out shaking your head. THAT's when you start to get it. At least that's when I got it.Watching this film is like a number of things. The metaphor I've been selling to friends and relatives is that it's rather like slipping away from a cocktail party on the 80th floor, stripping off all of your clothes and walking all the way around the building on the ledge outside before dressing again and slipping back into the party like nothing ever happened. Weird analogy? Yeah, well you haven't seen weird 'til you've seen this film.*** SPOILER WARNING, NEXT PARAGRAPH ONLY ****** Though no one may ever accurately decipher the movie's true story, my assessment is the only one I've read that fits with all the plot points given in the film ***Imagine that you are a floundering actress and that your soul is being crushed by these three regrets: First, you've been dumped by your movie-star-beautiful lover who, additionally, beat you out for the lead in a movie and who also seems intent on rubbing your losses in your face. Second, you've hired a lowlife to have her killed and there's nothing you can do to stop it. Third and worst, you're still in love with her. What kind of dream would you dream? What thoughts would pass through your mind just before you finally make the decision to blow your brains out? Would you wish that somehow, in fine Hollywood fashion, your lover is saved in the nick of time but loses her memory and returns to you humbled and vulnerable, giving you, essentially, a second chance at true love? Would you dream that you embark on a mission to help her and, in the process, prove yourself an unfailing, unselfish and lion-hearted companion who is also an incredible actress. That's the movie. Your dream, your last crazy Hollywood wish is the vessel containing the entire film and it's myriad sub-plots. Lynch just turns the whole thing inside-out so we don't know the reality of her plight until the very end.*** END SPOILER WARNING ***The myriad sub-plots seem to me to be where people lose track of this picture. And you really can't blame them because what Lynch does is use the dying dreams of our sorrowful actress as a landscape which he proceeds to populate with the real-life experiences and intention-infused dreamworlds of a host of other characters. How can anyone dream someone else's dream?Many of these other dreamworlds of perception and intention are left dangling and hint vaguely at what could have been made of them if the movie had been made into a TV series as was originally intended. An ordinary filmmaker, had he wanted to show us the heartless nature of fame beneath Hollywood's shiny exterior, would have directed a standard narrative start-to-finish story about a small-town girl who comes to LA, succumbs to corrupt relationships, and loses the role of her lifetime to her lover because her lover has mob connections. This kind of film would have put members of the earliest movie-going audiences -- those of the 40s and 50s -- in that tragic character's head. The experiences of these audiences forged Hollywood's reputation as the dream-factory. But the jaded 21st century audience has seen a million such tales on TV and in the movies by the time they've bought a ticket to ""Mulholland Drive."" In his masterful way, though, and because you aren't expecting it to be done to you in this way, Lynch does to you what the Hollywood-of-old did to those first movie-goers. He puts you in another world. In another head. In another set of experiences. In another soul. In this respect, Lynch's film is a most sublime homage to that Hollywood that has brought so much magic into so many lives. How can anyone dream someone else's dream? We've been doing it in theatres for years, thanks to Hollywood. But Lynch pays his homage by making more real to us than has ever been done before the miserable plight of one of its countless victims. In this respect, he is Hollywood's sharpest critic yet.By entertaining us with his exquisite insights, and framing them in such a way that we become the story, Lynch has proved himself a true artist and a very new kind of filmmaker. ""Mulholland Drive"" probably won't win the Academy Award for best picture; but only because Hollywood, sexy old gypsy that she is, won't have the courage to hold the mirror that close.This movie review by Erik Gloor",Mulholland Drive
348,ftm68_99,Style over substance,9,10 August 2002,"While I'd say that David Lynch is tops as a story-teller, as a story-writer, he is not so good.  In some ways, the story of ""Mulholland Drive"" is naive and I think that, overall, the story is slight. But the way in which the story is told, via the visuals and the audios--if that's a word--is sublime. I am still intoxicated by the incidental scenes of Misses Elizabeth Lackey and Melissa George lip-sychning at the auditions, and of Miss Rebekah del Rio singing at the club.  The music of Angelo Badalamenti and the production design of Jack Fisk make this movie a feast for the eyes and the ears, and, and its end, though I felt the story itself to have been weak, I felt elated by the way in which it had been told.",Mulholland Drive
349,fortey,I think a lot of people were duped.,1,6 November 2002,"I get the feeling a lot of people liked this movie (not all people, but a lot of them) because they don't want to admit they don't understand it. People of middling intelligence, if you will, who pretend to be ever so avant garde and trendy who think Lynch is a genius.Lynch, to me, is like Tarantino.  They're both great, but neither one is the messiah as so many fanboys want to believe.  No director can change the world, so chill out.  And both make sucky flicks sometimes, it just happens. Everyone has a bad day.  And clearly, since this movie was actually designed as a pilot first and then hack-jobbed into a feature film, it wasn't made with all the passion and forethought one should put into a movie.  Face it, much of the movie is gibbering unintelligibility which cannot be understood.  We can all make up meanings, Lynch may have his own view, but none of that matters.  It was strewn about the screen incoherently.  Admittedly, the first portion had the semblance of an intentionally convoluted passingly interesting story, but then it falters.The cowboy, the mysterious organization of men with their phonecalls, the lawyers... come on.  I can almost picture David Lynch yelling cut, forcing the crew to gather around him and explaining to them all ""Look how crazy and weird I am! Isn't it great?? It's so weird and crazy!""  Weird and crazy works if it's a by-product of your style.  However, it's pretentious and tired when you go out of your way to do nothing but that.

I agree with many other reviewers who have already said what I wanted to say.Great direction, cinematography, and even the acting, which at times doesn't make sense, suddenly does when you get to the end. The strange-ness of the film near the end reminds me a lot of the theatrical which just adds to my admiration, because there's just so much potential to be explored by combining those styles. I felt there was a certain energy that I've seen on the stage being transferred into the film's conclusion which is just original and refreshing to watch.To me, this film is a character tragedy involving an actress full of dreams and illusions, and the monster that is Hollywood and its surrounding bubbles of people. Disturbing, fascinating, and utterly absorbing, I loved being sucked into this movie filled with seemingly out-of-nowhere characters and incidents, because it all tied up at the end and definitely left me with a little of the creepy crawlies -- nice, unexpected surprise.I love when movies break out of the norm that is Hollywood cinema.

352,Kevin_Maness,excellent psychological thriller,10,14 January 2002,"I've read a number of reviews of Mulholland Drive, and I'm frustrated that even the best of them seem to throw up their hands and resign this movie to hopeless complexity.  Even the critics who like it very much see it as a tangle of nightmarish twists and incongruencies that defies rational explanation.  While I agree that this movie is a fabulous depiction of a dream or a network of dreams (I admire Roger Ebert's review, for instance), I disagree with the tendency to chalk the movie up as one more example of David Lynch's impenetrable neurosis.  Rather, I believe that this movie is a powerful and insightful representation of the psychology of its central character, a woman whose life has become a hell of disappointment and bitterness.  At the same time, it is a vicious send-up of Hollywood politics and filmmaking that makes The Player look polite and worshipful.  No, the movie is not tremendously accessible.  No, we don't get a Psycho-esque resolution at the end where a helpful but pedantic psychotherapist reveals the layers of meaning and traces Betty/Diane's descent into madness.  But, to the extent to which dreams might provide insight into one's most subterranean mental processes, the multiplicity of plots in this movie seem to do the same thing, and to the extent to which dreams are reliable narrators of the subconscious, Mulholland Drive (to disagree with Mr. Ebert) is more open to fruitful interpretation than Memento, which is told from the point of view of a character who is blatantly unreliable in his narrations. Like any dream, Mulholland Drive is rather subjective, open to various interpretations, but it is not a rational dead end, a puzzle without a solution.  SEE IT FOR YOURSELF, and enjoy a rare opportunity to create your own resolution to a movie that has the substance and the courage NOT to provide a simple one of its own. P.S. I'm glad to see Mulholland Drive nominated for a number of Golden Globes, especially in the Best Drama, Best Screenplay, and Best Director categories.  I'd be surprised to see Oscar nominations for it in those same categories, and shocked to see any major Oscar wins for the film.  The Academy is not known for guts (allow me to mention Pulp Fiction vs. Forrest Gump, Raging Bull vs. Ordinary People, and Apocalypse Now vs. Kramer vs. Kramer).  I will say this, though, if A.I. wins anything and Mulholland Drive wins nothing, my commitment to non-violence will be stretched to its limit.",Mulholland Drive

As for myself and thousand of other movie goers, I don't really like seeing a movie where I am in total dismay and confusion from start to finish. Mulholland Drive makes no sense, presenting itself with scene after scene of new characters and settings which have no introduction whatsoever.Mulholland Drive starts out with a young woman being held at gun point inside a limo, the limo crashes on a hill near L.A. The woman gets out and it is shown she has a headache, when she can't remember anything the audience finally understand she has amnesia. This scene is soon followed by a diner scene with Robert Forester which makes absolutely no sense where he is talking to his partner about every day things and suddenly says ""I can see through it, there's a man behind the dumpster."" So Forester and his partner go out, he has a flash of a monster once they get behind the dumpster, then they walk away. The next scene takes us to one of those executive rooms with the long tables, multiple seats, and dozens of ashtrays. A man in a chair who doesn't talk is being talked to by a movie producer of some sort, the scene ends and nothing is explained.The movie goes on and on like this. I wouldn't recommend this for the average viewer or for movie buffs. Only hardcore, and believe me when I say hardcore, David Lynch fans might enjoy this.

Knowing Lynch, you expect aren't what they seem, and things will turn into a nightmare soon. We viewers are prepared, as we saw a violent incident turn into a car crash already, and mafia Dons order a killing. A thrilling, but confusing plot develops. Names get switched, timelines tuned over.
Just as in real life, what part is what you want it to be, what part is bone-chilling reality? This is movie making for grownups. Mysterious, haunting, multi-explanatory. Lynch does not believe in words or explanation. As with good literature, it's about what happens in the mind of the audience.
If you read his works on transcendental meditation, there is a message behind all this. A key scene happens at club 'Il Silencio': what is not said is mor important than what is. There is even a Cowboy, who in a scene at a corral, teaches the director, and with him the audience, to really think before you speak.
How anybody can accuse Lynch over overstating the bright side of Hollywood is beyond me. L.A. is shown - literally - as a dark place. Production is controlled by mob-like gangsters. The director is a pawn in a power game. (Is he David Lynch himself? Remember his experiences in making Dune.) Betrayal, jealousy, foul play, adultery, it's all there. As with Twin Peaks, weird though it all is, you want to keep watching.
Great characters, beautiful sets and scenes. Incredible acting, by Naomi Watts particularly. Seemingly effortless she covers the whole spectrum of human emotion and condition, from bright-eyed happiness to total horror, from smooth seductress to hopeless despair.

Basically this is what a Mind bender with a twist is supposed to look like. A masterpiece. Ps. These two women together is pure perfection! Final Grade, A-",Mulholland Drive
358,FlyingTampon,"Not for everyone, I admit",10,13 July 2003,"I found David Lynch's ""Straight Story"" rather vacuous, and ""Twin Peaks"" was somewhat intriguing, yes. Never a huge David Lynch fan, I was not eager to watch ""Mulholland Drive"" until my friend told me about the infamous *cough* scene about 1.5 hours into the movie.The first twenty minutes were easy to follow...the car crash, her amnesia and Betty Elms's (Naomi Watts) annoying naivete coming to Los Angeles from Deep River, Ontario. She arrives at her aunt's home in Hollywood to discover ""Rita/Camilla Rhodes"" (Laura Elena Harring) in the shower. Rita has suffered trauma to the head and is unable to recall her identity. They begin a search, ultimately the names Camilla Rhodes and Diane Selwyn get thrown around until you forget who is who. Many of the scenes did not make sense. ""Mulholland Drive"" is an amnesiacal portrayal of surreal Hollywood...does anyone know what year this movie was set in? Some scenes it looked to be modern, others it was 1950s wardrobe and setting. ""Mulholland Drive"" definitely does not follow the typical opening, plot, climax and resolution nor does it follow a conventional narrative.
My advice is to watch it, and be confused.",Mulholland Drive

Well, he received somehow some Dollars and ""completed"" the pilot and created this mess by just mixing everything together... How can anybody see a failed pilot for TV as an cinematic masterpiece?!And now everybody is guessing about the deeper meaning!? Well, wake up, there is none! Like in that other TV series by Lynch, what was the name again? Same procedure there. Build up a mystery and then come up with nothing. I guess Lynch will repeat this concept until people will realise, the emperor has no clothes. In Germany there is a comedian called Harpe Kerkerling. He dressed up as an opera singer and ""performed"" some new ""art songs"". Singing complete nonsense like this: ""The wolf. The lamb. On the meadow. Hurrz!"" It´s a classic now. Anyway, afterwards he discussed it with the audience. And they were talking seriously about the deeper meaning of the wolf / lamb relationship.You people giving this movie a rating of 8.0 in imdb.com, you people could be one of them.

The 2 lead actresses are beautiful but the movie was definitely unattractive.,Mulholland Drive
362,YellowManReanimated,A Tragic Tale of Passion and Obsession,10,17 August 2021,"A beautiful woman is being driven along dark streets in a limousine. It is not taking the route she was expecting. She protests. The driver stops the car and turns to her, a gun is in his hand, it is pointing at the woman. He tells her to get out. The camera cuts to a group of teenagers drunkenly swerving along the road, it turns out they are heading towards the limousine. Before the woman has chance to get out of the car, there is a devastating crash from which, some time later, only she will emerge. She stumbles through the black streets and collapses into a thicket of bushes for the night.The next morning she wanders undetected into the house of a woman who is beginning an extended vacation, it is in this house that she meets Betty, a young, aspiring actress who is full of energy and optimism. Betty moves into the house shortly after the previous occupier, Betty's aunt, has left. Upon discovering the woman, Betty realises that the woman is in trouble. The woman can not remember her own name but she knows that she is being pursued and she is deeply fearful as a result. Betty takes it upon herself to help the woman, enthusiastically trying to uncover the mystery of the situation while also pursuing her acting career. The needs of this mysterious woman become more encompassing than her own, however, and she ultimately sacrifices an opportunity to achieve potential superstardom in order to continue helping her. Her decision to do so leads to one of the film's fundamental discoveries, we learn that Betty's sacrifice stems from love, a love that has been in existence for much longer than we might suspect, a love that we learn is, ultimately, an all too powerful force.Lynch is a notoriously beguiling film-maker. He is a director whose work is drenched in sub-text. He constantly uses leitmotifs and visual symbolism to tell the story which exists beyond the story. This work is the best cinematic rendering I've seen of the unreliable narrator construct. It's a construct Lynch had been perfecting ever since Twin Peaks and, prior to this film, is seen most obviously in Lost Highway. In this way, Mulholland Dr can be seen as the crowning achievement of Lynch's deeply complex and innovative vision. Stories are told from multiple perspectives, the question as to which perspective accords most closely with reality is one the viewer is tasked with deciding. He masterfully interweaves narrative flashback in rapidly shifting sequence in a way which only multiple viewings can truly appreciate.The rich atmosphere of his film guides us, though, Angelo Badalamenti's brilliant score fills the film with a seedy, neo-noir ambience; Lynch's use of ambiguous, dream like lighting in key scenes heightens the effect. The magnificence of the film hinges not only on structure but, also, plot, evinced in the tragic character arc of Betty Elms/Diane Selwyn, two juxtaposed characters, both played by Naomi Watts, the sum of whose experience evokes the true depth that lies at the heart of this tragic tale.",Mulholland Drive
363,vhilden,"Just say ""NO""",2,8 May 2002,"Kids, stay off cheap crack, or you may end doing something like ""Mulholland Dr"". The closest analogy to this film is a party drunk, who takes an eternity to say something he thinks is so smart and funny but no one can understand.
There are a few good scenes, a funny one where a hit man tries to make a murder seem like suicide and ends shooting everyone, including the vacuum cleaner. There's a couple of lesbian love scenes, with clear and explicit nudity, for those who think Hollywood movies have become too prudish lately. However, two and a half hours is too long to wait for so little. That used to be called ""glacially slow"", but, in this greenhouse effect age, one feels the glaciers will melt before this film ends.
Unfortunately, there are critics who enjoy praising films that make no sense, perhaps because they feel superior when they claim to understand it, or, worse, critics who think that making no sense is a positive contribution to entertainment. If I had known it was that kind of people who were saying such good things about ""Mulholland Dr"", I wouldn't have thrown away my hard earned money on this crap.
I'm not saying it's bad to be original, all I'm saying is that there are infinite ways of being original, most of them bad. It's very easy to do things at random. The hard part is linking the threads at the end, so it all makes sense. Doing a really good non sense film is extremely hard, I think Fellini did it a few times, or Buñuel, perhaps. Here, David Lynch certainly fell far short of the mark.",Mulholland Drive

365,drarthurwells,Mulholland Drive - Lynch's cinematic art - reality vs. fantasy,8,5 April 2013,"Lynch loves to realistically portray logical sequences interspersed by fantasy diversions, which entrances but confuses the viewer. Blue Velvet is his best film, and works well because of its overall logical coherency spiced up by fantastic deviations from the norm (the fantasy element of the film). This technique reminds me of Fellini's 8 1/2, where fantasy was often interspersed with a logical and coherent plot.Mulholland Drive starts off logically but then gradually abandons logical coherence as dream-like (but realistically presented) sequences are brought into the plot. Then there is a shift in the plot, from the fantasy of the first part, to the reality of the second part where roles and identities are reversed and reality reigns.Lynch's genius is in his artistic slight of hand where he presents a fantasy scene realistically, sucking the viewer in to expecting a meaningful depiction, then upending these expectations in shocking the viewer with the fantastic elements of the scene. I can imagine Lynch laughing in the background as he plays his joke on the viewer.The film Holy Motors presents pure fantasy in nonsensical and unrelated sequences, and is bad art. Mulholland Drive has enough organization and structure, with more skillfully accomplished fantasy, to qualify it as good art.Naomi Watts gives us an outstanding performance - better than the typical ""Best Actress"" Oscar award winner's performance in the last 20 years. Watts usually gets roles that don't allow her to display her considerable acting skills, but this role does, and she more than meets the challenge.The plot is secondary for Lynch since cinematic art is his focus. However, the movie is totally baffling unless you have some guidelines. Basically Mulholland drive is the story of a young girl who comes to Hollywood with high hopes of becoming an actress. The film is told in two parts. My interpretation is that the first (Watts as Betty) part is psychotic delusions of the young girl as she reconstructs her past leading up to the promise of a brilliant acting career. This is presented as reality and the viewer has no idea it is false. The shift to the second (Watts as Diane) part shows some shifting of roles, and depicts the true story whereby the young girl fails to become an major actress. Her identity is valid, as Diane, in the second part showing her dismal failure, while Rita of the first delusional part becomes Camilla in the second reality part.Naomi Watts thus plays two roles with different identities, in part one and in part two. The two parts are cued by the change in her name from the delusional Betty (part I) to the real Diane (part II). In a clever signal of this personality change, the waitress at Winkie's is named Diane when Betty and Rita go to eat there in the first fantasy part, while this same waitress becomes Betty when Watts as Diane goes to Winkie's in the real second part.The plot shift from fantasy to reality mirrors the high hopes and aspirations as fantasy (Part I as Betty) and dismal failure as reality (Part II as Diane), that happens so often as young would-be performers seek fame in Hollywood but end up as failures.",Mulholland Drive

I have waited nine years to watch this movie for the second time, i thought i would give it another try just to see if i was missing something, i mean all those people who love this movie cant all be wrong, so i watched it and even knowing more info about this film to help me see the genius of it all..... its still laughable to call it anything other than crap.My favorite film is blade runner i love it and i am biased in my opinion of it, some people think it is junk, they say so and are entitled to think so, what they don't say is it makes no sense and has no narrative there are not whole discussion groups coming up with explanation and theories of what the film is about, finer points might be discussed but generally it makes enough sense for most people not to be irritated.Mulholland drive has multiple theories from every angle trying to put meaning to the movie, it can mean so many things and that is its brilliance, NO IT IS NOT, ITS GENIUS IS IT IS NONSENSICAL SO MAKE UP WHATEVER YOU LIKE AND FEEL SMUG BECAUSE YOU ""GET IT"" as so many have said it really is a case of the emporors new clothes.",Mulholland Drive

Whether there is a story in there or not may not even be relevant. It seems that the film is about reality and illusion and as such the confusion inherent in this is just another aspect of that.The narrative is split up into a fairly straight forward three act screenplay. Betty goes to Hollywood and meets Rita, albeit in bizarre circumstances. They then try to find out who Rita is. Then the plot is turned on it's head and illusion becomes reality or vice versa. But in fact it doesn't matter which one it is. The point is that the movie plays on the tension between reality and illusion, and what better place to ground this kind of story but the capital of the greatest illusion of all - the movie business.Lynch just plays around with a straight forward story allowing us to make up our own minds as to what's happening, because in the scheme of things it doesn't matter, the story can mean whatever you want it to mean. That's the beauty of what is at the centre of this film; What is reality and what's illusion? And he still manages to tell a great storyIt ain't deep, it ain't meaningful.

But, again, perhaps I am just too unsophisticated to ""get it"". In any case, the movie centers around an actress who tries to help a woman who has amnesia. The two end up becoming lesbian lovers, and work together to find out the identity of the woman with amnesia.

I found them boring, painful and in some cases just plain distasteful.If you like movies like ""Danny Darko"" then this film is for you. If you like movies that actually make sense, and do not require you to look through the eyes of some ""brilliant"" producer who is ""way ahead of his time"" then spare yourself.

I thought the story was quite straightforward once you figured out what was real and what was a dream, and might have just been called, ""The Face on the Cutting Room Floor"" (thank you, Steve Goodman.) Won't say any more than that, as I don't want to give away its supposed secrets. I will say I find movies in which I can't figure out what's going on until half way through to be annoyingly frustrating, not artistic. ""Two for the Road,"" (Hepburn/Finney) was a complicated story told through multiple backward/forward time jumps, and made perfect sense.

Maybe a handful, if you're lucky? It bothered me to the point where I had difficulty getting to sleep because it really made me question what had happened. It's actually very rare that a film does that to me, but this really had me thinking for at least two or three days. I'm not going to do what other reviewers have done and give some kind of narrative on my perception of the movie. All I can say is 'Watch this movie for yourself'.

371,alafolle,"No need for plot and character, if you've got enough style.",9,16 April 2002,"---Contains Spoilers---Much time and energy on this site has gone into efforts to reconstruct the plot and timeline of this film from its shattered fragments.  Some have even proposed solutions to the puzzle that ALMOST fit.  But not quite.  As just one example, in the first portion of the film, Diane is dead and Adam is still married.  In the second portion, Adam's divorce is finalized, but Diane is still alive.  It is simply impossible to piece the shards of narrative together, and that (of course) is precisely the point of ""Mulholland Drive"".  David Lynch doesn't merely rearrange the timeline of the story, as happens in such films as ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Memento"", he completely destroys the continuity of the characters.  This is a much more jarring disruption of the story, which apparently sends many viewers running headlong for the exits, but makes this flick pretty darn enjoyable for geeks such as myself.     By completely stripping away such artificial details as plot and character, Lynch puts the emphasis on the basic truth contained within the film. Watching the movie in real-time we see the following:  Naïve, bright-eyed ingenue comes to Hollywood hoping to be in the movies...  she is sexually used, betrayed, manipulated by unseen powers, cheated out of parts by a less-talented actress who sleeps with the director... she ends up jaded, bitter, and insane.  We learn that Hollywood is full of freaks, ghouls, murderers, loose women, directors who compromise their idealism under pressure, bizarre and powerful men who manipulate the movie industry, etc. Our heroine falls in love with an exotic amnesiac and tries to help her uncover her mysterious identity, but the woman turns out to be a conniving bitch.  Tragedy ensues.  Roll credits.In the hands of a typical director, this basic story would result in a cheap, formulaic commercial movie.  The story isn't particularly interesting... it's been told a thousand times before.  Why should we care? We all know that plot and character are contrived concepts designed to hook viewers into digesting familiar stories... and to care enough about the ending to sit still for 2 hours and ultimately recommend the movie to their friends.  So Lynch comes to the process in a different manner.  He manipulates plot and character to build suspense, and then dispenses with them when they are no longer necessary.  This allows him to tell the old story in a new, interesting way.  It provides a medium for a bunch of really cool camera shots of Hollywood at night, creepy music, steamy sex scenes, surprising twists, and oddball side characters.   Abstraction and surrealism have been used in literature and visual art for a very long time, and it's surprising how few filmmakers dabble in these techniques.  Some people enjoy it, some don't.  Considering how the entertainment industry strives relentlessly to reach the maximum possible audience with every single production, I find it quite refreshing to see that there are still movie directors who would rather make half their audience angry than worry about maximizing their profits.I personally consider this to be an outstanding film.  Naomi Watts gives an outstanding performance in a complex double role.  The score is bone-chillingly perfect.  The scenery and mood are captivating.  The weird parts are blissfully bizarre.  In other words... it's David Lynch at his Lynchian best.",Mulholland Drive

Mulholland Dr. is unlike most films as its ending can be taken in many ways.1) The first and best idea is that the first part of the movie is a dream/fantasy. Right after the dancing bit at the beginning we see someone going to sleep on a bed. This is telling us its a dream right from the start! And the rest of the events near the end of the movie is reality. Salon.com has an awesome theory on this, read it and the movie's plot will seem very simple. Really!2) The whole movie is reality, but it takes place in two different realities. This is the first theory I thought of after viewing the movie the first time. The blue box is almost like a transporter between dimensions.3) All of the movie is a dream. This is my least favourite theory, but if you think about it it does make sense. When we dream a lot of the time the dream will move onto different scenes and characters and rarely make sense in a normal way.*** END OF SPOLIERS ***Mulholland Dr. is like many different movies. You can watch it with a certain theory, and next time watch it with a different theory. Choose your favourites and even try to come up with crazy ideas. Or you can just watch the film without trying to work out what it's trying to say and marvel at it's beauty.The acting is excellent. Particularly Naomi Watts, who does an amazing job. Her acting in this movie blew me away, she is an awesome actress and should have won an Oscar for her performance.Angelo Badalamenti's score is just wonderful to listen to and creates an amazing atmosphere.'Mulholland Dr.' is like a painting. For example, take a painting of a Mother and her baby. One person may view the painting as very beautiful and a display of the bond a Mother and child feels. A different person may take it differently. Say, a Mother who lost her child. The painting may bring back sad memories and this person may feel the painting is sad and upsetting instead of beautiful. One painting. Two different ideas and feelings. Mulholland Dr.: One movie, many ideas. It's almost like David Lynch created a moving painting. Maybe being a painter from way back he feels as if paintings and movies can be the same kind of art. I truly love this movie and get great feelings when thinking about it's amazing logic and mystery. And it contains a very funny hitman bungle scene to boot.Remember, with most mystery movies the mystery is in the movie. Mulholland Dr. maybe one of the only films where the mystery is not only in the film but also the film as a whole.A masterpiece that you don't have to 'get' to love.10/10",Mulholland Drive

It is like a puzzle that you can distinguish that all the pieces somehow fits together, but once put together, it still remains a mystery. There is more symbolism as opposed to a concrete meaning. This is a cerebral film that requires the viewer to be analytical, yet at the same time be open to many interpretations.That is the beauty of this film. This is art and while the film is really good, I'm still left pondering. I could imagine every viewer will arrive at a different interpretation and I feel David Lynch's intention while making this film was to encourage people to come up with their own explanations. This film is bound to leave one very puzzled upon their first viewing, but upon further analysis, there is a symbolic relationship that ties everything together. If you are still lost, I think the key thing to pay attention to is the cowboy. For some reason, that really helped me a lot in finding some sort of logical explanation for the events that occur in the film.While I really do not know if there is a moral presented (or a point), to me, this film represents the demons that people have in the back of their minds. It's the elephant in the room that people don't want to confront or how one becomes in denial of its existence and how there is a good way to do that, as well as a bad way, but either way it has to be confronted. That to me seems to be what this film spoke about. Coupled with a foreboding atmosphere and odd imagery, this is a disturbing piece of high quality cinema that is shrouded with an aura of mystery bound to leave an imprint on one's psyche.

377,Don Muvo,Really confusing but not bad,9,6 June 2002,"I just saw SSZ1-1's analysis in the user comments. Since he knows just about everything about this movie (at least partly from reading David Lynch's hint document) I feel I have learned something at last about this very confusing film. The one thing I think he might have missed was that Camilla Rhodes's role in the second half of the film was to push Diane over the edge. When things were going pretty bad for Diane at the party, she gives her the ""girl glance"" aimed directly at finishing her bruising ego. Notice how she appears out of nowhere and exits quickly. The part she plays in the dream (first part) is ""the one"", the interloper who will replace whichever girl deserves the movie role.I had originally seen the second half of the film (the reality) as an inversion of the first half (the dream), which it was, I just missed all the clues (that should have been so obvious) about why the dream was a dream. Now why did I miss all those clues? Am I really that dense? I think not. The problem is that I was guilty of not being a David Lynch fan already. I was watching the film under a pretence that David Lynch is a director who is crazy about making films that look like dream sequences, and I had better watch it and like it, even if half of everything did look like a dream. I was so proud of myself for coping so well, that I did not even notice the ""reality"" the woken-up sequence. So does D.L. do a good job of clarifying his intentions? I think not. Is it a bad movie? No, just a bit confusing, so confusing that it requires serious discussion, to try to put the pieces together with others that have seen it. Is it worth watching more that once? Probably. I gave it 7 stars on the plus side, for being a good movie, but 3 less than a perfect score for being confusing as hell. The cowboy reminded me of an existentialist guru who was lecturing the director on his attitude; thus he is my favorite character.Am I a David Lynch fan now? Probably.

The point of a non-linear narrative is that there is no actual story, just a general idea. From a filmmaking perspective, there are a lot of goodies here, absurdities that are genuinely funny, and I think this film reads best as a dark comedy.It is definitely not hard to see where we make the switch from proposed TV pilot to forty minutes of wierdness. The last part of the film sees the characters switch roles, and also sees the story (well, ok, the quasi-story) overlap itself a couple of times.The acting is fine, and Lynch has a key eye for making his film artistic and clean looking. But there's a lot of stuff in here that's just off-beat to the max, pure David Lynch stuff, that shouldn't make sense unless you're on acid, basically, because in isn't supposed to make sense in any natural way.A good movie to see if you don't mind the fact that there isn't a point to the plot.",Mulholland Drive

The films strongpoints is allowing the viewer to use there own imagination to fill in the plot holes, aiding this was some brilliant acting from the two lead women in the film Naomi Watts (Betty/Diane) and Laura Hanning (Rita/Camilla).  Both these actresses played there parts to utter perfection and completely dominated the screen with there presence.The Eerie score adds to the overall effect and wierdness to the film allowing each scene to move on flowingly and eventually leading to a mind boggling finale.How on earth David Lynch came out of the Oscars without the best director award is beyond me.

380,E-Z-Rider,A seriously bad movie,3,10 March 2002,"The movie has no plot to speak of.  It's a collage of scenes strung together with the idea that the more confusing it is, the more people will think it's deep.  It's not--it's mostly just silly, shop-worn and entirely lacking in originality; it was old by the time Lynch tried this stuff in the abominable Eraserhead in 1977.  Other than a fine performance by Naomi Watts--totally wasted here--this movie is not worth the 2 hours and 25 minutes out of your life it will take to watch it.  David Lynch hasn't directed movie worth watching since Elephant Man in 1980. Maybe it's about time he hangs it up.",Mulholland Drive
381,klesker,Lynch at his very best!,9,1 October 2002,"We all love to have our minds toyed with but sitting through a David Lynch film is like having your brain removed entirely. This film is no different as it proves that Lynch (Next to Bunuel) is a master surealist film maker.The film sees a young girl known only as Rita trying to remember who she is. The whole ""girl with amnesia"" plot make a lot of sense until about 3/5 of the way through the film when something that can only be described as a Lynchian Pandora's Box is opened. We are then tormented with a demonic homeless man, a mysterious Spanish play house and shrunken people before it all finishes in very dramatic, surreal David Lynch fashion.This film is perfect. There is no other way to describe such a great piece of work. It is flawless because it is helmed by a man that knows everything about his craft and is not afraid to show it off. This sort of film has been sorely missed since his last outing, Lost Highway, in 1996. It's good to see Lynch at his old game and lets just hope in future that he produces more gems just like this.5/5",Mulholland Drive
382,KnightLander,"Possibly Lynch's best; brilliant, enigmatic, and masterfully filmed",9,21 June 2005,"Originally filmed in 1999 as a TV pilot, ""Mulholland Dr."" was rejected. The next year, David Lynch received money to film new scenes to make the movie suitable to be shown in theaters. He did so - and created one of the greatest, most bizarre and nightmarish films ever made.The film really doesn't have main characters, but if there were main characters, they would be Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is a perky blonde who's staying in her aunt's apartment while she auditions for parts in movies. She finds Rita in her aunt's apartment and decides to help her. You see, Rita's lost her memory. She has no clue who she is. She takes her name, Rita, from a ""Gilda"" poster in the bathroom. So the two set out to discover who Rita really is.David Lynch has been known for making some weird movies, but this film is the definition of weird. It's bizarre, nightmarish, and absolute indescribable. It's like a dream captured on film. By the 100-minute point, the film has become extremely confusing - but if you've been watching closely, it will make perfect sense. Having watched the movie and then read an article on the Internet pointing out things in the film, I now understand the movie completely.The acting is very good. Watts is terrific. Justin Theroux is very good as a Hollywood director facing problems with the local mob. The music is excellent. Angelo Badalamenti delivers one of his finest scores. And the directing - hah! David Lynch is as masterful a filmmaker as ever there was.Is this your type of film? Well, that depends. You should probably view more of Lynch's work before watching this movie. You'll need to be patient with the film, and probably watch it a second time to pick up the many clues Lynch has left throughout the movie. For Lynch fans, this is a dream come true.""Mulholland Dr."" is a masterpiece. It's brilliant, enigmatic, and masterfully filmed. I love it.",Mulholland Drive
383,samadabbasi,Exceptional,10,9 May 2019,"To be honest I did not get this movie like everyone else for the first time and kept guessing until the end. This movie was in my watchlist for 6 years and I was too lazy to watch it. But now after watching it, I would definitely recommend it to anyone. This movie is not a typical Hollywood movie but a very thought provoking one. It's just a another masterpiece from Finch which is even better than his other films Lost Highway and Blue Velvet. I'm not going to write more about the movie and I'm gonna leave it to you to see it for yourself and then love it.",Mulholland Drive
384,Boris-57,"WOW! In between the MelGibsonites & ArtHouseRabbits, there's still room for some feeling",10,25 March 2002,"I waited too long to go and see it; as it stands now, I've seen it 3 times in the past week. More viewings will undoubtedly follow... I severely dug the testosterone-driven Lost Highway, but this, nothing more or less than its oestrogenic counterpart, really whacked my brain in a perpetual home run. Not seeing this one is NOT an option.In reading the comments, the usual clanheads are roaming about. The MelGibsonites, complaining that they understood zilch and that it's way too arty farty, and that the story gets completely nowhere, while on the other hand the ArtHouseRabbits go on raving about how this really is a movie you can think & talk about for a week. Both cause severe convulsions. Coming out of the movietheatre, I didn't really understand Mulholland Dr., but I was immediately convinced that this was it, Magnum Opus Time. My all-time whatever, my what-would-you-take-to-a-deserted-island item #1. Why?As I've stated myriads of times (also in some other comments on this site), a film is about IMAGES, meaning story-showing; NOT about story-telling. Books are much better at storytelling, so leave it to them. Most movies don't get anywhere beyond storytelling, while in fact they should be trying to take you emotionally to the same point as a good story would, only they should do it using only images. Every frame should be a painting, gradually taking you to an abyss or exaltation (or both, depends on how masochistic you are). This one does it continuously, epically and in an ultimately stunning way. You don't have to dig it all in order to enjoy this feast to the eye (and ear, for the prozacoids). So you don't have to expect a storyline (although Mulholland Drive has a very pronounced AND clear one), and you don't have to want to talk about it for a week (christ!).Some focus on the bizarre. Well, I find most Lynch movies to be about L-O-V-E. Call me a hippie, but that's where it's at. Love and Paradise Lost. In other words, how love is there, but we tend to lose it (or almost) because of what we do/are. Check it out in Blue Velvet (most clearly about two kinds of love, the obsessive and the soothing), Lost Highway (what are the essential elements in male jealousy/rejection, and how does he solve it?) and of course Mulholland Drive (same thing, but the female side). That's why Roy Orbison often comes in: his songs are about the same thing.The storyline of Mulholland Drive is roughly a mix of the lyrics of Orbison's ""In Dreams"" and ""Crying"". ""In Dreams"" is the script of the whole movie: it begins with a dream and then ""I awake to find you gone"", followed by ""I remember/When you said goodbye"", and then ""Too bad that all these things/Can only happen in my dreams/Only in dreams/In beautiful dreams"" and then she shoots herself, the only way in which she can perpetuate the dream of her (Diane) being together with her love (Camilla). In the beginning, the white light-image (which comes over the dancers) is Betty/Diane with the two old folks (let's call them Guilt/Remorse/Regret), while in the end, when both are dead, they are finally together again, the way they were in the dream (blonde Camilla), and the white light shows Betty and Camilla.Now, ""Crying"" (Llorando) is THE central key to the storyline (so I don't understand anyone saying that the scene might be redundant). In the beginning (that is, in real life, the part which actually comes before the dream), Betty/Diane is severely p***ed at Camilla, to a degree that she has her love murdered. In the beginning, the dream is fine and stuffed with wishful thinking/dreaming, leading to the climax (in Betty/Diane's fantasy, and probably in mine) of the love scene. But then it comes: the theatre scene. Betty/Diane's feelings of anger make room for GRIEF (for the first time in her dream, she is in distress)! It's so obvious: at the start, the theatre is red, then it becomes BLUE (with aquatic shimmer, for the hardheaded). And it is this grief (which is represented by the Blue Box) that will finally and inevitably lead out of the dream, when it is opened by the blue key, representing her GUILT when she realizes she had her love murdered - in the flashback we see that shortly before the dream began she found the Blue Key on the table, meaning the killing job is done) straight to Regret/Remorse (remember the two little old folks first reappear when the beggar (Destiny?) drops the blue box). Then she realizes that Camilla is now gone forever, or, as Orbison put it: ""Yes, now you're gone/And from this moment on/I'll be crying/Crying over you"". There remains only one way for her to remain forever in dreams with her love: she kills herself.Note, that this is not necessarily an unhappy ending. Romeo & Juliet would only have an unhappy ending if one of them died; not so if, like it is, both of them die for love. So, a happy ending after all, and what a movie.",Mulholland Drive

The first time, I dozed off twice, but went back to see what I missed (in fairness to the flick)It was fairly interesting, but I was kinda bored. The ending annoyed me. But yet, this film ""stayed with me"" for a week. I went here to Imdb to read others' opinions, and found that maybe I was shortchanging this film (like I did at first with Memento) and didnt WANT to like it, cause it was CHALLENGING me to THINK. (I know, another cliche phrase) I rented it again and sat thru it with somewhat of an idea of what was going on. By the time the scene where the diva is singing ""Crying"" in Spanish, I was enraptured by this movie. By the ending, I was BLOWN AWAY. The third time I seen it, I was STILL noticing nuances in Namoi Watts' ""Becky""/Diane charactor. The fact that this girl didnt get nominated for an Academy Award is a TRAVESTY of the HIGHEST ORDER. I think I witnessed one of the single greatest peformances of an actress in the last decade! Generally, I am not into ANYTHING ""surreal""...but what David Lynch has accomplished here is downright ERRIE! He has captured the way we/I DREAM on film! The way we ""interpose"" people, places, names, etc....and yet when we awake and try to explain what seemed so LOGICAL in our dream, is now just an incoherant BABBLE to our waking brain. BUT...I can honestly state that what makes this film a MASTERPIECE to behold, is that he (Lynch) is able to make what we have just seen, 98% explainable....when was the last time we awoke from a dream and were able to explain 50% in a logical manner? This film is a bittersweet, tragic and sad tale of broken dreams, broken hearts...and broken minds. Symbolic without being pretentious....CHOKE ON THAT INGMAR BERGMAN! Is Mulholland Drive the BEST film I have ever seen? No....but its up there...it IS however, the MOST FASCINATING piece of filmmaking ever committed to celluoid...and I remain STUNNED.

387,kdavidbushnell,"I tried, TRIED hard to like Lynch",1,1 September 2010,"This is why David Lynch absolutely sucks (I'll never understand how he is popular): And anyone who has tried to tell me different is no bigger of a movie buff than I, so it's a game of pretentious outlook and it's been handed down from generation to generation of Dbag Lynch lovers. Every Lynch film feels sooo B movie because of it's lack of intriguing characters and close to terrible dialogue. The acting is always bad as well even if it is Naomi Watts because they aren't given anything to work with besides abstract junk garbage. The stories are always so uninteresting and unthoughtful and ridiculously abstract that they are almost not worth thinking about or even watching all the way through (they lead to nothing, not even good structured thought), trust me I've tried and tried.At the end of each of his movies, there is no longing to figure anything out because it's so frustratingly bland and mindlessly abstract. While I don't necessarily like directors like Tarentino or Woody Allen, I can at least see the appeal and understand how they have become popular.People don't understand it (because there is nothing to understand and don't let Lynch lovers tell you there is), but Love the hype of Lynch.....

I have only seen this movie once and it deserves another look. Maybe I picked it apart too much or not enough.This is the bottom line. A great movie that deals with fantasy or fiction has to take that piece of clay and mold the unreal real, the unbelievable believable, the fantasy desirable, the nightmare undesirable and this movie failed in this area. It took the unbelievable and left way too many holes in the story. It carried me away in the beginning but crashed me in the end.",Mulholland Drive
390,experten,Non mainstream surrealistic atmospheric drama,9,8 June 2002,"If you dislike movies that are not explaining everything to you, that leaves you with questions unanswered and different possible explanations of what was actually happening then you better avoid Mulholland Dr. The same thing goes if you are demanding a lot of action, but if you appreciate a superbly directed drama where you get to think for yourself without getting everything spelled out for you, then Mulholland Dr. might be something for you.Mulholland Dr. has so many highly entertaining scenes if you appreciate the combination of good dialogue and good acting, but if I am forced to mention a few it would be Adam Keshers meeting with The Cowboy (excellent dialogue) and his meeting with the Castigliane brothers (the expresso scene is so marvelously twisted). Normally I hate when movies shows musical performances to fill up the screen time but the audition scene in MD is very well performed and the singers are sexy and charismatic. Another favourite scene is when the big bully enters Adam Keshers house like a living bulldozer or when Cookie tells Adam that whoever he is hiding from they know where he is or... there are so many favourite scenes, I can't mention them all.. OK, but just a couple more; the hitjob scene is very funny if you have a sense for black humor and the ability to laugh when people are getting murdered and the very short scene with the hooker asking for a cigarette is simply marvelous, she is so genuine and still I can't help being amazed that there are people like her right here on Earth. (She appears to be like a child mentally but she has the oldest profession in the world and she ""takes a cigarette though"").
Lynch also uses music masterfully, creating a thick and mysterious atmosphere, just to sit back and enjoy. Now I came to think about a couple of more scenes that I just have to mention; the lesbian scene is very believable and very hot and the scene where a man and his friend follow up on a dream, it would not be in a normal Hollywood movie, it is not essential for the story, but it is good, it is highly entertaining, mysterious and Mulholland Dr. is not your normal Hollywood movie.I don't claim that I have understood everything in Mulholland Dr., I am just a human and I have only seen the movie once (although I have seen some of the above mentioned scenes at least five times), but MD is so entertaining that it is not necessary to understand everything. My unanswered questions only acts like a bonus, a motivation to watch the movie again.The sheer number of reviews on IMDb of Mulholland Dr. (663 at the moment) is an indicator of the fact that this is a movie with impact, you will no be indifferent after seeing it, I think you will either love or hate it. Recommended for mature audiences only. Kids and action fanatics will be bored. My rating is 9 / 10, with more violence it would have been a 10.",Mulholland Drive
391,odor007,"ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS, ONE OF LYNCH'S BEST",10,25 January 2002,"This was one of the best films that I've seen in a long, long time.  As a fan of David Lynch, I have seen almost all of his films, such as Elephant Man, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, Lost Highway, and Blue Velvet.  I have to say, this was my favorite film of his.  First of all, the cinematography was just great.  Lynch really put some effort into this one.  Secondly, the acting was incredible.  In some parts, mostly in the beginning of the film, you say to yourself, ""wow, this is some bad acting.""  But by the end of the film, if you aren't blown away, check your pulse.  I'm sure the audition scene will become a great scene in cinema history--see the movie and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.  The plot was actually normal for the first 75% of the film (very rare for Lynch), but for the final 45 minutes things get very twisted, reversed, and flipped.  By the end of the film, I simply wanted to start it from the beginning.  WHAT A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE! Comedy, drama, action, and thriller elements all went into this one.  When the ending credits were going up, no one in the theater had the same reaction.  Some people were laughing, some were crying, some probably hated it, and others, like myself, were speechless.  That's what I love about Lynch.  His films are completely, 100% interpretive.  You either love his work or hate his work.  There is no in between, and Mulholland Drive is no exception.  I highly encourage people to see this movie--there is no other way to talk about without spoiling it for people.  SEE IT PLEASE!  Great cinema.",Mulholland Drive

The third watching proved I was right, I think.Most movies don't require a person to invest so much energy in them and it's understandable that many people will not like this film.  But for puzzle lovers, David Lynch must be some kind of god.  It is a credit to him as a director that no one has ever dared attempt to make a Lynchian film. Unlike the endless Tarantino knock offs who merely possess geek-like knowledge of trashy cinema, no one can duplicate the clearly weird and wonderful imaginings of David Lynch's head.Naomi Watts is incredible in this.  It wasn't until the end when I realized that Betty was Diane's dream version of herself that I appreciated how wonderful this performance really was.The most important scene in the film is the one that takes place in the club Silencio.  It is a metaphor for the whole film and if you can work that out then the rest of the film will unfold more easily.Brilliantly fascinating and frustrating Mullholland Drive is a mystery wrapped in a riddle set in a place of sunshine and bright lights but it's message is as dark as they come.Now if someone could help me Lost Highway....",Mulholland Drive

Canal+ is bound by French law to give 3% of their profits to film making.  Come to them with a story in June and they will consider it carefully and politely show you the door.  Come back in December and they are desperate to unload the rest of their budget and will back any ill-conceived mish-mash of ideas, even a failed TV pilot already rejected in the States.I know, I know the critics have raved about this movie, but they also rave about paint splashed on canvas by chimpanzees.  Ignore them,  never have cinema seats seems so hard, never has two hours seemed so long.

395,magic_marker,"Dali, Picasso and David Lynch",10,22 August 2002,"It is right that these three names should be mentioned together? I think so. Indeed, I think it is not quite praise enough for Lynch, who could very well be the greatest Surrealist artist ever. Dali understood dreams, but Lynch MAKES them. ""Eraserhead"" was a nightmare projected into reality; ""Wild at Heart"" was the fitful dream of a bad hangover. ""Mulholland Dr."" is the most accomplished and precise of Lynch's creations, fusing his dark Surrealism with a kind of cinemtic Cubism. Like Picasso's bull, he shatters his film into jagged pieces and then reassembles them; forcing us to examine his narriative from all angles simultaneously.We see Naomi Watts first as young naive Betty, overplaying the chirpy blonde to the point of absurdity, (All characters in Lynch's films overplay their roles to the point of absurdity, just as characters in dreams do) who finds an amnesiac in her apartment, played by the almost unbearably sexy Laura Harring. The amnesiac, who takes the name Rita from a Rita Hayworth poster, had been about to be murdered when joyriders crashed into her car on Muholland Drive, and now Betty is caught in the web of those who want her dead. So far, so Hitchcock. We learn that ""Rita"" once had a roommate, called Diane Selwyn, and when they break into her house, they find a dead body (hers?) there. The two amateur detectives bond, and eventually fall in love, engaging in one of the sexiest love scenes to hit the screen in decades. It is after this that Lynch takes the hammer to his mirror. A mysterious blue box is found, to which Rita apparently has the key. The key is turned...Suddenly, Betty isn't Betty anymore; she's Diane Selwyn, and events are spiralling towards the tragic conclusion that may (or may not) open this film.What does it all mean? By the actors switching roles, is Lynch demonstrating the love that both Diane and Betty feel for ""Rita""? Or are these two characters actually one and the same, and one is dreaming the other? Who can tell?There is much, much more to this film; a film director who gets caught up in a cult-like organisation that runs his movie, a dwarf in a wheelchair, a premonition of doom in a diner.

I pretty much stopped trying to figure it out when they went back in time. I knew then that it would be a lost cause because Dianne would have recognized Camilla in the restaurant. Luckily for me because I could get into the movie by getting it out of my head and rather than feel betrayed, I just took it in.
Unlike a song with scattered lyrics that can tell a story to a listener that never existed in the writers mind, or the Red Dot in a corner of a black canvas that is called Art, this movie falls short of that conquest only because it tries too hard. Still worth seeing only because of the acting and cinematography. And just to say you saw it.",Mulholland Drive
398,MrAwesome1022,Incredible Acting,8,3 April 2014,"This was my first endeavor with a David Lynch film, and it did feel as if I were apart of the film rather than simply watching a plot being told to me. I will start with the acting by Laura Harring, Justin Theroux, and especially Naomi Watts was outstanding. Everything from the use of their eyes to display emotion and tension was remarkable.The scene where Justin's Director character was instructed to pick Camilla for the role, his use of his eyes told a story of tension and unease which allowed the viewer to feel his plight during the scene. Laura and Naomi had incredible screen chemistry and I am slightly baffled that they did not headline a movie together soon after.Naomi's scene with Chad Everett gave me goosebumps and he should be commended for his performance there as well. As someone who wishes to act, I can only hope to present such emotion and reality to any performance.The story itself was very intriguing, I am of the belief that that dual stories were in two separate parallel universes that were briefly accessed through both Laura and Naomi's dreams. Neither of which are that of fiction, but both indeed excited within the same universe but are alternate realities on the opposite end of the spectrum.I will be watching more of Lynch's work, his style is not my favorite method of storytelling, yet it is very entertaining and allows the viewer to think critically and use areas of the mind which may not typically be used during the viewing of a causal film.True Score: 8.1",Mulholland Drive

402,FargoUT,Brilliant mindbender is actually very heartbreaking love story,10,4 December 2002,"*SPOILERS*This is primarily for those who hate and loathe ""Mulholland Drive.""  When I first saw the film, I walked out of the theater angered that I had spent two hours of my life watching a non-sensical film.  I enjoyed the performances, but I felt the film just fell apart the longer you watched it.For two weeks, the film stayed with me, lodged in my brain.  Why were critics applauding this?  Why did Ebert call it one of the year's best films?  Two weeks later, I decided to revisit ""Mulholland Drive,"" this time accompanied by a fellow film lover.  As the movie played out, my mind had a reawakening of sorts.  Everything started to fall into place.  I must not have been paying attention the first time I watched the film, because everything you need to know is there on screen.  I walked out of the theater, my friend praising the film, and I right along with him.  I've since seen the film about four more times, and it becomes more interesting with each viewing.  If I were to create my list of best films of 2001 now? Be sure ""Mulholland Drive"" would be near the top.The reason?  The first ninety minutes (or primarily the pilot for the TV series) had to be altered in order to finish the film.  While I was disappointed that ABC ditched the show (in favor of what, exactly? According to Jim??), I'm glad to have seen Lynch's work.  From the opening credits to the moment Betty ""wakes up"", the film is a dream of Diane Selwyn (Betty).  Diane, in real life (and this is where time shifts in the film), came to Hollywood, fell in love with Camilla Rhodes (Rita) and was then dumped for a Hollywood director (Adam Kescher).  Emotionally hurt, Diane decides to have Camilla murdered.  ""Mulholland Drive"" is basically just a tale of failed romance.The dream recollects everything that occurred to Diane upon her arrival in Los Angeles.  However, in the dream, her name is Betty, she's a talented girl who immediately gets recognition by the Hollywood's elite, stumbles upon the amnesiac Rita (it's easy to love someone when they have no past), falls in love with her, and everything works out for the best.  But then her dream starts to break for her awakening (the ""Silencio"" club, the blue box, everything starts to come apart--much like a dream would as it ends).  The cowboy announces, ""It's time to wake up.""  And then Diane wakes up, hurt and alone, angry at Camilla for betraying her love.That's basically the film.  After Diane wakes up, the film jumps back and forth through memory, time, and dream.  Diane is quickly going insane, as she realizes with horror that she had Camilla murdered (blue key).  Finally, she kills herself in her room (in her dream, they discover Diane's decaying corpse--a bit of foreshadowing for Betty/Diane).  Now watch the film again and see if it doesn't all work.  It's quirky, weird, and atypical... but it's one of the most imaginative films in a long time.  This is easily David Lynch's best film to date, and everyone should rejoice in its audacity.",Mulholland Drive
403,wglenn,Lost Velvet Peaks Boulevard,5,25 January 2004,"While watching Mulholland Dr., I had my own Lynch-ian moment of inner horror: a sinister and disturbing sensation that I had never really left the theatre back in 1986 after seeing `Blue Velvet,' but that the kindly woman at the concession stand who looked like an older, grossly made-up Florence Henderson had drugged my popcorn, so that I passed out during the credits and was taken down into a dark basement room below the cinema, which was run by a mysterious dwarf in a glass-encased room with wall-to-wall red velvet carpeting.  There was a slow-speaking (so I knew he was serious), folksy character who mysteriously called himself The Director, and he asked me if I could distinguish between reality and cinema, and then he proceeded to show me the same film over and over again for 18 years.  The phone rang.  The voice on the other end of the line, a Mafioso who spoke through an electronic device in his throat, asked me how I liked my pancakes. `Everyone likes pancakes.  How do you like your pancakes?'  A clown was singing Roy Orbison's  `Only the Lonely' very, very slowly (so I knew he was very, very sad) in French.  The now whorish-looking Florence Henderson came into the room and spoke to me in French as well, offering me a silver platter with strange-looking meat on it.  A pale young blonde girl, about six years old, who was obviously dead, and who wore a first communion dress and whose head was covered in Saran Wrap, whispered to me: `Don't eat it. It's Billy Wilder's heart.'  An old, grey-haired man suddenly coughed out, `I have to fix my lawnmower.  They won't let me fix my lawn-mower.'  He then handed me a magic 8-ball and said, ""You have to help her.'  I shook the black plastic globe of secrets and the message read: `Strawberry pancakes.' I shook it again and it read: `Cinema is the new reality.'  Then I suddenly woke up  or had I been awake all that time and now was falling asleep?  and Mulholland Dr. was coming to an end.Or as the Cowboy Angel said, `Oh no, no, I've seen this movie before.'I used to be a David Lynch fan, but somewhere along the way, what used to seem cool and mysterious began to seem silly and pretentious.  Take the scene at the Silencio club... please.  (Or at least shorten it.) Lynch is obviously a master in many areas of filmmaking.  He's especially adept at creating moments of psychological terror  the opening sequence of Lost Highway being one of the most frightening things I've ever seen (forget the rest of the picture.)  But I've had the feeling over the last few movies that he's too easy on himself and too pleased with his talent.  I suppose one could say that Mulholland Dr. was the culmination of his vision over the last 20 years, putting everything together in one film, but it seems to me more of a rehashing of the same old thing, a kind of greatest hits of Lynch's mysterious, pseudo-intellectual film moments, great for those obsessive fans who try to solve his cinematic crossword puzzles, as if maybe THIS time there really would be something down there in the murky unknown.In and of itself, Mulholland Dr. is a decent film.  The acting by Watts is top-notch, and Laura Harring is pleasing to watch.  The camera work is good throughout, especially lurking around those corners.  If you can get through the silliness of some of the scenes, this is an interesting look at Hollywood, playing off of Sunset Blvd. but updating it for the new century. If you're new to Lynch's work, stick with `Blue Velvet,' when he was able to exert a little more control over his tiring self-indulgence.Better still, taking a slow drive down Sunset Blvd. with William Holden, Gloria Swanson, and Billy Wilder.  A similar theme but much better filmmaking.",Mulholland Drive

Young Naomi Watts was so successful in two different characters she surely deserved an Oscar with this movie. David Lynch skillfully crafts his art piece of spider web with many references to the real life Hollywood. Like all great story tellers this movie deserves multiple viewings through your life.

407,gtylerpayne,Amazing One-of-a-kind movie will keep you guessing and thinking,10,10 February 2016,"Mulholland Drive has been one of my favorite movies for a long time. Some people complain that it doesn't make sense or that the movie thinks it is more clever than it really is. I personally do not agree, and I think it is a brilliant milestone in cinema.This is a spoiler, but the way I have always viewed the film is as follows.The first 2/3 of the movie is Naomi Watts Dream. You are getting to see a stream of her unconscious.After the box drops and the cowboy says to wake up, we NOW get to see what the REAL world is like for Naomi Watts. Yes, it still goes into some ""daydreams"" but for the most part, this is now reality. We see lots of character and elements from Naomi's real life that had shown up in her dream, but her dream shows a lot about her psyche and the way she thinks abstractly about different events and people in her life.Some people say the movie doesn't make sense, but if you think about it this way, not only does it make a lot of sense, but you can see how everything Naomi dreamt about gave further insight to how she really felt about the people and situations in her life, and you begin to see a very complex character. By experiencing her dreams and her reality, you know a lot about this woman's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. It is a very creative way of telling a story that is, in some ways simple, and in other ways, very complex. I am a film-maker who lives in Los Angeles, so I love all the commentary about the film industry, and I love the fact that this movie explores the subconscious of a disgruntled actress in Hollywood and her perceptions of the film- industry. I think that they parallel a lot of actors experience and provide a lot of good commentary about the industry in a way that can be both serious and very humorous.Lynch is also known for his great sound design and ambiance and it shows here. He is great at creating a mood, creating tension, and making you feel a certain way. Some scenes feel very uneasy while others feel very familiar and he achieves a lot of this through subtle sound design.Between the creative script, the brilliant directing, and the wonderful performances, this movie is a truly an experience that should not be missed.",Mulholland Drive
408,scottand,Not as complicated as people are making it out to be.,10,4 March 2021,"I didn't understand this movie the first time I saw it although I liked the overall mood of it. But then I read an explanation of the movie somewhere (maybe here at IMDb) and it makes perfect sense. SPOILER AHEAD!!!!
After the opening credits with the swing dancers and up to the point where the guy in the cowboy hat says, ""Hey pretty girl, time to wake up"", you have been watching a DREAM that the main character is having. After she wakes up and the reality of her life is exposed we are shown--in a bit of a non-linear fashion--some of the recent events in her life (and the people involved) that served as material for the dream we have just watched. That's it.I thought that this was another ""Lost Highway"", a movie that I have never been able to make sense of, but ""Mulholland Drive"" turns out to be a lot more straightforward and accessible than it initially seems to be. Once I understood what I was watching I really enjoyed the movie and also appreciated the fact that it tells a very sad story. Don't give up on this movie.",Mulholland Drive

We see some genuinely funny moments and clues that one hopes will lead to a satisfying conclusion. By the end, we're treated (tortured, really) by the stereptypical ""it's all a dream"" ending. When I saw this film at a screening in Santa Monica, people were literally screaming epithets at the screen. If you pride yourself on being an intelligent person, you will, too.What's truly mindboggling about this film is how it's a part of the IMDB's coveted ""top 250 films of all time"" list.

410,SteelBlue82,"Pretty at times, but very nonsense heavy",3,18 June 2019,I can't help but think that several of the random elements in the film were created just to cause overanalysis and throw the viewer off the scent.

411,skanklover_69,Return to Mulholland Drive,8,17 May 2020,"I watched this for the first time in cinemas nearly 20 years ago and didn't like it. I was confused and disappointed by it compared to Lynch's other works such as Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks.
On a whim I revisited Mulholland Drive and really enjoyed it. The beautiful, mysterious dream and fantasy cutting to the tragic, gritty reality of the final act was clear. It deals with themes we can all relate to. Our actual lives and loves falling brutally short of our dreams. The surreal elements were somehow now easy to follow.
Every scene featuring Watts and Harring is captivating, filled with gravitas. The atmosphere is intoxicating, ominous. We love and hope for Betty and Rita but it is an illusion. The dark realities of Hollywood claim more victims.
Where the film is still let down is the unnecessary scenes and sub plots. The scenes with the producers, director and criminals without the 2 leads are flat with wooden dialogue and acting, often unnecessary to the story or at the very least overlong. Tonally and production quality wise they let the film down. The film is quite long and much of these could have been cut out and it would actually improve the flow and pacing.
Overall though, a return to Mulholland Drive is a trip I would recommend.",Mulholland Drive
412,roland-sinn,Intensely Haunting and Creepy. Brilliant Stuff!,10,11 August 2003,"David Lynch makes beautiful films and with each successive film his craftsmanship becomes more and more refined.I found MD similar in vein to Lost Highway, but even richer in beauty. Like Lost Highway, MD is a story told in three acts. There are also similar mysterious characters who populate the worlds of both Lost Highway and MD.The first time I viewed MD around 12 months ago, I was very confused when the end credits rolled. After viewing it for the second time last night, the film made a lot more sense. David Lynch has his own distinct view of the world and how it works, and how events can be inter-linked and inter-related in order to tell a story. What he creates is films that skillfully mesh together mystery, beauty, horror and the mundane. The results are challenging, but oh so satisfying.
I know that Lynch's film are not to everyone's tastes, but I say to anyone who has viewed MD once and found it confusing and convoluted, try viewing it again and you may well see a lot more logic the second time. I certainly did.And thank you David for showing most of the world their first glimpse of Australian raised Naomi Watts in a staring role. She's come of age and deserves to grace important films.On a final note, apparently MD was going to be a TV series but plans were dropped. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing because MD is a very tightly edited film (even though it's 146 minutes long!). Even with brilliant concepts and direction, a TV series can drag stories out too long as Twin Peaks eventually did.10/10",Mulholland Drive

414,RayCharles81,"After Several Attempts Prior, Finally Finished It and It Was Meh",5,9 October 2021,"Meh. That's just about how I felt when I finally finished this after 4 prior attempts where I either fell asleep or just couldn't get into it.I really gave it a chance. I knew the runtime was long, but I made a commitment, stayed awake, and kept my eyes glued to the screen hoping this much talked about film would show me something special by the end to explain why it is always so highly rated.What I got instead was basically an overrated, mess of a movie that had some decent components, enough to give it a 5/10.First off, let me just say that, for a movie that obviously is building a mystery to keep you guessing, it simply is not that interesting or riveting. I've seen average horror movies that had more suspense than this did.I pretty much knew early on that Rita was not real. Nothing was adding up and it was apparent that ""Betty"" was making things up. But the scenes were just so scattered about and disjointed that paradoxically, even though they were like that to create suspense, it actually takes you out of the story instead.I think many of the scenes in this movie were arbitrarily and randomly selected just to add to the runtime.As for my opinion, I think ""Betty""/Dianne was simply jealous of Rita for her successes and having a breakdown. Although I still do not absolutely know what the blue box and key were exactly, it would appear that Dianne fell so low as to hire a hitman to get rid of Rita since she brought money to the bad-looking guy at the diner and he informed her he would confirm when the job is done after she gave him her headshot.It doesn't matter though because nothing is ever shown beyond that regarding the diner scene, and then we arrive at the end where Dianne finally gives up on it all,Ambivalent, I can see how some people like this stuff, but the biggest irk of all for me was in how unimmersive this was for the whole first hour and a half. I'm not saying Harring acted bad in it, but it felt like there could have been a better casting selection. Watts does the best she can do and excels in a couple of scenes, but other scenes it felt like she overacted a little, too.I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but for me this is the epitome, perfect example, of a 2/4 star movie, which on here is:5/10.",Mulholland Drive

417,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,Taking the first exit off the Lost Highway...,9,23 April 2002,"***SpoilersWhen watching a film like Mulholland Drive (although, with the exception of David Lynch' earlier work in general and Lost Highway specifically, there are very, very few films like Mulholland Drive), a lot of questions rise. The central one when discussing them is in how far does a movie have to be explained rationally or interpreted in a logical manner. Many people commenting on this film say it's a mosaic of dreams, present reality and flashbacks and because of the 'dream logic' of it any attempt at rationally explaining the film will be useless. But in my opinion you can still say sensible things about the movie based on what you interpret as dreams, present reality and flashbacks. Also, and perhaps even more interestingly, you can discuss the representation of those three (not necessarily discrete) elements in cinematic form. Another way of approaching this film is saying there really is a rational explanation for all of it, even if that explanation relies heavily on the idea that events are being distorted by the protagonist's subconscious.The second approach most often (I know there are different possibilities) leads to an interpretation that says the film's first two hours are actually a final dream of the Diane Selwyn character. A dream which starts out idyllic with her finding a woman she eventually falls in love with and her career progressing steadily. A dream which mirrors her own story about what happened to her in her search for stardom, and consequently also mirrors why she didn't find it. The blue box suddenly appearing at Club Silencio forms, much like the ear in Blue Velvet, the transition point between dream and reality. In this interpretation the final twenty minutes of the film consist of flashbacks to what happened to Diane in reality. It's a reading of the film that goes far towards explaining it completely. But not all the way.
Much like Lost Highway, although it's more obvious in Mulholland Drive, there is one problem with this interpretation, which is the perspective. If you consider part of the film a dream, why does that part contain scenes the dreaming person would not have dreamt (in my opinion, of course). For instance, the alleged dream part contains a scene with two cops discussing the car crash. Could Diane have known about that? Is it possible to have a dream that spans multiple weeks? I don't think so. And that's where the questions of cinematic representation pop up. Mulholland Drive cannot be fully explained in a rational manner because Lynch allows reality, dream and flashback and narrative flow into each other. He's doesn't just resist going for the traditional narrative structure; he's not going for the traditional narrative altogether. He knows it's impossible to force dreams into that traditional narrative. Filmmaking has a logic of it's own that is not naturally imposed upon our dreams. So it's not only a case of dream logic seeping into cinema but also cinematic logic seeping into dreams. In this way Lynch turns 'the dream' into a cinematic reality with only clues to guide us to its falsehood. The movie consists of two definite and different cinematic realities, both equally important.What Lynch is trying to do is give us an extremely dark, sarcastic view of Hollywood and the way one woman's search for stardom ends in tragedy because of the place's workings. Some ways in which he attacks Hollywood are quite obvious (the director being forced the hire Camilla), some ways are more ingenious (the different roles The Cowboy plays in 'the dream' and 'reality'). In the dream, all odds may be against Betty, but at least she has Rita to fall back on. In reality, Camilla betrays her far more strongly than Hollywood ever did. So, in Hollywood, even the one you trust most could betray you, seems to be (part of) the point. In the dream, Diane covers this fact up by resorting to dramatic conspiracy theories continually denying Rita's betrayal and her own guilt about having Rita killed over her betrayal.This is how I read the film and certainly not the only or the right way it can be explained. But one can find some twisted logic it and it's not necessary to discard it as pretentious nonsense or to resort to saying it can never be resolved and therefore it's unnecessary to try.But did I enjoy it? Well, any movie that compels you to think like Mulholland Drive has to have something going for it, right? And apart from that, I enjoyed every aspect of the production. The cinematography's brilliant, the soundtrack perfect, the acting more than Oscar-worthy and so-on. And trust me, I didn't have any difficulty with the lesbian love scenes either. It may have surprised me more had I never seen Lost Highway (that film may have a completely different setting but certain themes, like jealousy and betrayal are repeated and so are some of the characteristic storytelling methods) and there is the odd scene that DOESN'T work (the extended hitman sequence which plays like something out of a Tarantino flick, for instance). Still, it's a film filled with intrigue, mystery and occasional black humour, as entertaining as it is complex. Truly brilliant.Rating: 9/10",Mulholland Drive
418,jeanmichellavoie,He is messing with you...,4,29 April 2019,"I disliked this movie very much. I don't understand why people find it fantastic. I watched about half of it and stopped because I was under the impression that it was some sort of postmodern experiment where the director just included random things in his film just to see how people would analyze it. I then checked online and find both people who wrote PhD Dissertation on it... and an interview of Lynch saying ""This film is random, I wanted to see how people would analyze it"". I'm giving it 4 because he actually managed to make people write dissertations on it. The film is therefore intersting as a sociological piece... but I did not like it as a film or as an actual reflexion on his themes of subjectivity and construction of meaning. There are films that discusses these theme so much better...",Mulholland Drive
419,xawn,Intriguing Stuff,8,12 September 2002,"This is a film i really was dying to see, and no matter how bad the reviews i got from friends about it, i still was drawn to it. Well, i must say that after seeing it I was left glued to my chair trying to figure it out. And this is exactly why the film is so good. This is not your average disjointed psychological thriller which all makes sense at the end. This is much like a detective jigsaw puzzle. You've got clues which you've got to consider carefully at the beginning, at each corner of the film, and then at the end. Even at this point most (including me) wouldn't have got too far. You will either see this film a couple more times, or you will shelve it and try to forget about it. I've read many interpretations and many of them make sense. But even if you dont give the film meaning, its suspense and mystery will still engulf your senses. You dont really know what is waiting for you round the corner. Sometimes is nothing, just suspense building up that doesnt explode. But nevertheless its purpose is to keep the audience entertained, and give the film a dreamlike feeling. If you are into psychological thrillers, and if you are into David Lynch's style, then this is a film not to miss. This is no pre-packed and ready to eat meal. You've got the ingredients and you've got the figure out what to do with them. You've got to use your mind, and think. And re-think. And re-think again!

It doesn't have nothing but scenes and most of them if not all of them don't even connect. Well, if someone say they shouldn't always do... I reply yes, they should connect if you want to call it movie otherwise just do a music video instead.To begin with easy to make up to 2 and half hours when the characters takes 5 minutes everytime they walk to a door. The movie was incredible slow. I watched it untill the end to see where this went and as I expected it went nowhere. Watch any Jonas Åkerlund music video and you'll find another Lynch (director who made lots of music video Smashing Pumpkins, Prodigy etc)... But what is more annoying is to begin with the soundtrack... same as ever, Badalamenti is boring let's face it, he can only compose one tune since twin picks. Being a good friend of Lynch helps a lot I guess. Also is annoying that NEVER writer really comments or write seriously Lynch's movie. He is like an icon, whatever he does is great...

They are laughing all the way to the bank, and at you.I know, I know.  I'm just a Philistine who thinks he ought to be entertained for $8.  My mistake.The script is neither intelligent nor clever.  The acting is neither subtle nor nuanced.  (Most of the actors can scarcely conceal their contempt for the script and the direction, nay, the absurdity of the overall production.) Oh, but I forgot:  Since everything is blue and hazy, it's a ""masterpiece."" And let's not forget the soundtrack:  Ah, the sound of a match igniting (amplified by a factor of 1000).  Music to my ears!  Even the baffling ""The Big Sleep"" (before the filler material was added in 1946) is more satisfying than this pretentious waste of celluloid.The best part of the movie:  The babe lipsyncing to Linda Scott's ""Every Little Star,"" an awesome make-out song from about '61.  And the scene with ""Medical Center's"" Chad Everett is a classic.

Of course for those who have already seen this film you know that the entire point is not getting it anyway.I have heard from several different sources that the unique and likable aspect of this film is a dream-like quality it has.  In other words, the plot isn't structured like other films.  With the case of Mulholland Dr., it seems more like an unfocused collage made by a third grade boy who procrastinated until the last second to do his art project.  It doesn't make sense, it isn't supposed to, but I know it was to be a TV series at first. It appears Lynch had a stack of unused film and decided to mash it in with a bunch of new stuff.  You will notice that toward the end the nudity, sex and foul language increase.

Short side plots that don't seem to have anything to do with the main two stories don't help any. Postcards of imagery keep popping up for no particular reason.

Directed by David Lynch.Spoilers herein.Thrillers, for the most part, have been part of a successful genre in Hollywood. Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"", ""Psycho"", and ""Rear Window"" are key classics from the genre. And finally we have a film that can be compared to them. Mulholland Dr. has just about everything I look for in a film. Great acting, incredible directing, strange script, beautiful cinematography, and most of all, it's weird and fun to figure out. In other words, this is one of the greatest and most brilliant films I have ever seen, and this is Lynch's definite film.Betty Elms is a woman who comes to Los Angeles prepared to become a famous actress. As she stays in her aunt's house, she is surprised to see a woman with amnesia hiding there. She doesn't remember her name or how she got there, but the last thing she does remember is a car accident on Mulholland Drive. Meanwhile, director Adam Kesher is threatened by ruthless assassins for a woman to star in his film, but if he rejects it, he is in for major consequences.There are many short stories in ""Mulholland Dr."" that won't always make much sense, but in the end they will all come together. Knowing that many of Lynch's films usually don't give an explanation (""Lost Highway"" being one), he lets the audience come up with a solution on their own. All involved do an outstanding job  mainly Lynch, Watts and Harring, for taking such risks in the production.For the many people who are looking for a typical thriller, this is not one. It is one to create perfect atmosphere and clues throughout for the plot twist. On top of that, there is a structured dramatic storyline. There are many words to describe ""Mulholland Dr."", and some in which I haven't even figured out for myself. 5 stars out of 5.",Mulholland Drive

426,Libbets,AND THE OSCAR GOES TO...,10,12 January 2002,"I went to see a preview of this film and I was completely blown away by it. This is classic Lynch territory and deserves to win a heap of oscars. Naomi Watts gives an amazing performance and is sure to become a huge star. A young woman is involved in a car crash on Mulholland Drive, from which she escapes with amnesia, she hides out in a house, which a young actress (Watts) is staying in. They become friends and trying to piece togther who she is and what happened. The film reaches a point where the story folds in on its self and becomes completely unexplainable, in true Lynch fashion. I think this is one of Lynches best films, if not his best, it should rank alongside ""Blue Velvet""",Mulholland Drive
427,robertllr,One of the best films of all time!,10,14 January 2003,"This film has easily shot into my top 20 all-time favorites--right back to the dawn of the ""talkies"".  It will confidently stand with the best of film noir like ""Sunset Boulevard"" (is there an oblique nod at that movie in Lynch's title?) or ""The Big Sleep,"" as well as with other great puzzle pics like Resnais' ""Last Year At Marienbad,"" or ethical fantasies like Tarkovsky's ""Solaris.""People complain that the film diverges from a credible mystery thriller into some sort of haphazard surrealism; but this is far from the case.  You simply need to see that the end of the film is either; 1) the beginning of the film, its unseen preface,as it were; or b) a much later ending, after our heroine has been dragged into an unhealthy love affair; or c) both of these.There is nothing nonsensical about this picture.  Ambiguous, yes; symbolic, yes; even, yes, non-linear. But not incomprehensible.But ""Memento"" is also non-linear.  And that is a great film because both the nature of film itself, as well as the nature of the protagonist's illness, results in a story more powerful, not less, for being outside the usual stream of narrative relation.I've studied this movie a lot, and I could write a dissertation on it; but I won't bore you with explaining the film to you.  Let it suck you in, and you can't help flash on the meanings and implications of Betty's/Diane's story.Let me add that the actress who plays Betty/Diane, Naomi Watts, is clearly going to replace Laura Dern as Lynch's star of choice.  Whatever it is that attracts Lynch to young, intelligent, but vulnerable blondes, Watts has got in spades.  But you have to watch this woman act to believe her.  Watts plays a wannabe actress, and Lynch crafts several scenes were she gets to play her role within a role to jaw-dropping perfection.  Beleive me, she is flat out astounding.Another bit of sublime magic is the performance of female vocalist in a cabaret act where a pop song gets sung in such a remarkable manner that it transcends its humble origins and achieves the status of true art song.Where did Lynch find this singer?  And when will she be coming out with an album of her own?All I can say is that this film is simply an amazing tour de force.  It is both quintessentially Lynch, and yet it raises the bar on pure film making another notch.",Mulholland Drive
428,mateusolivotti,What is reality?,8,19 December 2020,"Mulholland Drive is a plot and suspense film released in 2001 and directed by David Lynch.This is one of the most different and creative films I have ever seen, it is impossible to describe all its complexity in just one text, and besides it is one of the (perhaps the best) films of Lynch's career, much of this is due to the fact that the studio gave the director total freedom to make the film he wanted, and it worked very well.
It is extremely difficult to understand the film seeing it only once, because, in addition to telling various allegories and symbolisms, it does not have an ""official interpretation"", so each person can have a different perception of the work, and many times I even recommend reading some articles about the film.The feature has an incredible look, give the picture the chosen color palette and the actors are all great. As much as the film has almost two and a half hours of shooting, the story holds you in a way that in no time becomes a tiring or boring film, each moment is extremely precise and necessary, nothing could be discarded, the experience of watching Mulholland Drive is almost like putting together a puzzle, the director gives you the pieces, and the viewer assembles them, and this is very cool and interesting to do.Mulholland Drive is one of the best films of David Lynch's career and watching it is much more than entertainment, it is an experience.",Mulholland Drive
429,blue__yoshi,I wish I cared (possible spoilers but who knows),6,26 July 2002,"Spoilers (if I'm right, otherwise not)Okay for the record here's my take on the plot - Diane is having a dream for 90% of the film, in her dream she dreams herself as Betty, a young girl, much like herself when she was younger -A bright eyed young girl who came to Hollywood dreaming of being a star.
In reality Hollywood tore her apart, caused her to hate herself and her girlfriend 'Rita' used her and got a great part over her by sleeping with the director. So in her dream she imagines that 'Rita' is almost killed and has to come to her for help. In her dream Rita is still in love with her. In her dream the Director who stole her girlfriend finds his wife sleeping around on him. And in her dream the director wants her for the part.Anyway, near the end she wakes up and is still half hallucinating but we see that - she didn't get the part, her girlfriend has used her and doesn't want her anymore and her Hollywood dreams have been shattered leaving her broken and full of self loathing.I might be wrong, but really I don't care. If I want a puzzle I'll get a jigsaw. Apparently there's quite a niche market for David Lynch films but film should be a medium for the everyone. I liked 'The Straight Story' but calling this film a masterpiece is just pretentious. It's just film w**k.",Mulholland Drive
430,swordfish-1,"One dream, one reality, one masterpiece",10,29 July 2003,"Ok now the first time I saw this film I was outrageous and really hated the ending and the Lynch himself for not giving an explanation about what was all the fuss about.Last night I decided to give it another try and I'm stunned even myself because of how dramatically my opinion change. This is one of the most perfect movies made in these last couple decades. The story is perfect, the direction by Mr. Lynch is at the highest possible level (he certainly deserved his academy award nomination, he should have even won it). And let's not forget over the top performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring, they definetely had a chemistry, one of the best maybe ever seen in the motion picture (just take a look at the lesbian scenes).***SPOILERS*** read at your own risk Now let's do a little search on the plot:  the first part of the film is a dream from Naomi Watts(Diane), the way she wants her life to be and the perfect indication to that is the way she is portrayed, she can do nothing wrong, she came to the city of dreams, found her lover, was becoming a star cause she was unmistakable as an actress and so on.Now the second part of the film, from the cowboy saying wake up girl is the reality, and also the beggining of the story. Its amazing the way that Lynch could tie the story though the names get changed and everything seems out of order. Naomi Watts (Diane) is in love with Laura Elena(Camilla), but that love is not returned cause Camilla is in love with the director(Justin Theroux). There are very strong indications that they never even had a love relationship, I mean look at the scene where Camilla comes from nowhere and Diane says ""Camilla, you are back"" and than she disappears (which means that she was halucionating), which brings us to the conclusion that the couch scene (a few seconds later)  was also an ilusion or a halucination by Diane (Naomi Watts).After the engagement of Camilla(Laura Elena) with the young director (Justin Theroux), Diane(Naomi Watts) hires a hitman to kill Camilla. The Hitman says ""when the job is done you'll find this key where I told you"", so when Diane finds the key, she feels guilt and her concience pushes her to shot herself.That is about it but there is just another possibility: it may also be that the first part is not a dream, but is afterlife of the two girls (after they dies). Rating: 10/10.",Mulholland Drive
431,Michael_Cronin,Shattered dreams & a broken heart,9,10 March 2006,"Mulholland Drive began life as a pilot for a TV series that was not picked up - David Lynch, genius that he is, simply took what was there, shot extra scenes & rearranged it all into what may well be his finest work yet.It has all the best elements from his previous work - the slick, syrup-coated darkness of Blue Velvet & Wild At Heart, the experimentation with parallel/alternate narratives that he displayed with such brilliance in Lost Highway (and, it can be argued, in Fire Walk With Me), along with the true artist's appreciation for beauty in all aspects of the human condition.The first half of the film seduces the viewer completely with the idyllic story of an innocent, talented young actress-to-be named Betty who befriends a beautiful amnesiac stranger, & while investigating the mystery of who she is, falls in love with her.The second half is the sickening jolt back to reality, when it becomes apparent that what has come before is nothing more than the dream of a young actress who has not only failed in her dreams of stardom, but has had her heart utterly broken by her venomous lover who is not content to simply leave, but torture & humiliate her even further to the point of madness.Sounds relatively straightforward, but this is a David Lynch film, & as such, takes a number of bizarre, yet rewarding, detours along the way to paint a picture of a town with sunshine & lollipops on top, & poison underneath. Almost everything can be explained in terms of dreams, unfulfilled desires & wish fulfillment - almost. There's a fair few loose ends that I suspect were part of the TV pilot & thrown in for good measure, but rather than feeling like loose ends, they just add to the overall mood of corruption & impending doom.Naomi Watts conveys the innocent wonder of Betty perfectly, then handles the alternate role of the bitter, jilted lover with equal perfection. Laura Elena Harring supports her by bringing a dark, ethereal quality to her role, both as the amnesiac & as the sadistic ex-lover. Although there's always the usual sleazy mention of their ""hot lesbian scene"" together when anyone talks about this film, Lynch handles the scene with such care & tastefulness that it's far better described as a love scene than a sex scene.The supporting cast is first rate, with Justin Theroux as a slimy director, composer Angelo Badalamenti making a truly bizarre appearance as a mob boss whose espresso must be perfect, & in one of the most unexpected cameos ever, Billy Ray Cyrus (yes, THAT guy) as a pool cleaner.Words can't do justice to this film. It's seductive & beautiful, slick & cool, sexy & violent, but the lingering feeling one is left with after it's all over is that of a deep, haunting sadness for what might have been for the hopes & dreams of a young girl who was going to be a star.",Mulholland Drive
432,jazzjunkie,Nice street Strange Movie,4,29 August 2004,I thought I was going bonkers    why couldn't I figure out this movie?? Then I read a couple of newsgroup reviews and figured it out ...It was the movie not me...   It had a plot that was hard to follow you had a very hard time trying to figure out what was a real scene and what was fantasy or what someone was dreaming...It went along fairly well from the beginning since I had no clue of what to come ...Then it started with the twists and turns in the storyline and got confusing as to who was what ...first she was Betty then she was Diane but Diane was dead or someone was dead in that apt..and then mystery woman was Rita then she was camila but camila was shown as blonde and ann miller was the apt mgr not the directors Mother... Oh well like one reviewer said just go with ....  so I've seen it but probably won't ever get it again   one time was confusing enough...,Mulholland Drive
433,The Overdrama,"Interesting premise, but don't waste your time (possible spoiler)",5,19 October 2002,"While the amnesia, alterations of fate, and surprising changes are intriguing (and the lesbian scenes enticing to an extent), this movie has many fatal flaws in its follow-through. Characters are not fleshed out in the end because they change identities, why fates change is not justified or explained well; and when fates change, a mystery that has been building in the story is suddenly pushed aside so that a new one may happen. The title is basically the location of the opening scene and another near the end, but has no significance whatsoever to the many plots.I've gotta hand it to Naomi Watts, though. She made one heckuva great and daring performance.And, why, I ask was Billy Ray Cyrus cast? (lol)",Mulholland Drive
434,froboz,Yet Another Hollywood Smile Victim,9,16 May 2002,"This movie shines all by itself. Together with 'Blue Velvet', 'Wild at Heart' and 'Lost Highway' it's forming a starry constellation of brilliant David Lynch movies, all succeeding in the hard task of making entertaining art.There's two contrasting worlds in this movie - the hopeful dream and the cruel reality of a young girl that has come to Hollywood. It must be confusing to director Lynch, that after the remarkable success of Twin Peaks, his brand of surrealism is still not accepted as commercial. So he built Mulholland Dr. out of the scraps of what would have been a thrilling television series. These two year old scenes are what make the dream story. Late in the movie it's cruel 'reality' time. Lynch really makes an effort to show how each dream element has a correspondence in 'reality'. There's plenty left to ponder though, for a viewers mind that is compelled to make sense of the plot. But it is this compulsion for rationality that is the *engine* of surrealism, without it the absurdity that makes the surreal would not be able to appear. And it will linger in your mind for weeks, together with the brutal sadness of the story. In the end, the Hollywood sunshine smile that took the girl in, is mocking her as haunting demons.
We can only be grateful that a remarkable artist like David Lynch still insists on taking on the disguise of an industrial-strength craftsman. Just like the girl in the movie, he's a victim of the sunshine smile of Hollywood. I guess that's what he really wanted to tell us.",Mulholland Drive

Whatever the case, too much of America thought that this was a good movie, and rated it 4 points better than it deserves. Weird movies are okay, but this one was too slow, boring, and ridiculous. No doubt this was conjured by someone putting a finger to their head: where-upon saying, `I think I'll write something stupid-Hollywood loves that type of sh*t.'  You might be able to hold some interest through the boredom, but it ends with you shaking your head. And get a better looking Blonde. But the brunette was attractive.

436,McCamyTaylor,"Would Give It a Better Review if I Had not Already Seen""Celine and Julie Go Boating""",7,16 October 2013,"Technically exquisite movie, like everything that Lynch does. However, about half way through, I started thinking about the 1970s French film ""Celine and Julie Vont En Bateau"" aka ""Celine and Julie Go Boating."" Now, when you redo a creative masterpiece, you are expected to one up the creative masterpiece---by adding some twist that the original did not contain, for instance. Pointing up a flaw in the original and fixing it. Maybe playing on the viewers expectations.This one did not quite do that. A really good film makes you want to go back and watch it again right away. This film makes me want to watch ""Celine and Julie"" again. To see why I remember it (Celine and Julie) as being brilliant and this one as being just pretty good and fairly clever and a pleasant way to pass the evening but nothing new.Probably would have made a very good TV series. I enjoyed the first half much more than the ""let's explain it all now and show how clever the writer/director was"" ending. Which means that Lynch is better at dishing out bizarre slice of life than he is as explaining life the universe and everything.",Mulholland Drive
437,robbieclaravall,Mulholland Drive is a surreal thriller experience.,10,8 May 2016,"Mulholland Drive takes us deep into the depths of psychological depression and madness. It is actually creepy at times, using supernatural and distorted elements as symbolism to some things these characters are doing. It is a type that doesn't follow the general, simple plot and personally requires more than one viewing in order to understand what the director truly wanted to convey and portray in this film.What I love about David Lynch's directing is the ambiguity and mysteriousness that comes along with it. As I mentioned earlier, this is a mind bending experience and you really have to think about it. If you think that the story is only about Harring's character having amnesia and meeting with Watts and them figuring out who Harring's real identity is, then I think we watched two different films. I have 10+ interpretations/theories on what's actually going on beneath the surface of this film, and I love how Lynch doesn't spoon feed us with all the facts and leaves us to think; it's all very thought provoking.In the first viewing, things may actually be quite confusing. There are a lot of characters introduced with different roles and even more in the second half of the film. So it will be quite hard to adjust at first with the multiple story lines but as you watch more of it things will start falling into the correct puzzle pieces and that will make you internally scream at your head. Overall, Mulholland Drive is a surreal experience. It enjoys playing with the unknown and the viewers might have a fun time trying to guess out what's really happening. The Silencio club scene with Del Rio singing might be one of the most haunting and depressing song sequences I've seen in movies. A great thriller, bordering on creepy sometimes; I highly recommend it.",Mulholland Drive
438,Nikos7,"I'll recommend ""MindTrap"" instead",4,10 February 2002,"(Minor?) SPOILER contained. I watched this damn movie tonight and although I initially liked it (perhaps I felt intimidated by the? wisdom in it) the more I think about it now the more I hate it! Maybe it caught me in a not-absolutely-perfect mood or it may just be that I prefer playing ""MindTrap"" than watching movies if I want to solve riddles.  The direction is obviously very good from a technical standpoint and it really catches your attention so you don't feel sleepy besides the long duration of the film. Yet, unlike ""Pulp Fiction"" were all the separate stories tie up together at the end in a masterly way, this ?thing just leaves you with the mouth open wondering what the hell happened at the end. Although I have spent some time thinking about it and have come up with a  broad idea of the general story I still have many gaps left and I'm not even sure if my guesses are correct. I'm guessing that the? grand master has put some kind of Deux-ex-machina explanation in his script to make this all tie together (maybe some of the facts/minor stories are ""explained"" by the fact that they were (?) Diane's hallucinations) and if that is the case it is certainly a sign of a poor script in my view.This is the first film I've ever seen (and I've seen many) that I can clearly say I didn't understand and I don't even care to any more. This including some of  David Lynch's earlier work (Dune, Twin Peaks) which I greatly liked.

440,Django-21,Adventures of a Jitterbug!,10,22 January 2003,"I love this movie!  From some of the reviews I'd read beforehand I expected it to be a difficult movie (despite being a fan of Lynch) but I really enjoyed it on first viewing and watching it again reveals new things easily missed before.  It's right up there with David Lynch at his finest. The two beautiful female leads both do a wonderful job of separating their dual identities in the movie.  Naomi Watts as Betty is amusingly all ""Gosh, gee!  This is superfun!"" through much of the film but gets to show her acting chops in the scene where Betty is auditioning for an acting role and later in the film when she becomes Diane, a tragic victim of unrequited love and guilt in the Boulevard Of Broken Dreams.  Laura Elena Harring is frightened and helpless as Rita but as Carmilla, she becomes more confident and hard edged.  Justin Theroux kind of reminds me of Bruce Campbell in his role as a director and it's great to see ""Twin Peaks"" star Michael J Anderson appear in the movie.There's lots of great scenes in the movie including the aforementioned audition, Theroux's meeting with ""The Cowboy"" (note the use of electricity in this scene, a familiar motif from David Lynch's other work), the hitman's first scene which reminds me of both Quentin Tarantino and the Coen brothers, the erotic love scene between Betty and Rita which is tender and is there to do more than titillate we male viewersand the surreal and touching scene in the Silencio club.It's great that David Lynch was able to turn his passed over tv pilot into a masterpiece of cinema with his familiar elements. Even by the time we get to the Pandora's Box cliffhanging ending of the pilot, we've been on quite a journey with the two girls, but the second part of the movie is just as interesting in it's way in showing an even darker side of trying to live in the Hollywood illusion.  A great exploration of dreams vs reality and the consequences of guilt.  Often amusing, mysterious, erotic, touching and heartwrenching in it's final revelations.

443,ryancarroll88,A postmodern movie mystery that is not to be missed!,10,27 September 2010,"With ""Mulholland Dr."" David Lynch presents his greatest stride yet, giving a surrealist pop dream that is as irresistible as it is confounding, and raising a huge middle finger to Hollywood conventions while never compromising entertainment. Perhaps what the movie accomplishes best is the feeling of unease and disorientation - the camera twists and turns as much as layered plot and the constant dichotomy of tone never gives a comfortable dwelling. For every tender or erotic moment there is an underlying distortion, giving a near subliminal terror that drives the whole movie and mocks everything we're given. This attention to craft and detail makes the movie's tone one of the most important plot devices of all (and is really the main key to figure out what is going on). Understanding the movie isn't necessarily a matter of logic; it's more like seeing the picture in one of those optical illusion eye puzzles - once you find it, it's there, even if the picture isn't clear on the surface level. It's this postmodern take on the idea of the mystery genre that makes ""Mulholland Dr."" one of the more unique movies I have ever seen.The movie stands on its own just fine, but the more films I watch, the more I see its influences: the character relations in Bergman's ""Persona,"" Godard's colorful capricious style, Fellini's self-conscious abstractions, Buñuel's vicious humor and beyond. I realize these directors are some of the masters of the art, and I wouldn't draw such grand comparisons if I felt they weren't earned, but Lynch delivers on every front, giving us a movie that is sure to leave you spellbound.

But since Mulholland Drive accomplished the rare feat of showing for FIVE MONTHS on a local screen here in Portland, I figured there must be something to it.  Sure enough, this time there is method to his madness ...***SLIGHT POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWS***: On the first viewing I couldn't understand the meaning of the sudden shift in characters and scene about 2/3 of the way through the movie.  But once I got the basic meaning of the two segments of the movie (as illuminated well by other reviewers) and watched it a second time, it all made sense.  ALL OF IT.  Every character, every scene, every prop had its purpose and it all made sense as a cohesive whole. Don't get me wrong, it's still a LOT of work to put all the pieces into place, but ultimately I don't think it's that hard to understand.It is hard not to compare this movie to Memento, which also presents things in a non-linear sequence and challenges the viewer to sort it all out. With Memento I'm not sure you can ever be absolutely sure what happened (though we all have our ideas), but with Mulholland Drive, there's no question.

The problems though seem to be everywhere else.Let's start with the narrative as if it were told linearly. Would the movie have been as interesting? Definitely not. It's a story about a down-and-out actress in Hollywood who has her lover killed and then fantasizes/dreams about how it all could have turned out differently. People are actually using the words ""human condition"" and ""universal"" to apply to this story. But is hiring a hit man to murder someone part of the human condition? Oversimplifying? Not much.Another problem I have with the film is it's point, or central theme. The vapidity of Hollywood seems to float to the surface, but not much else. I don't doubt the character of Diane (as played by Watts) experiences the shallowness of the industry. But that theme has been overdone in everything from ""The Player"" to ""L.A. Confidential"" to {pick just about any film ever set in Hollywood}. So what does that leave?

Lynch is generally a director I avoid as the pretentious hype around his work seems to create an exclusivity amongst his fans which is borne out by the Message Board here. It just seemed like too much hard work.However, forgetting the demand for attention to detail in an effort to 'work it out', I found the film a wonderfully crafted visceral experience. The atmosphere created with superlative techniques, especially by the sound department, drew me in and I was hooked.*Spoiler* There isn't a convoluted mystery to this, it's just a long dream, followed by flashbacks of reality to explain it and ending in the mind and madness of the lead player who cannot take it anymore. I recommend avoiding looking for greater depth of meaning or you'll walk away resentful you were made a victim of what is a simple film, beautifully executed.",Mulholland Drive
455,jacob rosen,Captivatingly Pointless,7,22 December 2001,"Though it's far more coherent than its predecessor `Lost Highways', David Lynch is beginning to show signs of repetition and this noir fantasy-nightmare is so reminiscent of other Lynch films that it ends up signifying nothing. Still, nobody does David Lynch better than Lynch: he's an artist when it comes to evoking dread and the film is never less than morbidly fascinating. There's very little point in going over the plot because it's far more of a mood piece than anything else; suffice it to say the primary issue here (much like `Lost Highways') is shifting identities. To that end, the characters are blank though gorgeous. Worth seeing as long as you recognize you're spinning your wheels.",Mulholland Drive
456,adam_pittavino,A puzzle best left unsolved.,10,21 August 2019,"David Lynch's hallucinogenic journey opens during an unsettling hazy dream. A woman is turning and twisting restlessly in a dark bedroom, eerily followed by heavy breathing and silence. Only Lynch can make something
so simple seem so intriguing. Mullholand Drive is an exhilarating, psychological battle, not only the viewers, but for the characters the storyline follows. The film is broken in two halves. Firstly we see aspiring young actress Betty (Naomi Watts) arrive in Los Angeles to begin her acting career. She's like many actresses that are driven by the fantasy of fame, but are naive enough to want it beyond unknown consequences. She is unexpectedly joined by a woman who has escaped a car accident and isn't aware of her own identity. The pair unite in a compelling detective like mystery, both women becoming allured to each other as a stylish seductive twist takes place. The second half isn't as straight forward. In typical Lynch fashion, we see a lucid nightmare strangle the main star to reveal a puzzle that is best left unsolved. Maddeningly baffling, this modern masterpiece can't be ignored.",Mulholland Drive
457,ksundstrom,A psycho thriller for junkies,5,7 February 2009,"Why say ""for junkies""? Simon Rattle the conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestre expressed the sentiment that the ""kicks"" from music was like a drug, saying also he would thus willingly be a ""junky"" for the rest of his life. David Lynch has not reached that level of wisdom. His Mulholland Drive has no recognizable threads in the first 45 minutes that convince one of a major theme to come. Just irritation that a kaleidoscope of fragmented images should hold one's full attention. No initial story line that almost all good modern literature has. The story between the three women Betty and Rita and the unknown who takes refuge in the house of Betty (details of the story given by other commentators) starts after about an hour. One wonders if the film had been just as interesting to get the directors prize at Cannes in 2002 without the first 40 minutes - just 5 minutes would have been enough to set the scene. 2/10 for the first 45 minutes, the impact of the good photography radically reduced by the incomprehensible fragments of the first 45 minutes. ""Imcomrehensible"" is a judgment formed from great modern literature. So begin after the first psychedelic 45 minutes, enjoy the rest. That will avoid the irritation of pseudo art in the beginning.",Mulholland Drive
458,JoshuaHarryMurphy,Unique,8,12 June 2014,"David Lynch's 2001 film Muholland Drive is a mystifying thrill ride that consistently challenges audiences with its ambitious non-linear narrative structure and superbly handled dialogue. In terms of the plot, the less said the better: a woman finds herself in the city of dreams to find that the key to a mystery lies somewhere on Mulholland Drive. What was originally intended to be a made for TV pilot, the film is left unexplained by the director also, with Lynch encouraging audiences to interpret the narrative in their own way and come to their own conclusions. On a technical level the film is flawless. Lynch supremely handles passionate sex sequences along with horrifying and haunting set pieces with the skill to wholeheartedly justify his Academy Award nomination for Best Director. Furthermore, the abandonment of coherence within the narrative is glued together by the well-written screenplay, also Lynch's work, which allows audiences to always engage with what they're seeing, even if it doesn't make sense upon first viewing. Perhaps this film's greatest triumph however is its ability to combine its technical brilliance with character that audiences feel genuinely attachment to. Undoubtedly this can be due to the performances from Justin Theroux, Laura Harring and a career-best showing from Naomi Watts, all of which add a sense of heart and realism to the twisted and uncertain world audiences are presented with.Mulholland Drive is an indescribable, underrated and engaging stroke of genius from Lynch, being both incredibly engaging upon first viewing, but also being so damningly inconclusive that repeated viewings are joyfully inevitable.",Mulholland Drive
459,danfeit,Frustrated and Confused,1,3 November 2002,"Like most, I rented this after I heard the universal praise. And despite COUNTLESS bizarre, unexplainable moments along the way, I was very interested and entertained through 100 minutes of the film. Then the two women went to the ""performance"" late at night. The rest of movie (which is another 40 minutes by the way) is even WEIRDER than the first part AND completely contradict and dump on what I had already seen. Then the movie abruptly ends.Baffled, I wandered over to my computer to see if I could buy a clue as to what just happened. Nothing made sense, and I'm a pretty clever guy. None of these other user comments made sense, even when they say ""SPOILERS."" I still have no idea what they're saying. Someone's dream? Not real? Then what's the point of a 2 hour 30 minute movie if it's ""not real?"" Or is it real? I'm forced to make a choice. Either:[a] The movie is a work of genius on a MENSA level and I'm simply too stupid to understand it. The movie is weird for weird's sake and just doesn't make sense.

461,pmoney13,"The top critics can't figure this thing out, so why the hell should we?",8,18 April 2002,"Mulholland Drive is a movie so complex and incomprehensible that even the cream of the crop in American movie critics (Ebert, Maltin, etc.) can't tell us what is going on, so I'm not even going to try to decipher it myself. However, I will say that among the confusion and disorientation, David Lynch's latest film comes away an exercise in pure, twisted imagination, a film so filled with haunting and seductive imagery that we hardly care when the narrative takes a turn for the muddled. It lingers in the mind and has us thinking days after viewing, like a good mystery/thriller should.  It starts off by hooking us in with an engrossing plot and interesting characters and ends up playing our emotions like a puppet on a string.The plot starts off with a beautiful brunette (Herring) who is involved in a car accident on the title street overlooking Los Angeles and loses her memory. She winds up in the apartment of a young, rather naive blonde (Watts) who hopes to make it big as an actress. Together the two women begin to put together the pieces of Herring's true identity. Other subplots in the film that eventually end up connecting concern a director who is told by sinister producers to cast ""their girl"" or else bad things will happen, and a man who dreams of a bum behind a Winkies shop that ""runs it all"". The film's highlights include a wonderfully creepy scene in a nightclub known as Silencio, featuring a terrific Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's ""Crying""; a dwarf in a wheelchair who intimidates his suited minions with brief commands, and Herring and Watts' uh...budding relationship.
This movie was set up like a dream (as evidenced by the blurry shots of a pillow at the beginning) and, like a dream, it makes little sense. But despite this it succeeds where other Lynch films don't: it's a film that pulls us in with its weirdness and excess, instead of repelling us as his ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Wild at Heart"" did. He manages to bombard us with his usual out-of-left-field imagery, but keeps us interested because the material is so hypnotic. When a character known only as The Cowboy pops up with cryptic words for a young director, I didn't laugh at the apparent absurdity but instead grew more intrigued. Lynch also manages to sustain a creepy tone throughout the entire proceedings, even during times when we don't expect it. There shouldn't be anything disconcerting about a lone female singer lipsynching to ""I've Told Every Little Star"", but for some reason here it is. All in all, Mulholland Drive is like a dream that sticks with you when you wake up. You can't get it out of your head, and the more you think about it the more confused you get. Lynch's last great film was ""The Elephant Man"", and now, in between a series of much less competent works, he scores again. Mulholland Drive is a memorable film experience, a truly fine piece of work that deserves a mention on anybody's Top 10 list of 2001.",Mulholland Drive
462,CTS-1,This Movie Stays With You....,10,30 July 2002,"I find it peculiar that some people claim that this is a ""stupid"" movie, or ""a waste of 2.5 hours of their lives.""  Mr. Lynch has created a fascinating puzzle-box of a film.  The beauty of it is, it actually takes some thought to get to the resolution of the issues (and, yes, there is a resolution- at least to the largest of the loose ends).  Perhaps it is not for everyone- afterr all, that is why ""Crossroads"" sold tickets.The film style is appropriately dark, and the music perfectly matches the noir- meets- Kafka feel of the film.  The saddest part is that, had Mr. Lynch been given the chance, Mulholland Drive could have been the perfect antidote for the ""Friends"" clones which were plaguing television at the time of the filming of the original pilot.  If there is any justice, Naomi Watts' career should take off after her spectacular performance.",Mulholland Drive
463,beetleborgs69,Sensual film,10,4 March 2015,"It's been called an extra-sensory film, the 2001 enigma ""Mulholand Dr."" is classically regarded cinema of the highest order, made in retro-grade, incorporating the nihilistic techno-dread of the new millennium. Stoners and users of the drug ""blotters"" have been quick to try and assimilate a plot thread to this assault on the senses, much like the victims of a ""blotter"" fear will attempt to correlate images in their head with scriptures from New Age books. But it's not there, this is a nonsense film, stripping sense down to it's purest form without context. What ""Mulholland Dr."" communicates it communicates through symbolism, no matter where the plot takes these characters or what random actor has been assigned to the temporary role (all actors play various characters, with no logic or continuity). There is the blue box, which is a symbol for Naomi Watt's colon. There is the homeless man behind the diner, who is a symbol for lust. There is the cross-eyed man, who is a symbol for greed, and trying to get the black book. There is the color blue, which is a symbol for the mysteries. ""Mulholland Dr."" has some of the finest acting yet. Naomi Watts is indelible. Linda Cardellini is sensatious. Justin Theroux, in his breakout performance, is trace acceptable, as the actor-boyfriend who may be leading a double life. The stand-out performance is Anne Miller as the landlord Lulu, who is secretly hiding a kangaroo in one of the garages. Small players are forced to do big things: Billy Ray Cyrus gives the comic turn of a life-time as a pool cleaner who is a little too keen in the peen, if you know what I mean. Michael J. Anderson is back as a ruthless sex-trader, and Dan Hedaya makes an appearance alongside Angelo Badalamenti, Lynch's faithful composer, as twin mafioso looking for a new lease on life. Nothing short of terrestrial here, folks.And of all the talk about the film, what would it be without the best direction? This is Lynch's finest hour, before he went crazy with the digital camera and started filming his whole life like Steve-O, Lynch had one last outing with the classic film, and this is one of the finest examples of pretty movie that there ever has seen. Colors: blue, red, green. Pretty actors, sets that look like a fancy Hollywood movie. Space technology, some gritty realism. There is so much style and variety in this film that if you took any random five minutes of the movie, you wouldn't be able to tell where it came from.I saw this film at Festival, I saw it on run, I have it on DVD and Blu-ray and I go see it whenever it's screening at the local theater. It's one of my favorite films, if I just want to escape into a world that has no meaning, random visuals and colors and space dwarfs and serial-killer madness, alien conspiracies, mish-mash of Hollywood themes. 10/10",Mulholland Drive

465,mrw8,"technically sound, but I must be missing something",2,18 December 2005,"technically a pretty film. Lynch doesn't spare any expense to get a pretty picture. no doubt. But it was incomprehensible. I live near Mulholland Drive. I live in Hollywood. What kind of statement is Lynch making? Is he making one at all? I seriously don't know. I've debated the worth of this movie with people who thought it was ""excellent"". ""What is the blue box,"" I ask. ""I don't know, but it was good."" ""Why are the two women attracted to each other?"" ""Because they are insane."" ""What about the miniature old people?"" ""They were a metaphor."" ""Of what?"" ""Of something important.""whatever. not the worst movie I've ever seen because the picture was so clear and the directing appeared intentional (which is more than can be said of CLerks). The acting is adequate. I just like my movies slightly more linear. But I will say this, there is a scene where a lady sings ""Crying"" by Roy Orbison. She sings it in Spanish. everyone cries. The scene has absolutely no internal value except as an interesting aside. If I had to watch any part of this movie again I'd watch that part and also the part where a girl sings ""I told every little star"" or maybe she lip syncs the Linda Scott recording. Lynch loves good tunes and these two songs are great. alas, they appear totally unrelated to anything. not only that, I must warn you. Each song is sung in its entirety. I mean every single note. SO that is 7 minutes of movie time that can't be accounted for. And I love music! but if 20 seconds will get the message across then what good is including the other 3 minutes? seriously.",Mulholland Drive

His genius lies in exploring intangible, philosophical concepts like identity/illusion via an interesting and accessible format - the genre picture (I use the term loosely).The filmmaker has almost single-handedly resurrected Film Noir from it's untimely demise in the late 50's, infusing it with doses of surreal horror/humor and other now Lynchian trademarks.Whether my amnesia is a result of the daedal construction of the plot or my subconscious subverting my memory is perhaps irrelevant.What is important, however is that Mulholland Drive is one of the most compelling exercises in Cinematic Hypnotism you are likely to ever experience.You won't forget it, even if like me, you have trouble remembering.",Mulholland Drive
467,Seamus-25,A good discussion movie,7,24 April 2002,"While I was watching Mulholland Drive I wasn't sure what to make of it - the film seemed to delight in trying to confuse the viewer, but maybe that was the intention. I went to see it with about 4 other people and spent over an hour arguing and chatting about the film - Can't see me doing that with your average film. The more we discussed it the more it seemed to make at least semi-sense. My advice definitely go with a group.The acting was reasonbly good and there were some very funny comedy moments - especially Justin Theroux as the movie director. I felt for him in his confusion. Although the hitman was amusing as well.I don't think it would have taken a great deal of alteration to make this movie appeal to a more mainstream audience - but then he wouldn't be David Lynch.Camera focus seemed to drift in and out occasionally and this may have been many things - the projectionist - bad camera work - or intentional to confuse the watcher, I haven't made up my mind which one yet.Summary If you do go and see this - don't judge it straight away, give it a chance to become clearer in your mind. 7/10",Mulholland Drive

I was never intrigued by the characters though it kept me interested enough to continue watching. Though in truth there are a few excellent scenes (such as in Silencio and the audition scene).

473,michaeledward1212,Mulholland Drive Theory,10,2 August 2018,"David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. has been endlessly analyzed. From every color, object, background poster, and casting choice. It's a film where every shot has been scrutinized, and deservedly so. It's one of the few films that transcends the medium, becoming a moving piece of art. The plot and story winds and twists into darker and darker territory, much like the iconic Mulholland Dr. itself. Here are some of my interpretations:Diane Selwyn is a struggling actress in LA who has been romantically/sexually rejected by a rising starlet, Camilla Rhodes, who is currently starring in The Sylvia North Story, a 1960's throwback style movie including music numbers that is also starring Diane, in a smaller, thankless role. As a child, Diane suffered terrible abuse by the hands of an elderly couple, and was likely sexually abused by a different man. This abuse was extreme and fractured her personality into many parts. This phenomenon is known as DID (dissociative identity disorder) formerly known as multiple personality disorder. Diane takes out a hit on Camilla and the hitman tells her he will put a blue key behind the Winkie's diner when the act is completed. A man overhears this in the diner and sees Diane pay the hitman. In Diane's subconscious, this event fractures her personality further, and she cannot cope with the fact that she's done something so horrible. This fractures her personality further, and as a result an alter, or new persona appears in her subconscious, modeled after Camilla because Camilla is a symbol for what Diane has done, as she is the one who Diane took a hit out on. The alter is completely blank, as a result of the fact that Diane created it to avoid the truth of what she did. The alter is almost killed, but manages to escape, showing that Diane did want Camilla to escape the hit, and regrets her actions. Later, we see the man who overheard Diane's meeting with the hitman in Winkie's diner. He has had a horrible dream, and saw a man behind Winkie's. This is a reference to the fact that he not only saw what Diane did, but is also a part of what Diane feels guilty for. When he sees the hobo behind Winkie's in the iconic scene, the hobo represents the blue key and evidence of Camilla's death that Diane cannot deal with. He collapses and appears to be dead. This shows that the deed Diane committed is too ugly for her to face and survive for the long-term.Later, we meet Betty, another personality or alter that Diane has created. I believe that Betty was created when Diane experienced childhood abuse, as she idealizes the elderly couple who accompanies her, and dreams of being a Hollywood actress or movie star. I believe that Diane's wish to be a movie star is likely something that originated as a child and is shared with her alter Betty. Betty is a part of Diane but is much more emotionally stunted, optimistic and resilient. Betty is an idealized version of Diane, one who can cope with anything thrown her way, and is unaware or is okay with the abuse committed by the elderly couple.In Diane's subconscious, she sees many familiar faces because in dreams all of the faces we see are faces we have seen in real life. The two alters in Diane's subconscious cannot create ""new"" faces because anything Diane has seen they have also ""seen"" so anyone in her life is likely to appear to her alters as another identity. One such identity is Adam Kesher, who is directing The Sylvia North Story, and through mob manipulation is forced to cast a new actress of their choosing. And after refusing he continues to have one of the worst days imaginable. This is a part of Diane's subconscious that is mad at him for taking Camilla, so she is punishing him as a result. The fact that the casting of ""Camilla Rhodes"" (another blond who was recast for the subconscious portion of the movie) is something forced upon Adam, and him saying ""this is the girl"" parallels with Diane saying ""this is the girl"" when showing Camilla's photo to the hitman shows that Diane views the casting process as a violent process, much like taking a hit out on someone.The head of Hollywood sits behind a glass wall, and appears to be in charge of forcing Adam to recast ""Camilla Rhodes"" in The Sylvia North Story. Behind the glass wall a teal sofa is seen in the room with the head of Hollywood. Due to the color blue being of significance in this film, I believe the couch is Diane's subconscious projecting the casting couch into the head of Hollywood's glass containment. Diane likely believes Camilla slept with higher ups for the role in The Sylvia North Story in reality, or Diane was forced to do it to progress her fledgling career. Betty is trying out for a part in a movie separate from The Sylvia North Story and reads her script with a much older man for her audition. This is Diane's mind taking power from an abuser. Reframing it as a performance and using her brave, resilient, idealized alter of Betty to play out the scene, and this time, land the role and get the attention from Hollywood executives in the way Diane wishes she could. This audition leads her to the set of The Sylvia North Story, where she fantasizes about Adam Kesher being transfixed by her but ultimately choosing Camilla out of necessity. Both alters meet in Betty's aunt Ruth's home, where Betty discovers that Rita, (who names herself after seeing a Rita Hayworth poster) is unaware of who she is, and both are intrigued by the potential answers. They go to Winkie's diner and Rita notices that the name tag worn by the waitress, is actually her name. Rita remembers the name ""Diane Selwyn"" and pieces of the puzzle come together. When they arrive at the apartment of Diane Selwyn, a woman tells them that she is now living in her old apartment. There, the two discover a corpse, symbolizing Diane's suicidal tendencies, and likely Camilla's death. Rita panics, and the two are shown outside the apartment and they begin to merge. After this, Rita cuts her black hair, as parts of her identity are beginning to become clearer and she is beginning to merge with Diane's memories of her guilt. Betty puts Rita in a blond wig and the two look very similar, showing the lines between the two creations in Diane's mind beginning to blur further. The two alters are beginning to share experiences, and later have sex and Betty tells Rita how much she loves her. This process is showing the two parts of Diane become closer and more intertwined. Harsh realities from Diane's waking thoughts seem to be intruding on the alter's activities, and after they make love, Rita awakens from a nightmare saying silencio, and the two are soon seated in Club Silencio. Here, a magician tells them that their is no band, and the club fills with blue smoke, becoming a blue box of sorts. Here the alters listen to Rebekah Del Rio's rendition of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" in Spanish. Both are brought to tears. Although they are aware that they are listening to a tape recording, they are still left emotionally wrecked by the performance. After Rebekah Del Rio collapses, Betty discovers a blue box in her purse, which matches a blue key Rita had in her purse when they initially met. When they arrive back at Aunt Ruth's they prepare to open the box, but Betty disappears. The two alters are now integrated into one, and once the blue box is opened by Rita, she is sucked into it and becomes apart of Diane's larger consciousness and personality. The blue box represents the gateway between consciousness and unconsciousness, and the next time we see it it is being held by the hobo seen behind Winkie's earlier in the film. The hobo drops it and memories of Diane's past actions and abuse come back to haunt her. The old couple seen at the airport with Betty are now images of terror for Diane, and the guilt and remorse overtakes her, leading her to commit suicide. As her face lands on the pillow smoke surrounds her bed, much like it did in Club Silencio to signify that we were watching an illusion, here it serves as a metatextual statement about how film is an illusion. After Diane is dead, her alters are seen in front of a backdrop of LA, and finally a blue-haired woman from the Club whispers ""Silencio"" and the film cuts to black.",Mulholland Drive
474,Mrbrown43,Mulholland drive: A dream about Hollywood (minor spoilers),8,6 April 2018,"David Lynch is one of the most interesting filmmakers in recent memory, His movies are often some of the most talked about and most intriguing films out there. They tend to be very dividing and often need multiple viewings in order to try understanding what they are about and what do they mean. Mulholland Drive is considered by many to be a classic and I would like to talk about it.Mulholland Drive(2001) is a murder (?) mystery drama about amnesic woman played Laura Elena Harring(later named Rita, later Camilla Rose), who after being involved in a car accident takes shelter in a house in a high end house in Hollywood. This coincides with Betty played by Naomi Watts (Later Dianne) a wide eyed young woman looking to become a famous actress in Hollywood after winning a jitterbug contest. The paths of these two women cross, resulting in them teaming up to uncover why the accident happened and who Rita is. While the main plot takes place there are a number of subplots that at first seem completely at odds with each other but all fall in on each in interesting ways towards the end of the film. After a certain point the film changes to a new set of characters played by the same actors (Dianne played by Naomi Watts and Camilla Rose by Laura Elena Harring) and the movie's plot changes into a tragic tale of betrayal and vengeance. I will not deny that when I first watched Mulholland Drive I disliked it, I suppose it was the sudden turn of plot and characters in a movie that is already dreamlike and demanding constant attention (please do not expect a David Lynch movie to be mindless or straightforward, you will only do yourself a disservice) just threw my interpretation out the window and left me cold. However recently with the rerelease of the film in cinemas I decided to give it another go, with this time approaching it with the idea that the first half is a dream of sorts and the second half was based on memory. After the second time I think it does improve immensely, I can't help wondering if this can be a flaw with Lynch's work if the first viewing could be such an off putting experience. I am not such if this is a flaw with the movie or me the reviewer. Naomi Watts shines in this movie, both as the near impossibly upbeat, naive and perfectly talented Betty and as the depressed mess of a human being we see her when she is Dianne. Her performance is real and perfect. Same goes Laura Elena Harring who starts off as the classic femme fatale of every 1940s thriller ever and turns into a woman who stole Dianne's career from under her. She turns from an idea blank slate for Betty to love into a betrayer of love and life. I love it.Now about that dreamlike atmosphere and techniques that is a staple of Lynch's work. He uses a lot of first person perspectives to bring a rather personal perspective and bringing across the implied fact that it is all a dream, the film cleverly uses blurred vision and different perspectives to show us the difference between memory and dream, the use of light and colour to tell the story and explain how characters are feeling and what they see. Perception of reality is not only a theme in this movie but also integral to the film as a whole.Mulholland Drive is an interesting movie that should be watched multiple times in order to understand it on some level. The first viewing may or may not turn you off it and I do not blame you. The movie is a daunting task if you are not prepared. However it is a pretty great movie and I will watch it again someday.",Mulholland Drive

Now imagine the pilot episode and the season finale of this television series edited together with a season's worth of dramatic glue missing, and you'll have something approaching Mulholland Dr. What isn't missing is the thematic muscle, lush cinematography, and a wickedly imaginative story.  Lynch dutifully leaves the ends open, refusing a typical summary conclusion or even a Sixth Sense-style OhWow finale, spinning our narrative expectations and elevating cinema.",Mulholland Drive

The dream seems real to the viewer. It is absurd at some points, but after all it is a dream - and as dreams often do, it touches you somewhere deep inside. It is only broken by brief moments of reality, which in some ways are even more sorrowful than itself...I cannot recommend this movie more. The acting is fantastic... the ideas are represented thoughtfully and the drama is unfolded masterfully - you will be enthralled (10/10)",Mulholland Drive
479,sackleywhistle,Almost beyond words,10,29 January 2006,"As any follower of David Lynch's films may already know, his films are sometimes a little hard to follow. One of his more recent efforts, Lost Highway, was perhaps his most unrepentantly perplexing film to date. Following from the much more straightforward (no pun intended) The Straight Story, came this, an aborted TV series pilot - a companion piece to his earlier Twin Peaks if you will - finished off and rounded out to become his surreal masterpiece.It hardly seems worthwhile trying to summarise the narrative or plot, but suffice to say it concerns a matter of missing identity, an actress new to Hollywood, a director under pressure and a string of dreams and secrets. By no means a film for all tastes, it is nevertheless intangibly brilliant - even though on first viewing you may be completely confused as to what you saw, it is impossible to deny the skill with which it was made and the power that several sequences hold.It is Lynch's sure hand that guides you, reassuring you that even if it makes no sense or it goes over your head, it still all works, thanks to canny, pitch-perfect performances and a series of icons and symbols which recur at key moments.In many ways, the film is a puzzle box, doubling back on itself and shuffling between realms, leaving traces of the truth, but no clear answers. And where the film succeeds beyond description is in atmosphere. There are moments that will have you close to tears, even though you won't know why exactly. Others will have you terrified, though lost. It is worth mentioning that there are moments of pure erotica here as well, both beautiful and raw.When all is said and done, the film exists in a field separate from most others, leaving not just a distinct experience, but a sound and a style, nearly a taste all of its own. Lynch has created a vision that only makes sense in the realm of a dream - a realm where things do not necessarily follow on from one another, nor do they at first fit together, but taken as a whole leave you with a sense of the emotions and feelings of those involved.Upon repeat viewings, there are noticeable details that help fill in some of the blanks and having seen it several times now, I view the film - by the time it has ended - as a harsh satire of human selfishness and cruelty and greed. But a brilliantly acted and gorgeously shot one, quite unlike anything else I've seen. For anyone looking for something provocative, daring, different or just wanting to sink their teeth into a mystery, I cannot recommend this film highly enough.",Mulholland Drive
480,MrMowji,Who does that?!,1,26 September 2017,"So, for David Lynch's movies we need a manual book too? The director has provided some hints or clues for the viewer. What?!! Who does that? This means that he did a terrible job, so he thought ""it's better to give people some hints otherwise they might not understand""!!! It's like having some guy on your next seat and he tells you where to pay more attention to, or to remember ""that pillow"" for future. Seriously, Mr Lynch, don't do this. When you can't show what's in your mind by movies, try writing a book.Some reviewers state that we need to watch MD more than once. This means that the product didn't get the job done. It's filled with so many details and scenes that you need to watch the whole movie again to remember them. Why should we do that? It's 2 hours and 27 minutes.You might be tempted to watch it again (by getting help from reviews or the director's hints) to relief your mind. But I simply decided to ignore it.",Mulholland Drive

I'm not properly describing myself or taste in film because I'm exhausted, but hopefully you get what I mean. But unfortunately this film was over my head I guess, or I missed something, because I was totally let down. Especially with the hype and the first 30 minutes. Am I correct in saying that this is a dark ""artsy"" film?Naomi Watts was amazing though, she got screwed by the Academy and Golden Globes",Mulholland Drive
482,b1lskirnir,Note to self: invent time machine so I can warn myself never to see this,2,6 October 2005,"I'm not too familiar with David Lynch's films, but I saw Eraserhead a few months ago ( voted 8/10 by the way, very good movie ) so resources told me that Mulholland Drive is often considered his best work. After viewing it, my recent energy has been diverted into inventing a time machine so I can go back into to warn myself not to ever consider doing so.Now why would I make such a blanket statement? Several reasons.The movie has no redeemable artistic value. Now while I understand the value of cinema as a form of beauty and artistic expression and that some films can be great films simply because they are absolutely beautiful ( 2001 A Space Odyssey, Underground, most Tim Burton movies, even The Cell ). This movie is clearly an exception. The cinematography is merely above average. Scenes such as the one in which the film director is seen behind the glass ominously masked in shadow has absolutely no relevance to the background of his character nor to anything really at all. This could also be said for the weird guy behind the coffee shop. Much of the writing follows this same pattern.There is only one scene that I could truly say is beautiful and that would be the Club Silencio scene. However, the filmmaker's complete lack of development of this ideal leads ultimately to its failure as a scene, which absolutely angers me because it could've had so much more significance if put in basically any other situation.This movie feels like David Lynch wrote three scripts, shot five movies, two of which were completely improvised, then put the clips into a non-linear editor and clicked a button labeled ""Create Movie."" It lacks any sort of control, explanation, or human sentiment for any of the characters. In fact, one of my favorite characters in the movie ( Cowboy ) was butchered by complete and total negligence to his character after his initial appearance.Let me say that in all honesty, I DO have, in some small amounts, respect for the quality of craftsmanship put into the production of this film and the obviously thorough work that was done in writing and filming it. But I hate this film primarily due to the amount of frustration and aggravation it has put me through and the number of times I told myself ""Don't stop watching it, something's bound to make sense soon enough"" or ""I can't back out now."" If David Lynch's intention was to frustrate me to that extent, I congratulate him on succeeding beyond a shadow of a doubt. But until signs tell me so, I will continue to loathe this film. I generally try to avoid saying that a movie ""tried to hard,"" considering I believe that everyone should always try their very best when making movies ( because no one actually goes ""I'm going to go make something... mediocre. Just ordinary. I'll let the critics do the rest."" ) but this tried and failed. FAILED. FAAAAAAAILED.How is it possible that David Lynch, a man who, according to the development of this movie, has the attention span of a fish when it comes to his writing, can at the same time create a movie so unbelievably boring and inane that not even a classroom of super-intelligent lab dolphins on Ritalin would be able to focus or learn anything from it? There have been plenty of people who have dissembled this movie and dissected bits and pieces, determining which parts are ""real,"" which parts are just the characters' various ""dreams,"" who's switching identities with who, etc. Why bother? What could possibly be gained by over-analyzing this movie? So many scenes are completely unnecessary, so many plot lines irrelevant, and so much time wasted, that any pieces of chicken in Lynch's broth have sunk to the bottom and are not worth fishing out.THE BOTTOM LINE: Do not bother wasting your time with this movie, especially if you are like me and were so frustrated that you wanted to stab yourself in the armpits with forks repeatedly until you passed out from blood loss.2/10",Mulholland Drive

David Lynch is some kind of genius to have been able to tell this story the way he does.  Read a couple of the other reviewers' longer comments if you want some sort of explanation for much of the movie, but the truth is there are some parts that you probably won't find any explanation for regardless of where you look.  No matter what anyone says against the movie there is an underlying theme and it does make sense, some people just don't see it.

I don't believe they've updated their decor since then. I wonder if I sat in the same seat? I think I've been fairly consistent throughout the years in preferring to position myself as close to the exact centre of the theatre as possible.As I say, this only occured to me after the movie was finished, and I was out on the sidewalk, listening to various of my (generally youthful) fellow filmgoers going (I shall paraphrase, so as not to offend the IMDb's delicate sensibilities), ""Oh my goodness, what the heck was *that* all about?"" Which is pretty much the essence of youthful me reeling out of ""Blue Velvet"". Not a clue--I just knew it was absolutely brilliant.Whereas ""Mulholland Drive"" I *think* I had pretty much figured out by the time I was standing on the sidewalk this time.Definitely one of Lynch's best.P.S., IMO anyone who found the sex scenes graphic or gratuitous really ought to get out more...",Mulholland Drive
491,Ramuna,Experience Dream in Movie !,9,13 March 2002,"Masterfully done ! This is truly an extra-ordinary experience you'll find in no other movie but Lynch's.The movie itself divides into two parts,the first part is quite a followable storyline with some sub-scenes in it that first cross to your mind might be scenes that will be connected as the story flow ahead,which you'll be proved wrong as the second part turns in and begin to roll into a surreal,unrealistic,weird and dream-alike storyline,and unlike other mystery thriller movies as Vanilla Sky,Memento,The Others,etc that offer an explanation in the end ,this time you'll be left with head scratching by the end. And That is what Lynch challenged us all.Regrettably some just walked out after the movie and began bursting bad references about how the story's so confusing,no exact point movie,even some claim it a trash movie,I'd like to say those are all who miss the whole point of the movie. The point is to figure out what really happens in the movie and that keeps the movie in mind at least for several days ahead. And I must admit it really ain't easy after all,even the best explanation might have holes in it, I don't think that anyone will ever come to a final conclusion about the exact story, not even Lynch himself, and I dare whoever claim to understand the movie from the very first viewing.Absolutely a must see film, a classic already, and believe me you'll never experienced the same if not with Lynch's.

492,JekyllBoote-1,A mesmerising melange of shaggy-dog stories,10,8 January 2004,"Stupidly enough, I didn't get round to seeing this movie at the cinema when it was on general release. With some qualifications (e.g. ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"") I regard myself as a reasonably devoted David Lynch fan, albeit not an uncritical one. I bought the DVD of ""Mulholland Drive"" some months ago, and found all kinds of excuses not to make the mental and emotional effort to watch it. Until yesterday.I thought about refraining from writing a review until I had seen the movie in its entirety several times, but it seems more honest to write a review based on my single viewing.I can't pretend to complete innocence, however. I did read the first twenty or so of the 1200-odd IMDb reviews, in the hope of gaining some illumination.It seems to me that there are two basic ways to miss the point with ""Mulholland Drive"":1) Be so devoted a David Lynch fan that you kill the wonderful, haunting mystery of the film with explanation;2) Be so bone-headedly anti-intellectual in general, and hostile to Lynch in particular, that you dismiss the film as ""pretentious rubbish"" or the like.We can, I think, dismiss the latter group of reviewers; they'll never ""get it"". It's the first group who bother me.I watched the film in complete innocence. I had no idea, for instance, that it was cobbled together from footage for a rejected TV pilot, and some new footage intended to turn it into a feature film. Knowing this would have completely altered my response. I'd've been looking for the ""joins"", and would have expected some incoherence and haste in the plot development.Some reviewers regret that the TV series was not made. I have some sympathy with this, but perhaps it was better this way after all. The sainted ""Twin Peaks"", wonderful as it was overall, was more uneven than gilded memory might suggest; it had its longueurs, and suffered from having, by necessity, to be directed not merely by Lynch, but by others, leading to an inconsistency of style and viewpoint.Even the tacked-on ""the first half of the movie is all Diane Selwyn's dream"" explanation doesn't take us VERY far, and robs the movie of much of its characteristically Lynchian suggestiveness. Lynch likes to set up situations that suggest rich possibilities of resolution, and then to withhold such resolution. You can feel cheated, as many doubtless do; you can attempt to defend Lynch by pretending that the plot has more coherence than is actually the case; or you can just accept that if you want what the pop-psych babblers call ""closure"" you'll either have to do some of the work yourself, learn to live with uncertainty, or stick to simpler cinematic fare.So, it's all Diane Selwyn's dream? Maybe I've missed something, but this doesn't, so far as I can make out, explain the following:1) There are three basic forces of evil in the movie:i) The hermetically sealed Mr Roque (the Twin-Peaks midget!), who seems to give the Mafia-types and the latino manager of Cookies their orders;
ii) The Cowboy. Is the Cowboy (one of the weirdest and most sinister villains ever to appear in a Lynch movie) simply an enforcer for the Mr Big, or is he an emissary of:iii) The Winkies Garbage Demon? This demon, who dwells among the junk behind the Sunset Blvd Winkies, literally scares a man to death. This same man has had a pair of prophetic dreams, and informs another man (a police officer?) that the Garbage Demon (as I shall call him) is responsible for all the evil that occurs in his dream. The Demon later also unleashes the airplane oldsters (clearly his satanic underlings) from the sinister blue box in pursuit of Diane Selwyn.2) If ""Betty"" is really Diane Selwyn (or vice versa), how does she dream the earlier parts of the movie? She has already killed herself in response to the attack of the airplane oldsters.3) How is Diane Selwyn privy to the experiences of Adam Kesher? Did she dream all of these? Why?4) Why are hermetically-sealed Mr Roque (the Mr Big) and/or the deadpan, riddling Cowboy (under orders from the Garbage Demon?) so keen that Camilla Rhodes be cast in the female lead of Adam's bizarre nostalgia movie?5) Who is the Blue-Haired Lady in Silencio? Why is blue so sinister in this movie (the blue box and its clunky key; the conventional blue key given to Diane by the hit-man)?6) Why Silencio?There are lots of other unanswered questions in my mind. Maybe other IMDb reviewers have the answers (or THINK they have!). As usual with Lynch, I think it's better just to accept that the whole thing is several interlocking shaggy-dog stories that aren't really going anywhere, but we can, if we like, hitch along for part of the ride. (I am reminded of the enigmatic Cowboy's reference to the ""buggy"" he is driving; it's the same with Lynch's narrative.)If none of this appeals, you can always enjoy just looking at the pretty women! (Lynch never underestimates the sheer entertainment value of beautiful ladies and good music.)I'll give it 10/10",Mulholland Drive

'Mulholland Drive' is an insult to people who enjoy excellent story telling. I've familiar with film noir so don't tell me it's so good that I just don't understand it. Make no mistake: I was not confused, I was bored out of my mind. You are not intellectually superior for liking this movie, you are a moron. Lynch cannot pull the wool over my eyes; there is nothing to experience here. He just wanted to make a movie with two inevitable lesbian sex scenes and even they were boring. This movie is not clever, it is not even interesting and trying to pass it off as 'art' is laughable. A few attractive images do not make a movie. The characters are not convincing and apparently have no direction. Whoever thinks Naomi Watts deserves an Oscar needs to realize that she should go to acting school first.The first half hour was so slow moving that I lost all interest in the characters and only stayed because after hearing all this garbage about what a great film it was I felt I needed to see the ending. I figured there had to be some sort of resolution. WRONG! The last hour of the movie derails completely and I wish I just would've followed the other patrons and walked out.

498,Don Stephens,"As everyone tries to figure it out, David Lynch smiles.",10,5 December 2001,"After a plethora of surrealistic neo-noirs that went next to nowhere and the great (albeit defanged) story of Alvin Straight, David Lynch has made the film that one gets the feeling he has tried for a decade and a half to get down pat.  ""Mulholland Drive"" takes the flashy imagery of ""Lost Highway"", the feel of noirs like ""Touch of Evil"", and the products of his own nightmares and exudes an unruly brilliance.This film takes place inside a dream, (There is no disputing that since the second shot in the film is a POV shot of someone going to bed) where things such as reflections, reversals, recurring images, childhood fears of the boogeyman, self-idealizations, and images of one's parents are the norm. ""Mulholland Drive"" is like a textbook of the florae and faunae that reside on the oneiric plain and doesn't resort to psychoanalytical claptrap.  For this alone it should be praised.The performances are wonderful, (Especially Naomi Watts who inhabits both sides Hollywood female ideal) the technical credits are great, and the script, which most would spit upon, does a great job of becoming more and more abstract the more you try to make sense of it.  Those who would say it's a bad script are those who would be looking for a story, which Lynch plainly doesn't offer.  Blasting ""Mulholland Drive for a lack of cohesion would be like blasting a Charlie Chaplin movie for a lack of dialogue.What I personally find most entertaining about ""Mulholland Drive"" is nowhere to be found on the screen, but rather in the reactions of those who don't get it.  I get the feeling that as he hears the drivel of the poor inhibited souls who bemoan this film for ""not making sense,"" David Lynch smiles at a job well done.**** out of 4",Mulholland Drive
499,VVMini,Surrealism taken too far,6,5 November 2018,"David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" is in many ways a hypnotic, well-directed and well-acted piece of surrealistic film. I'm still somewhat unsure of whether it is artistic genius or pretentious schlock, but right now I fall somewhere in the middle between these two extremes. I acknowledge the ambition and artistic integrity that went into making a movie such as this, and just how dinstinctly David Lynch and wildly different from any other movie it is. It's a very visceral movie experience, relying mainly on ambient music and visuals. At the same time I am also highly aware and annoyed of the fact that this is a movie that deliberately barely makes any sense without some sort of pre-conceived notion of what is going on.On first viewing (which is what I'm basing this review on, as I only just watched it for the first time), it's nigh impossible to understand what is happening. Only after reading up on the plot of the movie does some of the events fall into place. Some might see that as a plus, that it has many additional layers that get unravelled on repeat viewings. I would agree with that, if there were any initial layers to process. Instead, from a story perspective I got absolutely nothing out of it without looking it up, and that is a storytelling sin in my book.A large part of my frustration with the movie comes from the fact that the fantasy/surrealistic part of the movie goes on waaaaay too long in comparison to the 'reality' part. There are also no real hints that this is a fantasy/dream other than of course the fact that some bizarre stuff happens. This bizarre stuff happens equally in the 'real' section of the movie though, so that's not really very enlightening.Don't get me wrong, I'm all up for weird psychological tales with surrealistic elements, but if those surrealistic elements take up three-quarters (2 hours!) of the movie before coming to anything resembling any sort of sense, you have overdone your surrealism in my opinion. It made the end of the movie feel really rushed, as there was not enough time to properly connect the fantasy to the reality. If it was a more even 50-50 split, or if there were a few more specks of 'reality' interspersed into the fantasy part, I think it would have strongly improved my appreciation for the movie.As it is, I dig the whole hypnotic and surrealistic vibe of the movie on a visceral level, as well as the performances (especially Naomi Watts'), but the deliberate lack of any sort of coherent story just rubs me the wrong way. Which is a shame, because the underlying story beats that get presented at the end are actually really moving and deeply human.",Mulholland Drive

501,michaelmunkvold,A fantastic riddle that might not have an answer,8,3 April 2015,"Like most of David Lynch's movies, ""Mulholland Drive"" makes no sense: strange things happen for no apparent reason, characters change identities, and by the end it's unclear what you've just spent two and a half hours watching. Once you try to make this movie fit into a neat little box, you've lost the battle. Once you accept that it won't give you the answers you want, however, you will have a great time making up the answers yourself. ""Mulholland Drive"" is about whatever you want it to be about; it's like a dream that could be a fantasy or a nightmare, depending on what you bring into it. The plot (if there even is one) follows the weird, twisty paths Lynch is so well-known for: a young actress named Betty (Naomi Watts) moves to Hollywood to make it big, and meets an amnesiac named Rita (Laura Harring). She decides to help Rita solve the mystery of her identity, and along the way the two become lovers. Meanwhile, Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux), the director of the movie Betty wants to star in, is strong-armed into casting a certain actress by a shadowy group of mobsters, a mysterious cowboy (Monty Montgomery), and a malevolent dwarf (Michael J. Anderson) in the proverbial smoky back room.Of course, it wouldn't be a Lynch movie if it didn't take a trip through a parallel reality. It turns out that Betty may (or may not) be a failed actress named Diane Selwyn, and that Rita may (or may not) be her far more successful ex-lover Camilla Rhodes, whom Diane pays to have killed (or does she?). There are little vignettes about an incompetent hit man (Mark Pelligrino), a man (Patrick Fischler) whose recurring nightmare is coming true, and a spooky nightclub where everything is prerecorded. They may have nothing to do with the story, or may be very important to it. There are a plethora of fan sites, chat rooms, and even published academic papers debating the meaning, or lack thereof, of this movie. Maybe Betty is Diane's fantasy of a better life, and Rita is her perfect partner - no past, no baggage, existing only to love her. Or maybe both Diane and Betty are figments of Rita's dream. Or maybe, as the emcee of the dreamlike nightclub says, ""this is all an illusion."" I prefer to think of it as one of those ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books: the path you choose will determine where you end up.Watts is completely convincing as both a starry-eyed ingénue and a jaded, depressed failure. She plays both parts (or is it the same part?) for keeps. Harring complements her perfectly as both a damsel in distress and a sultry femme fatale. The sex scenes between them would have been exploitative in a lesser movie, but here they're tasteful and serve a purpose; Betty and Rita (or whatever their names are) are looking for someone to be and somewhere to belong, and mistake sex for the answer to those needs. We've all done that.'Mulholland Drive"" looks, feels and sounds like a distantly remembered dream, the kind that still feels real after you've forgotten what it was about. Composer Angelo Badalamenti contributes his usual sultry, haunting score, and cinematographer Peter Deming gives the movie a bright, Hollywood-style sheen that looks too good to be real, adding to the movie's fantasy quality. ""Mulholland Drive"" is not for people who go to movies expecting to arrive at a destination. It might not even be for people who watch movies to enjoy the journey, since it's never clear what kind of journey it is. ""Mulholland Drive"" might work best for the kind of person who finds freedom in getting lost. If you're one of those people, ""Mulholland Drive"" is a great ride.",Mulholland Drive

The best thing to do with this film is just watch it without any preconceived ideas or notions of what it is.

503,bijanadhikari,A beautiful Hollywood nightmare,10,9 May 2021,"Conveyed first as a TV pilot, David Lynch's twisted surreal drama is full of metaphor and interpretation which has been debated and analyzed to death by cinephiles and movie buffs (almost as close to Kubick's shining). What almost everyone can agree upon is no matter how much you twist or convolute Mulholland Drive to make sense on what you just discovered , you are assured to get a sense that behind all the characters, plot, act, story and ending, Lynch knew exactly what he was going for and he achieved it in a glorious trepidatious manner. At first you might get a sense of a absurdist drama being directed on screen but by the end if you somehow figure out all the detail and hidden meaning Lynch has left through out each act you will get a grand film noir(as close to Sunset Blvd) ending that you will appreciate with each passing day and viewing leaving a immediate impact on your psyche and Hollywood dream as a whole.",Mulholland Drive

The movie has been called a dream sequence and I've been told one doesn't have to understand it to appreciate it. But for me the king has no clothes.   David Lynch as done some fine things. ""Blue Velvet"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. I loved the first year of ""Twin Peaks"". But somewhere along the line - if memory serves I began to see it in the second year of ""Twin Peaks"", and certainly in Lynch's subsequent movies - Lynch lost the clarity that made his weirdness appealing in the first place. To me it appears that he is trying to be weird for weirdness's sake, and it doesn't work.   Maybe it's fun to see a movie like ""Mulholland Drive"" several times and sit around discussing it for hours, trying to understand what the filmmaker's grand vision was. Certainly I've done that with Ingmar Bergman flicks, among others. But if I want to have dreams I can take a nap, and David Lynch is no Bergman.",Mulholland Drive

506,trut,Amazing,9,13 July 2002,"I bought and watched the DVD of this movie for the first time recently and was shocked and amazed.I am a major fan of David Lynch films, and yet Mulholland Drive managed to catch me off guard and present me with a truly terrifying, cynical and quirky masterpiece containing some brilliant moments.Naomi Watts was outstanding.  I barely recognised her from her soap opera career here in Australia.  She truly gave an amazing performance and showed a very wide scope and variety.  Her brilliant performance made at least one outstanding and memorable scene.There are some truly beautiful moments in this movie.  There are also some delightfully quirky events, enveloped by an undertone of terror.  I found myself on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering what was going to happen next, how long it would take, and how creepy it would be.The usual David Lynch signatures make their appearance: the room with red curtains, the stage, the mysterious and bizarre characters, the transformation of characters, and the slow, drawn out pacing.  I found that it heavily references Lynch's previous works, such as Lost Highway (1997), which also features Los Angeles and the road named Mulholland Drive.  I really cannot give away anything else.  The movie makes an abrupt transition half way through and I still don't know what is going on.Certainly I have not pieced together the plot yet - I have been told it takes multiple viewings to do so.  I look forward to it.The bad points?  There were just two moments of the film where I sat back and thought ""that's been done before.""The movie is very long and tense.  Clear your mind before you see this. Also, make sure you don't watch this movie with somebody who has seen it before. 9 out of 10.",Mulholland Drive

This film is no exception, except in that it is more so. It is the first Lynch film I have seen on the big screen and I was not disappointed - confused and disturbed, but not disappointed. I get the impression from this film that Lynch really hates Hollywood. This film is an assault on many Hollywood clichés, while at the same time a showcase of Lynch's talent at using and transcending those same devices. There's some traditional suspense type stuff, romance kind of stuff, and some Tarantino-esque stuff all thrown in.**SPOILER-ISH**Speaking of devices, I must admit that I was just slightly disappointed in how Lynch fell back on some of his recurring themes and surreal/occult plot twist. Most notably seen in Twin Peaks and Lost Highway, Lynch's universe seems to include some shadowy network of sorcerer type people or creatures that somehow use human souls or emotions to fuel their time and space bending schemes. In this film it's ""The Cowboy"" who seems to be near the top of this cabal. His brief appearance(s) is one of the best scenes I have ever seen.There's some seemingly gratuitous steamy girl on girl action too.",Mulholland Drive

I saw it for the first time in 2018 and immediately watched it three more times (one each day for the three days following my first viewing). I can genuinely, 100% promise you the film became more brilliant with each watch. Then, I did some research. Wow. How could someone be so brilliant.David Lynch is a mastermind and this film is why I love film as much as I do. It's more than just a film, it's a feeling, an experience, a journey.

514,BadlandZ,More Crap for people who Love Crap...,1,18 October 2002,"This is just more crap for people who love crap.  It's typical David Lynch, with bad acting that would only fly in a 1950's sitcom, and a plot that is written solely to make you wonder what's next, yet really has a story behind it, and never goes anywhere.If you liked Twin Peaks, you'll love this.  Because both were `what's going on' and challenging to think about.  But, as usual, David Lynch fails on all but one point.  Everything is bad, everything except for one thing, he keeps you constantly asking `why?What's bad?  Well among the things that suck are, the plot, the direction, getting the best work from good actors/actresses, the discontinuity in what could be awesome visually relevant scenes, the subplots that do nothing except show their faces, the characters that seem interesting but aren't played out, etc.David Lynch has a talent, don't get me wrong.  He manages to get every single element of a good film together in one thing.  But he also manages to drop the ball on ALL of them, as in most of his works!If ANY other director could manage to collect even half of the elements in a David Lynch film into one movie, and make them work, it would be a blockbuster!  David Lynch has again triumphed in getting every possible good element of a project into one effort, and then making every single element fail.More crap.  If you want to study movies, study David Lynch.  He is a mast er at SOMETHING, and that is, defining and bringing the key elements, and many many of them into a project.  But, don't study what he does with them, just study what the elements are in the project.  He can't deliver on a `suspense', because there never is a climax and an ending.  He can't deliver on deep characters, because he just keeps trying to build them, but never makes them have significant meaning to the plot.  He can't deliver on the plot, because he brings a great plot to the table without ever bringing a `shocking' or `meaningful' conclusion to it.If there is anything Lynch is good at, it's this..  He is a mold breaker, and does away with the conventions of the typical Hollywood movie. Unfortunately, the parts he does away with are the best parts.  It's groundbreaking, no doubt.  But if you break all of the ground and leave nothing left to walk on, you can't go ANYWHERE.",Mulholland Drive
515,cecrle,reflection,10,16 October 2005,"Enough has been said in user reviews regarding the movie's interpretations (and of all Lynch's movies, I'd say this one has the most solid core of discernible plot hiding beneath the strangeness). I just want to make a few comments on the negative reviews posted by some viewers-- An ironic and extremely frustrating aspect of ignorance is that it cannot recognize itself, doesn't seek to expand itself into knowledge or understanding. This is evident in many of the negative reviews of Mullholland Dr. posted here. Just because certain viewers couldn't make sense of this film, or wouldn't even TRY to make sense of it or think about it, many of them reacted with anger & insults of David Lynch. Unfortunately for those people, there ARE answers to this movie, very real and satisfying answers. How unfortunate for American audiences that our film industry is constantly spewing out such boring, predictable, clichéd drek that when something of substance and artistic creativity & quality comes along (Mullholland Dr.), many are left puzzled and angry, and follow their knee-jerk impulse that it must be the MOVIE's fault, not THEIRS! A creative, artistic film that's daring and original--no wonder Hollywood-suckled zombies are left so confused!!!---""WHAT?! The director wants me to actually THINK about what's going on?! It's not all wrapped up for me in a clichéd 'surprise-ending' that spells it all out for me?! I might have to see it several times to understand it?! Then I don't WANT it!"" Sorry, but if this film makes you angry, then it's YOUR fault--your fault for being so intellectually lazy that you want everything to be cut & dried then spoon-fed to you. So lazy that you wouldn't know a good piece of art if it came by and bit you on the nose. This doesn't apply to the thoughtful viewers who saw the film more than once, thought about it, figured some things out, and came to the conclusion that this film just wasn't up their alley. But the negative comments by so many users here display a belligerent refusal to stop for a moment and consider things.So keep these things in mind as you peruse the user comments and see all the moronic comments of, ""This movie is garbage!"" ""This movie is stupid, it's meaningless!"" ""This is a waste of time!"" ""The only reason people say they like this is because Lynch made it!"" My honest first reaction is anger at the ignorance of these people, anger at that very ignorance of much of American's viewing public that has in part caused our entertainment industry to overflow with so much soul-less, brain-less junk. But really I feel sorry for the people who can't get anything out of this movie, especially those who think they ""love film"" but still can't understand why anyone would like this movie! It's a crime against art to see this film dismissed by some while so many pieces of crap garner loads of gushing praise. Thankfully the majority of IMDb's users realize the worth of Mullholland Dr.All I can say to those who so quickly dismiss and insult this film is this--you can keep your John Grisham adaptations, your action-explosion blockbusters, your Jackie Chan non-sense. A film like Mullholland Dr. is for those willing to view a piece of art from the standpoint of an intelligent adult, but unfortunately there are way too many juvenile, ADD-afflicted boneheads dictating the direction of ""entertainment"" in America these days.",Mulholland Drive

Unfortunately, ""Mulholland Dr."" is not one of them. Far from being even merely good, this film dwells on tired quirks, attitude and atmosphere in a desperate attempt to create drama. It does not succeed. There is no drama as the characters, Betty and Rita seem unconvincing, perhaps for lack of acting abilities perhaps because of the director's intention. Plot there is, as events follow other events, all of them searching for a story that fails to arrive. Characters come and go, trying to be ""cool,"" trying to convey something but at the end we don't know what. Even the sex is worse than bad, that is, just boring and uninteresting.

Subtle ""reality to fantasy"" changes take place at crucial moments to underscore Lynch's story, and if they're missed - so too will be the viewer's realization of them. Are there a few things left unsettled in my mind at the film's end? Sure - the monster in the alley probably being the most debatable, but all in all this movie pulls together in an incredible fashion.

520,vaudeville1980,"Visually stunning, but hardly a masterpiece",7,28 April 2003,"I, like the majority of reviewers of this film, found myself confused and frustrated at the end, but not disappointed. MD is visually stunning and had me in its grasp to the very end - even after the 180º turn in the last third of the film. What makes a masterpiece? Undoubtedly we can say that Schindler's List and Citizen Cane are in that category. But who had to watch them repeatedly to figure out what they meant? I saw Schindler's List twice only because I wanted to experience it again. I've seen Citizen Cane about four times because it's a fantastic work of cinematic art. The majority of reviewers sat through MD more than once because they were so confused by the ending that it became a quest to decipher Lynch's story. Granted, they (and me) enjoyed the film and it was a labor of love to understand. But is that a characteristic of a masterpiece?The Sixth Sense and MD, though barely in the same category, share IMDb traits. As of April 28, 2003 The Sixth Sense scores an overall rating of 8.2 and is #72 in the top 250. MD scores an 8.0 and is ranked at #139. These are very close scores which means that, in general, they are regarded almost as equals in their viewer approval. However, The Sixth Sense is superior of the two thrillers - both being of the kind that pull a major, unexpected, even confusing plot twist near the end. Shyamalan explains the twist using flashbacks. You come out of the movie shocked and loving that fact that Shyalaman ""got ya"". Lynch's end is so confusing and the flashbacks only make it more so. This is not just my opinion - read the other reviews. It took me two viewings of MD, hours rummaging through the IMDb message boards and several external websites before I finally found the blue key that unlocked Lynch's vision. Now that I understand his story I really like it but I don't believe that a ""masterpiece"" should have to be viewed repeatedly and broken down scene by scene to be understood. Still...Rebekah del Rio singing ""Llorando"" as Betty and Rita break down in tears was a mesmerizing moment in the film. 7 out of 10 stars.",Mulholland Drive
521,kennychaggerty,Bizarre without Logic,4,27 April 2010,"Before viewing Mulholland Drive (2001) I was prepared for a bizarre experience primarily because David Lynch has made some of the most abnormal movies ever created (Blue Velvet and Eraserhead). Although I was one of the few people who hated Blue Velvet I went into viewing Mulholland Drive with high expectations because the film was met with such high praise from critics. I was disappointed to say the least. After watching the film I immediately went to Roger Ebert's review of the film to see if I had missed anything within the story or in Lynch's camera-work. I had not but I was intrigued by Ebert's last paragraph in which he states that if you need your movies to contain logic, Mulholland Drive is not the film for you. Personally for me I enjoy movies in which the connections are made clear between the characters as well as a storyline which makes sense. In my opinion Mulholland Drive has neither, which made it almost impossible for me to care about what happened within the plot. I'll admit that there is some interesting camera-work done as well as some entertaining scenes, but the majority of the time I was so distracted by the ridiculous occurrences in the story that I simply did not care what was happening on screen by the time the movie reached the half-way point.I am all up for films that require you to come up with your own interpretation to what is happening but there is a difference between challenging the viewer and straight up confusing the audience beyond words. Mulholland Drive falls in the latter category. So if you like asking yourself the question, What the hell is going on? every five minutes, Mulholland Drive is the film for you. Otherwise avoid it at all cost.",Mulholland Drive

It's hypnotic, really, and many of the images are genuinely powerful.  My problem is that, while Lynch is clearly a talented director with a sense of the power of film, he wields his power irresponsibly.What we have here is a movie that is hypnotic but essentially meaningless. And I'm not saying that it's confusing.  On the contrary, as I watched, many different explanations suggested themselves to my mind.  But it would be a waste of time.  Lynch himself acknowledges the inherent meaninglessness of it all with a conspiratorial wink--""no hay banda.""  There is no band.  The whole thing is just artifice.There are those of you who will say, ""But wait!  I've figured the whole thing out!  Just listen!""  To you I simply say, ""Silencio!""  What about all the others who think they have everything figured out, and their interpretation is completely different than yours.  And even if you've managed to figure out the ""right"" interpretation, what does it matter?  It's still just a mind-game, a visual Rubic's cube with absolutely no insights on the human condition.Lynch has said about his paintings that he's really just going for a reaction from his audience.  And he's doing the same with his films.  Well, he certainly got a reaction out of me, but who cares?  What happens after I recover from my initial reaction?  This film is all surface and no depth.

The acting of both actresses is superb, especially Naomi Watts in her double role as both Betty and Diane. *** Possible spoilers *** My 1/3 for what is worth: THE OLD COUPLE- Betty´s parents (pushing her in the Hollywood dream world) THE COWBOY- An excuse for the director´s choice of Camilla. THE BLOND CAMILLA- Betty. LAST 1/3 - Reality. FIRST 2/3 - Betty´s dream (her reality and excuse before she kills herself). THE MOB - An excuse for the director´s choice of Camilla.Overall 10/10, a master piece and Lynch best",Mulholland Drive
528,arric,Don't believe the hype,1,9 January 2002,"Movies that force you to watch, simply compel you to think because they are multi-faceted and well thought out are few and far between.  This ""movie"" is not one of them.  It is convoluted, confusing for no reason and I was always waiting for a midget to appear as it would have made as much sense as anything else in this horrible film. Undoubtedly, there will be accolades and awards for this film and that is fine.  That is Hollywood handjobbing its own.  But if you want the straight truth, this movie is the longest 2 plus hours I have ever spent (not counting Titanic).  It starts out with such great potential that its failing is even that much worse.  There is a point where it gets, to put it plainly, stupid as hell.  You no longer want to suspend your disbelief and no longer want to trust that the movie will make any sense at all. I know this is what some people will say is the point of the movie. But if a movie makes you think, that is one thing.  If a movie makes you ponder why the director was ever given money to make such drivel and it only makes you think because the film has no genuine purpose and exist, as does so much of David Lynch's work, to be weird and confusing just for the sake of being weird and confusing then it is not really that impressive. Most of us could make a confusing movie with inane plot twists and strange characters, especially if we never had to make any sense of it.  But most of us did not, somehow, convince people we were a good director. I strayed away from much of the movie itself as I was so disappointed with it that there was not a great deal to say that was good about it.  The dual role of the blonde was a great performance in so that I did not really realize it was the same woman.  Kudos to her.   But her over the top starstruck new girl in town first bit of acting was so silly that I forgot the rest. There are so many loose ends in this film that I hope you are not a person who enjoy movies that make sense, much less movies that have a tidy ending.  This does neither.",Mulholland Drive
529,dmnkeen,It can't be just me...,2,30 January 2002,"Have I missed something? Has my IQ suddenly plummeted to an all-time low? No, I refuse to believe that I've lost my senses here and that, in true Lynchian paranoia mode, it's everybody else that's gone crazy. But, my oh my, did this movie suck big time!It's the same old David Lynch formula (which, believe it or not, I actually like) as seen in Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, Eraserhead, Wild at Heart et al. But here, it feels not like Lynch himself, but some hack Lynch wannabe who has taken control. The acting, apart from the two female leads, is appalling - whoever cast Justin Theroux should be shot - the camerawork stodgy for the most part, and even Badalamenti's score sounds like he was composing in his sleep.I'm all for innovation and challenging cinema, but this movie disappears up it's own rear end (and I don't mean in the intended way). Some scenes were also cringemakingly embarrassing to watch. This is definitely, in my humble opinion, a sad case of the Emperor's New Clothes where a director has started pandering to the critics and vice versa. Who cares what it all means? When it's this badly, lazily, and pretentiously done, there's no point in even thinking about it. Along with Lost Highway, this definitely Lynch's worst.",Mulholland Drive
530,nalders,"I got what I wanted from it, but all the hot lesbian action in the world couldn't make me care about the story.",3,10 August 2006,"Surrealism isn't my thing. I need a coherent narrative to enjoy a movie, and Mulholland Dr. does not have that. What it does have, is a few short, probably superfluous, yet nevertheless highly enjoyable, lesbian scenes involving Naomi Watts.Not to denigrate David Lynch's talents as a director. I'm sure he's a brilliant filmmaker and all that, I just really don't care. If this is the kind of movie you enjoy, surrealism and symbolism and vivid imagery and muttering ""What the f**k?"" every couple of minutes, then yeah, it's a good movie (symbolism or no, the dialogue made me cringe. Maybe that's intentional; like I said, I don't care).If you only have an interest in this because of the 'adult content', as they say, there are probably more effective ways to get what you want, unless you really... REALLY... like Naomi Watts.It strikes me as odd, however, that Lynch specifically requested that the DVD not be divided into chapters as almost all movies on DVD are. The reason given, that people would be more likely to watch the movie in one sitting, makes a certain amount of sense. Consider, however, that through his action, Lynch attempts to 'force' the viewer to view the movie within certain time constraints by making it inconvenient to do otherwise. Restricting the entire film to one chapter also makes the film more prone to become inoperative. Older rental movies with visible scratches frequently screw up in my DVD player, and I usually bypass this by skipping to the next chapter and rewinding. What Lynch has done has made this either vastly more difficult, or impossible.I think that's rude, and I also think it violates a kind of gray area, where the director's perception leaves off and the viewer's perception takes over. By even TRYING to dictate the manner in which the film is watched, Lynch assumes a sort of authority I don't think he's entitled to.But hey, what do I know? I'm not one of these 'surrealism' people. I'm just a guy with a headache from watching Mulholland Dr. I give this choreographed insanity 3 stars out of 10... all of them for Naomi Watts.",Mulholland Drive
531,Mighty_sheman,Huh? The same director made The Elephant Man?,2,11 May 2005,"Maybe I am going a bit soft, I have previously handed films 1 star ratings without any regrets but when it came to this film I generously gave it 2. Don't get me wrong though, that extra star is purely for MDs artistic qualities, because aside from that and a few mildly amusing scenes this film really has no redeeming features whatsoever. Mulholland Drive is pretentious, trashy, contrived drivel with fancy knobs on that unfolds at a meandering pace with a plot that's about as deep as a paddling pool and has incredibly weak characters. It is at times laughable at others cringe inducing. I spent the whole 2 and a half hours just hoping for a story to break out amongst all the madness!I myself enjoy a wide range of films from action films to the surreal thought provoking variety, however this film did not impress me one iota. In an age where a pile of crap (I mean that quite literally) or an unmade bed can be considered works of 'art' it's unsurprising that films of MD's ilk are being lauded as works of genius. Films like MD are so divisive it's unreal, some of those who don't 'understand' them think that because they are bamboozling that there must be some sort of divine genius to it that the common man simply can't comprehend so they decide they should love it, others will despise it because they don't 'get it'. Then there are those who feel they understand it so it gives them a sense of smug authority over those who don't. This film in particular has this effect. I don't like it, the most common response to that is ""well, you don't get it then"". Sorry no, I just didn't like it, the film was slow paced, dull as dish water and the characters were so dull, shallow and underdeveloped I couldn't give a toss what happened to them. It seems it's not possible to understand MD *and* not enjoy it, even though I can see it for the flat, hollow, coma inducing unadulterated dross it really is. It seems like there is an increasingly apparent snobbish attitude surrounding non-mainstream films at the moment. Just like fashion labels, the type of films people watch are becoming a statement about what sort of person they are.*Spoilers* I don't really see how people can get so confused. Sure Lynch takes the story off on a tangent every 10 minutes but there is very little here that should leave you baffled. The central plot is wholly uninspired and is nothing ground breaking, to cover up what is a rather weak plot Lynch tries to confuse and mislead the audience (and thus make it a work of genius) by cutting up the plot and adding bizarre scenes that don't at first seem to have any purpose, indeed a lot of the scenes are completely peripheral in the grand scheme of things. Lynch throws way too much symbolism and too many ideas at the screen at once showing no respect for his audience, and ends up with a horrible convoluted mess. I can see he's trying to be amusing and at times slightly ironic in the way he makes the film totally OTT and at times cheesy with daft effects and hammy acting (creating the 'Hollywood' fantasy world of Diane's mind) but he comes off as pretentious and self indulgent and it all becomes incredibly irritating very quick, after a while I just wanted to jump into the screen and slap the lead characters silly. Then there's the music 'score', it sounds like a 3 year old has been let loose on a FisherPrice keyboard to create the intense 'dramatic' musical accompaniment, it's the most god awful cheesy synth rubbish I have ever heard on any film, in fact it's the worst thing I have heard full stop and it blows any sense of suspense that could have been created. The denial induced fantasy world idea has been done before in a much deeper and emotional (more straight forward) manner by films like Jacob's Ladder. This just lacks any sort of emotional depth or development and the story is flaky at best, the characters are pretty inconsequential in respect to everything else that is going on and it's hard to feel anything for them, in fact I would have been quite happy if they had all endured slow painful deaths. The lesbian element ended up feeling rather contrived and a little trashy, though it did create a rare moment of interest amongst the myriad of silly imagery (the mutilated tramp thing made me laugh my socks off) and side plots. The whole film felt rather pointless, the lack of a solid plot and lack of character development just made me feel utterly apathetic. It lacked any real direction, like Lynch didn't quite know what he wanted to achieve or get across so he created this oblique, meandering puzzle, a charade that led to nothing of any great consequence. In the end I was quite happy the bitch died to be quite honest, and I just wanted to punch that infuriating hag with the blue hair! I felt nothing at the end, it is not a great 'open ended' conclusion at all because there was no fiber to the central story, it was a cold and empty experience not some profound journey that left me reflecting on the human condition, because this film lacked humanity and provided something entirely unsatisfying and plastic in it's place. Lynch has talent but it is certainly not in the field of screen writing, he couldn't write a decent story even if his life depended on it. If you liked this movie I suggest you watch something worthwhile then reassess your view of what makes a good movie.",Mulholland Drive
532,1negevoli,Visually beautiful and well-acted film with a couple of minor flaws,7,23 August 2006,"Well, I saw this movie three nights ago and it is still ""with"" me, so that says a lot. I think it is a beautiful, fascinating and evocative film, and good films about Hollywood and the movie biz are few and far between. I love good movies set in Hollywood -- my personal all-time favorite is ""Into the Night"" with Michelle Pfeiffer (when she was very young and really beautiful and not so affected) and Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager. As for David Lynch, I loved Twin Peaks and am still ticked off that it was canceled, all these years later. I didn't like Blue Velvet so much, though. So I guess that makes me objective.After reading the lengthy plot summary here on IMDb immediately after seeing the film, I immediately got a handle on the movie's intricate structure and therefore did not have to wrangle with it until I came to a similar conclusion. Actually, my only complaint with Lynch is the blue box and key and the really tiny little people. Totally ludicrous and unnecessary. If there had been NO blue box, no blue key, and no really tiny little people, I think the movie would have been better. Much better. And no damage would have been done whatsoever. These particular elements added nothing but a touch of the ridiculous to what otherwise would have been a much better piece of work. We, the audience, would have caught on that the blonde lady was nutsy coo-coo without those ridiculous elements. Somebody needs to reign Lynch in a bit, for his own good.",Mulholland Drive

534,seventh_samurai54,A masterpiece.,10,14 November 2002,"David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. is a brilliant masterpiece, and his greatest work to date. Lynch skillfully blends dreams, nightmares, memories and flashbacks with reality to create a strange and twisted film-noir. The story seems to be a simple murder mystery on the surface, but in the hands of Lynch, nothing is done simply. Watch this film, and don't just put it off as a twisted movie that makes no sense.

Because it's out of the ordinary, it's different.  You can never know what to expect.  I doubt that anyone could predict the cowboy in the film, it came out of nowhere, that's why I love it.

537,mppullar,"Unconventional, but all the better for it",10,2 February 2002,"David Lynch is no conventional director. Having only previously seen the brilliant yet relatively normal ""Elephant Man"", I had not personally experienced this, but knew it only too well, and was thoroughly expecting ""Mulholland Drive"" to be a shameless romp within the realms of surrealism, obscurity and plain weirdness. In fact, that was predominantly why I was going to see it.It seems impossible to review ""Mulholland Drive"" without using the words ""strange"" or ""obscure"", perhaps because, although apparently not David Lynch's least accessible effort, this is far from a conventional thriller. Indeed, Lynch's completely unique style of direction makes even the word ""thriller"" seem inadequate, which can be seen in the way moments of extreme terror are interspersed with absurdist humour. One of the primary strengths of ""Mulholland Drive"" is its effortless ability to go against all film stereotypes - highly appropriate in a film which is at least in part a criticism of the commercialist destruction of art within the ranks of Tinseltown. Naomi Watts' portrayal of the overawed and naive Betty arriving in Hollywood emphasises this every bit as much as the disillusionment of Theroux's Adam and the destructive wheeling-and-dealing that appears on the screen. Yet Lynch's heartbreaking deconstruction of humanity cannot be grasped even slightly until the film's conclusion, and even then its intricate patchwork of betrayal, seduction and misery leaves more food for thought than answers to the thousands of questions it poses.Naomi Watts' performance is a breathtaking experience, with Lynch's alienating yet rewarding direction allowing for a perfect showcase of the Australian actress's stunning versatility. ""Mulholland Drive"" is not an experience for the faint-hearted. It requires thought. It probably even requires multiple viewings. Yet it will take you places you may never go again, yet will be all the wiser and more fulfilled for being taken to by such a unique and undoubted auteur. A thoroughly deserved perfect score goes to ""Mulholland Drive"".",Mulholland Drive

Even though the film is terribly confusing and disjointed, it has to go down as an all time great for the sheer bravado and daring of Mr. Lynch in daring to pronounce it complete as is, and having the self-belief to accept the inevitable mixed reviews and criticism.The acting was first rate, and, although the film is long and slow paced, it still leaves you thirsting for more. various parts still confuse me. First, what is the dreamy attendance at the ""Silencio Theatre"" all about? Second, who is the dead woman in the swapped apartment. Is it a chance resemblance with the heroine? Third, why are the elderly couple from the airport screaming at the heroine? Fourt, what is the significance of the adultery scene? And so on and on.

All that gives the film requires analysis ; to grasp the logic of the film a personal interpretation of each character is needed, of course the plot has coherence, is a matter of keeping track of each track you will loose the director. Example: Betty is a talented actress, Rita is a Femme Fatale, Diane is a frustrated woman, Adam is an arrogant filmmaker; the film offers a sinister style, the characters move in a dark room, only the romance provides clarity and relief for the two female protagonists; there are secondary characters who bully briefly and then disappear, the main characters convey emotions and feelings, and betray some are shattered emotionally.Mulholland Drive is a perfect game on alternate realities, and also about the culture of Hollywood.",Mulholland Drive

I saw ""Eraserhead"" back in the 70's when I was in art school, and felt compelled to praise it. After all, art is supposed to be weird, right? I was still willing to give Mulholland Drove a chance, as I love movies with suspenseful, twisted plots that reveal dark parts of the psyche (Vertigo is one of my favorite films.) I was totally irritated by the end of this movie. It seemed to be specifically crafted to set off a train of speculation and to intimidate the viewar into thinking ""it must be a work of genius because I don't understand it.""

Each person that posted their little ""This makes no sense"" rant, please stop reading this post right now because it will make you think too hard and God forbid you do that!The key (no pun intended) to this film is to understand the concept that Naomi Watts dreamt the entire opening half of the film. In a desperate attempt to ""escape"" a reality where she is rejected by her one love who she has killed, she created this 'pseudo-reality' that allowed her to cope with the loss of her girlfriend. From the horrible events that befall Adam to the exaggerated innocence of Betty, she invented the perfect world for herself...then woke to the realization that she had her former love killed.This is not a difficult concept to grasp, nor is the obvious references to dreaming that you are given throughout the film. Including but not limited to the freakish grins on the faces of those that dropped her off at the airport, the waitress in Winkies that served Betty and Rita who happened to also be portrayed by Naomi Watts and the glorified representation of a ""key"" throughout the first half of the film...To anyone who cannot see the brilliance of this film, be it Adams reaction when he notices his wife is not by the pool, the portrayal of ""The Man"" who pulls all of the strings or the incredible acting on the part of Watts, I pity you.

It will bend every expectation, trope, and stereotype you've ever seen on film. That's all I can really say. You'll contrive your own meanings from it. I think Lynch knows this too. He has this fascination with human curiosity and his pure genius comes from the fact that he can create a mystery film that ends with more mystery than it began with.

Mulholland Drive easily takes the cake given how the plot is structured. From a general standpoint, no other film has left such a lasting impact on me like Mulholland Drive; it's dreamlike story which also boasts some unique horror elements have not left my mind since I've watched it and probably won't ever do so, which I'm not entirely opposed to.Lynchian visuals are always going to be one of the highlights of any Lynch film. In this case, the way light bounces off figures in certain long takes/sequences along with the ambient music masterfully composed by Angelo Badalamenti created a very dreamlike atmosphere. Almost whimsical in a way, but definitely foreboding in other aspects. Speaking of dreams, its just so impressive how David Lynch is able to completely blur the line between dreams and reality in this movie. For a fair portion of the film we're given fragments of a story then led to believe and care for it up until we as the audience are taken by surprise and given another narrative. The specific plot elements Lynch chooses to flip are so unexpected and thus more appreciated as well. However much we accept or reject the ""new"" reality is ultimately up to us but in the end, Lynch's message is a bit more clear. A film director who has a very specific idea for a story and sticks to it all the way through is deserving of all the praise they can get, especially when done in a successful fashion such as Mulholland Drive.The two biggest schools of thought about films are that they should either be politically and/or socially significant in its portrayal of certain relevant ideas or that films should depict a ""magical"" world that the viewer can immerse themselves into for a while and think on the experience afterwards. I didn't watch Mulholland Drive much more than I felt it. It's hard to contextualize my ideas because not only do I have almost no idea about what I'm saying, Lynch seems to favor the style of film making that's aimed towards making the audience feel things upon losing themselves in Lynch's world. From him using cinema to dig into the audience's psyche, I'm not surprised that some people can dislike this movie just as others, myself included, will absolutely love it and the idea of it.",Mulholland Drive

548,corn-6,10/10 (Warning: Contains Spoilers. Please be warned!!!),10,10 February 2002,"This film is basically the story of a disturbed actress, Diane, who has been jilted by Hollywood and her girlfriend, Camilla.  The first part of the film consists of Diane's dream/hallucination of her alter identity, Betty, who embodies her initial naivete and hope as a young actress coming to Hollywood to find her dream.    In Diane's dream, Betty/Diane meets this mysterious woman, Rita, who symbolizes her girlfriend, Camilla,  and upon finding that the woman has amnesia, decides to help her find herself (symbolic of the feeling that Diane has that Camilla must not really know who she is if she is leaving their relationship for a man).  Throughout the first part of the movie, we follow the two women trying to solve the mystery of sexual/psychological identity which culminates in their sexual joining/completion of self.  After an evening at a nightclub where the MC explains how things may not be as they seem, Diane's dream begins to unravel, much the same as a dream unravels, when the dreamer becomes aware that he or she is dreaming.    In her waking, however, her psychosis still remains (just as in the beginning of the film when Rita says that she had hoped that sleep would cure her insomnia).  At this point, we realize that Betty no longer exists, and that Diane is the Hollywood jilted and jaded remains of that wide-eyed girl.  In reality, Camilla/Rita has left Diane/Betty for a director of the film in which Diane had desperately wanted to be cast. Instead, Camilla got the role, causing a rift between the two women. Diane's waking world is delusional and paranoid.  Eventually, she is driven to have Camilla/Rita murdered (the scene where the murder plan takes place is a place where a monster broods in the dumpster, perhaps the monster is Diane).            Diane's world is filled with guilt, anger, and jealous torment, which splits her identity and reality into slivers of a mirror so shattered, she is unable to see where she begins and Betty/Camilla/Rita end.    A great film, expertly directed, with performances that are precise and confident.  The two leads are completely in sync with Lynch's vision and know exactly where the twists and turns lead.  Naomi Watts displays such diversity and confidence in the role of Diane/Betty that one can't help being intrigued and attracted to her.  She is PURE GOLD.  This is a movie not to be missed, and a second viewing probably improves its flavor. Mulholland Drive is an exhilarating journey down the treacherous roads of Hollywood.",Mulholland Drive

There is so much imagination, texture, and diversity that appeals to every sense that there is no need for understanding.

552,crawl-1,"David Lynch's last ""gotcha""",1,11 May 2002,"I was a Twin Peaks fan. I thought the whole idea of wierdness in a small town was unique. Slowly, Lynch ruined a really good idea with self-indulgence. I swore I would never go back to his stuff. I saw M. Drive and rented it. Now I want my money back. Yes, I must be one of those ""logic"" freaks who wants a story. Apparently you can put together a series of wierd scenes and call it a movie. They already did that. 30 miles from where I live they filmed ""The Giant Spider Invasion"". That was wierd scenes put together, too. It made me laugh. This didn't. David Lynch is a master of visuals. No doubt. But when you tell a story, apparently his rules say you can tell a story for MORE THAN TWO HOURS and then say, ""Oops, I guess I didn't have anything to say"" and walk away. The photography, even on video, was outstanding. The two female leads are incredibly beautiful. I will leave it there. I also must admit the love scenes are memorable. This is along the line of ""Natural Born Killers"" but Oliver Stone's movie is much better, storywise. Rent this if you want to have one of those on-going college-style discussions that lead to nowhere, which is what this movie, from my view, is all about.",Mulholland Drive

The only people who seemed to like this movie sneer at the others as if ""they"" weren't capable of seeing the deep ""insight"" Lynch has. What David Lynch is is a cinematic con man. Disneyland on a large screen. He beautifully photographs a bunch of images and tries to deceive you into thinking there's a story there. To all of you who loved the movie and thought the rest of us dumb, please explain the plot to all of us unenlightened ones and how it ends. It's nice to know there's so many smart people out there in a world where art is in the eye of the beholder.

Rather than make conventional, explainable ""They could have existed"" characters as in ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Lost Highway"", Lynch just does away with reality here.  I wish that he would have done so a long time ago (not that Blue Velvet or Lost Highway weren't enjoyable).  The plot makes no sense yet you follow it.  And then maybe it does make sense when you're all through.  It feels like a strange dream that you've got to tell your friend about after you wake up.  You can't help but be drawn to the intense love of Diane and Betty for Rita and Camilla.  It's erotic and will make you flinch with joy and smile with sadness.  It's so well made anyway.  Lynch deserved the Best Director Award.... too bad that he lost. In the end - how did they NOT pick this up to be a TV series?  I'm still happy with the way it turned out as a film.  Happy enough to say 10/10.  No more explaining from me, GO SEE IT!",Mulholland Drive
555,Barry_the_Baptist,"Nothing to care about in Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr.""",5,3 July 2002,"David Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr."" lacks any of the essential elements in smart film-making. Originally created to be a TV series ""Mulholland Dr."" was pieced together to be a film. Rarely can you transfer a story as complex and dreamlike as ""Mulholland Dr."" to the big screen when it was originally intended to be seen in installments. Because this film was forced on to the big screen it lacks good storytelling. Now I am not saying this film needs conventional storytelling, there are many great films without conventional story telling such as ""Memento"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". What I am saying is that the film cannot connect with its audience in anyway because of the faulty storytelling. Characters appear such as the cowboy, and then never reappear again. Characters are supposed to add to the plot or help convey a message or point that the director wants to get across. Granted, there are some brilliant moments in ""Mulholland Dr."" the sequence where we discover that Betty can actually act and the bit part by the cowboy where awesome scenes but they just dont mean anything in the end. In fact the entire film and its message is lost and wrapped up for the sake of being artsy. The people who 'love' this film almost undoubtebly dont understand it. They praise the film simply to appear as film connoisseurs and high-brow intellectuals. This film is artsy and unconventional for the sake of being artsy and unconventional not because it has a message we can identify with or some great new way of story telling. It was a bungled TV series that Lynch tried to save by throwing it on the big screen. Not worth the time invested in it: 3 out of 10.",Mulholland Drive
556,RichardBJ-1,"All atmosphere, no actual plot",3,29 May 2017,"The first half 90 minutes or so of this movie, I loved... the intrigue and atmosphere are terrific. . . Then I started to realise that the various movie threads were not going to link up. And they don't. There was no plot; it is just a series of very artistic and atmospheric scenes without any attempt to tie them up. You can convince yourself that it is pure art, like the Tracy Enim ""Unmade Bed"", but this is not my idea of a movie. I guess it was critically and financially successful; the reviews are rave, but I feel a bit sad for a director who can do all that, but is just not quite clever enough to think of a plot to match. This is my spoiler-free analogy: The director seems like a concert pianist; all dressed up walking on to stage wearing a glamorous suit with long tails flowing behind him. He gracefully walks up to a 15 foot grand piano... sits down... pauses pregnantly with hands above the keys. It is all brilliant; except he can't actually play any tunes. So he sits there hands all poised for a few minutes. We all clap and he walks of again bowing prodigiously. King's new cloths once again. Go on all you 10/10 reviewers. Admit it... it was rubbish wasn't it !!! :-)",Mulholland Drive
557,invaderJim,A beautiful work of art that fails to be a movie,6,28 August 2015,"The problem with Mulholland Drive is that if you try to say it's a bad movie, anyone can simply fall back on the classic ""You just didn't understand it"". I finally brought myself to watch it for a second time, and I still don't see the merit. And let me make it clear, to the extent that anyone CAN understand this movie, I do. But for one thing, David Lynch's make-it-up-as-you-go style always leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Don't get me wrong, I like a movie that leaves some things up to the imagination or open to interpretation. But there has to be something concrete underneath it all. For instance, as difficult as it may be to grasp, there is a distinct sequence of events that Luis Bunuel wants to depict in L'Age d'Or; and distinct ideas he wants to invoke. This is why his work is satisfying even to those who don't fully understand it, whereas with Lynch's films, even if you do understand it you're left feeling unsatisfied, as if something was left unfinished. And more than anything, this is an unfinished work: a television show that was dismissed and forced into the constraints of the feature film. Characters left undeveloped. Plot lines left unresolved. Ends left loose. It is an entrancing movie, credit where credit is due. There's nothing stale about it. There's purpose behind each shot (however undefined), and the shots themselves are beautiful. I've given it a six, and for artistic reasons I'd like to give it more. But a movie can't just be art, it still has to be a movie. And in that regard, this one just barely fails.",Mulholland Drive
558,Trelloskilos,It couldn't have been more perfect! *May include some spoilers*,10,9 August 2006,"What an amazing achievement! The film just oozes class, atmosphere, sensuality and layers and layers of intrigue. It's one thing to make a film like this, and make it really work, but it's another to salvage a project that was intended to follow in the footsteps of ""Twin Peaks"" and create something like this.From an initial viewing with a casual eye, the film looks like it is about Betty, a plucky young actress, who befriends 'Rita', a mysterious woman with amnesia, who seems to have a dark and mysterious background. For a large part of the film, the two women help Betty to achieve success after success in Tinseltown, while Betty helps 'Rita' to try to find out who she really is. During the main storyline, there are several seemingly unconnected scenes elsewhere involving a movie director who sees his wife cheating on him, a strange dwarf in a wheelchair pulling some very major strings, and a scene in which a guy confides a dream to his psychiatrist, then discovers something horrific.Then, just as the audience is lulled by the viewer-friendly and (mostly) generic progress of the film, the whole movie gets tilted on its axis, and it becomes very strange. The actors are all different, with different roles. The cutesy Betty becomes the down-and-out Diane. Rita's helpless damsel-in-distress character changes to a manipulative femme fatale. Major players become minor roles and vice versa. Things get surreal, confused and jumbled, and the movie plays out to a devastating finale, guaranteed to leave most audience members thinking ""What just happened?"" Now, here's the genius of David Lynch. He has done exactly the same trick as his other film, ""Lost Highway"". The audience is not watching a film in the conventional sense. For the majority of the film, they are watching a dream, and the final third, are watching a series of guilt-ridden flashbacks and confused recollections, all in the mind's eye of a desperate and deluded woman, who'se jealousy and disillusionment have driven her to commit a desperate act. ""Mulholland Drive"" is the nearest one could possibly get to sticking a film reel in someone's mind, recording their thoughts, dreams and memories, then playing the whole thing back on screen. There are clues there in the film, and viewed in the right perspective, the entire film really does make perfect sense. It just takes a shift in perception to see the whole thing, a bit like focusing on a jumble of dots and being able to see a 3D image.""Mulholland Drive"" is as much a visual and aural delight as it is an ingenious movie taken from a unique perspective. The film is full of 'Lynchisms' that any fan will instantly recognize and associate with his other films. Satin draped curtains, singers miming Roy Orbison songs, vintage '50's Americana, mysterious dwarfs and an atmosphere that is so thick, it's tangible even in scenes where not much is happening. (Full credit to Angelo Badlamenti) The sets are stylish, and the acting incredibly polished (Naomi Watts deserves particular mention, being able to turn out a character that goes from 'Brady Bunch meets Nancy Drew' right through the spectrum).Even if a viewer walked away from the film without understanding it (and no doubt, there will have been a fair few), they are still treated to some amazing cinema, and some very memorable scenes. Very few people who watch the film will forget the 'Club Silencio' scene, and even people who probably hated the film must admit, albeit grudgingly, that the scene is one that's difficult to shake from memory.Final comments. The film is a challenging film to watch (and all the better for it, in my opinion). It probably has a fairly even division of people who love it and people who hate it, and I can understand there would be some frustration from people who see the film without fully grasping what is going on, but for me, the film is everything I would truly expect from a movie. Something that actually switches my brain on instead of turning it off, and having a very distinct and unique style and flavour that very few directors are ever capable of achieving.",Mulholland Drive
559,Juggertrout,Lynch at his best,10,8 January 2005,"David Lynch is a master of dark, surreal films and this is no exception. It is his best work for ages and a good film to get into Lynch.After a bizarre car crash, a young woman is left with amnesia, she befriends an aspiring actress coming to LA to work and together try and solve the mystery surrounding just who she is. Meanwhile, a famous movie director's new film is seemingly taken over by a bunch of macabre producers, with a mysterious way of working. Also we see the story of a hit man and a young man and his psychiatrist in a diner.But what do these stories have in common? Well if you head isn't doing cartwheels in the first 20 minutes then you're watching the wrong film. Just when you think the solution is about to emerge, Lynch destroys any notions you had of what you may have thought had happened by more or less turning the story upside down into something much more...realistic, let's say.It's unlikely you'll understand this the first time round, especially if you're not used to Lynch's bizarre symbolism tricks. There is an answer, but most people prefer to admire it for it's beauty, the directing is wonderful, and the two female leads are brilliant, so there's a lot to show for.Mulholland Drive is a dark, confusing yet beautiful film. I highly recommend it to anyone.",Mulholland Drive
560,Patuquitos,Loose ends vs. hypnotic images (as usual),7,13 January 2005,"And who's winning the big prize? It's hard to tell. Every Lynch film has to be evaluated this way, I think. On one hand, you've got the surreal and beautiful happenings, and on the other, all the nonsense. You put it in the scales, and usually the first outweighs the second. By far.This is the first time I found myself doubting about it, because the mind toying was just way too much. The last minutes felt like a rehash of 'Lost Highway', but even more hallucinatory and illogic, and condensed in much less time. The fact that the crazy part started just when the story was getting REALLY interesting was a pain too. They were all noticeable symptoms of what everybody knows: Mulholland Drive was meant to be a TV series, in the same vein of ""Twin Peaks"". So the first half of this movie is, basically, a pilot (introduction of characters, some action, a bit of thriller, humor...) with a zillion of loose ends, and the rest, a milk shake of undeveloped ideas. Creepy and fascinating, but too much incoherent even for Lynch.The main reason this movie is, despite of all, a winner, is that Lynch has outdone himself this time. First, there are four or five shots in this movie which I can describe simply as unforgettable. Second, we are introduced to hilarious characters (the cowboy, for example) who are worth the movie alone. Third, we are presented with a few sequences in which Lynch shows a great sense of humor. And fourth, Badalamenti is still at top form.So, yes, he has done it again. But the margin is getting narrow. I'm really looking forward his next movie, because I have no idea which path will Lynch take. I'm already waiting.RATING: 7.4",Mulholland Drive

Like a dream, it makes almost no sense in the hindsight.

It has a bit of the dream-like quality that was all through Eraserhead.My one complaint has more to with the initial promotion of the film.  Right from the beginning I had been hearing about the girl/girl sex scenes.

When you see films like this it only reinforces the idea of the wonder of this medium. At times you think you are going 'loopy' as the story wraps around like a Moebius strip, but Lynch's style carries you through even the most surreal parts. This film has style and atmosphere in spades not to mention the cast of eccentric characters. I was half expecting a bit of tap from Ann Miller but we got jive instead. The two leads are excellent and their chemistry is amongst the most erotic I've seen on the screen. Was the Blue Box going to reveal a 'Kiss Me Deadly' secret or was it just made by McGuffin. It's not a story for the linear mind and you will find yourself thinking about it for hours (and who knows, maybe days) later, that is, if you've managed to shift 'Memento' !

572,bengreenb,Oneiric,7,31 July 2007,"Mulholland Dr is the best modern portrayal I have seen of the oneiric, film noir aesthetic. Oneiric means dreamlike, and it is the most appropriate word for describing this film, in which the viewer can barely tell if they're watching someone's dream, real life, or a movie about a movie, or perhaps some alternate universe. An unlimited plethora of theories abound as to what is actually going on throughout this confusing and engaging movie. It is a Rorschach test, a beautiful ink blot without a label. And that adds to its enjoyability, making me want to watch it again.The film is filled with surreal, repetitious motifs, lesbian eroticism, and intriguing symbolism. Watch it, but don't expect to make any sense out of it. To quote Ebert's review: ""This is a movie to surrender yourself to. If you require logic, see something else. ""Mulholland Drive"" works directly on the emotions, like music.""This will always be a cult classic, but it will never be a classic. I gave it a 7 out of 10 because a higher score would require that it had a coherent plot and meaning. Symbolism and cool aesthetics are interesting, fun, and artistic, but the plot is what makes a true classic.",Mulholland Drive
573,Kalifire,"Doctor? Yes, I need whatever Lynch is on please...",10,23 March 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *** SPOILERS BELOW : DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM ***I've just spent the last three hours watching Mulholland Drive. Well, I say three hours... what I really mean is two and a bit - the rest of the time I sat there trying to work out what has just happened.I was, to this point, unfamiliar with Lynch's work. I have seen the odd episode of 'Twin Peaks' but it seemed very complicated and to be honest I couldn't be arsed sitting down and watching something that required me to think. I was also turned off by the Lynchians who praise the work of their messiah often on what seems to be the basis that ""it didn't make sense"". Well, if something doesn't make sense it's not good by default - it's senseless. It's only good if you can piece it together yourself.
So was I able to piece together this movie? No. I had a good go and I'm sure the answers will come in repeat viewings and as I mull it all over in the days to come, but as the credits rolled, I just thought ""erm.... right...""
It's a common misconception that David Lynch works in a number of different levels. He doesn't appear to. I got the impression he works on one level that is interpreted in many different ways. It's the 'Lynch level' and you either love it or hate it. I think I love it. Time will tell.
I've read several of these interpretations now (though thankfully none before I saw the feature) and I simply don't buy the ""she was dreaming"" scenario. I don't believe a man who created a work as complex and deep as this would throw it away with the 'dream' routine. I think the deaths of both main characters are the key to understanding the hidden depths of what happens...It's plain that the first couple of hours aren't real, or at least they're not real as we know real. They are both a swipe at the idelisation of Hollywood and (as commonly interpreted) either a masturbatory fantasy dreamt up by a self-delusional suicidal poor actress, or a dream. The swipe at Hollywood I can go with, but the dream? Give Lynch more credit, guys. Are you really suggesting that the 'monster', the 'cowboy', the 'blue box' etc etc are all 'dream elemenets' that you can ultimately ignore? Why? Because you can't work it out?It's my contention that the first part of the movie is taking place after the suicide we see at the end of the movie. The old people on the plane are spirits who transport her to the afterlife. Think about it - they collect her at the point of her suicide and we see them wishing Diane (now the self-created - or maybe subconciously created 'Betty') good luck as they depart from the airport (the arrival place for new souls?) Rather then a dream, the soul of Diane, as is common with literature and studies into suicidal afterlife theories, is post-physically recreating her life as she would like to have seen it, as per standard theories on Mulholland Drive. She is angry and frustrated that the director character (in real life) got involved with her lover, and the cowboy (along with the people looking for him) are extentions of herself - acting the fantasy she wished she could have....There's a fuller (and rather lengthy) explanation of all this on the 'Aint It Cool' forum for this film and it's well worth a read. Right now I'm off to ponder some more but I'll sure be watching it many times to come and I can tell it will be one of those that get better everytime you see it.

If you have, there's a good chance it's Mulholland Drive, and your perspective on whether that's a good thing or not really depends on what qualities you appreciate in your movies.For me, it's definitely a good thing, even if it frustrates from time to time. David Lynch, who is reknowned for creating dizzyingly complex, seductive pieces of film, doesn't disappoint here, as aspiring actresses (Naomi Watts as the sweet, rather naive Betty Elms), quirky relatives (Maya Bond as Aunt Ruth), curious directors, mysterious neighbours and one captivating, seductive amnesiac (Laura Elena Harring as Rita) are swept together in a complex, rich tapestry that paints a very dark picture of the film industry.Lynch does love to play with the mind, too. Every single time things seem to be coming together and making sense, an unforseen twist leaves the viewer scratching their head again. Not a bad scratching, mind you, but part of why I'm not saying more of what the film was about is because I still don't fully grasp it. I know I'm getting closer, but for me, as for many of you who have seen this filmic enigma, Mulholland Drive will always remain a mystery.

This same belief has in many ways been associated with Mulholland Drive his 2001 film that was greeted with both critical and commercial success, but a sort of stigma has been attached to Mulholland Drive that I feel is absolutely needless and discredits Lynch's masterpiece as something incomprehensible, which it certainly isn't.The films I appreciate the most are movies which at surface value, seem like a certain thing, but if you really want to and care enough to dig in and investigate the picture you will find that the film means a completely different thing. So in the case of Mulholland Drive, the story seems pretty simple on surface level. An actress dreams about living a Hollywood fantasy with her lover who she hired in the real world to be murdered only to wake up out of her delusion and see the real world.Which, no doubt, is exactly what the film is about, on surface level. But if you look deeper you will find what the film is really about, the struggles of female actors in a Hollywood system that doesn't value them. A system that treats them like objects, tools to look over, only there to look at and forget as time goes on. This is seen with Diane (Naomi Watts) who has made it to the top of Hollywood through sexual favours and espionage. So of course, in Diane's dream, she's the all-too lucky, super talented, Hollywood actress who has a famous Aunt and an apartment. Everyone adores her, everyone appreciates her, she's living the Hollywood dream.But her dream is flawed, just like Dianne herself, even when still inside her own dream does Dianne deludes herself and hide away from the truth. This can best be seen with, Camilla Rhodes (Laura Harring) who in Diane's dream takes the name Rita after famous old Hollywood actress Rita Hayworth. The Hollywood press coined the term ""The Love Goddess"" to describe Hayworth after she had become the most glamorous screen idol of the 1940s. Camilla in real life is the shining example of the casting couch actress. She will do whatever it takes to stay on top, whether it's leading on Dianne and faking a love with her or sleeping with the famous film director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux), kind of like the real Rita Hayworth who is also famous for being married to 5 film directors including the great Orson Wells. In the real world, after being infuriated seeing Camilla with Adam, Dianne orders a hit to kill Chamila and we follow Dianne's dream after the night she ordered the hit for most of the film. So of course in Dianne's dream, ""Rita"" is the helpless woman in trouble, so Dianne can swoop in and be the hero and as Dianne starts waking up to reality her dream begins to crack until Camilla is just as she appears in the real world.Dianne also imagines Camilla Rhodes' new lover Adam Kesher as the pathetic Hollywood director who's life is falling apart and only really cares about money. But, this couldn't be further from the truth as seen at the end of the film. Adam is living the life, he's at the top of the Hollywood Hills with the Cowboy (Monty Montgomery) and Camilla. He's making films and living the real Hollywood dream. Contrastly, Dianne is, if not more, broken than Adam's dream counterpart. She's struggling with lovers, she can't get work unless she sucks up to the system and she believes she is most definitely past her prime, she will be forgotten and like Adam's dream counterpart, she's terrified of that. So Dianne has embued the things she hates most about herself into the man she hates the most.Mulholland Drive has incredibly similar elements to Lynch's other works, particularly Twin Peaks and it's follow-up film Fire Walk With Me and the third season of Twin Peaks (Twin Peaks: The Return) has several creative similarities with Mulholland Drive. The main similarity between these two pieces of media is that both have an incredibly dream-like persona over them both. I think the line that is most fitting to describe Mulholland Drive is actually found in a Log Lady intro for Twin Peaks Season 2 Episode 1 'May The Giant Be With You'.""Why are some things kept from our vision? Is life a puzzle? I am filled with questions. Sometimes my questions are answered. In my heart, I can tell if the answer is correct. I am my own judge. In a dream, are all the characters really you? Different aspects of you? Do answers come in dreams?""
With that quote, I am going to end this review. Mulholland Drive is one of my favourite films of all time and the more I think about it the more I absolutely adore its many little nuances and ideas. David Lynch is indeed an artist and the rumours of a future Lynch project in the future better be true because I want the luxury of seeing a David Lynch film in a theatre for the first time.",Mulholland Drive

579,joebofet,~,10,19 March 2002,"This is my favorite film of 2001.  In case you're a David Lynch fan and wondering, Mulholland Drive is the polar opposite of Lost Highway:  It's entertaining, the characters are interesting, casting was excellent, and on and on.  In my opinion, it deserved a nomination for best picture, but hey, Being John Malkovich, Magnolia, Memento, and Wonder Boys were also snubbed by the Academy, so I'm not surprised.",Mulholland Drive
580,mp65steady,A Disaster!,4,17 May 2001,"David Lynch still has made more beautiful than bad films, but his batting average is dropping dramatically. With ""Mulholland Drive"" he has managed to shoot a clunker that's so bad, you can't even have fun mocking its badness. Lynch was never great in storytelling, but his films had a compelling, addictive quality to them. It's not that there's no recognizable logic in the plot of a young actress coming to Hollywood and being put in the middle of a strange case of mistaken identities - it's that you never fall into the surreal, dreamlike atmosphere ""Blue Velvet"", ""Wild at Heart"", ""Eraserhead"", even ""Dune"" and ""Lost Highway"" had. Even more shocking is the horrible acting, pacing and lighting of the film, which give ""MD"" an amateurish look and feel. There's one scene, in which a supposedly professional criminal messes up a job. First of all he takes too long to get rid of his principal victim - who therefore has time enough to give what is quite probably the worst performance you've ever seen in a film by a respected director. Then the killer has to get rid of two bystanders, and the quality of the jokes is up there at the level of ""Police Academy 7"". Thanks a lot, indeed.In comparison to ""Mulholland Drive"" Lynch's dumb movie version of ""Twin Peaks"" seems like a masterpiece. That's how bad ""MD"" is.Why can't we give 0 points out of 10?",Mulholland Drive
581,tezzzaaa,lynch makes a collage of his previous work,6,12 July 2002,"Don't get me wrong, I am a great admirer of Lynch's work.  Not just his beautifully strange haunting films, but his painting and photography as well.  I have seen Lost Highway at least five times and it still intrigues me.  I think Eraserhead is one of the scariest cult horrors I have seen. The calming beauty of Straight Story couldn't have been captured by anyone else but Lynch.  The image of Bob from Twin Peaks can stil make me shiver thinking about it... but... Mulholland Drive didn't do those things for me.I think it is Lynch's most overrated work so far.  When these other films came out people were probably not ready for them yet.  When Mulholland Drive came out, I guess they were, so it was hauled by the press and audience as something they had never seen before.  And this is exactly where I think the film gets stuck!I almost feel bad giving this critical review, but I feel by doing this I am actually doing credit to the genius of Lynch's mind.  Although I'm not sure if the man himself would agree!  I think Lynch could do better. Let me start by saying that I did enjoy the film.  The atmosphere was still beautiful dreamy like.  It did miss the nightmarish dimension of Lost Highway though. Maybe cuz Betty, even when she turns darker, was so annoyingly nice and sweet.  There was a fair amount of your regular dry humor and some of the characters managed to give me the creeps for a moment, be it that they never had a deeper function.The plot itself soon lost my interest.  Maybe cuz I already knew the trick not to look for a binding thread too much.  You know with Lost Highway I still look for a missing piece of the puzzle, but in Mulholland Drive there are so many missing pieces you soon give up. Maybe it's not fair that I'm comparing this film to Lost Highway so much, but what can you expect when even the music, pretty decisive in creating the atmosphere, was identical at times. Then there was the dwarf we know from Twin Peaks.  Didn't Lynch have any new ideas of creating some other crazily disturbing characters?  As if he put them in for people unfamiliar with his work.  Or is Mulholland Drive an ode, a collage, to what he did before.  An ode out of the mind of some disturbed girl with a multiple personality syndrome?We know Lynch has a very typical way of handling the camera, which was one of the reasons to make a film with such a common story as The Straight Story still so beautiful and strange.  The camerawork of Mulholland Drive was too identical to Lost Highway though, but not as effective.  I didn't get any goosebumps.  I just felt dreamily entertained for two and a half hours.The love scenes between Rita and Betty were nice and seemed sincere.  Their relationship as a whole was convincing. That's were I liked the twist in the plot.  But then a lot of the rest seemed kind of useless entourage.  I don't know but Mulholland Drive really disappointed me coming out of this brilliant mind, I'm sorry to say...",Mulholland Drive
582,djtranny,This review is in the top 250 reviews of all time,1,15 January 2019,"Well, why not just dab, this is considered a cinematic masterpiece movie. Smart? It is a movie that I also watched before I knew it existed as I watched it in my dreams. How smart the director must be to have thought this puzzle that people believe is not boring. Is it good? Will it be an inspiration within what cannot be seen?Don't get my review? Oh that's because you're not smart enough to make the connections. Let me explain and then you will surely believe that this is the greatest review of all time:
Take the 6th word of my review, then the 12th word, then the 7th word, then the 3rd word, then the 13th word, then the 14th word, then the 7th word, then take the 5th word and reverse it. What do you get? Oh I'll spell it out for you: THIS MOVIE IS NOT SMART. IT IS BAD.",Mulholland Drive
583,k_28,And it makes perfect sense as a Love Story Or as Last Dream of Broken Soul !!,10,13 July 2015,"Like everybody else i didn't understand he movie when i saw it first time...and i wasn't sure what it really meant. But there was something else that mattered more to me than literal meaning what the film is about . And it was that experience...it was scary..surreal ...dreamlike ...n haunting...like having a lucid dream..you cant get this feeling out of your head even after you finished watching it. And that's pure cinema ...its about affecting people at deepest corner of their emotional core...at their desires n subconscious mind something with they themselves can not explain or articulate but still feel it and feel it very intensely. This movie was was like that..expressly effective though i must say i found it scary first time around. I normally never find any ""ghost movies"" or ""gory movies"" scary ; what really scares me psycho thrillers ..and this was perhaps best psycho thriller since ""The shining"".But when i saw the movie second time my views were changed. The scariness was gone and you feel like watching a tragic love story. The sweetest love story of young girl filled with innocence and dreams in her who is broken in her soul...who is wants to love and be loved but instead gets cheated n hurt . Who is desperate to have a moment of happiness in her life but not sure is she will ever get it. Thats as tragic as it can get but just like eerie and surreal atmosphere affects you ..the sad tragedy of her life (which is using ""Hollywood "" as atmosphere here) affects you. At some level it is story of all of us ...big dreams shattered by harsh realities of unknown harsh materialistic entities of ""big world""which we never really understand as its always faceless ..(represented by the mafia shown in movie as formless , shapeless , incomprehensible but still affecting everything that she did). The mafia doesn't go out to hurt Betty ...they don't even know her ...but her life , her dreams , her love is shattered as unintended or indirect consequences of their actions. Doesn't that sound familiar to our life? some random act somewhere done by someone have a far reaching impact on our life which we were not even responsible for. This is what the song ""Na He banda"" perhaps means...no one one is playing the music ...its all going on ; while we live in an illusion that we control our life , in reality we being there or not being there doesn't really matter...music goes on. We control nothing about it ..we are as helpless and inconsequential about our own life like puppets in a show. Someone somewhere else is plotting our life and we have no clue who is doing it.The second aspect of this broken soul is loss of love. She wants to love and be loved back and what hurts her is not just that she lost her love but also got betrayed and person who cheated her doesn't even care about hurting her. Its like she takes some ghoulish pleasure is rubbing her wounds by kissing others inf front of her . That is as painful as it can get for someone who loses her love. Its not just feeling of losing love but anger at oneself for being with someone who never cared about you. Who doesn't care if you are hurt but instead enjoys it, the guilt , shame , frustration , agony of being with such a person is unbearable. It makes u hate yourself ..and see yourself as not being treated a human but a toy..a sex toy at worse...used n thrown. It is that despair n pain that prompts the ultimate desire to ease suffering by freeing the broken soul from this body. And that's what she does.What would any person think of just moment before they kill themselves? That I wish I had another life..A beautiful life ...where all my dreams had come true..in a parallel universe i am happy AND satisfied !! Where person i like is so dependent on me that he/she loves me unconditionally. (and hence altered reality lover Rita who is totally in love with her) That everybody loves me for my talent. That all my dreams are withing reach ( so successful auditions) , that anyone who hurts me gets punished for their karma (so director getting beaten up, being cheated n bullied) and everyone cares about you, likes you (so all nice people meeting Betty while they r rude to Diane). The movie is about the last dream of a broken soul. Its a sweet tragedy of broken dreams n broken hearts that ultimately makes you cry since you know this can be story of any one of us.To me this movie makes perfect sense, every single shot of it as this is exactly how I would feel about the life I wished I had, had I been killing myself. First time as i saw it as a mystery but when i saw it again as love story in a dream, it made a satisfying viewing! Something which cant be captured in words but only be felt ..and be felt right at our subconscious level.",Mulholland Drive

Im still impressed by the single watch.,Mulholland Drive
586,pvsk,I dont know what the fuss is all about,5,15 November 2003,"After seeing this movie after all those rave reviews, just one thing struck me, ""Some body has to shout the king is naked"". And I dont understand why this movie is in top 250 and has got rave reviews.The movie is gripping no doubt and has a lot of unexpected turns which I totally agree (like pulp fiction), but there is nothing more to it. Naomi Watts has a great body which she shows off  in her skirt and there is a very hot rehearsal scene which she performs with a old man (Blame it on Rio!!) and there are a couple of great lesbo scenes and thats it.
Looks like nobody could understand the movie, but if you question they say dont use logic and this movie appears directly to emotions!!. Looks like an amateur shot a home video and linked all up without any logic. But all this movie is just unexpected turns,beautiful women and some hot scenes I will give a 5 for that!!!",Mulholland Drive
587,bunny_hater66,Mulholland Drive......,10,13 July 2008,"Fans of David Lynch and his twisting, odd and addictive television show Twin Peaks in particular, will love Mulholland Dr. because it captures all that series' oddness, dreamlike feel and creepiness in one film. In fact Mulholland Dr. actually started out in Lynch's mind as a TV series like Twin Peaks. But it was deemed too expensive. So Lynch gathered all of the cast and crew back together and shot the end of the surreal film. And what a movie. Beautifully shot made and almost impossible to solve. It begins with a beautiful woman 'Femme Fatale' (Laura Harring) staggering from a car wreck on Mulholland Dr., and inevitably forgetting who she is. She then makes her way to an apartment on which Betty Elms who then decides to help Harring find out who she is. The film then references another Femme fatale by the name of Rita Hayworth in Gilda. So far straightforward. Not, lynch tricks us and laughs at our idiocracy as we think it will be a simple narrative, where Betty is actually a struggling actress (with bad hygiene towards the end of the film) named Diane and her lover a star named Camilla, who is Rita. One of the joys with Mulholland Dr. is that Lynch doesn't give us all the answers. Is the first half a dream Diane is having while blasting her head off? Which story is real and which one is not? Head Scratching stuff, though Lynch has hinted that there are clues in the mise-en-scene and the narrative its self. .The accident occurs on ""Mulholland Drive,"" a windy, mountainside. Metaphorically, the road to fame is long, twisty, and dark, with danger around every corner: evidenced by the violent car wreck that begins the film. Mulholland Drive is the location of Rita's accident in the dream sequence, where as in real life the limo ride culminated in the dinner party where Camilla and Adam Kesher announced their engagement in front of Diane.Club Silencio is a very significant place and ends the dream half of the film. Like the magician says during the introduction to the strange nightclub is that everything they hear and see is an illusion and I feel that this is what affect the women so much as it is realisation time for both of them. The club is an illusion just like the Red Room in Twin Peaks. Another is the idea of the magician as the devil as he has the stereotypical look of the devil, a goatee; he also has a wand which could represent a pitchfork.The Blue Haired Woman- Diane's dream is full of images of people in 'high places.' Mr. Roque, the Castigliane Bros, the Cowboy. Throughout the dream there seems to be someone (or something) manipulating every event. Maybe she's Diane's idea of God, who can watch but not take part in human affairs, while the magician is her idea of Satan, who has more influence over people (he makes Betty shake). Considering the state of Diane's life, it makes sense that God is up in the background while Satan takes centre stage at Club SilencioLike Twin Peaks, Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart and Lost highway, the confusion, surrealness and blurred lines between dreams and reality are part of what makes the film so addictive. Some audiences may get impatient that the end doesn't resolve what has gone before, but the beauty of Lynch's luscious visuals, Angelo Badalamenti's haunting scores and the superb performances more than make up for any frustration. Interestingly Lynch casted actors who previously appeared in soaps, Laura Harring Sunset Beach, Naomi Watts and Melissa George both appearing in Home and Away. The film is superb, engrossing, annoying and dazzling film that is in my eyes Lynch's best film since Blue Velvet.",Mulholland Drive
588,krcjoey,I tried I really did....,5,13 October 2002,"I am a huge Lynch fan.  I loved Twin Peaks, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet (masterpiece), Lost Highway, and even Dune was good.  I had a hard time liking this movie.  I felt that it took way too long to develop.  They could have taken out the entire movie audition scene, the initial coffee shop scene, and the song at the Silencio and it would have still made sense.  I found myself drifting away and doing other things as I watched this movie. Lynch is a genius, but he should have kept this a TV series and developed it into another noir than releasing it as a movie.  I found myself bored. 5/10",Mulholland Drive
589,Jeff Softley,Mulholland Drive Explained,9,21 September 2002,"**SPOILERS**I finally saw David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. on DVD last night (9/15/02), and do not know what all the controversy is about regarding the plot. Really it is quite simple.First of all, it is one of Lynch's better films, after Fire Walk With Me and Wild at Heart.The real story begins in the last third of the film, when blonde Diane (Naomi Watts) wakes from the bed (remember the 'Cowboy' telling her to ""wake up now""?) and involves a story of a lesbian romance gone terribly wrong. The character of Diane is obsessively in love with an amoral brunette actress named Camilla (Rita in the earlier part of the film). Diane hires a hit man to have Camilla killed.SPOILERSThe Cowboy is like Chronos, resetting the clock so the hellish dream can be lived over and over again - hence the last third of the film actually occurs BEFORE the descent into hell of the first two-thirds of the film.The old couple are gateway demons, ushering Diane into hell for her crime, and leading her to her suicide in the 'real' part of the story.The blue box is a stand-in for Pandora's box, which the crime Diane sets into motion causes to be opened by Pandora - the evil looking bum behind the wall of the diner. Don't forget that hope was the one good thing unleashed with all the evils contained within Pandora's box, hence the hopeful tone of the dreamlike descent into hell for Diane (now Betty).All of the characters and circumstances of the first two-thirds of the film are idealized representations of what went on in Diane's life in the 'real' part of the story.The aunt is alive, helpful, concerned but still distant in the hell story. The director suffers all manner of torments in the hell story - Betty's imagination creating these torments for what he did to her (Diane) in the 'real' story - stealing her girl and humiliating her at the party. Coco, the director's mother, is the only person who is nice to Diane in the 'real' story - politely asking her questions about herself at the party while everyone else seems to ignore or be cruel to her, hence in the hell story Coco is helpful and kind - and now the apartment building manager. The hit man is a bungler and a buffoon in the hell story, a far cry from the crisp efficiency of the murderer in the 'real' story, who very quickly leaves the receipt for the murder - a conventional blue key - for Diane to find it. Rita (Camilla) is a blank: vulnerable, and even kind - the opposite of the amoral and self-serving Camilla of the 'real' story. Betty meets Rita naked, foreshadowing the lesbian relationship. The strangely shaped blue key and the black bag stuffed with money in the hell story link back to the real blue key and the money (a lesser amount) of the 'real' story ... and just when the mystery is to be solved, the blue box for the blue key found at the strange basement club where the singer dies but the song of love goes on (and the devilish MC intones that it is ""all recorded"") ... they open the box only to ... DISAPPEAR ... Cowboy appears and tells Betty/Diane to ""wake up now,"" starting the endless cycle all over again. The man in the diner who had the vision of evil behind the wall had been paying his check at the register in the diner when Diane contracted for the murder and sensed the evil unleashed, and in the hell story he is represented as a customer, sitting exactly where Diane had sat, and recounts his dream of seeing evil behind the wall behind the diner.Recap: Lesbian love story gone wrong. Spurned lover hires hitman to kill her movie star lover. Blue key found is receipt for the murder and causes her to go insane. She kills herself. Awakens in hell to relive her life over and over, but it is representational and not an exact accounting - and just as she is about to attain all that she wants - her lover, money, and a solution to the mystery of Rita ... Cowboy resets the clock to start it over again.",Mulholland Drive
590,sjl004,My opinion of the summary of events (SPOILERS),7,10 June 2004,"Betty for most of the film is very happy, cut-outs of Betty show her very happy, living life as a celebrity as she wanted to, although this ""life"" maybe a tribute to her as she couldn't be/was in her dream. We then go to back to look at her life and how she came to die. Interestingly this last sentence summarises what happens in Sunset Blvd., Lynch hammered home this point by showing said names street sign. The multiple images of her, in the opening scene indicate the many personas she possesses. Any the picture with the grandparents shows which one she is with in this dream. The funky dance scene as the opening scene shows the magic involved when someone first dies, its a little hard to adjust, this also is shown by the blurry images in the film and the morphing acts demonstrated. The music video ""Let Forever Be"" by the Chemical Brothers was made 12 months or so before Mulholland Dr. and is identical to the opening scene, its about a girl waking from a dream, to find multiple cardboard copies of herself (they come to life) and go-go dance, its trippy, like the film. The black faeces by the dog in the beginning represents the early transition by the arrival of ""Ruth"" into Betty's dream, as the black represents acclimatisation to the new arrival. Just like heaven Ruth must pass through the gates at the start of the drive, these represent the pearly gates; it's a cleaner who she walks past (whom is there no expunge previous life experiences, which explains the amnesia). The car crash is at night and involves a black car; this black theme is continued here and with Cocos hair (almost can tell its dyed). The blue box is a portal like in Donnie Darko, flashes of recollection appear and that is symbolised by the key to the box and the way to another place. It is also a reminder to leave the dream, as we are not supposed to dream forever, its like holding your breath under water - your diaphragm twitches to try and make you surface (I got a degree in Bio). The granny can represent Betty as the star whose made it, the glasses whom by her husband represent Adam and their children include the guy in Winkies (think about the store name), the cop searching for is in-fact his sister and the hairy troll thing that looks like Adam. The amnesia is also telling Betty that she cannot see herself as someone else, so its OK to dream, it also means she comes to terms with seeing herself dead on the bed, she dies in her sleep, the gun that went off is a tribute to the end of Fight Club. The time of dying is symbolised by the relatives (maybe herself) as the old people can represent life, but being white, she shouldn't be afraid, however the presence of old age in a dream is showing death, or the oncoming of it, which is why such goes into a dreamlike coma before dying.The start of the dream is her being happy, as when you are dreaming you are happy, the almost over-acting my Naomi in the first act and smiley nature of 'arriving' in a dream is the first satisfaction of sleeping, as well as the first moment the endorphins are released. Later these hormones run out, she masturbates to try and return the pleasure. The blurry image whilst this is happening represents her mind trying to urge herself back into a happier dream, the blurry images are also in the morphing between world, the 'accidental' blurring of Ruth's character represents an aurora of pleasure, a zone/portal to another dream, a new ""life"" (womb) and the realisation that Ruth is not real, as really people are not blurry, coming to terms with this, she might in fact be masturbating in her sleep, even though we see her on the couch. The different colour scheme illustrates this. In the bed Ruth was dominant, on the couch Betty was (she is on top) and the camera angle is different. The blurry image of her rubbing herself is a change of intensity in the dream and a cry out for more passion. She is trying to will herself to shift to another world or destination by the power of emotion. The ""Silenco"" man is a replica of the Master of Ceremonies in Cabaret and he controls the whole show, the dream, recall he makes her shake in her chair and the constant reminder that she's in a dream, because the sounds were not real. Just as her visions were not real. The gangsters are now the hit man, consolidated into one image, the blond hit man. The espresso and the spilling of it, means the rich nature of the dream, and spitting it shows that it gets scary, almost like a nightmare. The use of Adams car as a convertible, means just that, he can change, he can become different sway views, he is influenced by the cowboy and to pick the girl. He sees Betty at the audition, neither have seen each other, Betty leaves, she is looking for a different dream then to win, although please discuss this point as well as the cop searching.The hairy troll is showing by the guy in Winkies however we are supposed to believe that their is the reality, yet we don't have them in our reality, this is a world/dream that one of Naomi's characters have been in, yet isn't currently, this imbalance is shown by the paranoid status of some of the citizens in this world, this world (like in Revolutions) is becoming unstable and Betty might not be able to return, this explains why the name badge changes, why the troll is no longer a tramp, he might have evolved, or being corrupted by the box (like LOTR), and the breakdown in equilibrium is transmitted to other world 9(Ruth gets a headache), she undresses (black), she's in the shower, to cleanse herself for the new world and holds her head (from headache) as all is not right in other worlds. She wears the blonde wig, because she is becoming Betty, like the gangsters becoming the hit man and the combination of other events to trigger the end of this life for Betty/Ruth. The dog of Coco, do we see it much? Its dark matter produced is littering this world, anyone see any other dogs, this lack shows that they are not normally present. The affair with ""Wash Gene"" shows a change to the world that Adam is present in. He acknowledges it, realises he must then accept the girl (was it Naomi in the first image of the girl?) he is originally stubborn, but comes around, as its not his world, however in the dinner scene, it is a world where he was a greater power of influence in the hierarchy. The other avatars such as Adams wife, is another mention to trying to change, and also to stay with him. The neighbour of Betty is in actually Betty's real neighbour, but becomes the personality of Ruth to communication with her in the dream. * My post contains my opinion in a non-linear order, like the film * Scenes where there is little dialogue have other careful illustrations, and vice-versa (any film) [cheers]""this is it"" ""chew some gum your breath smells like my grandmothers feet"" THE CHASE[jump4]",Mulholland Drive
591,Suppiluliomas,What the pants was that?,8,18 January 2003,"What??? More than 15000 votes yield 8.1 out of 10??? Ranked 131 of the best 250 films ever???I am utterly shocked, loosing my faith in the IMDB audience.Lets face it: this movie is entertainment. I have seen it with a bunch of friends, and as the film went on, we had good fun, couldn't help laughing at the worst ever seen acting. We kept on taking the p***. (""Next time you'd better bring a piece of paper to draw a flowchart. Then you might have a chance to understand something."") I have a feeling that we will remember this film for a long time, as the weirdest, strangest, most incomprehensible, in one word: worst movie.Everybody here seems to admire this movie; hence, I am probably at the wrong party here. What was his name? David Lynch? He doesn't mean anything to me. However, I think that I am not hopelessly spoiled by average Hollywood flicks though. I have a strong feeling Lynch was inspired by French-Spanish movies of the 1960th (Luis Bunuel? Dali?). And yes, I enjoyed surreal movies that miss a plot, that are a series of non-linked scenes. But in contrast to Mulholland Dr, the scenes build a picture like a mosaic that one can understand. With all respect, Mulholland Dr is a pile of broken glass, worth nothing.This all was supposed to be real stuff, but ABC turned it down? I would have loved to see it shredded rather than making a movie out of it.One more question: How many magic mushrooms need to be in your soup until you appreciate this as art?It is not precicely a B movie, but the attempt to be sophisticated failed.

During at early-mid 2014, I decided myself to watch three more movies from this guy. First, being Eraserhead. Second, being The Elephant Man. And the last, being this movie. All three of them I loved. Anyways. This movie is anything that you would expect from a David Lynch movie. (Spoilers!, for those who haven't seen any of his movies): Dream sequences? Check. Same style like Lost Highway or some others? Check. Either weird or disturbing moments? Check. Anything that you can think of is there. Other than that, the acting is great, the direction is fantastic, the quality is pitch perfect, and the writing is greater than ever. But, I will say that this movie isn't for everyone. If you are not into David Lynch's style or just don't like symbolism all that much, I'll say avoid it. But for those who like David Lynch's style and want something different for the indie film genre, I'll say check it out. For me, I loved this movie a lot and it's now my favorite David Lynch movie. Score: 10/10",Mulholland Drive
593,JustineAssad,Sorrow at the heart of it,10,16 July 2015,"Years ago this movie was aired – late one night – on a local TV station. Perhaps it was the hour, perhaps it was its brilliance, but I remember sighing out an emphatic 'What the fack??' I watched it again the next day; it failed to lessen my confusion. I watched it again the next day and I found that as my confusion faded my fascination began to creep up higher and somewhere along the way my understanding and appreciation for Mulholland Drive began to settle in – an understanding and appreciation which are still growing today – almost ten years down the line. There really is no other film quite like this David Lynch masterpiece; never before has a movie gotten into my head the way this did, and never since. It's a cerebral exercise that insists on multiple viewings to be truly realised, and its complexities will never cease to inspire. We are introduced to 'Rita' (Laura Elena Harring) in the opening scenes of the film, being the lone survivor of a car crash on Mulholland Drive; she stumbles her way into town and ends up taking residence in an apartment of a woman departing on a trip. The apartment belongs to Betty's (Naomi Watts) aunt. As it unfolds we learn that 'Rita' is in fact not 'Rita' at all – she can't remember who she is, suffering amnesia from the crash. So Betty decides to help her find her true identity and as they tread along the path of discovery, they find something darker lurking in the unknown. Much more, I cannot really say, as I feel it would detract from the discovery and interpretations you – as a viewer – must make for yourself. I will, however, share what the film meant to me, and keep in mind that this is simply my opinion, what I took away from the film; whether it's 'right' or 'wrong' or something you find you can't agree with – I will afford you that. It's a story of sadness; of dreams gone wrong; of loss of trust and loss of faith – of oneself; fractured realities. I found it to be, at the heart of it, a beautifully melancholy story, and this was really something I only found with the denouement. It was then that I realised the pervasive, dark sorrow on which the film hung itself. It explores often the very tenuous divide between love and hate and how so very easily those two emotions are confused. The characters are driven by their own desperation, whether the motivation lies in selfishness or spite or heartache, and the hurt that transpires from those acts – at least in the latter part of the film, anyway. It speaks of longing for something that – deep down – you know you will never have, and through that desire you find that even the most meagre pieces of that something will satisfy, even if ultimately it leads to an even deeper state of despair. There is a scene where, one night, Harring takes Watts' hand, and I felt that to be a profound gesture; I think it's overlooked of how much trust, how much hope, can go into the taking of another's hand, and just how devastating it can be to let that hand go. It is also a movie of the darkness which I believe breathes in every one of us, and how close we really are to embracing it. And while perhaps - for the most of us – we would never consciously and wilfully act on those shadowy impulses, there is always a dark fantasy world in which we would happily play.Technically it is, of course, rather extraordinary. Lynch is a master when it comes to infusing a surreal sense of dread into his scenes; even with the bright sunshine over Los Angeles you can't really help but feeling unsettled, because inherently you know something just isn't quite right here. Add to that Badalamenti's score and what you're left sitting with is a breathing, waking nightmare you're almost thrilled to be a part of. Harring and Watts are brilliant with their dual roles and frankly, why Watts was overlooked for most of the major awards will always be something that confuses me.And lastly: Mulholland Drive also boasts what is to me, one of the finest scenes ever committed to film: Rebekah del Rio's exquisite rendition of Roy Orbison's 'Crying' ('Llorando'); this scene never fails to (literally) send shivers up and down my spine, and really epitomises the entire theme of the film: loss.",Mulholland Drive
594,kartiknnagar,Mulholland Dr - A brilliant construction of an intangible reality,9,8 December 2017,"This is the kind of movie that gets better on every rewatch. The first time I watched this movie, I was left cold and puzzled, as almost the first three quarters of the movie just consists of weird sequences, all mesmerizing to watch and brilliantly created, but with little logic or plot, with the mood crazily jumping from pure horror to comedy to everything in between. To first-time watchers, I advise patience, as there is a method to the madness, and the last half-hour of the movie provides an answer to almost all the strangeness that went before it. (I should also point out that this is unlike most of David Lynch's other creative endeavours, which can be maddeningly surreal and logically unfulfilling). On a rewatch though, one would be able to fully appreciate the brilliance of all the strangeness in the first three-quarters of the movie. There is a very strong rationale behind the weird sequences, as Lynch is committed to the construction of an intangible, irrational reality which nevertheless is intimately familiar to all of us, and which has its own set of rules governing its shape. Every little detail in this intangible reality has a specific meaning, and the way all this ties to the overall plot of the movie is nothing short of mind-blowing. Lynch's script and direction is as usual, mesmerizing and entertaining, Naomi Watts gives an absolute masterclass in acting (in particular, the audition scene is probably the best acted scene that I have ever watched), Laura Harring is stunningly beautiful, and the background score is haunting and stirring and perfectly captures the mood of the movie. The story is ultimately a tragedy, and a cautionary message about the price that we pay for having dreams and then seeing them shattered.",Mulholland Drive

596,vince-41,It's not just the structure.,10,14 December 2001,"Everybody's lying. You shouldn't analyze a film to know whether it's good or not. Analyzing wouldn't make it worse, you will just come to the same conclusion. Only thing that matters, is how film feels, not necessarily right after you saw it, but in general. Take ""Mulholland Drive"". The film might seem pretty primitive. Lynch takes the story of the naive actress's broken dreams in Hollywood, and blows it up, making it surreal and reminiscent of Hollywood noir. Is it easy to do? Theoretically speaking, yes, it is. But you can feel that movie is really good, because you can feel that for Lynch it's not just an exercise in twisting and turning rules of the narrative. (Lost Highway was the exercise, but exercise so splendid, even if it was cold and artificial, it still was mesmerizing). Lynch's strong points here are, first of all, is that he shows us both versions of what happened. None of the parts of the film are dread, no matter what hundreds of reviewers been saying. They are like two mirrors that were put together under weird angle. Second of all, even though you can point out similarities between two parts, they are totally different. Everytime you trying to put all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle together, they don't fit. And that's what films supposed to do anyway. I anticipate, in the near future, Mulholland Drive will suffer major throwback. It's too perfect, it's getting too much acclaim, naturally people will call it overrated. They will refer to the loose ends of where TV pilot ends and the film begins, they will say that ""Club Silencio"" is blue colored version of Black Lodge. Most of all, they will say, that the moral of the film is an obvious cliche. To all this, I can say: First of all, the only way to appreciate Lynch's film, is to have faith in him completely, to trust that he really means what he says, and in Mulholland Drive I am willing to trust him more than ever, because I do feel the love he put in every scene, even what might've seem the exploitative lesbian scene. I believe every single scene in this film. Second of all, getting back to beginning of my review, it feels right, and no amount of writing about film can change it.",Mulholland Drive
597,tonylo,To me the only great movies break new ground.,10,28 May 2002,"This film handles a formulaic Hollywood story; small town girl goes to Hollywood and either succeeds or fails. However, in this case she does both. The way Lynch approaches this story in his inimitable Twin Peaks style, complete with the haunting Badalamenti score, makes this movie a revolutionary one.This last two years we have seen movies like Memento, Vanilla Sky, Traffic, Moulin Rouge, and Mulholland Drive. These are movies that take chances, show new slants on old stories, but more than anything else, these movies assume the audience is intelligent.Nothing is given away, some things are hidden, and others have clues to the truth. Not since the sixties with the wave of Trussaut, Fellini, Resnais, and even Polanski have we seen better thinking man's movies.I would say this about Mulholland Drive; If you liked Swordfish, you will HATE Mulholland Drive. And you are the poorer for it.",Mulholland Drive

It's provocative , tense , dark , dangerous and beautiful....just like Hollywood . David Lynch treats this story like a Rubik's cube , and expects us to put it together...which we might , although you find yourself admiring the beauty of the cube itself , relegating the plot to curiosity status. The close ups , the actresses , the subtle simplicity makes for pure film fire . Witness Naomi Watt's chameleon switch , and sink into the eroticsm of two unprepared lovers...it all takes hold of you hard . In fact , that's about the best description of this film. Gripping .

600,tobybarlowny,One of the best films I've ever seen,10,23 April 2003,"I expected very little from this movie, but what I got was simply amazing. I like Lynch, but I wouldn't say I'm a fan. This film, however, held some of the finest emotional storytelling I've ever encountered. It's such a rich expression of love and anger, jealousy, revenge and guilt. I've read through a lot of interpretations and I have to say I think people are thrown off a bit by Lynch's other films. With it's twists and turns, this one has a simple clear and simple narrative in which the emotions boil over into something beautiful and fantastic. Naomi Watt's really powerful, just incredible. Also, Lynch's use of humor is as sharp as ever. And his sense of evil, as a beast so scary just the sight of it can kill, but which resides within us all and haunts our consciousness, is a nice evolution from what he did with Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet. Very underrated. Excellent. Good.",Mulholland Drive
601,tobybarlowny,I've been thinking about this film for a year,10,14 March 2004,"This is one of the most satisfying films I've ever experienced. David Lynch's masterpiece gives us so much to mull over.  The guilt and the burden of jealousy,  the haunting, unsatisfied ambitions that leave us feeling burned and broken, the way we have to carry ourselves through the debris of dead relationships, the strange sorts of revenge we wish upon those that cross us, all told through brilliantly through the lexicon of dreams. Walking around with his film in my mind was like opening a dark treasure. Boy howdy, that was good. Plus, lesbian kissing. At a book signing I asked David Foster Wallace what he thought of the film (Wallace has a nice essay on Lynch in his excellent book ""A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again"") and Wallace put it quite nicely. He said that, after a few failed attempts, Lynch had finally succeeded at making a real David Lynch film. I think that may understate it a bit, but it falls pretty close to summing up my love of this film.",Mulholland Drive
602,mafiahitman,Don't bother unless you like drugs.,1,16 June 2002,"Well, maybe not drugs.  I'll explain that later.One time I was looking at a personalized license plate that I couldn't figure out.  I drove behind the car and pondered.  It hurt my mind.  I can't remember what it was anymore, but it plagued my thoughts for a long time afterwards.  I decided then and now that I was going to create a personalized license plate that LOOKED like it meant something, but it didn't, thus creating confusion and pain in the onlooker.I think Lynch had the same idea with this movie.Many people have written comments to explain this movie, but I think the human mind must find an explanation to things it can't understand, and there were so many random elements in the film that some parts of it HAD to fit together.  But then there were the elements (about 2 hours of the film) that didn't need to be there.  There were the elements that were artistic but meaningless.  Something like the elephant who could paint.  Unless you like abstract art, stuff that ONLY provokes thought, then don't watch this. Personally I think thought is only a path to a conclusion, and this leads only to confusion, which doesn't make it thought to me.  So many elements in the film were just needless and I think stuck in there to make you think, but didn't really mean anything.  There were so many ideas that I had that I had to throw from my mind to get the real storyline.So if confusion, as I imagine, was his goal... 10 stars.  But as a movie that I paid to see?

I thought she was the dark haired chick all through the movie. But what a performance she gave. Spectacular. And the other lead actress wasn't too shabby either.This is in my top ten all time list. FYI, other films in that list would probably include (not a complete list) ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""Two Lane Blacktop"", ""The Wild Bunch"", ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", ""Carnival of Souls"", and ""2001"".Reading the other IMDb comments it's obvious that many people don't agree with the take that this is great, or even good.

At the end of it, all I could feel was anger.I heard people in my local video store debating the meaning and the storyline.  Frankly, I don't give a damn.  I don't believe that the film has any meaning or coherence, and am not prepared to waste my time trying to artificially look for something in this film: I'm convinced there is absolutely nothing there.Don't waste your time watching it, and for heaven's sake DO NOT bother debating the meaning - there's not one.I can't beleve the number of 10/10 votes this movie's received.  As they say, ""there's one born every minute!"".  If you voted 10 for this, can you really say you either enjoyed it, were stimulated by it or found it a wonderful cinematic experience?

I cannot be bothered enough to explain my theory, because I've done it at least 5 times and I have succeeded in convincing my listeners each time. it doesn't matter, though. the bottom line is, i love this movie because it hurts me physically towards the end - it just makes me cry so hard for the way our girl feels... i have the soundtrack and each time I listen to Llorando (crying) i do cry... and I am a person that has grown up on horrors!",Mulholland Drive

I now I had many ideas of what the movie talked about, until I heard other people opinions.Spoiler: Some disturbing images, as the monster that haunts the guy from the restaurant and the rotting corpse in room 17. Well made make-up. I didn't liked the acting, it seem a little flawless, though Naomi Watts tried her best. I think she was better in ""The Ring"". Laura Harring was mediocre, the only thing I appreciated in her was her beauty. One thing about Watts and Harding was the fact that they had the courage to do that lesbian scene, but that comes with the job. Justin Theroux starred as the director who became broke, so to speak.Lynch alternated the time course of the movie, which made people a little bit confused. He said that the movie makes sense, that the clues are there to see. I know now what he meant. I guess Lynch just wanted to test the mind of the viewer. After you see it sometimes it will all become clear.Like ""Jacob's Ladder"", at first it doesn't make sense, requiring multiple viewings, and I think it has a little bit of ""Memento"" too, as it goes back in time.

(I also think that the plot is not at all complicated -- there's really a canonical explanation for it already.) The scene with the strange man on the throne, who is he? Well, he's the strange man on the throne who is there to be strange, to induce the feeling of strangeness and uncertainty and fear. That man doesn't have to be anything more; Lynch has no obligation to spin each character into something the viewer can safely understand.And the feeling that comes out of this movie is incredible. There are very few films that so purely and honestly convey a feeling -- I would include ""The Piano"" and ""Crouching Tiger."" Lynch doesn't get as good as this -- I consider his latest effort, ""Inland Empire,"" as a rocket that never got launched.

It takes forever for a character to walk down the stairs, answer a question or do anything. It felt like it took weeks to view this movie. I was actually relieved when it was over and happy to delete it from my DVR.

615,dointhefish,Dense? Yes. Confusing? Maybe. Impenetrable? Not at all! (possible spoiler),9,15 October 2001,"After reading numerous reviews both good and bad, I went to see this film and it totally knocked me out!  From start to finish it just had me spellbound.  But what amazes me now is that after having seen it, I'm puzzled as to why some of these ""sophisticated"" movie critics missed the boat so badly on the story of this film.Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons, said that his show was designed so that the viewer would be rewarded for paying attention.  Mulholland Drive requires exactly that: complete attention ALL THE WAY TO THE END!  (spoiler approaching) A lot of these critics should take the time to watch Pulp Fiction again to get a sense of what directors can do with narrative time lines.  In fact, Lynch gives more than adequate clues as to what he's up to with total corn-ball dialogue in the beginning, the soft focus for the first two thirds and the little ""cracks in the veneer"" such as the dog turd in the court yard (contrasting the family-like apartment home), the bitchy casting agent (contrasting the overly nice producer).  But what's most important is understanding the nature or dreams and fantasy verses reality.  Lynch demonstrates this beautifully!But what I admire the most about this film is that Lynch has the audacity and nerve to challenge the viewer and to require him/her to interpret and ponder and THINK!  Such an achievement can only come from an uncompromising dedication to a personal vision which is the source of nearly all great art. So like all great art, it needs to be studied, thought about and talked about(!) to be really appreciated.Mulholland Drive and Memento are probably the ONLY thought provoking films released this year and I'm grateful that a guy like David Lynch had the balls to make it.",Mulholland Drive

I was totally absorbed by this movie and it's been a long time since that happened. Although it didn't all make sense, on a subconscious level it did. (I know that sounds pretentious but that's the way it felt). And the scene in the theatre where a woman sings a heartbreaking Spanish version of Roy Orbisons crying was so perfect. It succeeded in 5 minutes what took Moulin Rouge 2 hours to do. Move the audience. Less is more! And Naomi Watts is so perfect. Forget Halle Berry. She should have gotten the oscar. In the beginning she acted like someone who stepped out of Beverly Hills 90210 and I wasn't really looking forward to her acting in this movie. But (of course) I should have known better. It was all a farce. She turns into someone so complex that you're almost embarrassed to be spying on her.So if you haven't seen it, you should.Just don't try to explain it afterwards, 'cause there probably is more than one interpretation possible, if there is any at all.

618,muligens,A fantastic film that requires your brain to be switched on.,10,20 June 2002,"I should've commented on this film a long time ago, but better late than never. I have now had the opportunity to watch it again on DVD, an experience I will repeat frequently in the years to come.Being a long-time Lynch fan I knew roughly what to expect when entering the theatre. I was expecting the unexpected so to speak (about the only time Lynch has really surprised me was with the Straight Story). Unfortunately, a lot of the audience had no idea what to expect, and admittedly Lynch can be hard to deal with at first glance. With that in mind, I have little trouble understanding all the negative comments the film has gotten on this and other sites. The average movie-goer expects to have everything spelled out for him/her in broad brush strokes and have everything wrapped up nicely by the credits. Luckily there are those that refuse to conform to this bleak standard, and those willing to back them up so the films get made.About the film; there is little I can say about the plot that hasn't already been said. Personally I thought the plot was rather straight-forward once you got the timeline sorted out in your head. I certainly never felt the need to be on top of things as the film played out. The cinematography was so beautiful, the performances so electrifying and the scenes so intriguing that I was happy to just be swept along for the ride. And what a ride! Seldom do we see such powerful cinema, and as the pieces started coming together all I could do was sit back in awe of Mr. Lynch's vision. This isn't weirdness for the sake of being weird, this is carefully chosen imagery produced to make us think at more levels than a more straightforward motion picture would.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes films a little out of the ordinary. If you prefer lighter fare like your average blockbuster then hey, whatever floats your boat. Lynch isn't for everyone and one man's powerful vision is another's pretentious crap.",Mulholland Drive
619,Lorenzo H.,Warmed over TV Pilot served a' la mode'.,6,22 November 2002,"Before damning or praising MULHOLLAND DRIVE one should first understand its background and what the director's original intent was. Roughly the first 90 minutes of this film are composed of footage from a 1999 TV movie that was to have served as a pilot for a proposed series on ABC. They apparently did not like what they saw, or perhaps felt that the story line --- ""small town girl goes Hollywood, meets bizarre characters, gets embroiled in mystery"", was just a bit too odd for the sedated cop/medical/sitcom/reality crowd. Either way the film languished in the vaults for over a year. Director David Lynch however, found a way to salvage his project --- simply tack on an hour of typically Lynchian sex and weirdness, then release it theatrically and hope that audiences worldwide would embrace it as a viable, multi-layered, groundbreaking work of art.Well, to me that sounds a bit like micro-waving a piece of old apple pie, serving it up with a large dollop of cherry vanilla ice cream and hoping no one notices. Recently there have been lots of user comments stating that the film's first half should be viewed as an extended dream, and its second half as actual reality. The problem with that interpretation is that it has been embraced 'after-the-fact' by viewers who think they see some artistic master plan on the director's part. This could not be further from the truth. The scenes from the pilot had been shot with no such thing in mind. Even if the dream angle was something Lynch was going for in the refurbished theatrical version, those early scenes still come off as too firmly grounded in reality to seem convincingly dreamlike. No, I don't buy this dream angle at all. In the end, I believe that the reason many of us are drawn to this movie is not because of the bland pie underneath, but rather the rich, intoxicatingly sweet ice cream that's been dumped atop it.Let's get down to brass tacks.  There are basically 2 reasons most of us are fascinated by this movie. First and foremost, the lesbian sex scenes. Make no mistake about it boys and girls, many of us in living in these modern, liberated times have come to appreciate the aesthetically titillating aspects of watching two beautiful women making love to each other. If you disagree with me, simply try imagining yourself being as enthralled with this movie as you currently are had 2 'guys' played the lead roles. Well, now that we've established (surprise) that sex sells, we should ask ourselves if that in itself makes something great art? I certainly don't think so, --- If it did, half the pornographic films out there would be considered works on par with CITIZEN KANE.Now for the second reason this film seems to fascinate us --- those amazingly disconcerting and typically surreal Lynchian moments that abound in the movie's final hour. Of all those moments, the most hauntingly memorable, in my opinion, is the scene at Club Silencio featuring the Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"". Moments like that, coupled with the aforementioned scenes of sapphic bliss, build an atmosphere of brooding mystery and exotic sensuality that is quite alluring indeed.It should come as no surprise that those scenes were part of the new material shot to help sell the film theatrically. Unfortunately, they simply feel like colorful afterthoughts --- material that was never truly part of the director's original vision for the film. Knowing this, at least for me, makes the overall experience of viewing MULHOLLAND DRIVE somewhat less than satisfying. In the end, its a bummer to think that there was never truly an artistic intent on the director's part other than to salvage a failed project by injecting  moments of signature weirdness and steamy sex into it. Judging by the reviews on this site however, I'd say he'd managed to convince most of you otherwise.This film gets a  6 out of 10  because I have a 'soft' spot for David Lynch. Not surprisingly, when it comes to Laura Elena Harring, the exact opposite seems to be true.",Mulholland Drive
620,j_a_s_p_e_r,There is no solution,1,22 January 2003,"(1/10) I am sure that Mr. Lynch has left no solution to this film, but rather the feeling of the solution. You leave the film feeling like you somewhat understand, but you will never completely understand it. I hated this film. The acting was as bad as it gets. The dialog was annoying and dragged at many places. Furthermore the film invaded my sleep for 3 nights in a row. It is haunting, but it is garbage. Rather go and rent Memento.",Mulholland Drive
621,wgreid,Shhhwwwinnng !,7,25 May 2002,"I somehow missed all the initial hype on this and picked it up at a video store after seeing a review in `Premiere'.  I gave it a 6 initially because I was disappointed by the ending, however I changed it to a seven because the truth is I enjoyed the movie.  It was intriguing and while Lynch keeps you on your toes he doesn't exclude you all together from his insight. There's no doubt after watching the first few minutes that something is not all together as it seems. What I loved about this movie were the lead performances.  These two actors were compete unknowns to me and it was great fun to be introduced to these women with no other pre-conceptions.  And frankly, anytime I can watch a lesbian love scene between two beautiful women with my wife sitting beside me and not feel guilty well...that's not depravity, it's high art !!",Mulholland Drive
622,OzoFriendly,Reel! (or not?),9,23 January 2002,"I can honestly say this is the first film in a very long time that I have been completely mesmerised by; this film sucked me in whole from the opening credits - not only because Lynch's direction is so nourishing, but because the leading actors, Naomi Watts and Laura Harring - neither of whom I'd heard of before - were utterly captivating. If either acting or direction had been lacking then the film - more specifically, the narrative - might well have been disappointing. Not taking anything away from Laura Harring (or indeed the rest of a very fine cast), I think Naomi Watts deserves the highest praise for a brilliant performance in an incredibly tough role.Having said that, her role depended on an complete understanding of the emotional turmoil her character undergoes in the latter third of the film. With this understanding not only would Naomi have found her various styles easier to wear, but those in the audience with me who were prepared to spend a little time making sense of the story didn't leave the cinema dismissing the film as pretentious rubbish - as many volubly did.For those of you unsure whether or not you can stomach another film in the 'Lost Highway' mould, remember that the last film Lynch made was 'The Straight Story' and some of its narrative sensibility and honesty seem to have flowed into 'Mulholland Drive' because I found it a lot less oppressive and a lot more accessible than 'Lost Highway'. Rest assured though, you're still in for an exhilarating cinematic ride.9/10 and the best film of my year so far",Mulholland Drive
623,nekanderson881,Strange is par for this course,6,21 April 2004,"*** Spoilers contained within  ***Strange, strange film...but that goes without saying with Lynch as writer and director.  Two-thirds of the film is linear and follows a storyline that is interesting, creepy, and most of all Lynchian.  However, after Betty unlocks ""Pandora's box"", the story changes to the non-linear: actors play different roles, two characters become small enough to walk under a closed door all the while laughing and shaking their arms up and down.  The acting in the film is very good.  It is especially a joy to see Ann Miller.  She plays the no-nonsense landlady, that we find out later is also the mother of the film director.  Robert Forster is billed prominently, but appears only very briefly.  Michael J. Anderson plays a different character than in ""Twin Peaks"", but the room he is in appears to be the same one in that TV series. There are many memorable 	scenes: the director finding his wife bedded with the hired man, and then taking her jewelry box into the garage and dumping pink paint in it; the conference room meeting to decide on the leading actress for the director's film and the ensuing espresso problem; the opening sequence with the 50's style dancing and later in the film the auditions with the musical number. We see the killings in the apartment building--following a hilarious joke a man is shot; the second shot is accidental, but goes through the wall, striking a large woman, whom the killer fights with.  This is observed by the janitor who is standing with his vacuum, who becomes the next victim.  The female rendition of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"" in Spanish is beautiful.  This whole stage performance sequence is weird.  If this had turned into the TV series it was originally planned 	to be, perhaps the minor characters would have been expanded and the plot gaps would have been developed.  This film is unsatisfying as it is, due to its being edited down to feature length. Lynch is truly an independent spirit.  It is quite a miracle that with today's emphasis on profits that he is 	able to make this type of film at all.  This film is derivative of his other works--the same composer, whose music is so much like ""Twin Peaks.""  Lynch's use of old-time actors has been a habit of his all along.  And Jack Fisk, his production designer, has worked with Lynch off and on since ""Eraserhead"".",Mulholland Drive

The new occupant, a bubbly wannabe actress fresh from Ontario, finds her and it becomes apparent that the woman has lost her memory. Together they set out to discover her past. But just at the crucial moment, there's a twist to the story, that makes you wonder what is real and what is not...It is quite difficult to write a synopsis of Mulholland Dr. without giving anything away. I did not know any of David Lynch's earlier works, but wanted to see this one after reading the superb reviews it got. As I said before, I'm not going to give anything away, so you have to see and think for yourself, and then read some of the interpretations, and go and see it again.  This is surely the first film that had me waking up in the middle of the night and thinking about it. Even now, after knowing the clues and some people's interpretation, it is still not quite clear. Mulholland Dr. is surely not for you if you want light entertainment, but if you want to see a visually brilliant movie that makes you think about its meaning for long afterwards, go and see it. Kudos to David Lynch for this film, which you probably have to see even more than twice to understand its full merit. 9 out of 10.",Mulholland Drive

It's just David Lynch's weird mind and it'snot supposed to make any sense.  That's bull.  This movie has avery particular (and very very good) story line that is 100%understandable if you can do one thing; you have to understandthe sequence of events that Lynch twisted around so much.  Forthe convenience of everyone reading this (and anyone dying tounderstand this movie) I have set up the sequence of events as Iunderstand them.  Watch the movie again, and pay attention to the10 keys that Lynch provides.  Print this out if you need to : )Sequence of Events in Mulholland Dr. (according to wicket_saic@hotmail.com)  1.  Diane wins the Jitterbug contest.  Her family (the old man andold woman) is there and cheers for her.  (this is much earlier thanany of the rest of the movie.  years possibly)  2.  Camilla and Diane fool around on the couch (notice theashtray).  Camilla says that they shouldn't do that anymore.  3.  Camilla and the director talk and kiss in the car for the movie. 4.  Diane gets a phone call and is told to get in the limo.  She isdropped of at the bottom of the directors house.  The dinner sceneoccurs in which she finds out that her lover Camilla and thedirector are getting married.  5.  Diane sits in a restaurant with the hit-man and tells him to killCamilla.  6.  Diane returns home and feels guilty.  7.  She falls asleep on the pillow.   8.  Diane has a long dream.  What happens in this dream iscoming from guilt and the people surrounding her life.  Thedirector who is getting married to her x-lover has a terrible life.  Herx-lover loves her again.  Diane is an amazing actress and does agreat job.  The part with the men in the restaurant and the monsteris all just a part of the dream.  The cowboy has nothing to do withthe movie for the most part.  He was just seen by Diane at onepoint and he stuck with her so he's in her dream.  Her dead auntshows up.  She mixes up names just like everybody often does indreams.  None of this is real.  There are many things her dreamfeeds off of... to many things to try to explain.  The dream beginswith Camilla (Rita) in the car and ends with the cowboy waking herup.  That is all within her dream.  9.  A knocking wakes Diane up.  It is her neighbor looking for therest of her belongings.  She picks up her ashtray (notice the bluekey) and says that there are detectives looking for Diane.10.  While making coffee, Diane thinks she sees Camilla (whoshe just had killed).  Its just a daydream.11.  Diane goes and sits on the couch and stares at the blue key. Someone is knocking (I think that this could be the detectiveslooking for Diane).

628,vinzclortho,Definitive David Lynch!,10,15 June 2002,"For anyone getting started on the films of David Lynch, this is one to watch. 'Mulholland Dr.' is one of the most original mind twisters ever made, destined to be a classic. I'm a huge fan of Lynch ever since I began watching his show ""Twin Peaks"" when I was 10. I then progressed to the films, 'Elephant Man', 'Dune' (Not So Good), and finally I saw 'Blue Velvet'. That did it for me, and I was a fan for life. I've subsequently seen all his films of terrific twisted vision and 'Mulholland Dr.' just drives home the power of this film-maker's genius. Scenes at first, don't make sense, some might not at all, but in the end Lynch covers all his bases and brings everything back in a numbingly brilliant finale of images and sounds to put this puzzle together. This movie has to be, I repeat, HAS TO BE WATCHED MORE THAN ONCE to not only absorb the story but also to appreciate it's brilliance. In summary, 'Mulholland Dr.' is one of David Lynch's best films, and was my pick as the best movie of 2001. It's a different film, for sure, but if you want something original, brilliant and downright twisted, have I got the movie for you!",Mulholland Drive
629,Evan Anderson,Lynch in all his glory. Interpret it.,9,6 September 2002,"This movie is more or less about a women referred to by an alias Rita (the beautiful Laura Elena Harring) trying to find out who she is with the help of her newfound friend Betty (the equally beautiful Naomi Watts).  There are other things going on like a young frustrated director trying to recast the lead of his film and a paranoid man worried about the nightmare behind a diner but most of the movie is Rita trying to find out who she is.  The earlier part of the film is weird but easy to follow but the last thirty minutes are crazy!  Don't go psycho and bash Lynch all you people.  Calm down pay attention and get your own interpretation.  I'm not listing mine for the simple reason I want you to get your own.  There are probably one-million interpretations and none of them are wrong since Lynch probably intended for people to have different interpretations.  That's the beauty of films like this.  They give you freedom which is more than I can say for normal movies.  If you like weird movies like me rent this!  You will also be treating to some disturbing scenes a bum that looks like he came straight from hell, miniature malicious old people crawling under the door, a strange stage performance, an accidental suicide, and a rotting dead body.

630,adi_hecht,Two things going for this movie,5,29 December 2013,"There are 2 great things going for this movie: Laura Harring's sexy, exquisite curvaceous body, magnificently revealed in the movie; and Rebekah Del Rio's beautiful enchanting performance of Llorando (Roy Orbison's ""Crying"").Those are 2 perfect moments in a film that last nearly 2 and a half hours. And that, unfortunately, is not enough to compensate for the slow moving, confused (probably purposefully confusing) plot.Granted, one should expect, going in to a David Lynch film, a surreal and confusing experience. This is the director's trademark style, and I have found myself reveling in it in the past.But here, it seems purposefully constructed to confuse, and once the true meaning IS revealed, it does not hold as a cohesive story, especially when looking back at the entire length of the this overly long film.For my taste, there are too many distracting characters and throwaway scenes designed just to confuse, and in the end, they do not amount to anything: the cowboy. the large hit-man in the director's home. etc. I can appreciate the symbolism and the surreal atmosphere they add to the movie. But in the end, the amount of time the movie spends on these scenes is disproportionate with the fact that they're only there for atmosphere.Still, the 2 good things I mentioned are well-worth the watch for some people, myself included.",Mulholland Drive
631,funang,David Lynch's masterpiece,9,2 December 2003,"(Possible spoilers)Dreams, like the movies are in many instances an illusion for the mind. It offers us an escape from our mundane, boring and even dreaded realities. In the case for Diane Selwyn, it is her escape into a nice alternate reality. A reality where her wasted character becomes a goody two shoes, with talent and opportunities. Where else but Hollywood, LA, the dream factory that is the best embodiment of such a reality. Lynch himself describes the film as `A Love story in the city of dreams'. A most ambiguous and also most apt description.I can understand why the detractors of the film feel so strongly against it. They fail to reconcile the last act of the movie with the rest of it, and fail to see Mulholland Drive as a coherent whole. They also fail to recognize the bits and pieces of individual scenes, such as the bizarre scene of the two men conversation in the Winkles restaurant about a dream, or the good old diabolical smiling couple, who seems to be smiling for no reason, or are they? These are all pieces that contribute to a very well organized piece of cinematic jigsaw puzzle, orchestrated by a modern maestro, known as David Lynch.There are many more examples that can better 'explain' the subtleties in the first two acts winking at the reader.Given the detailed explanation, the general viewer may be able to appreciate Mulholland Drive better as a coherent whole, and not a mess of disjointed scenes that many detractors have claimed it to be.Mulholland Drive is without a doubt one of the more accessible of Lynch's work, and the most properly structured. As Lynch once said, even though his films are about dreams, they are based on ideas, tangible ideas. Ideas to him are the no.1 thing, and all he does is to translate his ideas to a different medium, the medium of film. Lynch has said that he likes it when other people analyses his films, for it is a subjective thing and all interpretations are fine. The ideas in Mulholland Drive without a doubt warranted deep scrutiny and discourse. However, one cannot deny the strong emotional resonance from many of the scenes, and its top notch crafting. Of note is Lynch's sound design, which retains the style evident in many of his previous work but comes out here even more strongly than ever, further complementing the mood and experience of the film. Mulholland Drive is both an experience to be taken in as well as intelligible rhetoric to be dissected. It is an angry indictment as well as a beautiful tearjerker. The duality and irony coupled with the uncompromising stance of Lynch makes it a great work of art.The film represents the journey of an artist into maturity, one who moves from the subversion in Eraserhead to Lost Highway and finally arriving at Mulholland Drive. Let's just hope that this is not the final destination for a highly original contemporary filmmaker.",Mulholland Drive
632,devon_chris,The world's finest director gives it to us twisted - I love it!,8,24 May 2002,"First, a disclaimer. Only a certain sort of person can watch and appreciate a Lynch film. I don't think intelligence is a factor - I like to think of myself as quite a smart guy, and was well pleased with myself for following this film through the twist in the last half hour, but then when the film got REALLY weird in the final few minutes, I lost any idea I might ever have had about what was going on. I think to appreciate Lynch you need to be open-minded enough to accept whatever surreality he's going to throw at you next, but not analytical enough to think everything has to have an answer. Sometimes, just to irritate the audience, I'm sure Lynch just chucks in a random element which doesn't make any sense at all. Mulholland Drive requires you to concentrate, otherwise you'll think you've just gone mad in parts of it. It also requires you to enjoy having your mind twisted inside out, churned around in a food mixer, and served to you 'Hannibal'-style on a plate. If you prefer easy-watching, sit-back-and-enjoy-the-spectacle films, stay well away. This is a thought-provoking, thought-mangling, masterpiece. I don't know what the underlying metaphors are meant to be (maybe there just aren't any) but I detect a cynicism, about what fame and stardom can do to you, very prevalent in this piece. What is unique among Lynch films of Mulholland Drive is that it makes you laugh with some genuinely funny set-pieces - the botched contract killing near the start had me in stitches, and the scenes that take place within the director's house are great too. Ultimately, what sets this out from some more mainstream surreal films is the absence of any explicit explanation - there is no conveniently-scripted description of what the hell's been going on, like there is in the Sixth Sense, Matrix or Fight Club. Imagine trying to figure out the Matrix with no Morbius, no phones or anyone telling Keanu Reeves what's happening, multiply your confusion by a hundred and you have a rough idea what you'll be feeling watching Mullholland Drive. I can't wait for this to be mass-released, cos I want to see it again to see if I can make any more sense. I'm sure I'm not the only one with my head fried.

636,erialc,Los Angeles is where all of our dreams lie; Mulholland Dr. is where the dream ends,10,11 June 2004,"In `Mulholland Drive,' director David Lynch weaves a story that ingeniously takes our minds on a fantastical roller coaster ride. The movie opens with the arrival of an ingenue, an aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Naomi Watts), to Hollywood in pursuit of her dreams of becoming a movie star, or a great actress, as she tells us. To Betty, Los Angeles seems the city of Dreams, the city of Angels, a temple where the yearning to dream the impossible is consecrated, a sanctuary for all those who dare to dream. However, immersed in the fantastical sceneries, the somewhat obscure plotline, and the eerie, nerve-striking music, everything in `Mulholland Drive' wears a mysterious and ghastly veil as if foreshadowing the ultimate defeat of these effervescent yearnings.As Betty soon involves herself in helping the vulnerable Rita (Laura Elena Harring), whom Betty finds in her apartment, to overcome Rita's amnesia, one senses the looming danger ahead. Then, the movie indeed takes a turn, but it arrives at a most unexpected place. It becomes haunting, ludicrous, and dream-like, enthralling us with its confusions, delirium, eeriness, and eroticism. Suddenly, what seemed once a passionate love becomes uncontrollable selfish desires, as mystery turns into an enigma and then transforms itself into a labyrinth. The audience begins to doubt the validity and authenticity of all of which we have seen. Seeking truth, we question what is reality, and what is made-believe illusion.The performances given by the lead actresses, Watts and Harring, greatly augment the effectiveness of this intriguing tale of aspiration and defeat. Watts is a revelation in her dual role as Betty and Diane, offering a soul to each of the two counterparts, rendering a riveting breakthrough performance of her career. Unfortunately, her Oscar-caliber performance was overlooked by the Academy, but it'll be the performance that'll define her career in the years to come.9/10",Mulholland Drive
637,ikonoklastik,This is why this movie is brilliant... actually... never mind.,10,22 February 2004,"10/10Recently, I read an excerpt from a book by Dennis Lim called ""David Lynch: The Man from Another Place."" In it, the author mentions how much Lynch despises interpretation of his work. He writes:""Writing about David Lynch, it can be hard not to hear his voice in your head, protesting the violence being done to his work. 'As soon as you put things in words, no one ever sees the film the same way,' he once told me. 'And that's what I hate, you know. Talking—it's real dangerous.' Not for nothing does ""Mulholland Drive,"" the Lynch movie that has invited the most fervent flurry of explication, end with a word of caution: 'Silencio.'""This reminded me that 11 years before this edit I had written this very review on IMDb, which contained an interpretation of the film's plot. I've decided to remove all of that. Whether or not you are satisfied with a particular interpretation of the plot should be irrelevant to your enjoyment of the film. I enjoyed it before I had that satisfying interpretation. And I'm hoping that I can clear it from my mind the next time I watch ""Mulholland Dr.""I will leave one thing from my original post.

It's so original!"" Well I watched it and it is not original or mind blowing and it is certainly not a great movie.First off, Pros: It is a very beautiful and well shot movie. As always David Lynch is a masterful director and injects this film with a lot of his odd, seemingly pointless, yet entertaining scenes. This movie is not hard on the eyes at all and for most of the movie I was enthralled and entertained.So what are the cons???It ends with a clichéd ""psychotic lesbian"" story that's been told a million times. Girl meets girl, girl loves girl, other girl decides to date a boy instead and the crazy gay person goes postal. That is everything that happens.The big gimmick is that at the end of the movie the audience is left to wonder what was real and what was a delusion. But the story is so uninspired that in the end I didn't care what was reality and what wasn't. Because regardless of the ambiguous scenes, when it's all said and done it's another late 90's, early 2000's cautionary tale to fuel homophobia.Sorry folks. This is David Lynch's most over rated film and one of the most over rated thrillers of all time. The ending ruined everything for me and turned it into garbage. I am not one to immediately dismiss a movie for something like this. I love other movies with negative portrayals of psychotic gay people like Silence of the Lambs and High Tension, but those films had other qualities that still kept things interesting. This is a self-indulgent, pseudo-intellectual story that is ruined by a cliché ending from an otherwise very original and talented director. I really wish I had never seen it and was still mystified by the idea of the movie.",Mulholland Drive
641,colaya,"""We are such stuff, as dreams are made on---and our little life is rounded with a sleep""",10,4 October 2016,"So the haunting quote of Shakespeare goes, so Mulholland Drive goes---Life and dreams: the same stuff. And we can turn both dreams and life into nightmares, even if they are made in Hollywood---the quintessential ""Dream Factory"".Borges expressed that same mystery in his poem ""The Dream""; I would suggest to read it carefully as accompaniment for this film:""If dreaming is (as they say) a truce, a sheer repose of the mind, why is it, if abruptly you wake from one, you feel you've been robbed? Why's rising too soon so sad? The early hour takes from us an unthinkable gift, one so intimate that it's only translatable in a trance the night gilds with dreams that may well be cut-off reflections of the treasures of the darkness, of a timeless, nameless orb that the day distorts in its mirrors. Who will you be tonight in the dark dream, on the other side of the wall?""When we sleep, we fabricate dreams. Borges thought that dreams are works of fiction. He concluded that dreaming is perhaps the oldest aesthetic activity of humanity. Seemingly dreams could be, then, our very own ""films""---Although in them we are everything: director, theater, audience, actors, scriptwriter, producer, editor, camera, sound,... all coming from our own emotions, fears, hopes, from our very life....But life... perhaps is just a series of dreams, dreams we live. The dream of achieving some aspirations, the dream of becoming a Hollywood star, the dream of being loved, the dream of being happy. Maybe our whole life is a dream, a big play, the greatest film of all.And sometimes, like Diane Selwyn, we turn our dreams into nightmares. For Borges, when dreaming, feelings inspire the images (if in the dream we feel fear, we engender a tiger, or a ghost). He went further and said that since in dreams fear precedes the improvised apparition of the image, then we can project horror on any thing (regardless if that thing is horrific in real life). A house, a theater, a little blue key... for Borges ""every form in the universe can be contaminated with horror. That's the peculiar taste of nightmares, more diverse from the things that scare us in real life"".Mulholland Drive stages a nightmare. But which one? The one that Diane dreams? The one that Diane lives? Both? What is ""the real"" story? Who knows? Who cares? Mulholland Drive shows the power of film and the chance for us to actively engage in cinematic experiences. Mulholland Drive is a mood, an atmospheric and suspenseful experience about dreams, nightmares, fiction and life. As dreams, films are illusions, like shows performed at Club Silencio. We enjoy them, suffer them, taste them, and make sense of them (or not). We make of them what we want, out of what we are. We create always our own versions of the films we watch--like in this forum. Perhaps our very life is made of the same stuff; illusional, creative, fearful, crazy, absurd, emotional. That might be the real horror. Or the real hope.",Mulholland Drive
642,DVLefferts,Fascinating and Fantastic,10,18 February 2006,"When you watch Mulholland Dr., you will not immediately understand everything (you might not understand anything). But an intelligent viewer will gather that, though they might not get everything right away, there is at least something to get. There is a structure to Mulholland Dr., there is a rhyme to its reason. What's important to remember is that it is about dreams. And not only those we experience in our sleep. Dreams that are projections of what our futures might have been like, dreams of going back and changing things, dreams of becoming something important and necessary to the world. But as Peter Travers stated in his Rolling Stone review, just ""let it take you in."" I am confident that if you do let it take you in, with all its colors and beautiful score pieces, etc., you will take from this movie perhaps not a gist of the real plot, but instead what is truly important--the actual feel of a film that is destined to become a classic.",Mulholland Drive

644,please_stand_by,A Brilliant Puzzle Worth Trying to Solve,10,30 August 2016,"Many have compared the underlying story of Mulholland Drive to a puzzle, and I must agree. However, unlike a traditional puzzle, this one arguably has only partial solutions that each depend upon personal interpretation. For much of the film, identities are blurred, events appear unrelated or pointless, and even the acting and character motivations come across as unnatural and bizarre. The atmosphere created by David Lynch's dreamlike style (through both cinematography and music) is wholly surreal as well, as anyone familiar with him would expect. But unlike other stories that explore the surreal by descending into the frustrating realm of purely subjective interpretation, Mulholland Drive is anchored by several critical, objective events and relationships in the central character's life. As the end of the film nears, the details surrounding these critical events are revealed, quickly bringing clarity to much of the bizarre amalgamation of prior events, but the vast periphery remains mysterious. When all is said and done, the viewer is left with many questions and even more answers waiting to be uncovered.In short, Mulholland Drive is an incredibly complex film, and one which can also be very engrossing and satisfying. It will inevitably confuse and disinterest some viewers, particularly those not interested in working to decode such a puzzling narrative. Yet unlike many films which lose much of their appeal once the twist or mystery has been revealed, this film only gets more interesting the more you piece together. Perhaps others will have a different experience, but for me it was as if the answers to the peripheral mysteries of Mulholland Drive were all there, right in front of me, but just out of reach; just out of focus; just needing one more connection to be made. And the more you piece together, the more you realize that the number of meaningful connections between various events is absolutely staggering. It never ceases to fascinate me with its depth and for this reason, I regard it as a truly brilliant film.",Mulholland Drive

646,LaowaiGuy,Naomi Watts makes Mulholland Dr. quite enjoyable,9,15 October 2010,"Sometimes an actor or actress makes a movie so much better than the sum of its parts. Mulholland Dr. is an example of this as Naomi Watts (Betty) is absolutely wonderful in every one of her scenes. She demonstrates true acting range as she portrays murderous rage, heart- broken sorrow and pure joy in captivating moments during this film. It was a pleasure to see her demonstrate her acting skills in two particular scenes.In one scene she is practicing her lines for a movie with her roommate. It's about a husband and wife splitting up. She delivers her lines with passion and emotion and it seems like Betty could become a movie star despite her roommate's wooden responses. Then a few scenes later, Betty is in an audition with the actor playing the husband (Robert Forster); who insists that she stand very close to him as they rehearse the same lines as before. She performs the scene with such intense, raw emotions as she kisses her husband while saying her lines in a heavy whisper. It's very believable performance. I can't imagine Angelina Jolie, Nicole Kidman or Julia Roberts pulling off that kind of pure acting.Oh by the way, enjoy the rest of Mulholland Dr. as Betty helps her new roommate (of sorts) Rita (Laura Harring) discover her true identity. Laura does a great job of moving Rita's emotional state from confusion, to fear to blissful happiness in a matter of a few scenes. I'm surprised her career didn't take off as much as Naomi's. She does an excellent job in this movie. Don't worry about trying to discover too many hidden meanings as some reviewers will try over-analyzing every scene especially since it's directed by David Lynch. Just enjoy the ride with Betty and Rita as they go on a wild adventure of self-discovery and character development. It's a long, strange trip, but it's worth taking.",Mulholland Drive

A quick glance through these reviews will tell you'll either think it the biggest load of garbage you'll ever see, or be completely hooked....But it is an important piece of film making without any doubt. Myself I liked it. I was enjoying the film as a highly entertaining dark yet normal thriller, that was until the film reaches the last 1/3 and it suddenly turns itself inside-out, upside down and twists itself into something unrecognisable. At this point, your brain is whirling and I very nearly lost all interest. But I stuck with it, and yes thoroughly enjoyed.....Now hang up, because there is a gathering of two huge armies here....the Lynchists, and the would be-Lynch-Lynchers, how can there be such a divide. Well for a start I do actually understand what the Anti-Lynch movement is about.....You could write off this film as being far too surreal, and that Lynch is just trying to be clever by throwing things upside down, and using things that have no relevance except being visually aesthetic/bizarre. But to me, thank god we have people like David Lynch who are challenging the norms of Planet Hollywood. How many anti Lynch people are there, that at the same time scream from their perches about the marvel of foreign film being different and how come America can't make a decent unformulaic movie.

Unique because regardless of what you consider- if you liked the film or not- you will think about what you just saw. It is a reactionary film in ways because it toys with your perception. Naomi Watts arrives in Los Angeles as a wide-eyed starlet who finds a mysterious woman, shaken and damaged in her apartment. With her career not going as desired she teams with this woman to solve the mystery of who she really is and how did she come to be in that situation. This is a psychological film with multiple layers and themes which might confuse you. Lynch is an auteur and all his films reek of atmosphere and this one is no different.

Definitely David Lynch's best.(Although haven't seen ""The Straight Story"") Its fractured time shifts bend and twist and demand the viewer to be with the actors in their own free and fractured dream consciousness. When the first cross cutting in time begins it is very reminiscent of Stanley Kubricks 2001 in the White Room, its almost a scene by scene technical duplication. There are also references to Alain Resnais ""Providence"" in the multiple time shifts and viewpoints. Except Lynch takes this principle and takes it much much further to the absolute edge of reality. If it had gone too far it would almost be a totally confused film but it is at the very knife edge of total confusion and a concrete multi view pointed reality, (seen in several different ways and times of course).Naomi Watts is an equally brilliant Actor, whom I thought was parodying Laura Dern at first. However I realized she has a much greater depth and brilliance than Laura Dern.Overall an Absolutely Mindblowing Experience! and a gift to the world of Cinema History, this film will be a cult classic for many followers of David Lynch (Myself Included)",Mulholland Drive

While this might be mildly entertaining on the most simplistic and banal level, it doesn't bear close scrutiny, and time will surely show it for the lack of substance it is.  Why, then, does it get ranked so highly on IMDb?  Viewers wanting to think of themselves as fans of avant-garde and edgy filmmaking convince themselves (and each other) there must be more here than it appears.  Sadly, there isn't.

I'm so tired of 'critically acclaimed' movies that are all about disconnecting from life. According to this theory, messing up your life is the only alternative because that's what 'reality' is. Well, if you're a fan of meaningless glorification of psychosis, then this is the film for you. A lot of clever film gimmicks, quirky editing, and a film noir, almost a dreamlike feel, characterizes this movie. I will say that  Naomi Watts is terrific and shows off her versatility, playing the full range of emotions effortlessly. It's almost worth it to sit through this jumble of disconnected scenes to see her performance. But what a waste of time for such a pointless motif as this film has.

When you make a film without a story or continuity... nobody can figure out what's happening. You wouldn't think this would be a big surprise.This ""film"" almost looks as if someone took bits of film from some unsuccessful, uncompleted project and deliberately cut them so as to obscure the story line and hide the fact that the story never resolved.The result, of course, is a piece of crap. Sophisticated cinema devotees do not wish to admit that they have no clue about they are watching. They do not seem to notice that the director, having nothing to say, has managed to say nothing.

Is this bad?  No, it's gripping, enthralling, provocative and frustrating.  There's some hints about what Lynch is up to in the middle of the film with the drug addict meeting a character who was an bungling assassin earlier in the film.  Is this a drugged out dream of some street waif who hoped the Hollywood dream was a reality for her?  Who knows - it just means you're doomed to want to see this film again and again, and  just as likely will be as dumbfounded and impressed each time.

663,lostatlimbo,david lynch vs. filmmaking,5,19 April 2002,"to begin, what the hell did i just see? does any one know what david lynch's problem is? does he have something against logic? does he hate making movies. i felt the whole way through that david lynch was sitting at home laughing at me as a grasped franticlly at little details, trying to figure out what was going on. ive never been a lynch fan, but since mullholland drive got such great reviews, i thought id give it a try. never again. lynch is deranged. was the first part before the last part or was it the part that was with the part before the part. did the blue cube represent treachery or the lady with the blue beehive. its ridiculous! nothing had to do with anything! its as if he made twenty different movies, took out all the important parts and then taped the rest together. mullholland drive IS what got left on the cutting room floor of somebody's nightmares. its enough to f**k with sigmund freud's head.ive heard and read a dozen times that, even if you dont 'get' lynch's  movies, you can still appreciate the art of it. but what art is there to insanity. is it supposed to stir up some emotion within me, like some abstract painting? is the point of lynch's work simply chaos? i think anyone can throw together loads of fickle nonsense, but to make sense out of chaos is what art really is about.if you ask me, lynch's point to mullholland drive was simply to p*** me off and drive me crazy. i liked twin peaks, to some extent, but maybe thats because lynch was not alone in writing it. maybe he needs a sane person to even him out. if he ever finds someone to work with again, then and only then, will i watch one of his movies. 5/10",Mulholland Drive
664,FilmFanatic09,Mulholland Drive,10,3 December 2006,"The first time you see ""Mulholland Drive,"" the most you can do is experience it. The second time, you'll notice more and perhaps a few pieces will fall into place. You can expect more of this the third time you see it. And the fourth. How many viewings does it take to get to the heart of ""Mulholland Drive?"" One wonders if it's a possibility. On a more serious note, what some would argue as David Lynch's best film, is a film rich in atmosphere, symbolism, and existential ideologies. The plot, which is still highly debated and theorized among film buffs, revolves around two women: an exotic amnesiac (Laura Elena Harring) and a bright-eyed ingénue (Naomi Watts) just arrived in a stylized and mystical Hollywood. Together, they investigate a mystery that encompasses a car crash, a locked box, a decaying corpse, and a purse full of money. Characters come and go and scenes flow from one to the next, with barely any concrete thread holding them together.Lynch proves fearless in ignoring convention and throwing linear storytelling to the wind. He's not alone in his dexterity, however. Naomi Watts gives the best performance I've ever seen in the movies here. Lon Chaney, character actor of the silent era, has been fondly nicknamed, ""The Man of a Thousand Faces."" For her work here, Watts should be dubbed, ""The Woman of a Thousand Faces of a Single Character."" She plays her ingénue with a range of depths that surpass anything we might expect. In the body of the film, she is clearly its heart and soul. There are no doubt those who will be offended by this film. Perhaps they'll think it's too graphic, too artsy, or too intellectual. They would be right. This isn't a film for everyone. But for those attuned to the graphic, artsy, and intellectual aspects of film, ""Mulholland Drive"" is surely one of the most rewarding viewing options out there.For those with the perseverance to work at understanding ""Mulholland Drive,"" there will come a time when they begin to suspect that most of the film's spectacle and eccentric happenings are merely pawns, artistically manipulated to tell a tragically human story. I think this is correct. ""Mulholland Drive"" is something of a paradox in that it has to be complex and illogical to so truthfully tell its story. After all, the human thought process is one of the greatest complexities in existence and that's essentially what this film is seeking to represent. And it succeeds. It has to, otherwise viewers would never be willing to invest the time necessary to decipher it. All I can suggest is this: see it again. And again. See it until you understand it.

666,seanwilson556,Why can't more films be like this?,10,17 July 2011,"Just simply amazing and addictive storytelling along with an extraordinary performance from Naomi Watts. David Lynch has crafted a truly magnificent film set in Hollywood, The City of Angels. A place where stars are made... but some fade. Some become destined for eternal success years after they pass on, but some disappear with the click of a finger with nothing but darkness. Think Elizabeth Short aka ""The Black Dahlia"" or Peg Entwistle. That's the haunting thing about Hollywood. It's the most alluring city in the world for its deep roots in the entertainment industry but its bright lights and famous stars also lies in darkness. Deep down, Hollywood, Los Angeles is devilish, disturbing... bleak.Billy Wilder showed us the ugly side of Hollywood in his 1950 film noir classic Sunset Boulevard and 51 years later David Lynch continues this tradition with his neo noir psychological thriller Mulholland Drive. Obviously that is a small portion of analysis and there is deeper symbolism but the dark side of Hollywood stuck with me the most.Shot against the dark backdrop of Los Angeles, we follow many different characters: ""Betty Elms"" (played by Naomi Watts), an aspiring actress from Canada in search for the Hollywood dream, a mysterious femme fatale who calls herself ""Rita"" (Laura Harring) in search of her identity and befriends Betty and ""Adam Kesher"" (Justin Theroux), a confident yet arrogant film director striving to maintain complete artistic control over his latest movie... but the last part of the film rips through conventional film noir storytelling and gives us a whole new batch of characters. Here we have ""Diane Selwyn"" (Naomi Watts), an unsuccessful and psychologically troubled actress ""Camilla Rhodes"" (Laura Harring), a successful and talented actress who just finished working with director Adam Kesher. Skipping between the past and present, we are shown a non- linear view of Diane's emotional and psychological breakdown. It may be sad, scary and tough to watch but Lynch just keeps our eyes stuck to the screen because of Naomi Watts brilliance. A film noir, psychological thriller, dark comedy, horror, drama, romance; MD is a wide mix of genres. You can't really place it in one genre. Or time frame. In fact, time is stuck in this film, we never really know when this film takes place. Lynch gives us a timeless feel due to his references to previous decades and films. One minute we see the iconic poster of Gilda (1940's film) then we see the more contemporary looking director Adam Kesher driving a fancy Porsche car. Rita is a classic femme fatale (a common female character in 40's/50's film noir). So mesmerising.Despite the amazing performances from Watts, Harring and Theroux, the incredible cinematography and the hauntingly beautiful score from Angelo Badalamenti; the star of the show is David Lynch: The heart and soul of Mulholland Drive. His driving force and determination to create one of the greatest films ever made is outstanding. Only a few have perfectly recreated a disturbing Los Angeles on film, crafted an intricate and complex story, pushed Naomi Watts to the limit to show us just how talented she is or gave us a visually stunning treat full of unpredictable moments.A very rare treat, Lynch has given us a film that will scare you, shock you, move you and most importantly: inspire you. From his dream logic, surrealism, to the dark look at Hollywood, to his psychological, philosophical and metaphysical ideas and probably most importantly to film buffs, his unique directing style, Lynch is an inspiration and a sensation. Following Kubrick's road with rich symbolism, fantastic lighting and cinematography, very memorable characters, Mulholland Drive will change the way you look at films. Forever.",Mulholland Drive
667,BeholdTheRiversofBlood,"A nicely made, boring film...",1,21 July 2012,"David Lynch's movie Mulholland Drive mostly serves as a practical exercise in chronology and atmosphere. These two points it does extremely well, but movies do not have merit because they are well crafted: They need to give the audience emotion, reaction or amusement back. Apart from starring very beautiful women (which should not be the purpose of the movie), it fails to deliver in actually being an experience rather than a show of how well a film can be made technically. There's very little suspense, which it must be assumed has to be made up for by the presumed weirdness of the film. It isn't. The weirdness makes sense in a way and in others it doesn't depending on personal interpretation, but no matter the conclusion the film is still a long 2,5 hour bore overcompensated with sexually attractive women. There's nothing for anyone here to see, but in a way that (nothingness) is also the story of the movie (possibly as an extremely vague and week criticism of Hollywood, which is irrelevant to a movie of this kind). Just a shame that it's entirely fictional and unbelievable, then, since an empty movie without context is just a nicely wrapped time wasting scheme.",Mulholland Drive

I enjoyed the scene of the women making love...of course I wanted more!! Hollywood is so timid about really developing erotic scenes, as if the American audience really can't handle it!

After the first time I saw this movie, I couldn't stop thinking about it for about an hour, because I couldn't figure it out. But then it hit me. It's really quite obvious once you think about it. I'm not going to give it away, because that would be considered a spoiler, but let me just say to anyone who is planning on seeing this movie for the first time: Put your thinking cap on or you are going to be very confused by the time it ends.  Now to the technical parts of the film. David Lynch's directing is amazing. Definately deserving of his Oscar nomination. All of the actors are terrific, especially Naomi Watts. The audition scene alone contains an incredible performance by her. The cinematography is brilliant. Truly great camera work on this one.There's not that much bad about ""Mulholland Drive"". In my opinion though, the last 45 minutes or so of the movie are perhaps a bit TOO bizarre. And also, some of the scenes in this movie seem to have no connection to the rest of the movie, such as the dwarf. I don't quite understand what the purpose of him was, although I am thinking maybe it was just to add to the eeriness of the film. And believe me, it is eerie. At times it is disturbing, most of the time unbelievably bizarre, and at certain points just scary. Sum-up: ""Mulholland Drive"" is probably a ""love it or hate it"" movie. There's no denying that it is beautifully shot. Brilliant direction and cinematography, and good acting. It will definatley be a bit too strange for some people's tastes. It also contains some very mature themes towards the end. So, all in all, ""Mulholland Drive"" is a great movie, but so weird that it could be too difficult for some to get.",Mulholland Drive
671,paulispinel,Beautiful... Just beautiful. Mixed emotions. A masterpiece.,10,14 April 2010,"Oh God, I don't know where to start. First, this movie is my favorite. Why? Watching this movie just changed my life... yeah, maybe too exaggerated, but it's true. The way of watching movies, and interpreting them. I'd like to see Mulholland Drive as a TV series, just like it was supposed to be... but not now, I think this movie can't be more perfect. Lynch is a genius! The concept, the simbology, clues, characters, EVERYTHING! is stunning. To watch this movie, you have to pay attention every second, every action and every event has a reason to be. Dreams vs. Reality. There are plenty theories about the movie...And I think that every theory might be right in some sense, but you may have your own theory, and no one can't change your mind or mine. All the references and connections that you can get with this movie... It keeps me amazing me every time, and I just can't stop thinking about this movie. It's kinda stucked in my head. The movie is sad though. The end just breaks my heart. It's hard to believe that almost all the movie is Diane's dream, though it was too ""perfect"". Diane's love and the need for Camilla is too big, and it's reflected in her dream... the way that she wanted it to be... (Because Camilla should be dead in the dream part).But in the reality, their love was not that easy. Diane's love for Camilla turned into hatred for a few reasons (you must see the movie to understand it by yourself). And though Diane wanted Camilla for help her to get some roles in her movies, she totally loved her to death (in this case, it is so true).It's a beautiful experience you must watch... At the end, or you love it or you hate it... nothing in between. You decide whether this is a boring or an entertaining movie. It's all up to you, but i recommend you to see it more than once.To finish, I want to say that the roles in this movie were brilliants. Naomi did one of her best interpretations I've ever seen. She did a great parallel between Betty/Diane, loved her in these roles. I doubt why Laura Harring didn't ""jump"" more into the fame and made some good movies. She was stunning in MD, she acted so well, like the perfect Rita/Camilla. Justin was great too, awesome interpretation for Adam Kesher. And the rest of the crew was fantastic too.Guess that's all, and I think I don't need to repeat how wonderful this movie is. Highly recommended. A perfect 10/10.",Mulholland Drive
672,dustin_abraham,This move=poster child for say no to drugs,3,15 May 2003,"I may have a SPOILER in here, so I'll warn before hand. David Lynch must have been on some good stuff to have written this. It seems to me like something that someone on acid started writing and then handed it to the drunk to add a scene or two...and so on. I feel that I am a fairly intelligent person, I am a college student with a 3.57 GPA, but after watching this movie I still had no idea what it was about. I got my Bettys and my Dianes and my Ritas and my Camillas all confused. I have no idea what the two guys at the restaurant have to do with the movie or what the deal was with the two elderly people from the airport. For a second I thought I had it figured out. I thought that Rita (or so she's called) had amnesia, but she was really Camilla Rhodes an actress for whom Diane was in love with. Diane came into the picture posing as Betty because she wanted Camilla to love her and not the movie director...but, then why didn't Coco and the neighbor lady recognize Betty as Diane, if Coco was the director's mother. And who was the Cowboy or the dude who shot the other guy and the woman by accident and the janitor (which was the most entertaining scene of the movie, and that includes the lesbian scenes). Who was the other Camilla Rhodes and the crippled mob guy with the goofy head...Not one darn thing made sense in this film. This movie is a lot like a music video from the band Tool (if you are familiar with that) in that a lot of stuff is going on and you don't know if it actually has a meaning or if someone just said 'it would be cool if we put that in there.' However Tool videos are slighty more entertaining than this movie...I gave it a 2 out of 10. This movie would probably be cool if you were doped up on mushrooms but I'm not that kind of person.",Mulholland Drive

During that retarded part of the movie the blond starts having a seizure for a bit of the magician's act. Then they both start crying when the Latino lady dies, or whatever the hell she does? From that point forward in the movie, the entire story goes to crap!Nothing makes sense anymore at all from that point forward. I figure the director at this point was just thinking to himself... ""Hmm... well, we have two hot chicks.., a story that doesn't make any logical sense anymore...

Yes it's dark and really keeps you on the edge of your seat for a while. But despite that, this movie has its head way too far up its own ass to be even half way decent as a movie and drags on so long that you'll totally lose interest in what good aspects it has by the end of it. This movie tries so hard to be deep and artsy that it completely fails in its attempt to be either one. It has ridiculous plot twists that make no sense and really have no bearing on a decent or logical plot. I don't care how much time you spend analyzing it, the fact is, there is no way to look at this movie that makes it not suck. Maybe it's the one chick's dream or a look at how disillusioning Hollywood can be but none of that matters. Don't believe the hype. Bad bad bad. This movie is just so bad.",Mulholland Drive

677,stamfragk98,"Will Probably Leave You Speechless And Confused And From My Point Of View, It Requieres A Second Watching.",10,2 September 2014,"Okay, I've just finished watching this movie for the second time after I watched it two days ago for the first time. I have to be honest, when I watched it completely the first time, I seriously felt challenged; because I couldn't understand a thing! I really wasn't able to fully conceive what I had just saw... Maybe it is just me, although this second time I watched it with a friend and she was as lost as I was the fist time I saw it. So to make myself understood, I absolutely think that in order to make sense out of this film, you either have to watch it again very carefully, or maybe if you are some kind of a genius and you're really concentrated, you might catch it with the first try... Well, in my case, I just read all about it and after that I couldn't stop thinking about this film! After I had all the pieces of this confusing, yet enjoyable puzzle together and of course having watched it once before, I was able now; with my second viewing to truly appreciate this masterpiece as a whole! From where I stand, yes, I find this film quite difficult to comprehend with only one viewing, so I believe it is essential to watch it again! Not only did I picked up all the elements that the director leaves, even from the beginning, for us to see, but I have made out some of my own theories and also have a better understanding of the characters' actions; especially Diane's. Diane is such a complex character and the more you think of her and the things she's been through, you acquire a much better understanding of what is going on, after the illusion starts to spring. This movie is indeed like a puzzle, begging to be solved, and once it is solved, you just love it and everything is so much easier! Mulholland Drive is such a challenge and it is just so worth it; there aren't that many films that give us the chance to analyse endlessly the scenes and the actions and the emotions behind each character and that is why, I now consider this film to be one of my personal favorites. Another thing that I find stunning about Mulholland Dr., is that it just shows us how much we can unravel, just from a person's subconscious and in this case Diane's'; even though almost the whole film consists of her somewhat of an illusion/dream, we feel as though we know her, we know how she feels, we know that she didn't want to end up like this, we see the person she truly wanted to be, her ideal self, we get why she was driven mad! I believe that her dream self Betty is a hidden part of her, a part of her that she could have been... It is tragic, it is beautiful, it is haunting, it is confusing and yet in the end it all makes sense. 10/10, and mark my words, after you watch it, read about the ""secret elements"" and give it another go. Beware, for it is not an ""easy"" film, for one to just pass some time, it requires concentration.",Mulholland Drive
678,bradjanet,An interpretation.,9,6 April 2018,"To explain my take would take a very long time, so I will just mention a couple of aspects ... the film is shot through with references to Greek mythology ... note that the old people in the early sequences are exaggeratedly kind and smiley ... and in the later scenes how they harass and drive Diane to madness? ... the old lady says her name is Irene ... in Greek myths, the Eryines are entities which can either be ""The Kindly Ones"", which is what the name means, but they are also The Furies, who hound and harass the guilty, especially those guilty of murder, to madness and death. In both roles they preside over justice.
Another Greek myth is represented by the mysterious blue box, which, when it is opened by Betty/Diane, brings her back to the sordid, crime ridden world of the second half, after the suspiciously glamorous and successful first half populated by ""Betty"" and ""Rita"" ... this, I believe is Pandora's box, which released all the evils of the world ... it is also probably a reference to Alice's rabbit-hole, which also takes her to what I believe is a nightmarish, rather than a dream world. The scenes in the diner belong to the evil world of the second half, but they leak into the dream world as flashes of reality into ""Betty's"" consciousness., 
There is also a scene in the cafe, where, hardly noticed in the background, a body is dumped in a dumpster ... was this the body of Camilla, killed by the hitman Diane hired? This, I believe is the guilt Diane experiences as her lover's murderer
So, the first part represents the fantasy life that Diane, as ""Betty"" has constructed for herself ... see how easily she waltzes into a very successful audition? ... after the box, she is plunged into a much harder, philistine, money and gangster dominated, cynical world of Hollywood, symbolised by the hideous man at the back of the diner, and by the cowboy.",Mulholland Drive

So I did. & to cut the long story short, it's nothing life changing.I'm pretty confident I realized the entire plot, every single clue, all the intentional character misplacements and the whole irrational logic which is essential to the nature of a dream, but at the end, it all seemed heavy handed and unappealing within the constructs of a film.I specially despised the movie score which was at times painfully monotonous & add to that a scrambled chronology and some douchey characters who appear out of nowhere and say stuff. Just a few reasons in a long line of why I'm not so fussed about this movie. Admired as it might be, it will get no more than 3 stars from me, out of 10 of course.

Lots of story, atmosphere, and some very interesting characters.  I liked this movie, but I would have liked it more if I only understood it.  I think the Silencio theatre scene made sense... nothing was real. OK, I got that. I got the money in the purse and the blue key. But what about the ugly guy behind the restaurant? Who was he? The devil? What was the cowboy doing waking up the dead girl? And what were we watching?  The afterlife? A hallucination?  Why the little people and why did the devil send them?  And who or what was the blue-haired woman?  I'm sure that if I thought about it, more questions would pop up. So why is this still a good movie?  It's because the story pulls you in.  The way that it weaves.  You feel like you know these people.  Their lives make sense.  You care about their fate.  The music and stage design set up a mood that lures you in.

Sometimes I even think I hate the very concept of a man-made story and prefer documentary's about reality. Another alternative to every day t.v.-show basics is the abstract work of David Lynch. I love watching a David Lynch movie perhaps even just for being so different. There is definitely a lot of talent and skill involved with David Lynch to make his movies the experience they are. But what I miss, since twin peaks / blue velvet is depth and coherence. It's almost become like playing out the abstract thing. I liked watching Lost Highway too, but on hindsight there's not much left of the affection I still feel for twin peaks. I have just seen this movie and can't be sure, but it seems like Mulholland Dr. is going that way too. People are going on about this being the sort of film to see more times.

That brief opening shot of a woman in bed is Diane and the first 2/3 of the movie is her dream.  There is no Betty, except maybe a spirit inside of Diane that died long ago.  When Diane wakes up, the ""real"" movie begins. Her lesbian lover, Camilla, has decided to settle down with Adam.  This further scars Diane, who hires a hitman to kill Camilla.

684,gethistr8,My preparedness prior to viewing this film was inadequate.,8,4 December 2001,"This film was intersting, but it wen't nowhere. I am a stranger to Lynch's directing style, so instead of sitting back and enjoying the style of the film, I was waiting for the plot to unravel the entire time.  Needless to say, if you go into this film looking for a conclusive and satisfying ending then this is not the film for you.  It's intersting.  I was watching HBO about a year ago, and was watching a film that I found nearly as confusing. I couldn't remember it's title.  Then, after having seen this film I realized there was a similarity in styles between the two films.  I looked up Lynch's track record, and there I found that movie I had been searching for.  Lost highway.  Really cool film, and as of right NOW I would have to say that I enjoyed that film moreso than Mulholland.  I will have to rewatch this movie again though sometime now that I have a greater understanding of Lynch's approach to film-making.  Normally I like going into a film knowing nothing about it.  In this case, doing so took away from the film because I found myself confused, frustrated, and just wanting the damn thing to end.Right now my rating is a 3 of 10....but I realize that subsequent to a second viewing, which will happen eventually, my review may be a bit more optimistic (but anything above an 8 I would doubt....I'm still a bit surprised at how high the ratings have been, regardless of Lynch's history as a director)....Movies should be more to entertain, not utterly confuse, which is what I found this film to do.  But hey, can't say I didn't like the lesbian scenes.  The brunette woman is absolutely gorgeous!",Mulholland Drive
685,dawidbleja,Treat it like a dream...,9,6 March 2002,"The first, and biggest, mistake to make while watching Mulholland Drive is undoubtedly the one that most viewers will make: To try and understand it. We've been force-fed linear, narrative, films with simple cause-and-effect plots so much that we find it almost inconceivable that a film could be made any other way. So when we see one that isn't, we think that the film-maker is confused, pretentious, or slack.   Most films are made predominantly for the intellect (this doesn't mean, of course, that most films are intelligent): to appreciate these films you have to use your mind. We are so used to mentally understanding films that many of us forget that there are other ways to understand things. For example, through intuition. Mulholland drive is a film that should be received with intuition. Treat it something like you would a dream.  Imagine that you've just had a strange, wondrous (or scary) dream that was full of bizarre things. There were some people in it that you know, but they weren't quite the same as they are in real life. Perhaps they were the same, but they looked like someone else. Other things in the dream were just plain unexplainable. One second you're in one place, then, without any reason, the next you're somewhere else. I won't go on, I'm sure you can remember many weird dreams you've had that were somewhat similar to this, and that left a deep impression on you. Well, when you wake up from one of these dreams, you don't say ""My God, what a stupid dream that was! It didn't make any bloody sense! Man, am I an idiot for having these dumb unrealistic dreams - why can't my dreams by like my everyday life, and not weird, illogical rubbish like that!!"" I doubt many people say that after a truly strange and affecting, dream. I'm assuming that most people have a similar reaction to mine: they contemplate it in silence for a while, because it affected them. They can still FEEL the imprint of the dream in them. They can still remember, or even still feel, the various emotions that they were feeling. They go over it in their head and try and better comprehend it - but it belongs more in a sort of a netherworld than in the reality they are in when they wake up, so they'll never understand it fully. But they appreciate it nevertheless, glad that they had such a strange, interesting, and wondrous experience to start the day off with (if it was an unpleasant dream, then they're probably less glad, but not necessarily). And try explaining such a dream to someone else! You know it was such a fantastic dream, because you lived it, but anyone else just nods politely and says, ""yeah, well that does sound weird"". Because what you experienced wasn't just a bunch of ideas that you can simply put into words and tell someone else, it was more - you also experienced it through your emotions and your intuition.   Mulholland Drive, as Lost Highway was, is in many ways similar to a dream. The viewer who walks away saying that it was confused, pointless gibberish is the fool who has entirely missed the point - the fool who would wake up from a dream and complain that it was illogical.
  Similarly, the viewer who ponders it endlessly desperately trying to figure out exactly what every part of the film meant, trying to neatly package everything in a rational, ordered manner, is like the child trying to force the square-shaped block into the star-shaped hole.
  So, when you see this film, don't limit your experience by trying to understand it intellectually. Remember that there's more than one way to experience a film, and that some should be felt more than understood. By all means, think about the film and discuss it afterwards with friends, but don't listen to anyone that thinks they've got it all worked out, because they haven't (David Lynch himself says that he doesn't understand all of the mysteries in it  so how could anyone else?) . And if they spent so much time mentally battling with the film, trying to cognitively understand it, then they probably spent much less time feeling it and letting it simply overwhelm them. And their experience will be all the poorer for it. So don't you make that mistake, because you'll be passing up the opportunity of a pretty great, unique film experience.   ;)",Mulholland Drive

It's barely B-movie quality. 1) The plot is contrived and farcical, except Lynch takes this mess too seriously. All the good stuff must have happened in Lynch's head because it sure didn't make it to the screen. 2)The dialog is stiff, forced, awkward, and stale. 3)The acting is horrendous, amateurish and completely unbelievable. The cast is wooden and uncomfortable in their roles. They are trying too hard, they look like they are acting. 4) As a director, Lynch completely failed his cast--he failed to coax competent roles out of anyone, allowing some very good actors to turn in the worst performances of their careers. They should be ashamed to have been associated with Mulholland Dr. 5) Editing can often save horrible films and elevate them at least to ""watchable"". Unfortunately Lynch's editors didn't do him any favors. Mulholland Dr. drags on like a bad french film. 6) The audio and score are the final nails in the coffin. Dramatic overtones are used too frequently when there is nothing dramatic or sinister going on. The moody organ music is cheesy and completely out of place.I get the whole ""surprise"" ending and the psychotic obsession thing at the end but it doesn't excuse the overall poor quality and amateurish execution of this film. There is no brilliance here, just misguided vision. I cant believe this movie could be nominated for anything, and has so many high reviews.",Mulholland Drive

One occurs throughout old Hollywood, in the shop-worn jewel- toned culturally recycled 'old' downtown and in the hills of the more established privileged, elite Los Angeles; the other in the hinterlands of the suburban/rural California desert. Both hail from a culturally complex southwest, specific to or influenced by a uniquely L.A./Southern California/southwest USA ethos. These movies couldn't have happened anywhere else or they would be different films entirely.This is the kind of movie that cannot simply be spoonfed to one like 99.9% of movies and other commercial media. It has to be experienced on many levels simultaneously, interwoven with mystical spiritualism, magical realism and ever-changing mythologies -- and yet to experience it means that it goes far beyond those limiting attempts to describe this masterpiece.Mulholland Drive is mystical and magical, spiritual and physical, intellectual, emotional, soulful, visual ... meta-sensory, extra-sensory and ultra-sensory -- it simply cannot be categorized or dissected nor completely understood.

The film combines the mysterious noir elements of ""Blue Velvet,"" the dream-like horror of ""Fire Walk With Me,"" and the bizarre structure of ""Lost Highway.""  People going to see this film expecting everything to tie up in a nice little bow at the end will be severely disappointed.  However, anyone who wants to take a strange and wonderful trip that sucks you in and keeps your mind churning for weeks afterward are going to love it.Lynch has clearly proven himself as a narrative storyteller with such films as ""The Elephant Man,"" and ""The Straight Story,"" and now he is taking the art of filmmaking in a new direction.  I believe some people will be frustrated with the movie because they simply have no point of reference to compare it with.  Others, who are more open minded to entering a dream world where things are so real and yet so unreal at the same time, are going to watch this film over and over and over.  The film at times is horrifying, at other times hilarious, and features one of the hottest sex scenes in motion picture history.  The performances are brilliant.  To describe the plot or give anything away would not do the film justice; it simply has to be experienced.""Mulholland Drive"" brings to mind Billy Wilder's classic ""Sunset Boulevard,"" which also explored the darker side of both Hollywood and human nature in an unconventionally narrative way.  Mulholland Drive, the road, parallels Sunset Boulevard the road in Los Angeles, yet it is much darker, with many hidden twists and turns.  ""Mulholland Drive"" the film works the same way, except this time we are experiencing Hollywood and human nature from the point of view of David Lynch.I think that with the right distributor, this film could do very well. This film should win Oscars.  When ""Fire Walk With Me"" came out, it bombed critically as well as with audiences, yet it is now considered one of the best films of the 90's by many critics and fans.  I think people are ready for a film like ""Mulholland Drive,"" as an alternative to the God awful crap that the studios are feeding us on a weekly basis.  If this film had been a television series, it would have been popular than ""Twin Peaks"" was at its height.  As a feature film, ""Mulholland Drive"" will stand as an landmark for the next wave of filmmaking.",Mulholland Drive

Some of my observations about the film (based on the assumption that the whole of the first section is Diane's dream on the night that her contract killing of Camilla is carried out):The cowboy - In the real world, he is a character Diane sees at Adam's party. In her dream, he is a mysterious controlling figure. I think, in fact, his main function is to represent David Lynch himself, and Adam in that scene represents the (increasingly confused) cinema audience. He thanks Adam for coming such a long way out to see him (thanking the audience for watching a film that appears to have wild plot deviations); Adam then asks him what's on his mind, and where this is leading to (this is the audience wondering exactly the same thing about the film). The cowboy mildly rebukes Adam for wanting to 'get straight down to it', and then delivers the greatest piece of advice for any audience watching this movie: 'I want you to think - can you do that for me?'. This whole scene is Lynch gently warning us that this whole film is going to take some careful thought to figure out, and not to expect some simple explanation on a plate.We then see him twice in quick succession opening the door to Diane's room, right at the end of her dream. For her, this signifies that she has done wrong, and as it's the last thing in her dream before she wakes up, it is probably what she is thinking about when she's sitting on the bed - that it was wrong for her to have Camilla killed. For us the audience, the reappearance of the cowboy (as a representation of Lynch himself)and his words that it's 'time to get up' are possibly a clue that the dream section of the film is about to end, and the real section is about to begin.
The mafia people - again, these are people Diane knows from Adam's entourage in real life, though she may not know very much about them. In her dream, she turns them into gangsters running the film business - but their real reason d'etre is to humiliate Adam as much as possible (more below) and to stop him from giving Camilla the part. Although it is never stated in the dream, it must be assumed that if Adam were to have his choice of leading lady, it would be Camilla. But this is the very last thing Diane wants, so in her dream, the mafia stop it happening.Humiliation of Adam - Diane's dream is also her fantasy, where everything she wanted to happen does happen. She is friendly, vivacious and purposeful. Everyone she meets is nice to her. Camilla depends on her. She is a fantastic actress, and her ability is recognised as soon as she arrives in LA. And all the way through the dream, she exacts her revenge on Adam for stealing Camilla from her. The mob force him to change his leading lady. His wife is in bed with the swimming pool cleaner (a scenario Diane dreams up from the remark he made at his party); he gets beaten up and covered in paint; his film is shut down, all his money is cut off, and he's reduced to living in a seedy hotel. And finally, in the audition scene, she dreams that he lusts after her, but then she turns and disappears, out of reach and unavailable.
Club Silencio - probably means many different things - but a possible interpretation is that it's one huge clue that we're watching a dream, where we can hear a band, but of course because it's a dream, there is no band - nothing of what we see is real. The reason both girls become so upset whilst in the club is because they have both realised this very fact - they are inhabiting a dream, it is not real, and the love they have shared is nothing more than a fantasy.
Hope someone out there agrees with all this! I think MH is quite possibly the greatest film I've seen - it is so rich, inventive, beautiful, hilarious, sad, terrible and just light years ahead of anything else I've seen.",Mulholland Drive

No, the end of this film, as confusing as it is, is circular. Its as if the clue that brings it all together must be found in our own minds. When I first heard that the film didn't make sense, I expected a big giant goldfish to show up on screen out of nowhere for a completely abstract ending.  Instead, what we get is something that connects to earlier characters and plot, and its as if we're missing the special 3-D glasses to see the entire puzzle.  But it doesn't matter, having been prepared, I was able to enjoy the film as a piece of dream cinema, and it was great. The two leads are amazing, and it was hilarious to see the audience in the theatre start to squirm and ask ""WTF"" as the relationship between them slides from friendship, to love, to dark jealousy and hatred.  You can construct your own explanation for this film, but either way, its strangely hypnotic.  If you like something different and challenging in your movie going, then Mulholland Drive is for you.  Mystery buffs how need an ending and a villain in handcuffs need not apply. I can't wait to get this on DVD.",Mulholland Drive

695,grotchly,My interpretation,8,10 June 2002,"This is a difficult movie.  I didn't get it at first, but upon watching parts a second time I felt like I had a better understanding of what happened.  I think a lot of people don't want to commit ANOTHER 2 1/2 hours of their time to see if they can make sense of it.  I think you can watch it once and then just watch the first 5 minutes and the last 45 minutes or so to get it. The movie to me feels like when you wake up after a real jarring, vivid dream.  You think how amazing the dream was, but then you have all these pieces that don't fit together.  Nonetheless, you think of it as a great dream and you enjoy thinking about it the next day. ***SPOILERS AHEAD!*** Here is what I think the story is in a nutshell (then I will explain from where these conclusions come): Diane is in a relationship with Camilla.  Camilla breaks it off with Diane because Camilla got involved with the director.  Diane is crushed.  She was already depressed being a struggling actress in Hollywood and playing second fiddle to Camilla.  Now she lost Camilla and if she can't have her, then neither can he.  So she hires a hit man with the money she inherited from her aunt.  Camilla is killed by the hit man.  The cops are on to her.  She is having a nervous breakdown and the film chronicles the night (her horrid dreams) and day before she kills herself. Where I got this: Once you can put together the timeline, it makes sense.  At about 2 hours into the movie when Diane wakes up, that is a moment in the present. Everything else is either a dream or fantasy. Diane is woken up by her neighbor wanting her belongings.  The neighbor takes her ashtray from the table.  Notice there is an almost empty glass on the table in an otherwise clean apartment.  It looks like it is there from the night before.  Diane starts having flashbacks from the days before while she is making coffee as well as some delusions about Camilla (now dead) coming back. Then there is the lesbian sex scene flashback that, hilariously enough, distracts everyone from the clues on the table.  The glass and the ashtray (no key) are there telling you it happened before in time.Then there are other scenes she remembers from that day(s).  Camilla urges her to come to the dinner party.  That's where much of her dream imagery comes from - the characters (Cowboy, the Italians), the stories (pool boy). And she is stating how she feels like a nobody to everyone at the table. She is starting to unravel.  When Diane sees at the party she has lost Camilla, she hires the hit man out of jealous rage the next morning (or sometime right after).  Then she gets the key that signifies Camilla was killed. Then she has her breakdown and must get drunk or something.  Because at the beginning of the film it looks like Diane getting off the floor and climbing into bed (the red pillow).  Then she has her nightmare (the 1st 2 hours of the film). In her dream she is prettier, has it all together and is a killer actress. Many things from reality crop up in the dream in distorted form.  The blue key, her couch, the names and people are all skewed. I could go on into how the dream uses many Freudian concepts of dream images - both where they came from and what they represent in her life, but at this point I think it would make you sick.  And you could always watch it again to have some more fun. Finally she sits in her apartment all day lamenting over the situation. She had Camilla killed.  She has no money.  She has no career.  And she knows the detectives are after her.  She hears the knock at the door and runs to the bedroom and shoots herself. I gave the movie an 8.  I think it is a brilliantly made movie.  Incredible imagery, great editing, frightening at times, and an amazing portrayal of a person's delusional thinking after experiencing great loss and their desperate attempts for a solution to what seems like an impossible situation. I don't think this film is for everyone.  The reason I didn't give it a higher rating is because it loses most of its audience and requires a second viewing.  I don't think that is fair to an audience.  If you pay to see it in the theater, you should only have to see it once to get it.  Nonetheless, an amazing achievement worth watching if you can commit the time to it.",Mulholland Drive

697,clay_animator,what the what?,2,8 May 2010,"I've heard it said somewhere that David Lynch doesn't really write stories as much as he write scenes. He admitted to thinking up scenes he thought would be cool and then figuring out how they would fit in later.This movie is an extraordinarily good example of that. I can accept that the scenes don't really have much to do with each other, but they are presented in a way that makes it seem as though they do. The scene at the silencio, I know they went there to ultimately get the box, but that was like a five minutes scene. Why did we watch that show? What purpose did it serve? While I was watching it, I kept thinking back to Donnie Darko. I didn't leave that movie understanding everything that happened, but I left feeling like there was a deeper meaning that I didn't realize yet. I didn't get that feeling while I was watching Mulholland Drive. I felt like I had just watched stuff happen for two and a half hours. Perhaps each scene was meant to have a deeper meaning. If Lynch writes in scenes and not movies, that's entirely possible. But please, don't bother trying to fit it into a story like these events are in some way related. The Diner Face Nightmare scene near the beginning of the film was a decent scene in it's own right. But I have a problem when the movie insists on saying that the scene is in some way related to everything else happening in the movie.Someone else on here compared it to a puzzle with missing pieces, I say it's about 5 different puzzles mixed together with half of the pieces missing.",Mulholland Drive
698,tlarry858,The film is nothing more than a study in gross self-indulgence and pretension.,1,11 October 2002,"A fine cast of journeyman actors is wasted in this dismal swamp of innuendo and surrealistic melodrama.  Also wasted are an interesting beginning and an intriguing premise.  At the film's opening, we see an attempted murder foiled by an automobile accident.  The intended victim, Rita (Laura Elena Harring), a dark, mysterious beauty, escapes death but suffers from amnesia. When she is befriended by Betty (Naomi Watts), a perky blond who has just arrived from the Midwest (Deep River, Ontario) to seek fame and fortune in Hollywood, the film rapidly develops into a quest for personal identity and truth.  United by the noble bonds of friendship, the two women intrepidly stalk the surreal streets and sun-drenched beautiful places of a Beverly Hills that is rife with danger and suspense.  Lynch's ability to create an atmosphere thick with the fear of potential violence works well in the first quarter of the film, but toward the middle, bored by all of this innuendo, we eventually say ""who cares?""  Questions are raised, but none are answered. This is like taxation without representation.The film's promising elements-mysterious lives in the haunts of the rich and famous-slowly, methodically, and ponderously dissolve like so much grease down the tubes with the Draino.  Mulholland Drive becomes merely fodder for Lynch, the Great Trickster, who, in failing to invest his film with a heart, soul, and (worst of all) a brain, perpetrates the greatest outrage against his audience.  By its robust ineptitude, the film mocks not only itself, in a self-referential chic, but also the people who have actually paid good money to see it.One scene, in particular, is instructive.  At one point, giving way to insomnia, the two friends, Betty (the blond) and the Rita (the brunette), who are by now also lovers, hail a cab that deposits them in the seedy side of town.  Here a thin, cold winds blow discarded candy wrappers and the yellowed pages from ancient dailies to and fro.  The scene is Lynch's Little Magic Theatre (aka the Club Silencio). The theatre is a cheesy old movie house unimaginatively converted into a kind of night club.  Most of its tiered seats are unoccupied, as the Blond and the Brunette sit down together and look anxiously at the stage. Almost immediately, a sad sack of a woman is physically helped on to the stage. Perhaps she has stage fright or has read the script.  A sonorous, plaintive ballad, sung in Spanish, begins to emerge from within this dowdy woman with misapplied makeup.Though she looks like a fugitive from a Tijuana Red Light District, or from someone's (the director's?) nightmare, the soulful ballad works its melodious way into every nook and crevice of the theatre.  Betty and Rita, apparently transfigured by the lyrics and melody, begin to cry so fluidly that makeup and mascara run, and Betty soon looks like Tammy Baker at a funeral.But are the women crying because the song is so soulful, so beautiful, or because they are stuck contractually  in this dismal bog of cinematic bi-polarism?  At one point, Betty's chair contracts a severe case of Saint Vitas Dance, and threatens to hop, skip, and shudder its way to the back ward of the local hospital.  (Shades of the Exorcist?) But Rita is ready with moral support and is able to subdue the chair, which, ashamed of its histrionics, settles back into its former existence as an uncomfortable seat in a cheap theatre. Once the obsessed chair is exorcised, we remind ourselves that more horrors await us, just around the shadowy corner.  Perhaps the Bag-Man-Who-Looks-Like-A-Buddhist-Demon will pounce, showing a cavernous jaw filled with bad teeth and halitosis. Caution:  SpoilerThis cheerful scene in Lynch's Magic Little Theatre ends when the zombie-like ballad singer finally collapses on the stage and two men, ticket taker and diabolical Master of Ceremonies, haul her unceremoniously off the stage.  Well, at least she doesn't get the bum's rush.  Strange thing is, though, the song continues.  Behold, the deft stroke of the Mountebank! The song was not sung by the plump, odd woman with the bad hair and makeup. Apparently, the song is coming from a loudspeaker-appearance versus reality, perhaps?  Well, gee, but hasn't this been done before, and so much better, in, say, Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup (1966)-or scores of other more artful and accomplished films?",Mulholland Drive

You see, its a film about death. The actress kills herself, at the guilt of having her lover killed, and is transported to hell. This is done far more effectively in Hellraiser Inferno. and the plot is actually competent in that movie. The thing that gets people is that a bunch of random characters are introduced, to no purpose, and a bunch of random freaky stuff happens, all purposefully edited, out of sequential order by Lynch, to make matters more confusing. It's an attempt to make people think there is a lot more going on in the film, than there actually is.Imagine watching Hellraiser Inferno, but edited in such a way you are completely clueless about what's going on. Then imagine the final reveal is taken away from Inferno, and the film just ends there. And imagine that Inferno is padded out to 2 and a half hours, with more bizarre imagery and nonsensical stuff.

702,reasonablyniceperson,Skip it.,1,28 January 2020,"""Mulholland Dr."" is sometimes described as being a being mystery movie. That it is. For this reviewer, the biggest mystery is how and why it was ever released to the public.The film starts out promisingly enough with some first rate acting by Naomi Watts as Betty, a stereotypically naive all-American Girl who comes to Los Angeles from Anytown, USA to seek fame and fortune on the silver screen. The viewer soon comes to realize, however, that Ms. Watts' deft portrayal of the hopeful, starry-eyed young actress is actually an exercise in High Camp at its highest and campiest - which was surely the effect that director David Lynch was trying to achieve. Lest there be any doubt about this, the manager of the apartment complex where Betty is staying is played by (believe it or not) Ann Miller. Yes, THAT Ann Miller, who plays a character named Coco. One has to wonder if Ms. Miller realized what she was getting into when she agreed to appear in this senseless waste of celluloid.Since those early scenes constitute the highlight of the film, that would be a good time for a forewarned viewer to leave. Many of those who remain will be Hipper-than-Thou types, possibly under the influence of certain mind-altering substances. They will probably love it and declare David Lynch to be a true auteur of the highest order.

Having watched it a second time I have come to feel that this is actually one of the elements I like about the film, and it makes me respect David Lynch even more as a director. Instead of having everything spelt out for you the movie leaves you to figure things out yourself. The distorted plot, strange characters and settings will stick in your mind for days as you try to determine exactly what was going on. The music in the film was great too, with an eerie tune underlying many scenes that filled them with atmosphere and a strange tension, and makes some scenes really creepy. I found myself gripped to the movie at several moments, wondering what was going to be thrown at me next. I thought Naomi Watts was excellent, in my mind this is one of her best performances (and let's be honest, you can't totally knock a film that contains sex scenes between Naomi Watts and Laura Harring).

The fact that he remains an outsider filmmaker, after a career as studded with great films as Stanley Kubrick's, is a standing accusation of Hollywood, as I'm sure Kubrick's career was. Right now his latest film is out, yet my hometown isn't showing it. I can't believe that. The latest schlock from whoever is there, but not David Lynch's latest.I keep hearing that Mulholland Drive is hard to understand. I don't get it. I think that, like almost all his films, it's much clearer than the kind of stitched together narratives that seem typical even of many good films. A gal comes to Hollywood, full of dreams - the old cliché. She doesn't do so well, but she does find love, she thinks. She ends up betrayed, on a lot of different levels, perhaps most importantly, by her own hopes, and she kills herself in despair. I think it's a pretty simple film. But Mulholland Drive is deep too. It's about the darkness, inside us and outside us, that can drive our lives towards nothingness, but also about the resilience that clings to hope, reaches out for redemption, even when all hope is lost.Naomi Watts. My God, in view of what she has done since Mulholland Drive, how did she pull off such a magnificent, detailed, emotional, transcendent performance? How did she do it? Well, I guess Lynch played a role in that. But wow.Mulholland drive is a modern day Wizard of Oz. It lives in a Valhalla of film perfection that few films ever achieve.

My partner and I are regular film-goers and we saw Mulholland Drive following the slew of awards and critical acclaim this film has received. After David Lynch's The Straight Story, I was particularly looking forward to viewing this film but I was very disappointed. If nothing else, this is a self-indulgent orgy. Like Lynch's Blue Velvet, the film has a promising start but three-quarters of the way through, it takes a bizarre turn and we are taken onto David Lynch's too-often-travelled-road. The ""dramatics"" included are too familiar: the colour blue, the dark mysterious woman, the sense of panic, the patriarchal society's view of lesbianism (this part is just an insult and completely unnecessary). I have no idea why people are raving about this uneven film with a flimsy plot-line. Although the cinematography and some of the acting (particularly the leading performance by Naomi Watts - it is inaccurate that she is being cited as a supporting actress) are quite good, there is little to stimulate and there is little to ponder after seeing this film.

Which I think is really the best way to enjoy this film - let it wash over you like a dream and when you wake up (when the movie ends) you'll figure it out. There is a point. Keep your eyes on the blue box - it's the key (no pun intended) to when dreams turn into reality. Don't try to fit every thread and character into your rationalization - not every part of every dream makes sense (it also helps to realize that this was originally supposed to be a TV show, and so many characters were introduced who stories never got to be fully told). One way to think of it is dreams as wish-fulfillment. In our fantasies and dreams, waking and not, we recast the players in our life as we wish they were - the lover who has spurned us becomes weak and dependent on us.

Lynch is a poet, his films are poetry, poetry is about feelings and emotion; find the answers there. The truth of the story does not lie in your being able to puzzle it all out. The truth will be found in your reactions to it. Emily Dickinson wrote: There's a certain slant of light/On winter afternoons/That oppresses, like the weight/Of cathedral tunes. Heavenly hurt it gives us/We can find no scar/But internal difference/Where the meanings are. Why does that light oppress us? It makes no objective sense, and yet it does disturb us. Lynch's films are like that slant of light: contemplation of why we find the scenes disturbing, or comical, or heartbreaking is of far more importance than nailing down ""what it all means.""

Good news, everybody! David Lynch is convinced that you still have a soul, one that can evaluate, accept, or reject input according to your own free will. Don't expect simple answers to all life's mysteries. Sometimes you can study and puzzle it out all you want, and after all that work, the best you will be able to come up with is a hushed ""Silencio"" There's nothing wrong with that.",Mulholland Drive

I could not get into this movie because of the hammy acting and the weirdness for the sake of weirdness. I like odd stories and images but they don't have resonance if there is no logic behind them.  Here the director just threw in a bunch of stuff he thought looked neat.  I think movies fail if they can't draw the viewer in and at least make some sort of sense.  On top of everything else this film is long with far to many shots of folks looking into space and cars pulling in and out of driveways, parking spots, etc.  Just a long mess of a movie.You have to give it up to Watts though, she is fantastic and the shooting of the vacuum and the terrifying first shot of the homeless being are wonderful moments.",Mulholland Drive

720,jvddoes,"Interested in content, see it thrice!",8,24 September 2002,"On first view, Mulholland Drive is enigmatic. But on second view about all riddles are solved, and on third view only brilliant superficiality remains. Besides Naomi Watts' acting, it is this steep learning curve that I enjoyed most when viewing it. Anyway, here is my solution to this apparent labyrinth, after having found values for all relevant parameters in the movie's final thirty minutes.*In her youth, Diane Selwyn (Deep River, Ontario; Canada) has won a dancing contest, which makes her decide to start acting. She has the ambition to conquer Hollywood. When her aunt dies, who lived in Los Angeles working for the movies, she inherits some money and moves to L.A. herself. In L.A. Diane discovers that her acting talents are less impressive than her natural beauties. During the audition of 'Sylvia North Story' the director Bob Rooker makes it clear that she has no talent. This in contrast to Camilla Rhodes, who is selected to be the lead actress.     Diane and Camilla become friends, even lovers, and thanks to Camilla Diana will play some minor parts. For Diane Camilla is the love of her life, Diane is just one of Camilla's affairs. If after a while Camilla ends their relationship, Diane knows why: Camilla is getting serious with the director Adam Kesher. Once abandoned, Diane stays in her apartment to sob and masturbate. But then Camilla invites Diane to Adam's house at Mulholland Drive. Here Diane finds nothing but deep humiliation. In this environ her lack of success is more than apparent, the marriage of Adam and Camilla is announced, she notices that Camilla still has other female lovers. Diane rushes home in tears.     Somewhat later Diane decides to hire a man to kill Camilla. 'This is the girl,' she tells him, showing Camilla's photograph. The deal is made at Winkie's, Sunset Blvd. She hands over the money, and when the deed is done she will receive a blue key. After having received the key, Diane hides at home in deep despair. She tries to sleep and forget it all, but instead she dreams up the twisted soap-paradise that forms much of the movies first 110 (!) minutes. (Dreaming is marked more by an audible than a visual clue: the monotonous dark sounds.)     Diane's dream uses elements from the most depressing time of her life; Winkie's, 'This is the girl.', blue key, among other things. But despite signs of danger and dead, all is as she wanted it to be. Just arrived in Hollywood, under the name of 'Betty Elms', she promises to become a successful actress, as even Bob Rooker has to acknowledge. Camilla suffers from loss of memory caused by a car-accident that she survived. She finds shelter in the apartment of Betty's aunt, where Betty is also going to stay. Camilla now calls herself Rita, after a film poster reading: There <i>never</i> was a woman like [] Rita Hayworth'. Although starting a new career, Betty still finds time to help Rita trying to overcome her amnesia, a fate she shares with all dead people. It makes Rita highly dependent on Betty, especially in their fruitless search for Rita's true identity. Is she Diane Selwyn? When Betty and Rita find Diane dead in her apartment, Rita decides to adopt a new identity, very similar to Betty's. That night Betty and Rita undouble in bed and, even in appearance, in the mysterious club Silencio.     In reality, Diane has not been seen for three weeks when an old friend (a once lover left for Camilla) visits her to collect some of her belongings. She tells Diane that two detectives have been at her door. As soon as the woman has left, Diane resumes brooding over the blue key. Then, she hears knocking at her door These harsh knocks push Diane over her limit. Surrounded by distorted images of her youth and later, she runs to her sleeping room and kills herself. Over her bed there is the same cloudy smoke as over the car-accident that killed Camilla.Silencio...*It's a stroke of genius to show the wrecked life of a girl striving for fame in moviedom as a distracted chromium plated dream. But the chromium used here can not allude to the dark, even the blackest tones shine. As a consequence, a powerful idea tends to reduce to a cryptogrammatical postmodern twist, a mannerism to sell true human misery in Hollywood. Mulholland Drive may well continue to impress those who strongly believe in form, but as far as I am concerned: Hail, Kieslowsky! Hail, Mendes! Hail, Interiors!Mulholland Drive is dedicated to Jennifer Syme (1972--2001).",Mulholland Drive

There were parts when i was literally laughing at how stupid the movie was getting.  Also, the blonde-haired actor's acting abilities at first were awful, and almost made me leave early.

723,cagedavid,I bought the video,2,8 October 2002,"I bought the video for £13 at HMV (we pay more in Britain) as a friend had told me it was highly rated and  the reviews on this site were generally impressive.I have to say that the opening credits were a let down...the dancing/music not very powerful.The car ride and unexpected crash just as the lady passenger was going to be harmed was a nice touch,..something unexpected...though the way she walked away from the car with hair perfectly groomed and still carrying a handbag looked corny for most Directors ..but for Lynch was something else.Her dazed walking around after such a shock was enhanced by a regular low noise similar to fingers scraping along a blackboard; I thought another Lynch master touch perhaps portraying the demons gnawing into her shocked and traumatised  self conscious. After a while this noise became somewhat annoying and on further investigation I discovered the new video cassette squeaked.I dont know whether this squeak took away a lot of my enjoyment but this movie became a waste of time.(and money)The two  female characters had some presence and the lesbian scenes were fair enough, though predictable. There were no male characters of any merit and apart from a few vaguely good scenes (the hoover switching on )there were far too many dreadful scenes that were plain weak and ridiculous. Eg, the coffee being spat into the napkin by the menacing loon and the silly monster face at the back of the diner. Oh and what about the paint in the wifes jewels..boring and naff.This whole film gives you the feel of the failed genius..you know when you listen to the worst Dylan track ever and think my God that was embarrassing....was that really Bob?The whole feel is that of a failed TV movie , badly put together with a few (not many) extra bits to give it a 15 rating.I whizzed it on during the last 30 minutes .Do I give it another chance and watch again. If I want to be puzzled and work hard at understanding a film I will watch Frank Woods Guide to Consolidated Accounting.Lynch did one classic ..Blue Velvet and Straight Story was nice.This, like Wild at Heart, was a let down ; his weirdness is now predictable and stale.

725,mia-manns,A tribute to the old art of film,10,22 March 2011,"Ever watch a movie and when the credits roll feel that you have no idea what just happened? Actually, it doesn't happen much these days unless you fall asleep and miss part of the plot line. Hollywood really likes to spell it out these days. The last time I had this sensation was with 2001: A Space Odyssey. I watched this with perhaps not the best frame of mind for a challenging film and when it was over, I headed to IMDb to find an explanation for the past 141 minutes of my life. It's a rewatch in the sense that on the first watch, you will probably get lost. I mean, the flicks these days just really don't challenge you in the same way. I even watched it after the lecture in my Sci-Fi class and still felt pretty lost, despite the fact that I was decently well-prepared.I was not prepared in the least to watch Mulholland Dr. The only thing I knew about this movie is that it involved a woman with amnesia and took place in Los Angeles. Believe me, if you haven't seen it, just stop reading right now and watch it. It's really good, based on the 8.0 rating on IMDb, so you don't need to read a review to convince you. Just enter into the world of Mulholland Dr. the way I did without knowing a thing about it. It's best that way. Stop reading, right about, now... Well, now that we have gotten rid of those losers. Heh. Just kidding. In fact, maybe you're back after watching Mulholland Dr. and you've found yourself as lost as I was last night. If you're confused, rewatch the first 2 and a half minutes. Right after the jitterbug scene. The red sheets and the red pillow approaching. A troubled girl falls asleep and dreams that life is better, and that's the key that unlocks this film. The first two thirds or more are just a dream. The dream takes pieces of Diana's reality and combines them with fantasy, so that she can have the pretty life of Betty - a talented, sweet girl who falls in love with a woman with no memory of past wrongs. In her dream Diana is able to have Camilla back, to punish the man who stole her, and live the dream of being an actual good actress.It would have been nice to be able to resist the temptation to find the explanation, and watch Mulholland Dr. again to figure it out for myself, right? In fact, early after Diana awakens t I predicted that she had Camilla killed, but didn't understand how it was possible based on the events from the first half of the movie. As the credits rolled, it appeared that my theory was correct, but I still didn't understand why. This is the kind of thing we should get more from films, and perhaps the reason audiences don't get it on the first pass is that we're not used to thinking critically about what we're seeing. We're used to being handed the answers on a silver platter. I was really counting on something explaining to me that Diana had killed Camilla and was simply dreaming of what her life could have been as Betty Elms, which is why when I didn't understand the answer, I went straight to Google, as have many before me and many after me. Rather than continuing on like that, I'm going to endeavor to watch some of IMDb's highest rated films and seek out more confusing, mind-boggling, frustrating pieces of cinema and I hope you will join me.",Mulholland Drive

This film is not a pop corn movie, it presents a sophisticated insight into a conceptual analysis of dreams and hallucination elements. It is not depicted in an obvious manner but it's this that makes this film unique.I recognised this films' beauty in hind sight. It did come a little difficult to watch towards the end but this was because I missed the point of the film. The second viewing made it much easier and I enjoyed this more now understanding the concept.There are some fantastic scenes in this film that are second to none. The 'surreal' dream concept was played beautifully and to capture this idea without the use of special effects is a work of genius.Watch the film carefully, enjoy it, don't blink, talk, pause the movie or make a cup of tea. It's in depth and not an easy watch but it is a work of art.I can only think that Magnolia has some similarities in terms of the time changing, and that is a fantastic film. It's not the same of course and is not a messed up film that a naive watcher could decide. It is easy to deny it continuity, on the contrary.Enjoy and I will give it a full 10/10 because its concept and the simple fact of subtle surrealness that played throughout that kept me on edge.

728,omelette007,Mulholland Dr.,9,13 March 2012,"Mulholland Drive is often referred to as David Lynch's masterpiece. While my favorite Lynch movie is a toss-up between The Elephant Man and The Straight Story, I wouldn't argue with that claim. Mulholland Drive certainly seems like the ultimate Lynch headtrip. It's a delirious, movie-mad fantasy, a surreal film noir that steadily reveals seductive, disturbing layers. That haunting, oddball but compelling vibe found in all of Lynch's best films is here in spades.Lynch returns to the realm of schizophrenic weirdness after the gentle, G-rated Straight Story, but the results are much more satisfying and compelling than his previous Wild at Heart and Lost Highway. From the opening moments, the strange artistry of Mulholland Drive is fully evident. If Blue Velvet was the most demented Hardy Boys mystery ever, than Mulholland Drive is like a deeply sinister Nancy Drew mystery on acid. Our bubbly, attractive heroines become Los Angeles sleuths, but the giddy vibe is held up by an ominous and seriously weird undercurrent. Mulholland Drive only grows darker and stranger as it goes on, going to some seriously disturbing and surreal places by the last act. It's about as sublimely orchestrated as films get, although occasionally hurt by the overly lurid approach that damaged other Lynch movies. Thankfully, Mulholland Drive is kept afloat by Lynch's directorial genius, and the fact that it actually does have a soulful center. It's nowhere near the emotional powerhouse of The Elephant Man, partly by design, but Lynch clearly has sympathy for his main character - a Hollywood outcast whose failed aspirations have left her an unstable, perhaps-psychotic wreck. This is partially due to Naomi Watts's monumental performance. It cannot be easy to give a human, emotional performance in such a fractured and bizarre movie, but Watts more than lives up to the challenge. She is alternately dazzlingly beautiful, appealingly innocent and horrifically damaged. A great performance in a weirdly great movie.",Mulholland Drive
729,haxboob,Dude...what?...um....huh?,4,25 April 2005,"Are you kidding me? I sat there wondering why it is so trendy to laud David Lynch as being edgy and brilliant when all of a sudden, as if in my own dream sequence, someone explained to me that the film was supposed to be like watching a dream, random events unfold and your taken on some journey where you have no control. OK with that in mind I kinda get it, trust me this review is completely different from the one where I rip everyone and everything in David Lynchs galaxy apart after thinking he wrote half of a story about an amnesia girl, a nice helpful girl and a bag of money and then couldn't figure out how to end the story so he just filmmed random scenes and prayed to God everyone would go ""well thats David Lynch for ya, isn't he brilliant making all of us discuss this film and what it might mean?"". In fact here is a bit of my old review, where I spit venom at Art-House types for raising this film to cult status, in the form of sarcasm: My favorite scene was when the 2 old people were in the limo and they were really happy and the car was driving and the old people were smiling and the visuals just made so much sense artistically, like it was some sort of dream sequence where 2 old people sit in a limo and smile, very deep, very emotional and raw. David Lynch is a genius and I too understand the secrets of this film, this makes me smarter than most people and I laugh at those who don't understand his brilliance, or the brilliance of this, his latest masterpiece. If it was supposed to be someones dream then fine, congratulations for having an intereting point of view. If not then shame on everyone who made this film into something more than it was. My only advice to anyone needing to see the film is, see it with friends and get stoned. I should have been.",Mulholland Drive
730,trelloskilos-1,Complex and Ingenious,9,17 December 2004,"If there was ever a filmmaker whose films fuel discussion and divided opinion long after the final credits have rolled, David Lynch is certainly a prime candidate.Almost every film he has made so far is classed as either a work of genius with a unique point of view, or incomprehensible arty-farty rubbish. Despite whatever anyone thinks of his films, however, it is undeniable that they are all very well-crafted, well-directed, and will unfailingly cause a reaction.Mulholland Drive, while originally intended to be a TV series in the same vein as ""Twin Peaks"" was restructured and recreated into a fascinating piece of film-making and storytelling, with a dreamlike and almost detached atmosphere all of its own. Employing several set pieces of mysterious dwarfs, blue neon, red drapes and vintage microphones, chanteuses singing Roy Orbison songs, enigmatic and dangerous femmes fatales and '50's memorabilia, the setting is perfectly ""Lynchian"". Everything is stylish and chic, caught in a hazy lens with an element of something dark just behind the scenes.What causes the most controversy in Lynch's films, however, is the plot itself, or more particularly, the conclusion. Some people will wonder if there was a point to watching the movie, expecting an ending that is handed on a plate. Lynch, however, likes to make his audience work for their own answers to the movie (and personally, with the case of Mulholland Drive, I do believe that there is an underlying solution that does make sense of the entire film). Moviegoers who enjoy something cerebral and enjoy a challenge will love this movie. Others who do not attempt to understand the movie will either be entranced by the imagery, or be appalled at the apparent lack of a coherent ending.Ultimately, though, the key to Lynch's films, including Mulholland Drive, is to switch your point of view. Lynch's films centre heavily on dreams, and once the viewer realises what they are watching, the film takes on a different perspective, with a satisfactory conclusion.",Mulholland Drive
731,BeMi21,"Masterful mix of Neo-Noir/Crime, Mystery and Drama",10,16 June 2014,"David Lynch's Mulholland Drive is probably one of those movies that divide its viewer in two groups: The one group absolutely loves this movie, the other group hates it. Few may have mixed feeling about it. I belong to the first group.It's difficult to describe what the movie is about without telling too much. The basic story seems to be about a woman (Laura Harring) who escapes attempted murder but lost her memory. The mysterious woman, who calls herself Rita, finds help from Betty (Naomi Watts), a young actress who came to Los Angeles in order to become a star. The two women try to find out what happened to Rita and what is the background of the attempt to kill her.The mysterious score and the dark atmosphere give this film a great touch of a neo-noir movie. And the basic storyline which I described above seems to fit perfectly into a neo-noir schema. However, every viewer should be aware not to expect a solid solution of this movie and should expect turns that may (or maybe will) even confuse you. But the great thing about this movie is - besides the great suspense that is arranged throughout the whole film - that you discover new things each time you view it. Furthermore Mulholland Drive benefits from a glorious performance by Naomi Watts who shows an extreme versatility in this movie.",Mulholland Drive

I also don't necessarily think one story-line is ""real"" and the other is a ""dream."" (They're both ""movies."") Personally, I think of this as a movie about symbolism and storytelling. It speaks to me about art and performances and how artificial they are, yet how they can transform our world. Also, it has a wonderful, haunting paranoid sensibility, and a lovely surreal style.

735,Wesley-Wang,Incredible,10,11 November 2017,"A film so polarized, that ""The New York Observer"" labeled Mulholland Drive as a ""moronic and incoherent piece of garbage"", while BBC noted it as the greatest film of the 21st century (so far). Even though I agree with the latter, I can understand the dislikes.David Lynch completely transformed a seemingly clichéd story about an aspiring, perky actress who seeks fame in Hollywood to a horrifying surrealistic roller coaster that never ends. This transformation was so subtle that it kept viewers engaged throughout, emotionally contained, yet sporadic simultaneously. Angelo Badalamenti's beautifully unsettling score, a combination of minors and dissonance that represent the devastating collapse of Betty Elms, does well emphasizing Lynch's signature dark tone in such a psychedelic manner that viewers are able to relate to Betty's catastrophic hallucinations.Was the first two-thirds of the film a dream? Betty Elms and Diane Selwyn were the same people? While there are countless other interpretations of the film, I, like most of the critics and audience, subscribe to the explanation above. The pieces of the puzzle seem to fit together so unbelievably well that it must have been Lynch's vision. To confront the fact that Diane was a sexually frustrated failed actress, she envisaged her own perfect life. For example, during my favorite scene of the film, Betty auditions in front of a crowded small room, where everyone praises her abilities. Except for Bob Brooker, the same director who didn't award Diane Selwyn the lead part in ""The Sylvia North Story"". Yet in this version of the events, Brooker is portrayed as incompetent, and easily deducted as disrespected by the side glances he receives from his peers. From this, we can determine that Diane blames the incapable director as her reason for not obtaining the part for ""The Sylvia North Story"". Sensible. Furthermore, Betty imagines the hit-man as extraordinarily incompetent during the murder scene, clumsily setting off the fire alarm, and killing two more people than he was supposed to. This amateurish hit-man could be a reasonable justification for the option that Camilla was not killed in reality.Then the backbone of this film could be centered around the idea, ""We believe what we want to believe."" Yet there are multiple other persuasive interpretations of the film that cannot be dismissed, such as the Mobius strip theory, parallel universes, and that the whole film is a dream. Even after 16 years of extensive research and analysis, audiences and critics still can't seem to agree on one interpretation that is more convincing than the next.And don't even get me started on Naomi Watts' breathtaking lead performance. From the lesbian sex scenes with Laura Harring to the heart-stopping audition scene, Naomi Watts has displayed an incredible range of emotions and acting capabilities. After watching such a masterpiece, I highly doubt one will argue that cinema isn't art. Because even if you didn't enjoy it, even if you still don't understand it, you can't deny the fact that ""Mulholland Drive"" is one of the most astonishing and bold films of all time. Thank you, David Lynch.Silencio.",Mulholland Drive
736,richardbrennan-78429,This movie really held my interest.,7,19 October 2019,"If you were to go downtown to your city's main library and went into the reference section to find that fat Funk and Wagnalls dictionary, you know, the one that's so big it needs its own little table, and you looked up the word ''weird,'' the definition would reference this movie, Mulholland Drive. It plays like a dream ...all disjointed, making no logical sense at all, yet it's somehow quite captivating. It also has a couple of hot girl-girl sex scenes, about which I have no complaints whatsoever. To sum up, it is a strange but interesting film and well worth watching. Think, Coen brothers on LSD.",Mulholland Drive
737,aspero-12928,David Lynch surprises us with a both linear and twisted movie,9,1 January 2019,"The movie initially seems to follow the style of ""Pulp Fiction"". It narrates different stories that are apparently disconnected with one another. Then the simple opening of the blue box brings us back to the reality and we understand that it was all a mere dream generated by the guilt and the remorse of the main character's actions. We finally understand how the various characters and elements that appear in the dream are connected to the real life of Naomi Watts' character. The punch line, ""Silentio"", is very effective and makes us notice the theatrical connotation of the whole film. It's incredible how Lynch ""tricks"" the viewer with the linear storyline given by the dream to then overturn it all in order to retrieve (again) the viewer's attention. The director focuses on details and nothing is given to chance. A film full of good scenes and interpretations and that the viewer follows always with ""the breath on the neck"".",Mulholland Drive
738,JP-43,A beautiful and haunting dreamscape,9,17 October 2001,"""Mulholland Drive"" is one of the most understated, inscrutable, and satisfying films in David Lynch's inestimably complex career. An involving mystery, a surprisingly passionate love story, and a double-edged indictment/celebration of Hollywood superficiality, it's also one of the most involving films of the year. It's particularly gratifying to see Lynch successfully utilize some of the head scratching plot devices -- mysterious puppetmasters, multiple identities -- that failed him so grandly in ""Lost Highway."" This time, anyone complaining that the story doesn't make sense just wasn't paying close attention. It's also nice to see him carry over some of the subtle touch that he brought to ""The Straight Story.""  Elevating the whole affair is the solid, at times spectacular work of leads Naomi Watts and Laura Haring. Watts should be singled out, especially, for deftly shifting from good hearted innocent to embittered sensualist without missing a beat. She, like the film, simply rocks.",Mulholland Drive
739,lebowski_achiever,It's a loop,9,5 May 2002,"I was bowled over by Mulholland.    I had read nothing about the movie before I went to see it, just going on the merits of Lynch as a director. I have always loved his style of directing and vision.  There is always a good-natured naiveté about his work. Something very pure and honest (this is why he goes on about the quality of coffee in his movies, I think).  I am sure that most will not agree but that is the underlying feeling I get from it.  He loves filmmaking and it shows.  It is uncompromising and pure.  It is brave and very rare in Hollywood.Mulholland Dr follows into that vein but there is an underlying tone of evil from the beginning that is fed by the goody goody nature of Betty (just too good to be true..too wide eyed and innocent) and the leering old couple when they leave Betty on the pavement of LA airport.  But you just don't know where Lynch is taking you with this.  I just let it wash over me and it was astonishing.  Creepy, funny and devastating the story is a loop but you only find that out, of course, at the end of the movie.  Ending where it began. So I do not understand the notion that it is incoherent.  It certainly isn't incoherent. It is a Loop.  It doesn't deal with normal time notions but it gives you clues as to what state of reality Betty/Diane is in.Just look for the ashtray in the shape of the Piano.  The lampshade and the robe and the hairstyle...  If you keep your eye on that you will know what is real and what isn't.But then the question is.. What does it all mean?  The Blue Box? The key? Silencio? The old Couple? The Thugs, No one can answer that (perhaps not even David Lynch) but one can only guess... and that is just part of the fun of this movie. There is no wrong answer but the symbolism is logical to a degree. (Think Pandora's box, the key is the key to Diane's release of her obsession, Silencio the calm before death, or death itself, The old couple her innocence lost..coming back to haunt her, The thugs are validating her belief that the director was bullied into choosing Camilla and had nothing to do with Diane's lack of talent or star quality) It stays with you long after you have left the cinema.  Like some vivid dreams they can baffle you as to their meaning but make you richer for having them... I was bowled over by Mulholland.",Mulholland Drive
740,ebohls,Goes from Bad to Great,9,11 January 2002,"Funny, I leaned over to my date about halfway through the film and whispered, ""Are you hating this as much as I am?""She was.But then, of course, everything changes and twists and turns and who knows what all happens or even has happened.And I ended up really liking this movie. Go figure.To me it was the exact opposite of Vanilla Sky, which I liked for the first half and then loathed the exposition. Mulholland Drive is similar in that you don't know what's real and what's not, but in the end you pretty much maybe still don't know but in any case don't necessarily care.And, anyway and anyhow, that Naomi Watts is an absolute shining star, by turns perky & lovely and then damaged and dangerous.Unforgettable, although sadly my date never did warm up to it.ejb",Mulholland Drive
741,steva-4,top 5 movie,9,11 June 2006,"Recently I have started to watch David Lynch's movies. I have watched Wild at Heart, Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr. I saw Mulholland Dr. first and it is still better than those three movies.This movie is 9/10 because: it is not purpose of movie is not always to tell you staff like: world is bad, men are corrupted, greedy, jealous... This movie is good because it forced me to think more about Hollywood about women and to think more in any way, though I still do not have clear opinion. I am still thinking about Hollywood, but I concluded you must face something to understand it. I guess Lynch think that there are some bad things in Hollywood. Also I understand that most of his films are inspired by his childhood and his whole life. We all have our Camillias and our demons.Lynch probably wanted show woman's life broken by a unrealized dream. That dram ruined her life and some other lives. That part is nice realized with a scene with two men in a Coffey shop and a demon with a box. That ""pandora's box"" represents her affection on certain people. There are too many people like Naomi's character. There is one more and Hollywood contributed it, and I hope Lynch has a same thought.",Mulholland Drive
742,NOLDaemon,Um... what?,1,18 August 2006,"As hard as I tried to understand this movie, I just couldn't make out exactly what the plot was. Nor did I comprehend why 3/4 of the way through the movie, the main characters switched names. There is basically no explanation of what is going on, and I'm sure anybody would be confused throughout the whole movie. There are many characters introduced that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot. (And again, with no explanation) Even when I read a summary of the movie & comments, I still didn't understand what happened. The writer MUST have been on something while thinking up this movie.I have to write 10 lines minimum, but there just isn't 10 lines to say about this movie. There are a couple of nude scenes, but they aren't worth sitting through over 2 hours of no action, no plot, and complete confusion the whole time. Essentially, there is no real ending since the characters switch names (Yes I already said that, but remember I have to write 10 lines) about 3/4 into it. So your questions about the movie never get answered. Such as, who was the woman who had amnesia? Why were people out to kill her? What was the blue box? What's the point of the cowboy?If anybody says they understand this movie, they're lying!",Mulholland Drive
743,carlsez_1,"Come for the experience, leave the analysis for later",8,18 March 2010,"There is already enough written about Mulholland Drive to make my overall explanation on the film unnecessary. In general you will find many valid and insightful analysis and deconstructions in IMDb and other websites devoted to interpretations of this film. These will get any novice factually prepared for the MD experience.What I would emphasize is that the movie is best appreciated on first viewing by simply letting go and following along. Lynch is an artist who attempts to create a cinematic experience rather than a step by step whodunit. Those who try to figure everything out immediately will only rack their brains and miss out on the full emotional impact.You can trust Lynch, even though he himself may not always understand why he did what he did (he has admitted not knowing what every image he has in his head means). His skill lies in understanding the visual and emotional impact of an image, and having a real purpose for the effect intended. He is an expressionist who composes sights and sounds mostly to evoke emotions rather than to simply advance a narrative.He is also a minimalist who doesn't pack in a bunch of disparate or extraneous images. His scenes are measured and purposeful, and build to climaxes with simple, skilled film making rather than with bloated, overdone special effects.Having lingering questions about MD are a given. Any movie that could be understood immediately and completely after watching would grow old quickly. MD is a movie that will confound in a good way, and haunt you long after it's over.",Mulholland Drive
744,Da-Ant,As Homer said...,7,21 May 2002,"As Homer Simpson said of Twin Peaks...""Brilliant!  I have no idea what's going on.""So true of this movie.  I think it's David Lynch at his most cryptic, as some of my friends argue about which half was reality, let alone what was happening in that reality.Unfortunately, unlike any other Lynch movie, I think maybe there isn't an overall theme or concept that ties it all together.  Granted, I've only seen it once so far, and many have commented that it needs to be seen 3 times. I disagree.  If the movie doesn't hold up under the first viewing, then there is a real sense of loss with viewing it.  The structure of the film is compelling, and the lead actresses were great, especially Betty/Diane. Very versatile performance, as the movie demanded a LOT from her.  I think that ultimately, viewers just have to make up their own minds, as there is no ONE accurate interpretation to this film, and I suspect that multiple viewing would lead to completely different takes.  I probably WILL watch it again, but I suspect that there isn't a true internal logic to this movie, which can be evidenced by the fact that over half of it was originally a TV pilot, and extra footage was shot to make it a feature.  I think this provides the evidence that the sense of cohesiveness was shoe-horned in after the fact by Lynch.Unlike Lost Highway, which was just as ""out there"" and still his best work to date.Mulholland Dr. is a distant third (I still love Eraserhead to no end - in fact I watched it just after Mulholland Dr).",Mulholland Drive
745,GeoDude,"Ultimately, A Sadly Disappointing Mess .. Bummer!",1,4 November 2010,"So, this was on Encore Mystery (Satellite & Cable TV channel) this week. Hmm, IMDb #249, must see this one, or so I thought! TiVO, record, may want to watch this one twice. I know, David Lynch has made some remarkable, complex films. After my 3rd viewing, decidedly, there is nothing worthwhile here, just a haunting disappointment. I am now ambivalent towards David Lynch films. A few of his other films were weirdly interesting and highly viewable. Not this one. It was a big mistake, filmed first as a TV pilot, rejected, then salvaged by adding a second half, then the incoherence explained as dream sequences. Watched it, then read 100 reviews, director's hints, FAQ, watched again. Still unsatisfied, wished I had not even wasted one millisecond of my time to press Record. Three TiVO thumbs down on this mishmashed waste of time, poorly filmed, horribly edited. Not entertaining, just depressing. Too many very poorly filmed whispy details which only elude, confound and confuse. If you like plot hints which are so subtle as to require 2 or 3 viewings, okay, but please ... filmmakers, make the experience worthwhile. I found NO payoff in watching this film. A few nicely filmed scenes, but many largely bad ones too. Just bad cinema. I will long remember this mess as one of the worst films of all time. (See Memento, Inception, The Usual Suspects or Pulp Fiction, infinitely better than this film.)A few more low votes and it should be knocked out of IMDb 250, it clearly does not merit being in the top 250 movies of all time. Only film students should be interested in seeing this as an example of a very, very bad film, lessons learned. It could have been far better. Dreams vs. Reality counterpoised, nice concept, very poorly executed here.If you enjoy watching a tragically sad, convoluted, Disappointing Mess, see this film, otherwise, skip it.Voted 1/10",Mulholland Drive
746,mobunit,a complete masterpiece,10,15 April 2002,"David Lynch is the master of mystery. This film must be viewed at least two times to even get a taste of how extraordinary it is. In my mind this is definitely the best film of the year and Naomi Watts deserved best actress and she wasn't even nominated.David Lynch is the only director out there that really makes good mysteries that you really have to pay close attention to if you want to solve, he doesn't tell you at the very end the lead character is really dead or that the best friend turns out to be the villain, he makes you work, he doesn't hand you the solution, you have to find the solution by solving the mystery.** Spoilers & Clues ** Many people think the car crash is a main event and they can't figure out what is real and not. The car crash never happened it's all a dream and I'm sure everyone's had a dream involving a car crash. At the beginning of the film we go into a pillow. We are in Diane/Betty's dream. The blue box is the escape from her dream, when club Silencio reveals that everything is an illusion we are taken into the blue box, therefore out of the dream. We are put into reality for a short time and than shot right out into flashbacks. Notice the coffee cup and the robe that Diane has. When she goes onto the couch the robe is gone, she does not have her coffee cup and the ashtray that was recently taken is still there. We are now in past events. These are real, but flashbacks. The whole dream sequence has a lot of significance and mostly portrays everything the way Diane wishes it was, which is what we do when we dream. When we go back to the coffee cup and Diane is in the robe we are back into the present and soon to the end. I don't want to give away everything, but that is the basic structure that will maybe make things a little less confusing and help you focus on other things that tell a lot more about the story. Also notice how Blue and Red play very significant parts in the film. My interpretation of this is that Blue represents everything that is negative and completely an illusion, created only from the dream. Red seems to represent everything positive and everything that is associated with reality. Red and Blue mix together in club Silencio and that is when the dream ends. This film is amazing and to get to all the details this message would be ten pages long.",Mulholland Drive

I should have known better than to listen to critics and Oscar voters when they have been so wrong, so often and this time was no exception. This was absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen!!  It wasn't that I didn't get it either, the thing is I'm pretty sure I did. It was that it was just done horribly! It was also very boring! I love a lot of his work Blue Velvet was really great. Wasn't this going to be a TV series at one point? Because that is what it felt like that this movie intended to show and be a lot more but then took a horrible turn.

748,glassvision,"David Lynch's Darkest Fable - A Cryptic, Sublime Masterpiece",10,16 February 2016,"Mulholland Drive isn't a movie - it's a psychic experience. In order to appreciate and understand David Lynch's cryptic, sublime masterpiece your mind must first shift into an alternative mode of consciousness. If you do that then you'll be attuned to this divine puzzle.Mulholland Drive is a masterful and hypnotic portrait of both the horror and beauty of being human and contains Lynch's sharpest observations so far. For me Mulholland rises way above Inland Empire which I felt was a bit self-indulgent. Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway are his best films, Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart follow close behind but these two have a certain dark vibe that I've never felt while watching any other film. David Lynch does EVIL very, very well, and he does it best in Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway, but especially well in Mulholland Drive. David Lynch is a practitioner of transcendental meditation and clearly presents within this film a deep understanding of Eastern concepts regarding states of consciousness, desire, ego, greed, love and death.This is what it's about: It is about IDENTITY. We follow the adventure of a woman submerged in Western ignorance, pursuing a dream that is in fact a nightmare. She wants to be an actress. ""Mulholland Drive"" itself refers to the winding road on the outskirts of L.A., like the life of the protagonist, winding, unpredictable, with steep cliffs, what's around the corner? The tagline, ""A love story in the City of Dreams,"" presents the ultimate in human weakness; ego, desire, greed. For as long as she is pursuing ego, desire and greed, she is moving further away from her real identity. When she dies we see images of the supportive elderly couple who initially wished her luck on her starry-eyed adventure in film-land and we also see the demonic vagrant guy who lives out the back of the diner - all reminders of the emotional ups and downs of pursuing the film dream in Hollywood. The cowboy, the fifties dancing at the beginning, the film director, the hit-man; these are all stereotypes of Hollywood Movies; artifice. At the midnight theatre, we are reminded, ""It's a tape, it's a tape;"" artifice. Her perceived love for Rita / Camilla; artifice, dazzled by surface charm and fake smiles. For as long as she pursues the life of an actress she is living artificially, she is not her own IDENTITY. The amnesia: she forgets who she is! The film ends where it begins, yet she can't figure out how to escape this CYCLE - like Saṃsāra - get it..? The hit-man shoots the cleaner, the vacuum cleaner sets off the fire alarm... a chain of events a bit like karmic cause and effect, no?Surrounding her is the private nightmare she herself created, in the pursuit of desire and ego. At the end - the miniature elderly couple, so admiring initially in the car, now so deranged and small, that elderly couple represents her ego. She is driven over the line. Where is happiness? In this City of Dreams? Mulholland drive is a modern day, very intelligent Dharma from David Lynch, a very wise man.",Mulholland Drive

Or you take outer resources, with implicit complexity, or you must create that resources, or both things. Complexity without resources are like ""culteranism"".

This film is, pure and simple, intentionally incomprehensible, and it seems many are being blinded by that.  Incomprehensibility does not equal greatness, it equals confusion. All that having been said, I would like to call special attention to the very fine jobs done by the two lead actresses, Naomi Watts and Laura Harring.

757,BigE-3,Crying Over You,10,21 October 2001,"This is the first David Lynch movie I have seen.  I just finished watching it for the third time, and am planning to go back as soon as I can.  An absolutely fabulous masterpiece.Roger Ebert, the movie critic for the Chicago Suntime, said something very interesting about this movie: this movie is not to be understood by logic or rationality; rather, it's like music, which gives you a feeling, an emotion, an atmosphere.  It's a dreamscape saturated with powerful emotions.  Ever had a dream where you wake up, you don't quite remember what happened in the dream, but a profound sense of sadness, despair, all laced with a touch of quiet malevolence, firmly holding onto your heart and wouldn't let go?  This is that nightmare.*spoilers ahead*As to the structure of the movie, the most popular opinion seems to be this: the first 2/3 is a dream, and the last 1/3 or so is the reality.  I think one can construct an equally strong argument that in fact the first 2/3 is a reality, and the last 1/3 is a nightmare.  This confusion, of course, is exactly what Lynch had in mind: there are more than one ""theories"" that can ""explain"" this movie, though none can be perfect (that is, account for everything) -- exactly what ""dream logic"" should be.  Two realities.  Two dreams.  Dreaming of each other.  Projecting their respective love, fear, anxiety, and hope onto each other.  Creating each other.  Which is perhaps the more important theme Lynch is trying to explore: Hollywood being not merely the ""corruptor"" such as that of Nathanael West, but as the intersection of an identity crisis.  Who dreamed who into being?Lastly, a small Taoist fable, as told by Zhuang Zi, A Chinese Taoist philosopher who lived some 2000 years ago: one day he was sleeping and had a dream.  In that dream he was a butterfly doing all sorts of butterfly things, such as flying from one flower to the next, fluttering his wings. He had no awareness of being a human.  Then he woke up and found himself to be a human again, lying on a bed.  He thought: am I really a human being who was just then dreaming of being a butterfly, or am I a butterfly who is right now dreaming of being a human being?Lynch -- a secret Taoist?

759,aharmon,"Not just images, landscape and logic buggery here",10,21 October 2003,"It begins with a jitterbug, ends with a suicide, and seems to spike through everything both hopeful and hopeless about L.A.'s film industry in between. David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. may very well be his single best achievement in noiresque narrative mixed with his trademark skips and jumps in logic. Brilliantly acted, shot, edited, mixed and scored, Mulholland Dr. may or may not make sense to what no doubt will be a bewildered viewer, but the images conveyed in the interim prove unforgettable.Read about the plot in the ""Plot Outline"" link or in the external reviews by Roger Ebert, David Edelstein or Kenneth Turan. I want to present something else here: the notion that what you're seeing does, in fact, exhibit a logic and brilliantly plays on so many emotional levels that, taken as a whole, Mulholland Dr. can unsettle not just those who don't get it but, worse still, those who do.So many reviewers use the term ""dream"" to describe this film, and Lynch himself cleverly quips the tagline ""A love story in the city of dreams."" I won't go into every detail in order to completely spoil someone else's first-time enjoyment of the film, but let me go far enough to ask that you consider that what's shown is a dream through most of the movie and that the rest is a mix of imagination, delusion, memory, guilt, and sheer disgust, all made to counter the illusions just shown to you.Consider that much of what you're seeing isn't just coming from the mind of Lynch as filmmaker but from the dreamer as the one sometimes incorrectly interpreting L.A.'s lifestyle. Even Betty, the movie's heroine, refers to where she is as a ""dream place.""Consider that the Club Silencio is where the dreamer reaches the closest point to realizing the truth without being told it, where the environment of the dream is revealed, where the song elucidates more than just a point about the dimensions of sight and sound when they're not real: it uncovers a true feeling underscoring the entire dream. The song is sung in Spanish, one more way to show that it's not completely real or understandable while, at the same time, it teems with a very real, underlying feeling that brought the dreamer to her dream and, later, to her unflinching, gruesome reality. It's as if the Spanish singer is speaking the emotion but in a way that keeps the dreamer from fully realizing it.Consider that Betty and Rita, as the critics put it, are archetypes of the dream but that Laura Elena Harring's and Naomi Watts' characters in the end, after a jarring switch in identities, are also archetypes but, unfortunately, pale-faced reflections of what we know and what is true not just about Hollywood but about life in general. The movie isn't just about image or illusion. It embodies the always contradictory but yet congregational experiences of lust, greed, hatred, ambition, luck, vengeance, guilt, manipulation, storytelling, love, and silence. It shows us how one person's fortune can become another person's aching, how one person's jealousy can be another's nourishment. It also forces us to consider how you can be jealous of the one you love.And, just as important, Mulholland Dr. should not merely be looked at as a puzzle whose pieces one can connect if one reads David Lynch's primer on the rear of the insert in the DVD package. Voluptuous images should be taken in and felt without deconstruction. The emotions being played out are very real whether or not the viewer truly understands the plot.In all, David Lynch has created not just a memorable motion picture but a truly emotional experience.",Mulholland Drive
760,smoak,Pretentious and amateurish,1,14 September 2003,"This movie cannot be on the Top 250.  The camera angles are from '50's television, the sets look as if they were just painted by the high school thespians, the pace is slow and uneven, the dialog is pretentiously portentous and melodramatic to the point of laughter, and the sex in it is so strange and awkward as to make one think the writer/director is titillating himself.  In short... awful.  I've never understood Hollywood's utter fascination with David Lynch.  AMATEURISH at best.",Mulholland Drive
761,dedalus626,What?,1,8 April 2002,"David Lynch doesn't answer any of the questions he puts in the audience's head because he doesn't know the answers.  There are no answers in fact. The movie's intrigue is in that the plot in left behind halfway through and never picked up again.  The movie takes off in a bizarre direction (and I use the term direction very loosely) and never makes any attempt to reconnect.  The movie may be thought-provoking, but I don't think David Lynch deserves any credit for creating a confused audience by throwing out the plot.  The only reason this movie received any acclaim is that people were too afraid to admit that they don't understand it.  Don't be embarrassed; there's nothing to understand.",Mulholland Drive
762,John-442,state-of-the-art sensuality,9,28 May 2003,"Amazing the amount of comments this film has provoked. While I have nothing particularly original to say, I want my 15 seconds of fame anyway. I am on the side of those who consider it a masterpiece, though a less 'contained' one than Blue Velvet. However, I think confusion is a very understandable reaction to MD, and people who experience that don't need to feel bad about it. Many commentators here are sure they have 'figured it out,' i.e., what parts are dream, etc. I've seen it a few times (I own it, ok?) but am not completely convinced by anyone's explanations, so far, although some insights have been helpful. I celebrate Lynch's sound and vision. On one (important) level, he is showing how sensual the medium can be. Perhaps one should resist a bit the temptation to over-intellectualize it. In my opinion MD is intended to be felt too. Ideally one enjoys the experience without it being all reductively sorted out.",Mulholland Drive
763,jaycbird,Lynch meets Bunuel,9,26 September 2001,"I've been a 'fan' of David Lynch's work for it's quirkiness and playful, albeit, self indulgent surrealism.  ""Mulholland Drive"" however, has the director's 'tricks' firmly serving a script. He uses his technique and brilliant moodiness to not only fulfill narrative, but create a character. Naomi Watts is stunning as our 'guide' and 'subject.' I felt I was watching a film comparable to Luis Bunuel's ""Belle de Jour"" in it's ability to take me down an unknown path, into it's own dream, and then slap me awake by it's finale.  It is a very mature film. There is no doubt that at about the 1 hour 45 minute mark, I and the audience around me, were beginning to get restless, though the following half hour is MORE than a payoff. It takes patience and submission and deserves to be relished. It is also a film for which Mr. Lynch joins the ranks of ""International Cinema"" along with Bunuel, and the like.",Mulholland Drive
764,TimG-2,Brilliant mind-teaser which leaves you spellbound,10,9 January 2002,"Well, where do I begin? It's hard to describe my view on David Lynch's latest works without revealing too much of what's going on in it. A lot of people have already written out their theories and analysis of ""Mulholland Dr."" - so I won't bother with something like that. Just one thing: Some folks claim that the film doesn't make sense. They're wrong! When you try hard enough connecting all those seemingly chaotic strings, images, fragments, then almost everything makes sense - although there may still be a couple of ""red herrings"" left For me, there are three main reasons why no one who likes films like ""The Usual Suspects"" or the French movie ""Viva la vie!"" by Claude Lelouch should miss Lynch's masterpiece:a) The tension: There are only a few movies which make me clutch the upholstery of the seat. But a couple of scenes in ""Mulholland Dr."" do - although the ideas behind them are rather simple: Sneaking into a dark flat or around the corner of a fast-food restaurant b) The mind-teasing: Sometimes it isn't too bad when you already know some essential things about it before you go and see a movie. In case of, e.g., ""Memento"" - and ""Mulholland Dr."", too, you should know that everything you see might be important to fully understand the film. With the consequence that you'll definitely keep your attention for more than two hours - sort of spellbound c) The acting: It was a wise decision of Lynch not to cast any blockbuster stars for his movie but entirely rather unknown faces. Otherwise, we couldn't see those brilliant performances by Laura Elena Harring and especially Naomi Watts (who is gorgeous in every which way and would well deserve an award for her role).To come to a conclusion: Even if you finally don't get what it's all about, this movie might fascinate you. Or, as a friend of mine said when we left the cinema: ""I didn't understand anything of what was going on - but let's go and watch it again"".  10/10",Mulholland Drive

766,abominabledrphibes,Sheer brilliance from one of the world's last true filmmakers,10,11 April 2002,"David Lynch is, as far as I am concerned, one of the last true filmmakers left on Earth.  His works have the capability of making me laugh hysterically and nervously one moment and quickly switching it over and terrifying me to the point of near tears.  He, paired with Angelo Badalamenti, has succeeded in creating one of the most disturbingly beautiful films it has ever been my pleasure to witness.Lynch has slipped back into the incredible mindframe from which Eraserhead and Wild At Heart emerged with Mulholland Drive.  At points in my viewings of this film, my stomach has just been wrenching with confusion at the wild barrage of emotions sparked by the seemingly random images on the screen. Scenes that come specifically to mind are the ghostly Club Silencio scene and the freakishly bizarre meeting with The Cowboy. Lynch left Mulholland Drive so abstract for a reason, and that is is that he wants the viewer to make it his own by applying his or her own interpretation to it.  People who do not like to think for themselves will not enjoy this movie.  Anyone who enjoys the latest action flick or the latest crappy Disney movie will not enjoy this movie.  Those of us who believe that film is an art form and a medium for self-expression will most definitely enjoy it.  It is an incredible piece of cinema and hopefully will be soon forgotten by everyone in America except those of us who are truly capable of appreciating it.(By the way, Lynch got hosed at the Oscars.  Even someone who knows nothing about film would admit that Mulholland Drive is far more visually interesting than whatever it was that won.)",Mulholland Drive
767,zhoule2,Would have been a great TV series ...,5,10 November 2002,"... as was intended, but, for whatever reason this became a feature film. Therein lies its fatal flaw. Imagine if you will, taking a two-hour TV pilot that's painted in very broad strokes in order to keep enough of a plot going for a number of episodes, and then having to wrap it up in another half-hour so it can be released to theatres. Can't be done. Here. Watch this film if you don't believe me.Now, David Lynch has coughed up some interesting films and does try to do things a bit differently, I'll grant him that. And I get the sense that this was meant to be the kinda inverse of ""Twin Peaks"" -- that is, a fish out of water story turned inside out. So big points there.Plus, I hafta say the film *is* riveting, for the first two hours. You do get wrapped up in the weirdness, the mystery and (yes) the lesbian sex. But, before long, it all goes over the cliff before bursting into flames like a really bad car wreck. (Hmmm...)It's the ending -- the damn ending that gives it in. I won't spoil it, but the film's preoccupation with this post-modern b.s. about dreams and reality/fantasy is not only starting to get real old (see Vanilla Sky and the truly horrible Donnie Darko), but is the mark of a person who doesn't know what they're doing. I think Lynch knows it too. Didn't he do interviews for this film saying that he didn't know what it meant?
On top of all this, did I mention that there are far too many loose threads left dangling? No? Well then. We are introduced to characters who swiftly disappear off the map, never to be heard from again. Mark of an amateur writer, right there.I was going to begin this little spiel with a quote from author Jonathan Carroll about how he felt the most important thing in life was to be understood. But I'll end on that quote instead. If you need to 'understand' a film in order to enjoy it -- pass on this. If you, however, like having a director stick his metaphoric genitalia inside your head whilst simultaneously projecting all his twisted fantasies onto a screen before you -- well, you might like this one. But don't come aboard expecting explanations or pat resolutions. None are forthcoming.My personal opinion? You're almost better off watching porn. No plots there either, lots more t and a, and most of 'em are about an hour to an hour and a half shorter than this thing.",Mulholland Drive

The entire plot was given to you in the film's tagline (""Love story in the city of dreams""), but instead of giving it to you in a straightforward way, or even a backwards way, David Lynch (nominated for his third acadamy award) seems to have decided to give it to you sideways.*SPOILERS*Mulholland Drive is about two lovers, both actresses, in Los Angeles. In a fit of jealous rage, one actress orders a hit on her lover (played by Naomi Watts), but the hit goes terribly wrong one night on Mulholland Drive, and the lover is stuck without a memory, desperately trying to figure out who she is and where she came from. She makes her way back to her lover's apartment, where the two are able to start with a ""clean slate"". The movie then jumps backwards and forwards in time with no apparant rhyme or reason, giving you short glimpses into these Hollywood Movie-Star lover's lives.The film is quite brilliant and is David Lynch's masterpeice.

I began watching this movie with the knowledge that it was an offbeat sort of film, and without the knowledge of its plot. I had been forewarned that it is extremely complex and filled with intense lesbian romance scenes, and so I was somewhat prepared. However, I warn you! DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE IN THE MOOD FOR AN ACTION/COMEDY/ROMANCE!!!!!! You will not be ready for it and you will subsequently despise this movie.I waited weeks to watch this movie until I was in a sufficiently enigmatic mood. Watching Mulholland Dr. is sort of like reading Kurt Vonnegut- you feel with every passing moment as though you are dying a little bit, but when it's all over you feel as though a little bit is growing back, sort of like a Cherry Tree that loses all of its flowers and then bears fruit. It is enlightening and confusing all at once, and all that can be said is that it is a mood movie: if you are in a mood to challenge yourself, if you are in a mood to think, if you are in a mood to throw yourself into a whirlpool of cinematic brilliance, then watch Mulholland Dr.Criticism: If blatant sexuality on film disturbs you, be ready to fast-forward. Or watch the film alone.",Mulholland Drive
773,wideawake-1,Who is the subject of Mulholland Drive?,5,4 July 2007,"Imagine someone sits beside you on a bus, train or plane and begins to tell you a story. After a while you realise that the story is a bit confused. What do you think? The narrator has a problem? That he/she is hiding or evading something? Would there come a point when you might ask yourself if that person is a threat to you? That's what I thought about while watching Mulholland Park. More specifically, I thought: What is David Lynch afraid of? OK. The film/movie is made by the central lesbian scene. Very powerful first time round, less so after that, until you reach the point of understanding a major feature of internet porn: the male interest in supposedly lesbian sex. Have you ever visited a lesbian site? Nothing in the world more earnest and boring (from the masturbator's point of view, that is). So, what is it with this male interest in lesbo porn? Simple, the women serve to make each other real to the viewer, and so add what is most lacking in all porn: the real thing, the actual woman.OK. David Lynch gives us lesbo voyeurism dressed up as art-house cinema. So, what is David Lynch afraid of? You got it. And therein lies the power of this film. We start with the nice suburban blond - brilliantly acted - and the headless (amnesiac) brunette. Now, instead of the usual Hollywood fun and games with the man caught between the virtuous Mid West blond and the dirty, implicitly Latin, brunette (in which, of course, he commits himself ultimately to virtue - because man and woman is about children in the western world and not about sex - and the unfortunate whore will die for love of (read lust for) him.So, where is the man in Mulholland Drive. He's behind you in the director's chair. So what happens when the man is taken out of the plot? It collapses on itself. The whore turns the blond into a killer.It's remarkable how frustrating the film is. Compare it with Blue Velvet. OK, there are some confusing bits, but it is about the young man's discovery of sex and the overthrowing of the reigning sexual man (not quite the father). That the brunette in this case likes a bit of rough simply betrays Lynch's immaturity (or impotence?). That our hero is content to tie himself to the more conventional blonde indicates Lynch's underlying submissive nature. But you are left at least with the presence of the far more exciting brunette, who is now a family friend (safely tied up with a husband AND a child). Like having a dirty picture hidden in the loo, isn't it? I had to buy the two-disk package, which cost more than the film is worth. The interesting thing, though, is how the women in the interviews praise Lynch, even his editor. There is another layer to this subject, then. What use is an impotent or reluctant man to a woman? Well, he can create images of her. And as any woman will tell you: there is nothing like sex for making a women take an interest in herself. And as the man discovers, if you want to keep your woman, groom her image. And that, dear reader, tells you something of just how destructive sex actually is.",Mulholland Drive

779,joeliuscaesar,"What a nightmare, what a masterpiece!",10,22 February 2002,"**WARNING**SPOILERS**Was I awake during the movie or was it a dream. Or was it a dream of a nightmare where I watched Mulholland Drive. These are the types of comments I thought to myself as I left the cinema. Yes in parts it is a nightmare to watch, but this is the beauty of David Lynch. Mulholland Drive is a masterpiece of art cinema and an instant cult classic.Like all of his previous movies David Lynch takes the viewer into the realm of the subconscious where reality is blurred with the surreal. In Twin Peaks, for example, we are taken into a seemingly idyllic country town but if we take a closer look we find that that this `reality' is blurred by murder, corruption, prostitution and even a deeper nightmarish evil that lurks in our subconscious. Similarly, Mulholland Drive provides this juxtaposition of the reality and surreal in the context of tinseltown, the dream factory known as Hollywood.Key to understanding this film is a scene at the beginning from the point of view of (a yet to be revealed) Diane Selwyn falling face first into a pillow. Henceforth we enter the dream-world of Diane Selwyn.And a dream-world it is. It is Diane's retrospection of how her life should have played out. Naming herself Betty she steps off a plane full of high hopes of success in a city where dreams come true. Everything is given to her on a plate: a comfortable apartment given to her by an Aunt; a seductive, vulnerable love interest (Rita a.k.a. Chamilla Rhodes) enters her life; her big break in Hollywood is achieved in her first audition; and, a director falls in love with her at first glance. However, even this idyllic dream-world hides an underbelly of dirty-dealings, corruption and murder. Betty's (Diane) love interest, the famous Chamilla Rhodes, was meant to be executed. A car crash allows the now amnesic Chamilla (carrying only money and an odd looking blue key), now naming herself Rita, to wander into the helpful arms of Betty. Adam Kesher, the director of Chamilla Rhodes' latest movie must now replace the missing starlet. However, Adam's choice conflicts with the choice of the corporate studio but stands his ground, to his own demise. The director loses his job, the film is cancelled and even loses his wife. Adam is then given one opportunity by the corporate studio (represented by a ridiculous looking, straight talking cowboy) to get his life and job back. And of course, Adam takes the opportunity and is lured into one of Hollywood's many folds of corruption.The growing love between Rita and Betty, and Betty's continuing endeavours to help Rita regain her memory consume the rest of Diane's dream. Rita is only able to remember one name from her past, none other than a Diane Selwyn. The two women follow this lead and it brings Betty and Rita to Diane's shabby apartment where a corpse of the real Diane Selwyn lays on a bed. Finally, the two women enter a surreal theatre where a blue box is found by Betty. In this box lies the truth, Rita unlocks the blue Pandora's box with her strange key and the dream ends. The corpse in Diane's shabby apartment is told to wake up, we leave the dream and enter the nightmare reality of Diane Selwyn.And a nightmare it is. It is the reality of Diane's life in Hollywood. All of Diane's dreams are fake: she lives in a shabby apartment with unfriendly neighbours; her big break never comes and can only get work in movies Chamilla can get for her; the director is ignorant of her existence; the woman she loves, Chamilla Rhodes, is marrying the director Adam Kesher. And it is this final shocking truth that finally sends the ill-fated Diane into insanity: her jealous rage compels Diane to pay a hit-man to murder Chamilla Rhodes.The dream becomes an abstract parody of her nightmarish reality and of Hollywood. Like Rita in the dream, for example, the blue key is extremely important to unlocking the truth for the audience. The strange blue key in her dream is a normal blue key in her reality. According to the killer in Dianes reality, Diane will know when Chamilla is dead when she sees a blue key. In the dream, Rita finds the key and unlocks the blue box of truth revealing that Diane wanted her killed. Thus the ideal dream ends there. In addition, the idea of the blue box as the keeper of secrets and truths was again seen in Diane's reality in the hands of the scary looking hobo. This could imply that truths in Hollywood are like a piece of rubbish easily discarded and forgotten, like the homeless. A final note, the cowboy, who represents everything corrupt in Hollywood, is taken from a quick glance of a man in costume at a Hollywood party.There are two great features to this film. Firstly, the endless layering of David Lynch's themes will provide multitudes of interpretations and many talking points for years to come. Secondly, Lynch's directorial skill is shown to be second to none. Admittedly, Lynch's trademarks reappear again: fire and flames; red curtains; and that strange looking dwarf. Each of which provide the Lynchian atmosphere' (eerie to say the least). His camera work was imaginative while effectively adding the necessary effects for the surreal world of Mulhollund Drive. If you're open-minded and up for the task it will be a 10/10 film.",Mulholland Drive
780,hobbitonroad,Just awful,6,23 June 2002,"This movie was just awful. The film plays as a self indulgent exploration by a director who appears to be going through a mid-life crisis. The humor is canned, and the droning bass in the background is used to supply the suspense. Is this good directing?

781,jbryanc,Emperor's new clothes are aging,4,8 April 2003,"Mulholland Dr. looks like David Lynch had several movies in the works at one time and, lacking the skill to make sense of any one of them, shuffled them together. At the outset the movie looks like an okay, but badly acted story. The only question is, are they acting like bad actors or are they really bad? The story develops a certain mystery potential for a time and then takes a turn for the incomprehensible. Hey, Dave, you already had the mystery set up, the confusion and random plot twists are not necessary. You could have made an okay, if not brilliant, movie by going with the first plot twist rather than letting it get out of control.",Mulholland Drive
782,jasonpb,One of the best films of this decade so far,10,18 August 2005,"David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. is undoubtedly one of the best films of this decade. The film takes the viewer down an ever-more disturbing path, one that will evoke every feeling in the book before it reaches its raw, nerve-shattering conclusion. As one reviewer put it, ""Mulholland Dr. gets in your head and stays there."" This statement could not be more true. No film is harder to decipher than Mulholland Dr., but from David Lynch, we would expect nothing less. The non-Lynchian crowd will be frustrated to the point of fury, while those who respect Lynch's work will be drawn to this film's complexity and dark symbolism. It takes a special person to enjoy a movie with more metaphors than actual plot, and more symbolism than hard fact. Those who dwell on what is real and what is not will not be able to fully absorb the sheer brilliance this picture. In fact, I recommend that a first-time viewer simply ignore Lynch's cryptic ""10 clues to solving the thriller,"" and just enjoy the film for what it is: a masterpiece of modern film-making which does not rely on big-budget action or cheesy romance, but rather on a consistent and intriguing script and an absorbing, real-life quality that many films lack. Lynch's camera may resemble that of a horror film to many, and indeed at least one scene pushes the gates of the horror genre nearly wide open. The throbbing, often hostile soundtrack will only add to the feeling of fear incurred by this picture. Overall, I found Lynch's newest film to be a piece of cinematic brilliance with few flaws and much to offer for the philosophic, or simply just observant, viewer. Any film that has the ability to lead to hours of pointed discussion between recent viewers (as Mulholland Dr. has a reputation for doing) has done well for itself. Indeed, Mulholland Dr. is a love-it-or-hate-it film, with little or no grey area. Those who love it will watch it countless times, and develop and redevelop long-winded theories and themes that they believe Lynch has hidden in the film. Those who hate it will denounce Lynch has an arrogant surrealist who believes that the more complicated something is, the better it is. For my part, I loved every minute of this film, and each time I watch it, I discover something new. I was speechless after watching this film, with thoughts racing through my head so fast I thought it might explode. Films rarely have that effect on me. For those who are tired of the Hollywood big-budget summer blockbusters full of testosterone-filled men slaughtering each other with machine guns and beautiful women in bikinis disarming nuclear weapons, try something new this summer. Try David Lynch's Mulholland Dr.",Mulholland Drive

some people might think that this movie was pretentious or boring, but for me there was a feeling right from the start that each detail was relevant. i thoroughly enjoyed the intricacies of this movie after i finally figured it out. maybe i am biased since this movie got the best of me at first, but after thinking about it and replaying it in my mind, i am convinced that Mulholland Dr. is an excellent movie.the subtleties of its morals and dry, dark humor (especially involving the director) make it something worth appreciating. the sound effects (or lack of at times) create a disturbing, haunting feel throughout the movie, which is beautifully appropriate for the movie's ""reality"".i will likely watch this one again at some point, and i have already scoured the net to fill in some holes for me (wtf is with the box at the end!).

The ""funny"" dialog directing is supposed to mean something special?Slow... not sometimes quick-quick-slow but s l o w all the time. Thrillerwise it is a failure, because among other things employing music that is supposed to be a bit less or more haunting doesn't make up for the total lack of suspense. I couldn't care less who shot who at the Embarca.. sorry just saw Vertigo again. Me badWhat to other people might look like transitions from one real/surreal reality to another, are to me sometimes just bad cuts. If Twin Peaks was not for you, then stay away from this movie. If you want to watch a something surreal you better watch a Bunuel movie.

I needed to put all the pieces together in order to see it as the masterpiece that it is! It seems very chaotic, but it's logical. In order to understand it, you should pay attention to every detail, even before the movie starts, in the head titles! It's like a fight between Diane and her subconsciousness! She wants to forget, to cancel everything, so she forgets, and she's afraid to remember! It is built with either elements of this inner fight or random people seen elsewhere, just like a real dream is! And let's talk about Naomi Watts: she is great! I would totally put her in my ""The 50 of the Most Beautiful Actresses""! Thanks to her, you can perceive the struggle, feel the pain! From now on there will be spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie yet, don't go further. The first three quarters of the movie are all a dream! And a dream doesn't follow the rules of logic, but it's the manifestation of what we truly feel, mixed with random things seen recently and other stuff that we don't understand at all! But you believe that it's the reality, and when the real reality comes, you don't know what to think. Here's what I understood: Diane wants to be an actress, and after her aunt Ruth dies, uses her money to go to Hollywood. Her parents don't believe in her: this explains the final scene where they laugh, and the initial one too at the station. She meets Camilla Rhodes at a casting, which is the real name of Rita, and it's also the name that in the dream is referred to the blonde one, who kisses the real Camilla at a party. Note that ""Rita"" dresses fake hairs to look like the fake Camilla. Bob, the boss of the casting, in the reality chooses Camilla, but in the dream Betty succeeded. In the dream she is also very good, while Rita is very bad in acting. It sounds like a revenge. The same revenge against Bob, the old man, who is painted like a loser, and the other director. Lynch criticizes Hollywood, which is ruled by references: Camilla gets all her roles because she's going to marry the director. Diane loves Camilla, and discovers this at a party, on Mulholland Drive, and when she goes off the car, the scene is pretty similar with the first one of the dream. Diane is so angry, that asks a bounty killer to kill Camilla, and shows him a photo saying ""she is the one"" (as the mafia in the dream). Then she gives the killer the money in the purse (remember?). The killer says that she will find a blue key when Camilla is dead (remember?). This scene is set in the same pub where the guy with the black hair tells about his dreams, and where Betty goes with Rita. But the waitress, actually named Betty, is Diane in the dream). I like the scene where Rita wants to sleep, thinking that this will solve all problems. Diane doesn't want to kill her anymore (remember the strange scene, where the man on the wheelchair says ""cancel everything""?), but she can't go back. In the head titles you can also see Diane going to sleep, with the same pillow and blanket! Diane hopes that the killer won't be able to do it: in the dream Camilla survives the accident, the killer can't find her and he is goofy, killing three people for a book. The scene at ""Silencio"" starts to make understand it's a dream! ""There is no band, but you can hear it"". Diane switched her apartment (number 12 with 17). When they find the dead body, they hear knocking at the door: this sound wakes Diane in the reality. So she wakes up, and finds the blue key. She cannot live anymore remembering that she killed the woman she loved, so decides to kill herself, falling in a similar pose than the dead girl. The homeless is probably the consciousness of what she has done, and the blue box maybe represents her dream. PS: notice that the mafia called a number, and a black phone, near a red lamp rings. It is Diane's phone! It rings when Camilla invites Diane to the party. PPS: the dance shown in the head titles, it's the one in which Diane was good.",Mulholland Drive

789,hosr2,Wonderfully subversive movie,9,17 January 2004,"Saw this for the second time last night & I really love it. It's a masterpiece - the weirdest yet most enjoyable film noire I've seen.Those who 'explain' the plot are doing a grand job ... but in many ways the point of this movie is that subverts all plots. Just when you think it 'works', it doesn't! No reviewer quite manages to put their finger on how the plot holds, and I love that! I couldn't help but wonder at times if Lynch was taking the p*** out of Hollywood in general, and maybe Tarantino in particular. Whereas Pulp Fiction (a favourite of mine) 'works', Mulholland Drive deliberately subverts the plotline. The result is gorgeous. Oh, and talking of gorgeous ... Naomi Watts. She puts in a stunning performance.Terrific film - a dream-like trance mixing humour and dark, dark, thoughts. What a great antidote to the 95%+ pap that comes out of Tinsel town.",Mulholland Drive
790,witty_pseudonym,Too good to describe,10,13 November 2005,"This film is not just outstanding; it is, in my opinion, the definitive film, the single greatest accomplishment in the history of Cinema. Lynch manages to create an atmosphere that is so unique, so full of unease yet so bittersweet and picturesque. Weaving all the elements that make for a great film, Lynch creates with panache a story of such depth that to many it seems incomprehensible. In truth, the film is so amazingly ambiguous that indeed any body can interpret what is seen and make a legitimate story. That is the beauty of Mulholland Dr. Making a brilliant statement on society and the movie-industry, Mulholland Dr. manages to enthrall and enchant. Unique, amazing, poignant, courageous and unbridled, this is a true mile-stone.",Mulholland Drive
791,cabrita,A real masterpiece from a real master,10,13 April 2004,"Some directors are good, some are bad, some are brilliant and some are real Gods. David Lynch is in this last category, his visual art is elegant and amazing, and his films are real masterpieces.The first movie that I watched from this great movie master was Wild at Heart!!!! I was astonished, I felt like if I was in a gallery surrounded by beautiful paintings and wonderful pictures, I was in shock.From that moment I felt the urgency, the big thirst of looking for all the past movies of Lynch. So that, I could have a big picture of his work.I found everything about Lynch, from ERASERHEAD to TWIN PEAKS; I became a collector of his work. Every year, since he made FIRE WALK WITH ME, I was exciting waiting for his new work.And then he made Lost Highway, The Straight Story and Mulholland Drive.All different movies, but with something in common, his director, his personal view and touchDavid Lynch is a surrealist artist. Like Luis Buñuel, Lynch is one director who knows how to manage the strange, the noir, the dreams and the nightmares in his films. And he does it excellent, flawless!!!!MULHOLLAND DR. is a brilliant movie, is the Lynch world at his best form.The club El Silencio is a key place to understand the film. To love this masterpiece you don't have to be a Lynch's fan. You'll like it if you love good movies.Laura Harring and Naomi Watts, both of them play two different characters, and that's why this movie is a puzzle.Naomi Watts as Betty/Diane play a powerful character, her acting is thrilling. And this movie, at the start is her nightmare, and at the end is her true destiny.Of course you'll find some strange characters, something usual in Lynch's movies. The Cowboy, Mr. Roque, The man behind Winkies and the Castigliane brothers. They are all created by Diane in her own dreams.The performance of `Crying' by Rebekah del Rio, is devastating. This is a beautiful song written by the great Roy Orbison. She sings it without instruments, without orchestra.Don't look for sense in this movie, like Lost Highway, this is a dream/nightmare that may mess up your sense of the right way movies goes on. Just watch it and enjoy it, which is the best you can do. Remember the real world of Diane is the last twenty five minutes of the movie, all the rest is her dream.In this movie Lynch works with his regular collaborators: Angelo Badalamenti, (since Blue Velvet he started a rich relationship with the director) with a great original music; Peter Deming an excellent cinematography and Mary Sweeney with a flawless film editing.This great film won several awards, Lynch won the Best Director award at the Cannes Film festival in the year 2001. Also he received an Academy Award Nomination.Mulholland Drive is a fine masterpiece in visual art. This is real interaction between the movie and the audience, you can feel like if you are in a gallery, watching pictures.David Lynch is with no doubt, one of the best directors in cinema historyThis film deserves 10/10.",Mulholland Drive
792,thejamaicancritic,David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. has brought Spanish cinema to Hollywood,9,11 June 2016,"David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. has brought Spanish cinema to Hollywood. Mulholland Drive captivates audiences with its sheer storytelling,characters and bold visuals without reliance on, or even the existence of a steady plot. The audience does not know for the most part, what the movie is about, who some of the characters are, or how they even play apart in the story, yet, it doesn't seem to matter. There is something spellbinding about the film and you are captured and drawn into this non-linear mystery with little sense of control.The analogy to Spanish cinema is made as it reminds you of Latin American classics such as ""All About My mother"" (1999) and ""Open Your Eyes"" (1997).Lynch's usage of bold colors and dreamy photography also invites this comparison. The non-linear nature of the film is also reminiscent of earlier Hollywood works such as ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (1998) yet Mulholland Dr. is in a class of its own. It stands out and is interesting because you have never seen a film quite like it before.Unlike, traditional Hollywood narratives, there is a mystery, but the audience doesn't care for it to be solved, rather the awe comes from watching the characters trapped in it and how they man-oeuvre their way. Mulholland Dr. is a full drama wrapped with elements of horror, fantasy and is a thriller in its own respect. It is one of several films which have discarded the Hollywood dream for many. It adds to the likes of ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1956) and ""All about Eve"" (1950) but is darker and more eerie, but in equal parts expertly acted and directed.Naomi Watts as the perky Hollywood hopeful, Betty, and later as failed actress Dianne Selwyn is arguably one of the stronger and more ranged performances of an actress on screen in recent time. However, Laura Harring bravado performance as the amnesia-tic ""Rita"" carries the film and acts as a canvas for Lynch's unconventional direction. The cast is excellently rounded out by Justin Theroux as the perplexed movie director, Adam Kesher, and Ann Miller as Coco, the ever-present landlady. After watching Mulholland Drive you will remember three things: a small blue box, a haunting post midnight performance of ""silencio"" and the line ""you don't stop here."" What you won't remember is what the film is about or where it began or where it ends for that matter. Nevertheless, you will know you have just witnessed an incredible piece of cinema, known only by the name of the street, Mulholland Drive.",Mulholland Drive
793,asrever,Let's Take a Drive with no Destination,10,26 September 2004,"I was expecting this movie for a long time, ever since a friend of mine told me she couldn't get the point of it...and then another friend told how this movie was so confusing, and so on. By having these antecedents and also knowing who was the director and writer of this movie (David Lynch), I felt so hungry for a Mulholland Drive, a drive with no destination nor end.Everything will start with an accident, a car accident that will take this beautiful brunet to a place she had known before but now it was totally erased from her memories. Then everything did not started with a car accident, it started way before that, when this gorgeous brunet was a Camilla and had a Diane girlfriend who was no longer her girlfriend since Camilla forgot about her and decided to join lives with Adam (Justin Theroux), the film director that was just a small part in this mixture of paths. Who's paths? The paths of the Brunet and the Blond girl, the ways of this two lovers that will always end up walking together no matter what story, what life or what destiny the little box and its key will create for them. The Box was a life giver and it was also a life taker, a dimension portal guarded by this mysterious creature a symbol that represents all the unknown all of that we can't explain. In that Box lives an old couple, they make sure the destiny that was given by the box is complete, they follow their victims until the mission it's achieved as if they were the destiny themselves. The killer is looking for the brunet as all the other killers are since Diane or lets say ""the blond girl"" decided to, not knowing what exactly did she do. The killer was also the one in charge to give the key, but what does that key opens? what does it do? it opens the past and probably the future, it opens the circle within the Box. The cowboy it's a guard, all places must have someone to take care of the details, that someone or something will always be there as a silent spirit moving and changing small elements that keep the boundaries, the limits safe from the chaos. The man in the chair, with no words will tell you what to do. He observes, he watches you and if you have a doubt he will make sure you get an answer. Just ask.But the killer didn't kill the now Rita before Camilla (Laura Elena Harring), so she had a second chance by forgetting everything about her past, her lover soon will find her the now Betty before Diane (Naomi Watts) and they will again walk together no matter what life comes next, they will find their love over, and over again, because since they found the key that will take them to the box, they are trapped in this dream, this circle of lives and destinies called ""Mulholland Drive"".",Mulholland Drive

I defy anyone to come up with a definitive explanation to the series of bizarre events and twists surrounding an aspiring actress's climb and downfall in Hollywood. Even after multiple viewings, there is always a different slant an angle - was it a dream? Is there a supernatural conspiracy??? - and there is still no satisfactory answer. A fastidious film which deserves attention to every detail in every scene which are pieces in a never unravelling puzzle. This is David Lynch's film with an excellent score by Angelo Badalmednti, whilst Naoimi Watts simply excels. A genuine treat and definitely one of the greatest films ever made.",Mulholland Drive

I truly thought this movie was going to be a thrilling great movie but sadly i was wrong. A very twisted and weird movie, that will leave you thinking WHAT DID I EVEN WATCH? If you guys are into movies that has no connection, no story and is weird then this movie is for you. I hope i never come across a movie like this ever again, unfortunately i might in the future lol.

It's so bad that at the end of the movie, a man sat in front of me in the theater stood up and shouted to the audience, ""Ladies and gentlemen, congratulations on wasting two hours of your lives!"" The film starts out so well and builds up tension nicely by introducing the characters. Naomi Watts, as usual, is terrific. She is one of the most versatile actresses in Hollywood today and manages to hold together a film that otherwise zigzags out of control leaving the audience wondering what on earth is going on.I can't really say much more about the film because I honestly don't know what it's about. I felt it was nothing more than a series of incomprehensible skits that didn't quite mesh to form something coherent. I don't want to recommend this movie, but unfortunately it's one of those films that everyone has seen and so needs to be seen...",Mulholland Drive
797,Self-4,BEST OF 2001,10,23 April 2002,"[MAJOR SPOILERS -- POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF THE PLOT] Created at 3:00am in the morning, upon 3rd view of the movie. If we are to make sense of this movie (which I think is possible despite some critics' reviews) we have to separate the changes in the first (up to the point when the blue box is opened) and second half of the movie and call them either facts/realities or lies/illusions. In addition, we must understand which parts are relevant in our analysis of the plot and which facts are not so relevant. So here is one explanation that can account for the majority of scenes in the movie and is the one that you undoubtedly heard: everything up to the point of the blue box drop is a dream. Yes, this explains a lot but we have to be careful here. If something or somebody appears in a person's dream, does this render all the facts in the dream false? Absolutely no. Like any other dream, the dream in the movie contains both facts and fiction; it also can take a fact, a real event, relationship, names and even words and turn it into something new and unreal, out of place and extraordinary. Like any other dream, it can indulge in wishful thinking making one's reality appear in a better light than it really is. In short, a dream can make whatever it wishes to make. Here I have to borrow Ebert's words that can better convey what I mean: ""Like real dreams, it does not explain, does not complete its sequences, lingers over what it finds fascinating, dismisses unpromising plotlines."" (Ebert) For example, take the early scene in which a man sitting in a restaurant tries to explain to his friend the dream, in which a man seen by him through a wall scares the living crap out of him. Do these people appear later in the movie? One of them does. Are they by themselves relevant to the plot? Not really but the circumstances that surround them are. You'll see my point later on. Now let me try to explain some of the scenes in the movie. The first scene in which Rita rides in a limo is Diane's dream. This claim is supported by the improbable survival of Rita that leaves her not only alive but conveniently vulnerable (for Diane) and having no memory of who she really is. Also, notice that there were two cars that caused the crash, two for each lane. One did crash into the limo but what happened to the other one? They didn't stop to see what happened and help possible survivors? Remember, like every dream it doesn't explain, it doesn't need to be logical and thorough, that's how our brains work while dreaming. The dream simply threw that second car out of the picture and forgot about it. Where am I going with this? Well, I believe that all characters in the first half of the movie while not fictional occupy different/fictional positions and play fictional or slightly different roles than in the second half, in which in my opinion they reveal their true selves. Still, it seems that every character in the first part (the dream part) met, saw or knew Diane in the real, second part. This happens in our dreams too. A character that we have met only once or twice in our lives or the one that we've seen just for a split second (the cowboy in the Adam's party scene in the second half) can take center stage in our dreams. This explains how the mob guy whom Diane saw at Adam's part towards the end of the movie is given a relatively prominent role in her dream - he is seen as the major force behind the campaign to pressure the director to accept Camilla for the role in his film.I regret that I don't have space to account for every little detail but here's my take in short: Diane, who is completely in love with Camilla, hires a hit man to kill her when she realizes that Camilla will never be hers. She pays the killer the money that she inherited from her aunt and is given a blue key. The key may be a metaphor but is likely to open something that Diane can open to see evidence of Camilla's death (like her watch, which we see on the ground next to the blue box). We then see her at home, besieged by the guilt, represented by the old lady and old man, the very first people she met when she came to L.A. At this point Camilla is likely dead; Diane hears her screams in the head. She can't take it any more and commits suicide. The entire first half of the movie is perhaps the last thing that she sees before passing away (the old ""the entire life flashes before her eyes"" cliché) or is her dream but earlier before the cowboy (an illusion) comes to wake her up. All scenes in the first half of the movie involving the director, the mob guys, the guy in the wheelchair and the killer are most likely a dream too. Take what happened to the director, for example. Diane upon hearing that Adam and Camilla are about to be engaged/married (not explicitly said in the movie), develops such hatred toward Adam, who stole her love, that she sees Adam in her dream as having the most improbable bad day - he loses his job, wife, money, gets beat up and is harassed by a mob. Remember, dreams can linger in wishful thinking and create whatever they want to create. In other words, the only real Adam in the movie is at the party. We can use the aforementioned theory to account for pretty much every scene and fact in the movie.",Mulholland Drive
798,jjmoney,It's fun to have your brain melted,10,9 October 2001,"I have to say, at the end of this film, I was utterly confounded, mystified, disturbed, fascinated, and it felt as if someone had driven a truck through my brain.  However, I truly enjoyed the feeling.  I saw ""Mulholland Drive"", and I was completely involved from beginning to end.  Do I understand it? Nah.  Is that okay?  Yup.This is definitely Lynch's best film since ""Blue Velvet"".  Many people will be comparing MD to that truly brilliant film, Lynch's magnum opus, and others will doubtless be comparing it to what I believe to be his weakest effort, ""Lost Highway"".  But the fact is, where ""LH"" was abrasive, murky, unpleasant, and often ridiculous, ""MD"" is lyrical, subtle, creepy, poignant, terrifying, and quite wonderfully loopy.We get all of the trademark Lynch stuff:  the droning, vibratingly dramatic score, which is remarkably effective and creepy; we also get the syrupy, overdone, deliberately cheesy dramatic scenes (as when a young blonde actress beatifically describes Los Angeles as ""Some sort of wonderful dream-land!!!"") and the aggro-bizarre moments that seem utterly separate from reality...or at least a reality we might be familiar with.But what I really loved about this movie was the brilliant way in which Lynch joyfully screws with the collective mind of the audience.  He sets up the first 90 minutes of the movie as a straight-ahead, linear Noir-mystery, with two beautiful young women (one an amnesiac car accident victim, the other a naive aspiring actress) trying to figure out the amnesiac's identity.  He also introduces several seemingly unrelated subplots--one involving a frustrated young criminal who undergoes a truly hilarious and brilliantly-staged series of mishaps during an otherwise typical murder-heist.  Another involving a hip young movie director who is coerced by a pair of Italian gangsters to hire an unknown starlet for the leading role in his next film.And then there's the ingeniously creepy opening scene where a disturbed young man tells his (shrink?) about the nightmare that has been plaguing him whilst dining at a Denny's like restaurant, only to have the dream begin to come true...It's best not to reveal anything else.  But suffice to say, there are more twists, turns, surprises, fantastic red herrings, McGuffins, and delicious samples of twisted erotica to satisfy any Lynch fan.  The film, as I said before, confounded me utterly--but I loved every minute of it.  I will always remember certain random images:  dribbling espresso, a shiny blue box, a series of blue keys, an ashtray in the shape of a piano, hallucinogenic jitterbugging, Ann Miller's mottled claw reaching into a bowl of walnuts, and a Lynchian blue-haired woman uttering the word ""silencio"".Gorgeous, trippy, scary, and fantastically strange...""Mulholland Drive"" is 2001's best film thus far.  Thanks, Dave!  It's been awhile since ""Blue Velvet"", but you've finally delivered the goods.",Mulholland Drive

800,buffelina22,A Brilliant Postmodern Tour-de-Force,10,7 February 2002,"A riveting and innovative meta-cinematic masterpiece! In true postmodern fashion, this film brilliantly explores the narcissistic and schizophrenic nature of Hollywood and the human individual. A complex and labyrinth of love, naivete, heartache, broken dreams (literal and metaphoric), unfixed identities and plot twists, Mulholland Drive encourages multiple viewings as it is itself comprised of multiple meanings.Equally multiple are the paralleled layers of identity and reality in this film. Drive mirrors the film industry which reflects our own dream worlds, our reconstructions of ourselves and our realities. The film seduces the members of its audience, changing them into riddle-solvers like Oedipa Maas in Thomas Pynchon's novel The Crying of Lot 49, and like Betty (Watts) and Rita (Harring) themselves. The audience, once its identity has been shifted into that of detective, tries to piece together and make sense out of Drive's ostensibly inexplicable connections and ever-shifting identities and occurrences. As the film eludes resolution, it leaves its audience wondering: is there such a thing as an authentic or fixed identity? Do demons and nightmares emerge, as they do for Diane, when we lose ourselves in our dream worlds (be they in the movies or in our own imaginations)? Or are fluid and multiple identities and realities perhaps more authentic and ""real"" than what we perceive as real? Moreover, does not having a fixed self or fixed reality offer the human individual a wealth of potential and possibilities? The surreal may not be all that bad after all, which may be what Lynch is hinting at in Drive. The two moments in the film that best encapsulate the value and dignity of the complex human individual are the love scene between Betty and Rita, rendered with utmost tenderness, and Del Toro's beautiful rendition of Roy Orbison's ""Crying,"" which compels the audience to cry along with Betty and Rita and to cry at the simultaneous beauty and ugliness of human existence that Drive mirrors so well. The film's end seduces the audience one last time with a reminder, ""Silencio...,"" but Mulholland Drive seduces us to be anything but silent about its noir world. Once it becomes your parallel universe, you will find yourself continuously driving through its labyrinth of multiple meanings and possible interpretations, reconstructing your reality again and again.",Mulholland Drive
801,buffelina22,Getting Lost in Confusion is Beautiful,10,19 January 2004,"Mulholland Drive is a conundrum that is just as curvy and convoluted as the road for which the film is named. Set in the mysterious and menacing `dream world' of Los Angeles, the film circles around a trance-like landscape where the actual amalgamates with the fantastic, defying logic. Lynch's surrealist techniques--unnatural juxtapositions, irrational ""realities"" of dreams, circular narrative, and shifting identities--combine to form a beautiful composition, like a painting by Dali. Although Mulholland Drive does not adhere to any logical structure, each mirage of sight and sound evokes several emotional responses within the viewer. Usually, any piece of art will speak to us on an emotional level. And we usually cannot explain why; it just does. Likewise, I cannot explain all of the reasons Mulholland Drive speaks to me; it just does.",Mulholland Drive

804,mlopezib8,Absolutely awesome trip,10,25 June 2008,"The first time I watched this movie I was 18 years old. The film had just been released and it was my first contact with the universe of Lynch. Couldn't have started better. I went to the cinema with my friends. We all got trapped by the story. Though I really enjoyed the projection, I couldn't state to be satisfied with the result when I left the room. For me, it had been a non-sense plot. My friends and I spent more than an hour trying to construct a solid theory about the movie. It didn't work. However, something curious happened to me the following days. The more I thought of Mulholland Dr. the more I felt it was a masterpiece. Once I watched the movie one more time, all my doubts were wiped away. Several theories have been developed since this film was released. I'm not going to discuss here what the argument is about or the conclusions. My advice: watch it and let yourself go. Lynch will take you to a fantastic trip and if you really want to enjoy it, stop wondering what is going on. This film is about senses and for the senses, images trap the viewer and take him/her through the world of dreams, fears, nightmares and illusions. The scene at the Silencio Club is basically pure visual poetry that escapes from the screen and makes you feel pity, hurt, uncomfortable and humbled. In conclusion, don't insist on trying to understand 100% the movie. There will be time to think once you recover from the ride. Simply, one of the best movies ever made.",Mulholland Drive
805,mimino99,The true power of cinema,10,31 May 2020,"This is all a movie should be: haunting, gripping, mindblowing, and unforgettable.
There are great chances you will stand speechless when the end credits begin. You will probably be left wondering what the **** just happened and whether David Lynch was playing a trick on you.
If you give up quickly, you will probably jump to the easiest conclusion that this movie made no sense at all and that no efforts were in consistence and coherence. You might angrily leave a 1/10 rating on IMDb to emphasise your frustration and then decide to move on.
But my advice is don't. Instead, take a shower to think about what you just watched, then come back, look up Lynch's 10 clues on the Blu-Ray format of ""Mulholland Drive"", and watch the movie again paying attention to the details mentioned in those clues.And that is when you will be able to appreciate the true genius behind it all. That's when the movie might leave you in awe. Lynch didn't create a movie, but some sort of treasure hunt disguised in a movie format.
Without a doubt, David Lynch's style is unique and inimitable, and no director will ever resemble him.And if you didn't like the movie, fair enough. But at least one thing is for sure: you will never ever forget that you watched it. And to me, that is the true power of cinema.",Mulholland Drive
806,bratpac911,Appreciation through intellect,10,31 March 2007,"This comment is in response to previous comments which have offended one's intellect by assuming that appreciation for this film can only be given by perverts or idiots. This is an entirely unfair assessment that I truly resent. Creativity is not defined by our understanding of it. Would you challenge a haiku because it is not written as a limerick? A short story because it is not a novel? As the cliché goes, you are comparing apples and oranges; both are fruit but beyond that they have little in common. Mulholland Dr. is not supposed to have a specific meaning and that is what makes it art and/or poetry. The author/director may have initially had a meaning in mind but it is always up to the viewer/reader to apply their own interpretation. Lynch never claimed that his work had a simple meaning or that it had any central meaning at all. It is supposed to be stimulating and provoking. It is truly irrelevant whether you loved it or hated it but how you felt while watching it. That is, if you could step back from your judgemental thoughts for a minute to just absorb. Lastly, even if you hated the movie, I cannot imagine what would inspire one to insult those who enjoyed it. I tried to understand where these cynics were coming from by looking at their previous ratings of other films and would often find myself agreeing with their choices with the exception of this film. With that said, I am no more a pervert or idiot then those who have categorized me to be, and I must say, I adored this movie. Keep them coming Mr. Lynch.",Mulholland Drive
807,cma75,verging on surrealism,10,24 November 2001,"Whereas ""Lost Highway"" was psychoanalytical, dwelling on our most archaic fears, precise after all, ""Mulholland Dr."", abbreviated as it is, possibly willing to evoke what cannot be described, angst, turns out to be surrealistic and thus may explain why and how there is a bridge between the discoveries of Sigmund Freud (subconsciousness and dreams) and the art of Dali and Bunuel (collage and role playing). It's hard to figure, though, whether that drift is decadence or not.",Mulholland Drive

It isn't an easy watch, and may require multiple viewings to even start to understand what's going on. It's a film that will keep you thinking, long after it has ended. For some, this isn't a good thing, but for me, it
is what makes it so great.Each time you watch this film you'll have a different view on the storyline/plot. It has a fantastic cast, with great performances, endless re-watch capability, and a fascinating plot.Definitely worth a watch, and in my opinion is Lynch's best film. 10/10",Mulholland Drive
809,Pitchforkdisney,How can anyone attempt to review the unreviewable?!,9,28 November 2001,"There can never be anyone else who makes films like Lynch. Selfish and personal to him, but somehow open to interpretation by so many others that he is able to pull in a respectable audience. From the genius (almost mainstream) beauty of The Straight Story to this - arguably his most mindbending and confusing movie since Eraserhead, even Lost Highway seems simple in comparison. Typical Lynch, it's haunting me now, 3 days after seeing it and walking out of the cinema in a state of bemused wonder. Friends watch cheesy action movies again and again - I can't watch'em more than once - Lynch's films demand you watch them again and again...Mulholland Drive is one hell of a ride. For now I'll give it a 9, just for the fact that it's original made for TV status shows in certain areas.",Mulholland Drive
810,jef-frisone-1,Lynch's Masterpiece,10,5 May 2012,"This is maybe not my favorite Lynch film, but I feel it is his masterpiece. All the threads he has been working on for years finally come together in one story. I prefer Inland Empire because of its truly dreamlike ambiance, but this film never ceases to intrigue me. The acting is excellent, esp Watts. The editing and cinematography are superb, the music sublime. It is shameful that the film only received one Oscar nod for Lynch (though he deserved it). It could easily and should have been nominated for film (as it was here in France), for music, for editing, for cinematography. Instead, we got typical John Williams type of music, a feel-good film, etc, as winners. I think Lynch perfected the language of cinematic-dream language in Inland Empire, but this one comes close. Kept my friends wondering for days what was really going on through the whole film. You can't ask anymore of a film: if it makes you think, you remember it, even if you hate it. So better than so many films that are in one eye and out the other.",Mulholland Drive

And even if some fragments could be assembled easily, it was difficult to interconnect them. Actually, after having tried in vain to understand the plot, I decided to look at the movie from a somewhat different point of view. I just looked at it as a collection of short scenes (such as a guy telling a dream, Betty's audition and a triple murder). In this way I didn't bother searching the clear connections between the scenes and just enjoyed each episode separately.Perhaps, it's the main idea of a mystery movie: to leave a spectator's questions unanswered, the mystery unrevealed. And just as a hint that tells you that it's rather a phantasmagoric dream, David Lynch offers you an unexpected ending, which is like a summary of the fun and mystery of the movie.",Mulholland Drive
813,maneesh8,Excellent movie in parts.,7,31 January 2002,"First one and half hour of this movie is excellent. Very fine acting by Naomi Watts. This movie reminded me of a story by W S Maugham, where the main character is trying to escape from his murderer, the story is written in first person, and in end he describes, how he was killed. This, in my opinion, though a good experiment, but kind of deceive the reader.
Same is true for this movie in a way; in end 30 minutes you realize that what ever you have seen so far, an excellent and engaging plot, is either a dream sequence or a fantasy.The scene where Hollywood director is persuaded to cast the lead actress by Cowboy (an underworld person) reminded very much Mario Puzo's Godfather; only difference, it was better.Over all, I would say this movie is still worth watching, just on merit of first one and half hour.",Mulholland Drive

815,bobbyallright,Makes a dull story turn to exciting mystery,8,7 December 2007,"The typical story of a nobody going to Hollywood in search of opportunity isn't that exciting and we've all heard that story enough times. But here Lynch makes it exciting in his suspenseful way and with the actresses he chose for the roles, Watts and Harring. When 'Betty' gets to Hollywood and she has great place to stay and a smashingly good audition I started to question the reality and was tempted to go to sleep at this point. But Lynch turns it around completely with all the hits that this is a dream world and in the end shows it to be only a fantasy. The reality is that she came to LA and failed miserably and were it not for the Diana's sexual interest in her and petty parts given her she would have either went packing back to Canada or ended up as a hooker. Who knows. Eventually Betty has Diana killed by a hit man out of jealous rage over her unfaithfulness. There are many spooky scenes throughout that will leave you wondering what the heck? Such as the cowboy, the old couple, the next door neighbor, the dark figure with the blue box. All of these are Lynch's way of hinting that this is all an evil dream. I saw this on regular TV which was heavily edited, and sadly missing some of the more 'light' and humorous parts in the movie such as after the hit man offs the guy in the office he then has trouble exiting the office cleanly with complicated action involving the lady in the next office and the vacuum guy and then the vacuum itself. Also was missing the full length of the cowboy scene which was simply knee slapping. So I had to go out watch to full 'real' version of the movie. You'll like this movie if you want something different from the typical predictable and thoughtlessness of the usual Hollywood Box Office.",Mulholland Drive
816,byroncallas,Repeated viewing yields rich rewards -- and Naomi Watts is Best Actress,10,15 February 2002,"I hate to begrudge anyone their Oscar nomination, but that Naomi Watts wasn't nominated for best actress this year is astounding. There were fine performances by several actresses this year and some of them were even nominated. Watts's performance, however, was far and above any other hat in the ring. Her exclusion seems shameful. I accept that the Oscars have their political underbelly and bemoaning that, I suppose, is naïve. When you think about it, neglecting Watts is not a bad metaphor for at least one of the underlying themes in Mulholland Drive, a richly textured masterpiece.I'm wonder that it isn't common to go to see good movies numerous times. The best films are so rich and complex. It takes repeated viewings to thoroughly appreciate the jewels waiting to be discovered underneath the surface. Much like repeated listening to a great but complex symphony, with repeated viewings Mulholland Drive's rich mysteries unravel to reveal a coherent, elegant, satisfying logic.I've seen Mulholland drive eight times, and will see it again this evening. I have found each new viewing to be more intellectually and emotionally satisfying than the previous viewing as the whole work comes more and more into focus  a `grok' if you will. I understand that the film may not be to everyone's liking or temperament. I suspect, however, that most film lovers will find repeated viewings of this multi-layered, beautifully photographed, brilliantly acted and authoritatively directed work highly rewarding.I can't help but repeat myself about the Naomi Watts oversight. This thoroughly satisfying film that many find so mysterious is an apex of clarity compared to this mysterious injustice at the hands of ones supposed peers. It's a wonder that Lynch was nominated for best director while all of the other remarkable achievements of his masterpiece have been entirely overlooked by the Academy  most notable being Naomi Watts's remarkable performance.",Mulholland Drive

Unique storyline, keeping the viewer wondering what is going on and what will happen next. Amnesia, psychotic illusion, impossible to work out 'a satisfying interpretation'. Superb acting, characters all believable and often very sinister. Places are often weirdly familiar. I even thought I could smell some of the locations! The music is also quite spine-chilling and haunts you for days. A movie to remember and see several times.Director Lynch has made his masterpiece, far excelling Blue Velvet. I wonder if I could drive up there again without getting the creeps! Silencio! Silencio!",Mulholland Drive
819,tomcon22,Completely explainable....and brilliant,10,1 May 2002,"David Lynch is a director whose work is not concerned with detail or explanation. He does not give the viewer a complete picture of characters or situations. He does not go out of his way to spell out the intent of a character or explain the meaning of certain events in his movies. There are many effective movies that explain everything and provide complete answers, but it's just not Lynch's style.David Lynch once referred in an interview to the danger of over-analyzing everything around us.  Once we begin to overthink something that has a positive or negative effect on us, that thing begins to lose its effect. The moon was much more mysterious before man walked on it. Life, in general, is full of unanswered questions. Sometimes we have feelings or emotions that are unexplained, pleasurable or not. Many times we have dreams that cannot be explained. Lynch completely manipulates these feelings, emotions, and dreams with Mulholland Drive by providing us with situations, characters, and images that are pleasurable, frightening, and everything in between.If you did not like this movie because no answers were provided, I would urge you see it again at some point. Believe it or not, this movie DID make sense to me although not after the first viewing.",Mulholland Drive
820,theENK,"Shame on you, Mr. Lynch!",1,17 June 2002,"I usually enjoy mind bending and thought provoking films, but this one was just awful. I just don't buy it. I'm actually a Lynch fan, but I'm very disappointed in him for making this hunk of B.S. Very bad acting from the supporting cast and very awkward dialogue with even more awkward pauses in between lines throughout the whole movie. VERY ANNOYING.Please do not judge Mr. Lynch based on this film. He has done a few other films that are very well written and played out. Mullholland Drive, in my opinion is a cheap attempt to kiss Hollywood ass, not show Hollywood what it is missing and desperately needs in such films as Blue Velvet and Lost Highway. Both are great films by the way. I don't know about you guys, I'm I am really sick of wannabe thrillers (especially the last couple of years) where the plot does not make sense, or is set to confuse you until the end...when you ""Get it"". It's been tired, tried, and worn out. You know the films I'm talking about...they use elements such as amnesia, flashbacks, random characters and twists to make up for lack of plot, a true story line,  and character development... Anyway. This film really has nothing to offer and is not original in any sense. Don't believe the hype!",Mulholland Drive
821,trinitycm,a contemporary analysis of David Lynch's latest atrocity,1,16 March 2003,"I want 2 hours of my life back.  David Lynch deliberately stole two hours of my life with an arbitrarily complicated plot intended to confuse the be-jeezus out of people...the only possible reason he had to do this...because he didnt have enough time, money, or idea to finish this movie.  I think its funny how so many people think this movie is fantastic. The only reason I see for this is that people must assume that if they dont understand the movie, it must be a work of art beyond the scope of the common man.  Believe me, this is not the case.  I love complicated movies. Memento is amazing...LA Confidential is amazing...do you know what made these movies work?  They had ideas!  They had plot!  Please note the top 100 movies...they all have plots that ""normal"" people can understand.  No immense volume of words can even begin to explain the awfulness of this movie.  To finish, a quote from Lewis Black...if you ever have any aspiration of seeing this movie, ""why dont you take out a pencil, sharpen it, and stick it in your eye...because you'll have more fun sitting in the hospital emergency room trying to hold the pencil steady.""***spoilers*** Oh yeah...symbolism...ummm...this movie was rank full of it (thats a double pun) People who believe in this movie have tried to explain it to me...I understand what they say:  She lives out her wanted life in her head and we see the contrast of that with her real life and how dreams are shattered by the reality of life.  She is obsessed with the actress and wants more than anything to be with her and b/c she cant, she wants to upstage her...but in the end, she realizes that all of her dreams have failed and so (post furious, superfluous masturbation) she kills herself.  Every other bit of symbolism is dealing with her shattered and failed dreams of stardom.  I get this explanation...but the movie is still awful.  There are far better ways of showing this...in fact, movies have been made about failed dreams...a lot of them in fact...I recommend seeing one of these rather than enduring the stabbing pain of trying to figure out this movie.  I recommend a different activity to partake in besides watching this film: write a script and send it to David Lynch.",Mulholland Drive

I really wanted to see it for God knows what reason and I discovered that Lynch might as well just make movies for his own pleasure these days, but that's just me.  I feel sorry for Jennifer Syme, since this horrible 'movie' (if you define the term lightly) is dedicated to her.  Don't rent this movie, whatever you do, you'll be glad.

825,daha1120,The only mystery here is why I even bothered with this tripe,3,24 February 2013,"Somehow this confusingly butchered mess is generally considered to be some of Lynchs best work alongside Eraserhead and Blue Velvet, while Wild at Heart, one of his films that will actually stand the test of time, is, for the time being, probably his most widely dismissed. While Wild at Heart applies liberal experimentalism to the technical aspects of the film, it allows for a mercifully comprehensible plot (his only other works featuring this attribute being Eraserhead, sort of, Elephant Man, his worst movie until this one, and his somewhat lame Disney effort The Straight Story). Give me a break. People think this is better because they just simply don't like ugliness or truth. So instead of Willem DaFoe achieving his personal pinnacle of creepiness and Nick Cage achieving his own personal height of greasiness in various backwater hellholes, you have hot, nude lipstick lesbians making out in lush Hollywood surroundings. Voila, everyone loves it even though nobody (including Lynch himself) knows what the hell its about. Not to mention the really cheesy music video-esque effects that plague the final act of this. How anyone can argue that this aborted TV pilot with a 45 minute long non-ending slapped onto it wasn't truly Lynchs weakest feature at this point, I don't know, but it clearly follows a downward trend that started with Lost Highway and has culminated with his fizzling out as a feature length filmmaker. But I guess all people ever really wanted out of him was to be the most pretentious softcore porn director ever.",Mulholland Drive
826,svores90,An odd avant garde film,5,28 March 2012,"If you haven't ever seen David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. be prepared for two and a half hours of what I can only describe as a twisted nightmarish tale inside Lynch's mind. They film leaves a lot to be desired, well at least as the average movie-goer is concerned. I'm not sure if the version I had was defective but I found the sound editing to be a little off, for instance during a scene of heightened intensity the audience has a calm high pitch note lingering until a corpse is revealed, next it cuts to outside said set to another character walking towards their own house and finally we have a very loud and almost obnoxious burst of sound that I'm pretty sure was intended for a good ten seconds before (when the corpse was first discovered). Also it seemed liked they switched on and off from voice overs and actually using a boom to capture sound. While the cinematography had some interesting cuts (flashes of extreme close ups and other infamous Lynch shots) it appears that they shot entirely too much film and left the rest up to the editor, who did their damnest to make a cohesive story line which structure is about as solid as a nightmare. If you have the time and energy to sit and examine the film I'm sure it is laced with hundreds of little clues to lead you to some marvelous discovery but upon your first viewing you will be left saying WTF?",Mulholland Drive
827,ali-davari-2010,Dreamfull!,9,3 June 2018,"In this era where movies with profound context are really hard to find, we begin the 21st century with a movie that represents it's genre for good. Mulholland Dr. is not a movie to get just relaxed and watch it. It gets you on your toes from the very beginning to the end of the movie.
It's one of those double-watch movies, which you have to watch twice or even more to get a general understanding of lies beneath the whole scenes. 
No matter how you watch it, It WILL make sense from each aspect you look through the movie. It could get you as a love story, a confound surreal movie, aesthetic thriller or else. 
What really got me the first time I watched it was the color use in scenes. The three famous Red, White and Blue shades and the color Black. Certainly the colors are correlated to the Story. An enthusiastic young girls who chases her dreams and comes to Hollywood to get them, Which reminds us of all ""American Dream"" where your dreams become true and the red white and blue colors used in the scenes are representations of the American flag i.e America itself. But what is more interesting is the use of the Black color. The black usually reminds us of darkness and impurity and the bad things. It is highly possible that what the Director wanted to say- or at least one of the things he wanted to say!- is that beneath all the shiny enormous industry of Hollywood there's lies, There's darkness, And there's resented things that only you realize when you deal with them yourself.
And of course there's other messages in the movies but they're out of our time to be explained now. So we leave it to here and let YOU find the all that is going on in the plot to say to us. Or even don't bother and forget all the hidden things and just enjoy the movie itself. It's a surreal movie after all, It doesn't have to make sense to enjoy!",Mulholland Drive
828,bastard-from-a-basket,Nothing like you've ever seen,9,1 August 2012,"Oh my gosh, I don't know from where to start. I just like an ordinary viewer came to know about David Lynch from the Internet. From what was written about him in Internet it made restless to watch his films and particularly Mulholland Dr. I feel blessed that I watched that movie. It gave me the most terrific cinematic experience in my life. I watched this movie and got plunged into the most dramatic plot ever. the film started pretty simply with a aspiring small town girl Betty making her way towards the mighty Hollywood who goes to live in her aunt's exotic apartment and finds a completely clueless amnesiac woman who just had escaped from a terrible accident at Mulholland Dr. Betty helps her to find out who she is. They end up falling in love with each other then bizarre things start to happen. Lynch cleverly introduces two new characters Camilla Rhodes and Diane Selwyn and establishes a drammatical relationship between them. Guess what Betty is Diane and the amnesiac woman is Camilla. The film then explores the astonishing chain of events which will just blow your mindYou will just be overwhelmed by the intrigue, thrill and suspense David Lynch has produced. After the movie completes you will just go wild and think ""What the hell happened in that movie"" and you will start developing your little theory about this movie. I have watched this movie thrice and pretty sure what happened in that movie but next time I watch it I will try to make justification about the characters which I had ignored during my last three watches. That's what I like about this movie each time you watch it different it will offer.My recommendation..

829,JGTurner-364-300307,Defiantly not the masterpiece I had been lead to believe.,6,7 May 2012,"Of course we scratch our heads in bafflement at what exactly Mulholland Drive all means, is it parodying the life of Marilyn Monroe or some other tragic actress? Is this a Mobius strip phantasm reflecting parallel dimensions, a rumination on fantasy and broken dreams? And what of the highly unpredictable ending and how much does it represent the protagonist's upbringing or her taking part in a jitterbug contest (???!!). And yes, all these points are all very well, but ultimately despite my admiration that the film has motivated viewers imaginations I am still left with how it has made an impression on me. It's not like I'm a film goer who equates the necessity to 'enjoy' a film in the sense that it should be a fun ride like in a fairground, but I do have a fairly important stipulation that a piece of art should have power. And Ultimately I wasn't completely won over by Mulholland Drive, I felt emotionally disconnected from its fetishism of Hollywood and quite bored with the purposefully ambiguous dialogue/plot. That it should transcend such barriers of quality control just because it's considered great art seems a ludicrous approach to film criticism, and thus I can only conclude that I didn't get Mulholland drive, not for the purposes of it being a surreal, satirical or even its confusing narrative but simply because I thought while it was at times interesting film it was defiantly not the masterpiece I had been lead to believe.",Mulholland Drive
830,Mulholland-95,A unique neo-noir surrealist film,10,25 February 2017,"Mulholland Drive is the ninth movie of David Lynch on 2001.Originally, this story was going to be TV show, like 'Twin Peaks', but this project was canceled in 1999, in this moment, the story end in Rita with her wig. However Canal+ took the project and David Lynch realized the film, as we know it and for own good luck.This film has attractive, unique and interesting elements: - The mysterious, emotive and subjective soundtrack, moreover excellent three songs: 'Sixteen reasons', 'I've Told Every Little Star' and 'Llorando'. - The critic for Hollywood. - The use of three languages: English, Spanish and French. - The thrilling and tragic lesbian relationship. - The symbolic persons (cowboy, old folks and vagabond), the psychoanalytic elements (colors (blue, red and pink) and traumas) and the metaphorical objects (blue key and blue box). - The neo-noir elements: fatal female, the crime, the detectives and a fatalist environment. - The possibility for interpreter the story from perspectives like metaphysics, dream, reality or both.Like in The Shawshank Redemption, another of my favorite movies, Rita Hayworth plays an important role in the story because the amnesiac girl takes her name and Lynch uses her name, maybe as a symbol of yearning of stardom and fame in the main character.Furthermore, this film catapulted the Naomi Watts's career, so in the next years, she did some important movies (21 grams, King Kong, The impossible); however, the Laura Harring's career didn't climb.The story of this film we can divide in four parts:-The (metaphorical) beginning: The purple hued swing dance number, Diane and the old folks, and the bed.-The idealistic (dream) part: One woman suffers a car accident on Mulholland Dr. and then she stays amnesiac meanwhile Betty arrives to Los Angeles and she goes to the Aunt Ruth's apartment, in this place Betty finds the amnesiac woman (Rita), they decides resolve the mystery of accident and the identity of Rita meanwhile Betty search the stardom. For the other hand, the director Adam Kesher must confront the mafia that controls his film and they impose one actress: Camilla Rodas. Adam is fired, his woman is unfaithful and she, with her lover, takes out to Adam of his house. For the night, Adam go to one ranch for see the cowboy, this gay say his that should do. Next day, Betty does her casting and Adam chooses to Camilla; later, Betty and Rita go to Sierra Bonita for find to Diane but they discover that she is die, so Betty do one wig to Rita. In the night, Betty and Rita do the love and they go to 'Club Silencio', afterward Betty finds the blue box, they go the Ruth's apartment, Betty disappears and Rita opens the box with the blue key.-The depressive (reality) part: Diane Selwyn wakes up and she has many memories with Camilla: from their relationship until their fracture, this include the party, her jealous, her madness, her revenge and her depression. In this part, the watcher must connect the story between Rita and Betty with the story between Camilla and Diane.-The confused (metaphysical) part: Undoubtedly, the hardest part for understand. The vagabond appears behind of Wilkins restaurant; he throws one bag with the blue box, rotten meat and can opener and the old folks leaves the bag. In the Diane's apartment, she sees the blue key, the two detectives touch her door and the old folks persecute and torment to Diane, she takes one fire gun and shoots herself. Finally, blue smoke appears and we can see the face of vagabond, Betty and Rita together in dream place and the lady of blue hair saying: Silencio. This part can have many interpretations so we must enjoy this ending and we must avoid the over analysis of the story.I like the neo-noir movies and the surrealist works, so I love this film because David Lynch gets to combine these two genres.Finally, this film so excellent and it deserves more recognition for the people.",Mulholland Drive
831,Pranavist,A splendid masterpiece by David Lynch,10,15 April 2014,"I personally think 'spoiler alert' has nothing to do with this film. Nobody can make a 'spoiler' for this film, I swear. Hence I deliberately avoid spoiler alert here. Mulholland Drive is one of the phenomenal work of David Lynch. It proclaims the brilliant direction of Lynch and I feel a trifle uneasy to find out a suitable genre for this movie apart from neo-noir. Since this is an ambiguous movie, viewers are given the freedom to decrypt it according to the didactics of their subconscious mind. Apparently the director hesitated to impart the gist of this movie thinking that the audience should criticize it without his assistance and certainly, this is what that distinguishes Lynch from the other directors. His movies are far beyond the standard perspective of Hollywood film-noir thus I feel a trifle uneasy to tag it as neo-noir or film-noir. David Lynch is renowned for his surreal style applying to the general precis of genres like film-noir, neo-noir, thriller, mystery and so on. Rather than exerting the graphical aspects of surrealism, he utilizes the epistemological angle of surrealism by means of the complicated story. The chronological order of the story turns indefinite as it proceeds and especially when the viewer start confounding what reality is. Even with a reasonable chronological story line, the logic of the events is still very illusive. He presents a film that challenges viewers to suspend belief of what they are experiencing through his juxtaposition of cinematography, cliché, surrealism, background music, lighting, nightmares/fantasies and nonlinear story lines. Apparently he avoided dramatic dialogues deliberately out of the film.Naomi Watts achieved an outstanding performance. It's really challenging to impersonate two mutually exclusive personae (Betty/Diane). Laura Harring supported her well taking the role of Rita as well as Camila and she had a great chemistry with Naomi. The other actors did their role very well regardless of the importance of their roles. The intensity of light has been wisely utilized in order to scale their emotive status. Diane's dreams were shown in bright light especially during her arrival at the apartment. Also her emotional breakdown was rendered with darkness. Lynch used different camera positions throughout the movie most of then were hand-held point of view, so that the viewer identify with the suspense of the character in his or her particular space. Discrete style was also adopted to make deviations from the expected hand-held views, so that the multiple perspectives keep contexts from merging, significantly troubling our sense. Also sound-mixing and editing was excellent. Mild background-scores enhanced situations. Apart from the eerie and mysterious atmosphere of a set of problems, the objective of this movie is to bring out the language of an unconscious mind. The objects we see in our dreams have a relation to our real life, some of them would be easy to interpret while some may be metaphorical representing some qualities or emotional aspects. The tagline for Mulholland Drive is ""A love story in the City of Dreams."" As we can see, Diane's struggle to love herself is what gives the film its poignant power, even more so than her doomed struggle to love Camilla. And that is as it should be, because we do not get much help understanding why Camilla is the person whom she is, but Diane's mind is laid open to us. In the end, Diane shoots herself and it shows Betty and Rita beaming at each other after which a woman in the Club Silencio balcony whispers ""Silencio"" as the screen fades to black. These images float in an indeterminate zone between fantasy and reality, which is perhaps the genuinely metaphysical dimension of the cinematic image. This indeterminate zone ended up by 'Silencio' which makes it hypothetical. I felt an indirect fatalism from that scene as if an external authority suppressing her unconscious mind to be silent. I felt it uncomfortable to watch such a pessimistic ending where everything became static and dark. I believe that the ending scene can be interpreted pessimistically as well as optimistically depending on the subconscious of audience. For me, it was pretty much pessimistic. I should not have said that. Erase it. Unleash your mind and enjoy the eternal ride to world of David Lynch. Good luck!",Mulholland Drive
832,council24,Overrated!,1,16 January 2005,"Critics loved this film, but critics don't know David Lynch. This film is just more of the crap he gave us in ""Twin Peaks"". It's just a bunch of weird and random stuff thrown at the screen with quirky and strange characters meant to be intriguing, but, inevitably, is all meaningless junk with no point or purpose to it. It's like ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", where Lynch is the tailor telling the Emperor only an intelligent person can see his creation, when the truth is that he's fooling almost everyone, because there's nothing really there. To all the critics and fans of the film, I can only say, ""The Emperor is in his underwear."".",Mulholland Drive
833,fahlstrom-161-771986,Absolutely terrible. This movie has few - if any redeeming attributes.,1,1 February 2017,"This movie starts out confusing and gets even more so. The plot is literally all over the map and makes one think that perhaps the director (David Lynch) was on a trip with peyote or LSD while he was tossing this mess together. Imagine if you will a garden salad with lettuce, tomato, boiled bass, catsup, bourbon, red peppers and vanilla ice cream tossed in. None of the ingredients in this work together. The two lead actresses are attractive and the viewer wants to enjoy their effort but they may as well have been reading their script in reverse. Nothing fits. There is some meaningless violence and some gratuitous sex that don't contribute to the story at all. In the end, after 150 minutes I got up feeling like a fool for sitting through this drivel. When I read all these positive reviews it makes me wonder if these folks saw a different movie - or if they are trying to rationalize wasting 2 1/2 hours on this and not having a clue about what the story was about. I've been a movie fan for 71 years and this is a real bomb. Possibly the worst movie I ever saw.",Mulholland Drive

One drastic example:
""Hello, my name is Coco"". This is what the landlady says to Naomi Watts when they meet first time, in the beginning of the movie. Then, almost when the movie is finished, they meet again in the party: ""Hello my name is Coco""
WTF!
It is a Rainbow movie, bombastic, full of cliches.

835,diablopale-41194,"Surreal, scary, heartbreaking, thrilling, funny and most of all, Lynchian",10,29 April 2017,"After seeing Mulholland Drive, I found myself going through the reviews on IMDb, hoping (as many of you will) to find not a theory to latch onto but stimulating discussion of the movie. What I instead found, for the most part, were tons of hate-filled reviews which said nothing much other than that all those who liked the movie and did indeed find it intellectually enjoyable and found that it did not underestimate its audience were lying to ""save face"", as one reviewer kindly put it, or ""seem smart"" as another did more brashly.Right now, I can assure you that this is not the case. Mulholland Drive is a powerful piece of cinema, boiled down to (much like Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO) the very simplest form. Both movies were made with a smaller, TV crew (in Mulholland's case that is not surprising) and both are regarded as hallmarks of film today.Mulholland Drive boasts a very good lead performance by Naomi Watts. As with much in this movie, to reveal any details regarding the use her talent is put to would be spoiling it. Unlike most movies, which aim to create a world that one feels is real and inhabited by real people, Mulholland Drive goes the opposite way. The majority of the movie happens within an apartment, and it feels as if Watts' character and those who she stumbles across are the only people in the world.The remainder of the movie (up until the unexpected and quite devastating finale) is punctuated with glimpses of the great beast of Hollywood. We follow director Adam (Justin Theroux) as he stumbles into strange and darkly comic situations. The tone of Adam's scenes -foreign and funny- contrasts very strongly with those of Betty's -heavy and emotional. Despite the strong-sounding adjectives used to describe Betty's scenes, they are strangely lacking in deep emotion in comparison to Adam, who feels very real.The movie shifts wildly in tone, but manages to keep the audience involved and guessing right up to and long past its final note. It makes the audience a character in the film, witnessing the tragedy and illusion that plays out before us like the works of Club Silencio. Having finished this movie, I sat for am hour past the end credits, both trying to shuffle my own interpretations on it into order and attempting to communicate to my body that I was Jo longer watching the illusion. It really is a dream: First a happy one, then an erotic one and finally, a nightmare that leaves us crying in our beds, unable to tell real and Lynch apart. Maybe they aren't.10/10",Mulholland Drive

The last 2 1/2 hours of my life were spent with my eyes glued to the screen. The set up for this film was amazing. This movie was an actual mystery movie that you couldn't solve 30 minutes in, unlike every mystery movie. Only other mystery/thriller movie that I can say matches this movies greatness is Gone girl. Very well made movie 10/10",Mulholland Drive
837,BloodyThorn,Did I mention that I don't get David Lynch movies?,4,15 August 2008,"I JUST finished this movie. Luckily I went into it with low expectations. About the only David Lynch movie I have ever finished without being bewildered, confused, and a little bit angry was his interpretation of Frank Herbert's Dune. But I keep watching them. When I pass by a David Lynch I haven't seen, I feel compelled to watch them. And I think the reason why is, that they draw you in.I was deeply embedded in the storyline throughout most of the movie. At least until it started getting really strange. And when it finished, I found myself bewildered, confused, and more than just a little bit angry. I was never a horror movie fan, because I never understood the allure of feeling scared. Well that and most of them were just not scary. The only audience I can imagine Lynch appealing to is an audience that craves feeling confused. In my desperate attempt to make sense of it all, I looked up what I could on the movie through google, and I came to find that Lynch never feels inclined to explain his movies. He is even entertained by other people's interpretations of his movies. So I think Lynch got out of me exactly what he wanted.I gave it a 4 because it was at least involving. I didn't want to stop the movie early because it really had me drawn in.Did I mention I just don't get David Lynch movies?",Mulholland Drive

That's a crock and anyone that says otherwise is delusional. He is and will always be an artist as in art. His movies are simply moving art for him. Some people get lost trying to explain things in his movies and fail to see then for what they are, simply art. I appreciate his movies because I like the weird incoherent stories he tells. Most of his movies make no sense and that's kind of the point. He is a very strange man and it comes through all of his films. Don't get stuck on the details, just go with it. Hell, the acting in most of not all of his films is mediocre at best. Are Betty and Rita the same person? What does the blue box represent? Who cares. I was entertained throughout.

Yet with so many admirers of the great Lynch, I had to give ""Mulhollad D"" a shot. ""Don't expect to understand it,"" I said to myself. ""Let the right brain ride with the flow. After all, it's David Lynch."" I guess that was the right way to watch it, because I got it on the first take, which I often don't with easier movies. Of course I didn't get it until almost the end. While my right brain was riding the waves, I guess my subconscious was busy examining the hull, so when the ""Betty"" nametag appeared, the Aha was confirmed. An explicit revelation of the plot is found in the IMDB review by idyllbay. My take is slightly different, but only slightly and does require invoking Eastern philosophies of death. (By the way, you don't have to understand this film to enjoy it, as most devoted Lynch fans will tell you.) I will only add that I have found few puzzle movies so sweetly satisfying since Vertigo.

843,the reach,Lynch's Hindu Riddle? A Shockless bore or absurd masterpiece,9,8 November 2001,"Lynch Soup 	Car Crashes, Caffeine and Concussions and here we are again, back in David Lynchs ultra- creative head. His new movie Mulholland Drive defies logic and depending on how you define entertaining, this could be his absurdist masterpiece or  a complete shockless bore.	Lately, Lynch toggles between two extreme movie-making formulas, either Stop Making sense scene after scene (Lost Highway)or dole out a linear narrative at an unhurried paint-drying pace, like The Straight Story.  One things certain: he's testing his audience, albeit splitting them into polar groups of love him , hate him camps. 	This is Lynchs variation of Bergmans' Persona, an actresses search for identity, yet it's truly his. There's the postmodernism, the homoeroticism, the amnesia, the versatility and range of experience and performance and last but not least the TRAUMA that bisects the film in half leaving characters and the audience in a sort of communal concussion. While Bergmans film is much more dour, Lynch throws in his absurd fatalism usually in the form of a frightening-comic Establishment, pulling the red curtain strings in an almost ironic vaudevillian/50s fashion. The movie's driven by two female characters, one an amnesiac (Laura Harring) who was just about to be murdered in a limosine, and two the innocent aspiring actress from Deep River, Ontario who finds her (Naomi Watts).(You have one sentence to leave this review. The rest has spoilers.)What follows next, are various subplots that never seem to connect, and a confounding Hindu riddle that goes too far. If only this could have been the ABC series David Lynch envisioned it to be, yet ABC shelved it 1999, it may have had the restraint, nuance and To be continued nature of an episode. Instead, we're left with a cynical metaphysical letter to Hollywood. Up to that point Lynch is masterful at having that abysmal unknown along the Nite-blue Los Angeles fault line compel us curiously, deftly balancing between absurdity, curiosity and comedy, not to mention the entire cast seems to want to play along. Up to that point Angelo Badlamenti's score understates and punctuates with synthesized stabs, and swashes and giddy lounge numbers. Up to that point it's Lynchs' best movie.",Mulholland Drive

There were moments when I thought we were watching a terrible b movie but I let it go because I thought they were kidding. tongue in cheek I thought. The few scenes that had a chance to become excellent did not follow through with a completed great performance. I would give the movie 1/2 a star for that but they dont allow anything less than 1 star so that's what I give it. And the Lez stuff way short and seemed like an obligatory twist for twist sake.

Many of the scenes were laughable, and I found myself not even caring about the characters 30 minutes into the film. The only reason why I stayed is beacause I was hoping to find out just exactly what was going on; for an end or resolution to come to this movie. It is ludicrous to call these disconnected, disjointed, and incoherent ramblings art. Was it really necessary to show the girl pleasuring herself? This film was vulgar, and did not have any point to it. I just don't understand how so many people can say this is such a wonderful film. And I'm tired of people thinking that they're so intelligent because they ""got it."" Although this movie showed promise, it was entirely too long and was not lucid enough to satisfy me. I left feeling angry and cheated out of my time and money. Unfortunately, Lynch lacked the talent to pull together this movie into something worthwhile. Call it laziness or lack of intelligence on the writer's part, but I think the audience was cheated. Some of the scenes make me laugh just thinking about them because they are so stupid. Silencio!

This is a random pointless movie that tricks you into thinking that maybe there is an explanation for so many BULL. There is nothing clever about this movie, its all about ""Lets twist peoples minds"" and anyone can give an explanation for this long and boring movie. Lynch has reported before that many movie ideas comes from dreams (who's dreams?)fish dreams??......sure, even dreams have symbolism, plots and stories.This is like painting a white canvas with a red stripe, and making people figuring out some meaning for a random art stroke, or even playing random piano chords and associating it with the first thing that comes into your mind....I'm thinking.....something yellow, bananas???PRETENTIOUS IS DUMB WANNA BE SMART, did you know that?......like saying Justin Bieber is a musical genius, when you never listened to classical music or jazz.

No plot. No progression of the characters (unless you find revealed delusion a ""progression""). It amazes me how anyone can call Lynch's garbage ""art"", but if beauty rests in the eye of the beholder, so be it. Lynch's movie and TV work in the 1980's came off as ""avant garde"" and ""alternative"", fine. 20 years later, work like ""Mulholland Drive"" comes off as a 2.5 hour David Lynch masturbation piece.

The first time I watched it I was a teenager and finished it without a clue of what I had just watched, but despite that I somehow reluctantly liked it and kept thinking about what it all meant. Like that feeling you have after you wake up from a bizarre dream, part of you may want to forget it, but another part of you just wants to understand. Eventually I came back to this film, and then again, and now it's become one of the classics.The plot of this movie is like a bizarre dream, half based in reality and half based in fantasy which blur together with a warped version of events presented to us by a highly unreliable narrator.The story itself is not that complicated to be honest, if you take out the dream-symbolism and accept that we're getting presented with a fiction-filled and metaphorical version of the main character's struggle, it's quite a straight forward story of Hollywood aspirations, love, desire followed by jealousy, hatred, and bad decisions filled with regret which inevitably lead to a tragedy. Regret and trauma can make us wish we can alter the past and reality around us and create a dream world where things could have gone differently, but eventually the cold and hard truth of reality comes knocking at the door.

Betty & Rita work well together. As my wife said this morning, if you like David Lynch, you'll love this movie - if you don't like his previous work, don't see this.

I'm going to try to see it as many times as I can while it's here! This is definitely another Lynch film that's not spelled out for you. I don't believe you can fully understand everything that happened in one viewing, or the connections between all characters. Everyone was wonderful in this film, and I applaud David Lynch. I'd like to see more of this material on the eventual DVD. Since it was originally shot as a pilot, I hope that leaves room for more new footage to eventually see the light of day in a DVD or sequel film release.

It is too clever and intricate that for the first time in my life, my brain really got hurt ( even Memento is a much easier film ). After each viewing, I discover the deeper messages, metaphors and meanings of the film. Superficially, Hollywood is spectacular, adorable but behind it, it is a nasty, ugly and contemptible place. Maybe the world is just an illusion that someday we would try to escape the pain by living in our fantasy like what Diane did.David Lynch is truly ingenious, the best director working today ( I must confess that I'm quite obsessed with him ).

I have followed many of the theories regarding this film. My guess is that Lynch started filming without writing an ending. Then he filmed multiple endings and plot twists. Then he threw it all together in editing when he couldn't figure out how to tie it all together. Remember Twin Peaks?  Lynch can set up great premises, but he can't finish them.

859,jefferyq,amazing film...and one solution (SPOILER! BE WARNED!!),10,13 April 2002,"This film is one of Lynch's best...maybe his very best, though only time will tell if I like it better than Lost Highway. Most people know that this was made from a television pilot and that makes it more impressive to me. It is definitely not a film for everyone.SPOILER!SPOILER!SPOILER!There are possibly any amount of solutions to a David Lynch movie, he brings a to his films a painter's power, where everyone can lend themselves to his films and pull from them something that makes complete sense...though maybe not the same sense that another has experienced.I look at Mulholland Drive in two sections, told out of order. The second section tells the reality of the story: A woman (Diane)comes to Hollywood to be a star and is beaten out of a part by a sexually manipulative woman named Camilla. After being discarded by Camilla at a party, where she appears to be in the process of sleeping her way even further to the top, Diane hires a hitman to have her killed. Driven mad with guilt she ends her life with a gunshot.Section one is her dying dream (possibly dreamt just before her own death, or during), where everything is trying to go right, until she is forced to start making connections, leading to full realization, and vanishing into death. It is interesting to see her reaction to various events in this section when we are aware of what occurs in the final parts. Like when Camilla is cast in the movie (the same movie we find out she was beaten for in ""real life"")...that nervous look and panic seems to say ""this is not how it is supposed to go"" - the whole time the director is focused more on Diane than Camilla. These little recognitions of what really happened reminds me of the film Jacob's Ladder, though they work much better here in Lynch's world.As in many Lynch films the ""circle is closed"" - here by the old couple. Who or what they represent is unknown to me but they are in the film at both ends...they appear with her during the jitterbug opening, they usher her into the first section smiling, and usher her out of the second section far less cheerful.This probably (most likely) isn't the only explanation of Mulholland Drive but it is one that works and makes for utterly fascinating viewing!

860,pvdee,A movie of switching identities,9,25 September 2006,"A lot of people give this film a very low rating, only because they find it too confusing. I think this is unjust. Once you take the confusion for granted and watch this movie a second or third time, it actually starts to become very interesting and intriguing. I really like this movie, even though I haven't understood everything yet and some of the scenes are still a mystery to me. Even if you don't UNDERSTAND it, even critics can hardly deny that the mysteries in this film send chills down your spine, every time you watch it again. And I think this is exactly what David Lynch intended: he wants to evoke a reaction from his public. Mission accomplished, at least that's what I think.What is perhaps the most crucial thing about learning to appreciate this movie, is not to be irritated by the frequent identity switches that take place, but to take them for granted. Actually, as far as I'm concerned, they are all projections of one person, which gives the female masturbation scene at the end of the movie a lot of sense. This movie is about narcissism, and the themes of lesbian love and Hollywood stardom get intertwined to a degree where you can't separate one from the other as a viewer. An interesting sidenote here is also that the two main protagonists are BOTH women (instead of the usual male-female couple --- only the movie director played by Justin Theroux is actually male.) Whether the actual ""plot"" of the movie involves a murder attempt or only a suicide (or both?), I still don't know for sure. But does it really matter? I actually like to watch this movie again, in order to try and find out.And for all of those people who are critical about this movie because they find it too incoherent: remember that Lynch does this intentionally. Actually, allusions to illusionism and magic abound in this movie. We can see rooms full of smoke, and of course there is also the scene in the theatre where the guy on stage disappears in a classical puff of smoke (""It's all an illusion"").The first time I saw this movie, I found it inferior to ""Lost Highway"", for the same reason as a lot of people: the incoherence seemed a little overdone (even in comparison to Lost Highway, yes). However, now that I have seen the movie 3 times, it doesn't seem so bad anymore. I actually started to like this movie very much, and I hope that more people will follow.",Mulholland Drive
861,jaywelt,My thoughts on why this film is brilliant.,9,11 April 2002,"Mulholland Dr.There are spoilers in this review.  Please do not read it if you have not seen the movie already.  This movie is a true masterpiece; a wonderful work of art.  Many people who watch movies like this wonder how someone can see art in chaos.  I know I will have to see it many more times to `catch' everything.  I think many people get different things from a David Lynch movie.  I'd love to share a few of the thoughts I had.  The first time I felt that warm, `ah yes  this is a David Lynch movie' is when the two detectives are talking to each other.  If you close your eyes and just listen to their dialogue, you can hear David Lynch's direction. The deliberateness of the words - words like Pearl Earing.  No one can make you picture a pearl earing like David Lynch can.  On the flip side; had he decided to shoot a pearl earing.  No words would have been needed. 
The Rita character bears a striking resemblance to Sherilyn Fenn, doesn't she?Did you notice that the Michael Anderson character sat in a room in which the walls were covered with curtains? I couldn't help but think that Lynch just sees him in that room.  He sees him in curtained rooms and simply has to put that image on film.  One of the greatest feelings I got during this movie was what seemed to be Mr. Lynch's ability to predict what I was thinking while I was trying to dissect what was going on.  I can imagine him laughing about all the thought people try to put into dissecting this movie, but...Near the end when the character roles have changed and I was trying to decide who Betty really was, I found myself leaning toward her  being a figment of Rita's guilt ridden imagination.  I had it all figured out.  Betty was really Diane who offed herself because she could not have Camille's love.  Camille, guilt ridden, lost it and created Betty to replace Diane, right?  `No. no. no,' I thought.  `What about the old couple at the airport?  And for that matter what the hell is the deal with the old couple at the airport?'  Just then they return to the movie.  Haunting me the way they are now haunting Diane. I don't know if Lynch did this on purpose or on accident, subconsciously.  It doesn't matter.  No matter where brilliance like that comes from, it's exactly those types of incidents that make a David Lynch movie a true, masterful work of art. That's the only way I can explain the `why' to the non-believers.  That's exactly the type of incident that ties all the Chaos together, somehow.",Mulholland Drive
862,czulkovsky_po,a new art,10,21 October 2001,"I have always wondered why cinema has been so slow about developing great, moving, groundbreaking artworks. Think about it: think about all the incredible novels, paintings, sculptures that changed the concept of art in the 20th century, and after that go to the movies. What do you see? Films that could be scripted by 18th century bad writers.If I really try to think about guys who have changed and improved film art, few names come to my mind, most of them Russian: Vertov, Eiseinstein, Tarkovsky... uh, and an American guy, Lynch.With Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive, Lynch has changed forever the way we look at actings, characters psychology and script. In spite of the commercial failure and all the stupid critics (where do American critics go to study film theory? at Verhoeven University?), Lynch is the greatest American director who has ever existed.",Mulholland Drive
863,st-george-1,That David Lynch is so funny!,2,27 August 2018,"He has got to be kidding us with this movie. He is not Luis Bunuel. This is a movie that lures us in, pretends the character are human, at first slowly, then quickly, turns into a freak show. I do not recommend this except to serve as punishment. In order to accomplish this aim (whatever it may be called) David would need to have been much more skillful. Oh wait, there are people walking under my front door, I have to go and greet them!",Mulholland Drive
864,mfb138,a masterpiece,10,6 November 2001,"It seems to me that there is a sort of ongoing fight between people that have been genuinely moved by the film, gushing about it, and people who hated the film and think that anyone who liked it is saying they 'get it' to feel intellectually superior to those who didn't like it (this is absolutely ludicrous).To all of the naysayers out there-you don't have to like the film.  You don't, and you are completely entitled to voice your dissent.  The problem I've been noticing from negative reviews, though, is an almost complete ignorance of what goes into filmmaking.  People seem to only be talking about the 'message' of the film, or lack thereof.  Other things that make the film everything that it is-sound design, cinematography, editing, imagery, etc.-seem to not even matter.This is David Lynch.  Criticizing his movies for not having a linear narrative is like criticizing a football player for not hitting a home run. Stanley Kubrick once said that an artist feels his films, he doesn't think them, and I believe this.  I think the people who say things like 'he cannot tell a story', or 'he is weird for the sake of being weird' are just dismissing the film.  They're engaging in the intellectual snobbery that they accuse others of, because if they can't find an easily identifiable 'message' or something that makes them feel like they've been thinking for the past two hours, they dismiss it as trash.  Meanwhile, David Lynch is working on an intuitive level, not an intellectual one, and so people looking for a 'Usual Suspects'-type plot or even something like 'Memento', where things can be pieced together, are looking in the wrong place.  It's apples and oranges.That being said though, I think that intuitive filmmaking is a much more powerful and effective use of the tools the cinema provides.  Lynch can capture, better than any other director I've ever seen, the feeling of dreams and the powerful and almost unspeakable emotions that come with them. It's like when you have an incredibly powerful dream that moved you in ways you never thought you could be moved, and then you try to articulate that feeling to a friend and can't even come close to accurately describing what you felt.  The same is true with Lynch's films, especially, in my opinion, this and Fire Walk With Me.  And you don't need to.  The idea that movies have to give you some sort of message and have a linear structure that actually ends at a specific point is an idea that stuffy pop film critics have given the American public, and it's just not true.  In terms of sheer artistry, and a near-perfect grasp of every single element of the cinema, Mulholland Drive is leagues ahead of a film like American Beauty, but which one has the best picture nomination?Anyway, just pouring out some of my feelings on what I feel is Lynch's best film to date (although he has no bad films, with the exception of Dune). The reason that people who hate this film see no value in it is because they immediately dismiss it as 'weird' instead of just surrendering to it.  You feel it, and the emotional payoff is more of an experience than anything I've seen in theatres in a long time.  Lynch always says that the last reel of a movie should play out in the viewer's head, and that is the case here. He avoids specific meanings of things because this allows the viewer to project their own subconscious thoughts onto the proceedings, making it a personally different experience for every viewer, and I can't think of a better way to describe 'art'.I'm not going to say anything about what happens in the actual movie, because it's all been said, but I will say that Lynch is one of the most creative, fertile, valuable artists we have living today, and everyone should be at least a little appreciative.",Mulholland Drive
865,kegean,A Well told Enigma....,10,17 January 2002,"David lynch has done it again.I envy him for his style,and commend him for his screenplay.Keeping on the same lines as Fight Club or Donnie Darko, Mixed Pulp fiction with Romance in the hills of LA,Mulholland drive wasn't as hard to interpert as some would have you belive.The breaking point was about half way through, and then the strings started to unwind from there.How people view themselves and relationships, could be done from so many angles, but no one has done it quit like this film, at least from my perspective.This film is definitly worth a watch, especially to see the great performence by Naomi Watts which thats synchronized by Laura Harring too.Great Soundtrack too by Angelo Badalamenti.",Mulholland Drive

Oddball scenes are tremendously funny, the cowboy is hilariously outta sink and the twist on Hollywood is remarkably dark and scary.

If you seen Lost Highway and Blue Velvet, then see this, Mulholland Drive is a combination of these two with some lesbian sex added. I really recommend that title. Watch and and you see it's worth it.",Mulholland Drive
869,krakonoff1,Unique mystery,8,26 May 2018,Mulholland Drive is a unique mystery movie directed by David Lynch. The movie is incredibly hypnotic with much of the visual contributing to a dream-like state. This is a positive in the movie's favor as it adds to the themes and setting of the movie. I highly recommend this movie to any audience looking for something different.,Mulholland Drive
870,mafioso,Very Confusing...,5,19 May 2002,"Perhaps I'm not as bright as some you folks who have given this one glowing appraisals, but honestly I just couldn't figure out Mulholland Dr. Obviously I can't enjoy a film I can't follow or understand.  Too many loose ends and a plot which is anything but linear. Whether this movie makes any sense at all is up for debate.  I really can't believe this one is in the top 250!  In my opinion I give ""Born in Missoula Montana, Eagle Scout"" director David Lynch a 5/10 for Mulholland Dr.  But I encourage everyone to judge this bizarre film for themselves.",Mulholland Drive
871,spoonbender-3,Poorly edited ABC movie of the week,1,7 August 2007,"My title is not hyperbole. This movie started out as a made-for-TV production. Only later did Lynch try to beat it into a feature film. It shows.The result we see here is (like many other Lynch ""masterpieces"") just a lousy Hollywood production that fools people into thinking they're smart if they get it. Hence the popularity amongst people who need the ego stroking. Friends, there's nothing exceptionally intellectual about this film other than the fact that if you can sit through the whole thing without puking into your popcorn you must have good mind control over your esophageal passage.Hey, if you know what ""esophageal"" means, then WOW you're really smart! You're really cool! Don't you feel wonderful about yourself and about my review which made you feel so wonderful about yourself? Lol. Lynch is just another hack who caters to the bourgeoisie of the intellectuals. (What? You know what ""bourgeoisie"" means also? WOW You're ssssssmarrtttt!)

A convoluted plot, characters who appear and disappear with no reason and holes that you can shoot a canon through.  If what Lynch was trying to do was confuse, bewilder and leave you without a sense of resolve, he achieved it.  If there is in fact an ending to this picture, then it must be somewhere on the cutting room floor.",Mulholland Drive
873,cherwebb,Potential viewers should be warned of twisted sexual content.,1,14 April 2002,My wife and I watched the first hour and a half of the movie with a gradually building interest in the story line. We were somewhat disappointed when the lead actress broke into an apartment through a window. Until that point she was a sweet young lady that we had begun to like and respect.The real disappointment and end of the film as far as we were concerned was a full-blown lesbian love-making scene with the lead actress the instigator of the encounter. After this relatively long scene we were unable to enjoy the rest of the movie because in our minds the lead actress was a twisted character.,Mulholland Drive

And it was such a relief that I didn't just have to sit through a movie that handed everything to you.  It's so fun to figure things out on my own, I love movies like this.  It didn't really hit me as a really great movie (in my opinion) while watching it because the style wasn't what I usually fall in love with (Like Tim Burton's movies, or From Hell, the dark 18th/19th century stuff).  Immediately after watching it I was completely lost.  And then I realized one key thing, one simple word that I thought about but then forgot, and everything suddenly fell into place.  I was so grateful for the ending *not* being one of those that explain everything in 30 seconds.  It gives you the story and you have to figure out what it means and what happened.  It kind of puts you in the same position as the character in the movie who also has to figure it out.",Mulholland Drive

Its possible for movies to be thought provoking and convey messages of society etc, and still have some coherence. This movie does not, the only reason a person would spend time thinking about it after seeing it is that they are disappointed that they wasted 2 and a half hours of their life and hope to figure out something so the time was not a complete waste. The acting is also terribly wooden, but those who love this movie seem to think it complements this piece of 'art'. If you want to see a good, intelligent movie, go to minority report or rent something like fight club.",Mulholland Drive
876,louiebotha,Mulholland Dr : a Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bumblebee around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening.,10,14 December 2007,"Mulholland Drive starts with an innocent looking aspiring blonde actress (Betty) from Deep River, Ontario, arriving in Hollywood. The previous evening, a dark haired mysterious looking beauty had an accident in the street with the same name as the movie, after a bunch of racing youths crashed into her limousine. Concussed and with amnesia, she decided to hide in the apartment that was just cleared by Betty's aunt. Betty and Rita (the amnesia girl chose the name from a Rita Hayworth poster in Betty's room) seemed to get on superb, even after it is spilled that Rita is not known to her aunt. After a couple of nights with Rita on the couch, they decided to share the double bed. When a naked, flaming hot Rita kissed Betty goodnight (""Goodnight sweet Betty""), the inevitable follows. It appears as if Mulholland Drive consist of two parts, because the movie dramatically changed in outward appearance after Rita opened a blue box with a blue key. It is said that MD is about a failed actress. I agree with that, so, I am thinking only the second part of the movie is real. Betty's name is now Diane. And she is just not ""the Girl"" anymorethings is going dramatically less idyllic for her in the city of dreams in the second part. The first part of the movie can be described as the surrealistic undercurrent of the movie, the knitted together dreams that Diane has, in her not so striking apartment, in her far less attractive reality than Betty. In fact, I am willing to speculate that Part I is the dream that Part II is having. In Part II's dream, the characters and storyline is tossed all over the place, but, with fantastic, deconstructive skill. Diane is also an actress, like Betty. She is engaged in an unsteady relationship with a seemingly successful actress, Rita. But Rita is deliberately toying with her: Rita and Adam Kesher, also the director in Part I, is soon to be engaged. A tormented Diane hires a killer to get rid of Rita. He told her that the key will be where he mentioned, when Rita is killed. After she found the key, Diane shot herself. Another dream goes south. The scene when they got the blue box that the blue key open, is vital to the key points of the movie. In the first part of the movie the night after they fooled around, Betty finds a muttering Rita next to her in bed ""Silencio, Silencio"". Henceforth they head 2 am in the morning to a theatre with the same name, and find a wicked looking magician, which show is centred on the theme that things only appear real. ""We hear a band, but, there is no band"". In other words, it is all an illusion. Betty has a hysterical fit, and they decide to leave, but before doing so, they found the blue box in the chair next to them. When Rita opens the box, the real events, Part II, kick off. (I believe Lynch has said that he does not know what the damn thing is) The nightmare part II is having brings us such jewels as the scene where the Italian mob makes it clear to Adam that they will decide who will be the lead actress. I am particularly fond of this scene, because of the treatment that the supposedly first class espresso got from the mob boss. This is Lynch's coffee drinking scene. I have read that there is a point of view that described Lynch's cinema as pretentious. Mulholland Drive, when I saw it the first time, in Brooklyn, with my friend M impressed me infinitely. Probably, one can say it is pretentious, if you want to say: ""Life is not like that"". The espresso scene, and the Cowboy scene, and the Winkie's scenes are certainly a bit over the top. Certainly a bit ""unreal"". This reminds me of another scene, also, brilliant. This is when Betty did her rehearsal. So in a way, when they started off with the rehearsal, one prepares oneself for a bit of acting, in the context where the movie itself is taken for real. One of the actors/producers/advisors on the set that watch the rehearsal, made this remark beforehand: ""don't play it for real until it gets real. "" It honestly is a remarkable scene, because of the force of the acting, and then when it gets real it manages to mix up the viewer's perspective on what is authentic - similar to the familiar illusions that tricks one's eyes into believing that one square is darker than another square, or one line is longer than another because of the adjacent structure. One seems to be asking oneself, ""What is going on?"" after the scene. I guess in a way this film tricks our mind into unfamiliar alleys. Sure, after one has seen it, one can willingly favour a discussion that ""both squares equally dark"" is. It was all only an illusion. For me: I'm still amazed - being sucked up once by that vortex leading into the blue box.",Mulholland Drive
877,nancy-54,I was highly intrigued by this movie,9,14 October 2002,"I was highly intrigued by this movie.  This is not a movie to watch when you just want to veg out in front of a flick and have a few laughs.  This is a movie you watch with your brain on, and even then you will find yourself rewatching it (almost immediately) to see if you really figured everything out.  This sensation doesn't end even when you watch it months later. It's impossible to give away the plot - because you couldn't truly explain it to anyone - and if you tried they would only look at you like you were nuts - so I recommend you watch and watch carefully - then savor the theatrical uniqueness of this film.",Mulholland Drive

879,pbarrrgh8617,hmmm...the reactions seem familiar,6,26 April 2003,"for some reason or another, people currently seem to be in love with movie, such as mulholland dr., that have nothing more to offer than giving the viewer the chances to figure out what the hell is going on. granted, i think lynch did a very clever job of planting clues to aid you in figuring out the story, but so what?!there must be more to a movie than a bunch of random events and people that in the end turn out to all be related.  if people continue to gush over movie like this (memento being another example) than within several years movies will have turned into nothing more than extended logic puzzles on a very large scale. i want more out of my 2 hours than confusion with the possibility to put the puzzle together.i want to learn something. or at the very least, feel something! these mindbending movies are completely emotionless.  bottom line: this movie (and others like it) may be fun to piece together, but beyond that are completely pointless and leave the viewer feeling absolutely nothing",Mulholland Drive
880,Blockmary,A mind bending masterpiece by Lynch,10,8 February 2003,"Lynch has outdone himself with Muhlholland Drive.  I was concerned  that the movie was going to be another Lost Highway, but it is most certainly not. The movie excels in areas that Lost Highway lacked.  The storyline and direction in this movie are so well done that this makes my top three movies of all time.As is typical of Lynch, the movie begins with confusion.  I find this to be a key element in film, as you are instantly gripped to the storyline. Confusion continues, and even intensifies throughout the movie.  Many of the scenes in the movie are eerie, and only add to the enjoyment.  I don't want to get into specifics, because I believe this is a movie that you should watch with no pre-conceived notions.  It only makes it that much better.Naomi Watts and Justin Theroux, who was the star of American Psycho in my mind, both give outstanding performances.  This is one of those movies that you will talk about for the rest of your life.  I only wish that I could see this movie again for the first time.  Brilliant!",Mulholland Drive

The actors are great(outstanding Naomi Watts), the music is wonderful.As the same time a Hollywood classic(we think about VERTIGO, SUNSET BOULEVARD, or KISS ME DEADLY), a TV series, and a post-modern thriller, MULHOLLAND DRIVE is the first masterpiece of the decade.

883,oldgoldtop,That Story Inside Our Head!!!,10,14 March 2011,"THIS IS THEFILM!!! On the outside, we perceive a ""physical"" mystery puzzle, which is never quite made whole by what is provided. Viewers create their own ""illusions"" based on something which is not really there, in an unending desire to fit the pieces together. But on the inside, there awaits a complete and extraordinary non-physical conceptual allegory of remarkable depth and complexity. Like a prismatic jewel wrapped deep inside decreasingly cloudy layers of understanding. To reach these deeper levels, viewers must decipher the films own ""language"" which Lynch has placed ""right before our eyes""! Every frame is used, from the beginning darkness to the ending darkness and character credits. Insignificant characters names, colors, film techniques, editing, sequencing, dialogue and really everything, is used to provide an ""understanding"". While most who view the film will attempt to solve the physical story by inventing various rationalizations to explain a perceived murder/suicide mystery, as in life, few will ever become conscious of the remarkably fulfilling experience which another path can provide. By concentrating on every aspect of the film's experience, the determined viewer may eventually penetrate beyond the physical Hollywood dream ""illusion"" and enter into a non-physical philosophical realm of reality (perhaps inspired in part by Lynch's interest in transcendental meditation). Once there, it ultimately becomes possible to awaken to the reality of the unintended damage we repeatedly seem doomed to inflict upon our own inner being(s) through ignorance and self centered desire. Perhaps some might become inspired to reflect upon the way they live and make positive changes. But it is possible to continue to explore the deeper levels and I feel the journey may be unending. This film will likely involve many viewings to appreciate the seemingly endless subtle details Lynch has cohesively woven into what is a most ingenious use of the film medium. More importantly, it will require the viewer to maintain an open mind and let go of any preconceptions and familiar associations. Hopefully it will lead to a most unique and intriguing film journey of self discovery. I will continue to explore this amazing world. There are not enough ""little stars""!Edit...I have continued to explore this film and have begun to perceive it also as an artistic representation of ""The Unified Field of Consciousness"". The outer physical layers (various viewer solutions of Diane's Hollywood experience) wrapping increasingly non-physical levels of inner consciousness. A beautiful experience that actually led me to discover and practice meditation!",Mulholland Drive
884,jane_dane,"Script totally cryptic, director way in over his head",1,12 May 2003,"A terrible waste of time.

But only because you want to know what it all means.

Unless you like completely weird movies, which make no sense, have no continuity, you will waste 2 hours of your life watching it and another 2 hours asking yourself ""why did I waste my time watching that complete piece of trash"".David Lynch should stop wasting film and get a job he is more suited for.. perhaps cleaning floors or street sweeping.

885,natedaug-1,Classic Lynch,9,28 June 2003,"*Spoiler's Ahead, I explain the plot*I really enjoyed this movie and thought it was very unique.  I usually like David Lynch movies (I even like Dune) and this was not an exception.  I have my theory on what this movie was about since there are about 6 dozen theories on the meaning of this movie.  The first half of the movie is Naomi Watt's dream of what she wanted reality to be.  She fell in love with Laura Elena Harring's character and the first half was her dream of the way she wanted it to turn out.  The second half was her nightmare of what really happened.  Harring's character falls in love with the director dude and and Watt's gets jealous and hires a hitman to have her killed.  She ends up committing suicide at the end because of her guilt of killing Harring's character and she is now living in a nightmare.  Random character's pop up, like in a dream, and there is classic Lynch dream logic.  Also tagline for film is ""A love story in the city of Dreams"" which is a joke kind of because it is explaining how Watts falls in love and then has two dreams, one good and the other a nightmare about her experience of falling in love.  The reality was though that Watt's fell in love and then Harring fell in love with director man and Watt's hires hitman to kill her.  Very good film, very abstract.

Nothing is what it seems in this film, and you need to watch it several times in order to get the general idea that David Lynch is trying to put forth. Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring give great performances as two women trying to solve a mystery of identity and destiny in the city of angels. Take nothing for granted in this film because once the rug is pull from under you, you will need to connect what you saw earlier in order to figure out what is going on right before you at the moment.

When I first saw Mulholland Drive I was awe struck. It made me think, as all David Lynch movies do.It was so mesmerizing in its visuals and the performances were just outstanding, Naomi Watts made her career out of this movie by her mesmerizing performance as Betty. Laura Elena Harring is absolutely gorgeous as Rita. The Late Ann Miller was great too.To me the highlight was David Lynch. He wrote a great screenplay, which was originally going to be a TV series, and his direction was absolutely superb. David Lynch's composer for the music Angelo Badalamenti creates his perfect music score. The score was haunting and eerie which made the movie a more memorable experience.All in all, Mulholland Drive is a film you will never forget and I highly recommend it. An outstanding movie.10/10",Mulholland Drive
889,MulhollandGirl,My all-time favorite film.,10,22 March 2004,One of my favorite things about this film is the freedom I have to theorize what I want about certain items and events in the film and all the symbolism that I see.  I know that David Lynch likes to keep his own theories on his films pretty secret and that is great.  By doing this every one who views the film sees something completely different and no one will prove their theories wrong.  Beyond that I think that the film is one of the most beautiful that I have ever seen.  I think the acting is superb and the story is my favorite ever written.  This is one of the few dramas that I can watch more than once a year.  I love all of the elements of it and I seem to spot something new or come up with a new theory every time that I view it.,Mulholland Drive

891,lenny666,mind-blowingly awesome,10,7 August 2006,"The first time I saw ""Mullholland Dr"" I was definitely a tad confused. I was looking for meaning that really wasn't there, while I was missing the point entirely without knowing it. The second time, I was maybe two-thirds through when all of a sudden it hit me, like a light bulb just went on inside my head. At that moment, the entire film made complete and total sense. I realized I had just seen the most incredibly astounding depiction of the human mind in its dream state that had ever been filmed.The movie begins just as the main character is beginning to dream. The first two-thirds of this movie is all a dream sequence. When the lead character, Diane, wakes up, the remainder of the film is set in ""reality"", and a grim reality it truly is. Diane's dreams were simply an idealized version of her Hollywood experience, full of wishful notions, mystery, intrigue and love. Her subconscious, however, creeps into her dreams and reminds her of the terrible reality she will soon awaken to live once more. This reality is one of loneliness, failure, frustration, revenge and guilt, far removed from the Hollywood of her dreams. In that perspective, the entire movie not only makes perfect sense, but captures the weirdness and darkness of dreams more perfectly and with more detail than I can possibly describe here.",Mulholland Drive

893,a_southern_knight,Waste of time!,1,24 September 2013,"Unless you are a masochist, save your time and money by skipping this movie. I Consider myself a pretty intelligent person but when the movie ended, I had not the slightest idea of what had happened.I've read several of the reviews and it turns out that you have to watch it more than once to sort out all the cryptic plot details. Personally, I think that is the director's job. I watch a movie to be entertained not to try and make sense out of two and a half hours worth of disjointed vignettes.The biggest mystery of all is how this film got an IMDb rating of 7.9. Quoting John McEnroe, ""You cannot be serious!"".",Mulholland Drive
894,Mark_Beronte,One of my all time favorites,10,18 April 2012,"I know many people found this movie hard to follow, and so gave it a poor review, but what they don't understand is that this was exactly the reason so many others loved it. The film certainly doesn't take the viewer by the hand and lead them through step by step, instead it leaves things up to their own interpretation, making it necessary for their own neurons to participate in the process of creation, not unlike in an abstract painting.We see movies all the time with plot holes the size of mac trucks and silly premises, but this is not what we have here. Instead this is a very simple and common story told in a very unconventional way, with a skillful blurring of the lines between fantasy and reality, thereby letting our own minds make connections that might be unexpected. What more could you want from art or a film? Beyond this the acting is incredible, especially by Naomi Watts, who not only has to act, but also has to act like she is acting, which she does in one very memorable scene, which is just one of many scenes you won't easily forget. Final advice: Watch this movie as you would look at a piece of art. Let your mind go where it wants, without regard to whether it makes sense at the moment, and you might begin to understand the acclaim this film has received. Multiple viewings wouldn't hurt either.Cheers",Mulholland Drive

""Rita has the money because this is the logic of Dianes dream"" what a load of bull. it's such a cope out to use dream logic.

I hated this film, it was disjointed, confusing, lacking any visible plot, and incredibly frustrating to watch. The movie is almost schizophrenic, it goes from scary to erotic in seconds, I am not used to being both scared and turned on, it was rather unsettling. The movie definitely has artistic value, one of those movies that has a hidden meaning at every turn.

The magic of everything about this movie, from the twists of the plot to acting to camera work is simply amazing... I watched it all over that same night and then two more times the next day and still loved it. Only later did I learn about David Lynch and his other work so now I can see where all this came from. I did feel there was something fishy about the acting in the first part of the movie but after the plot took that unexpected twist, everything fell in place... Well, almost everything... Well, no, not really. Lynch leaves much to viewers to make sense of. If you prefer the type of movies where at the end you get all the answers, then stay away from this one. It left me searching for clues and interpretations which I am leaving out to avoid spoilers. The tag line for this movie may have well been ""Nothing is what it seems to be""... or wait, did I steal it from somewhere? It did remind me a lot of ""Memento"", one of my all-time favorites, although I am pretty sure they were conceived independently.One more thing. (I should start with that, really.) Naomi Watts' talent is unbelievable! The way she transforms several (I counted six or seven) times in this movie, transforms literally beyond recognition, is absolutely amazing. The way she looks at Camilla as they walk uphill towards the party... and then her face at the party... and almost immediately at the diner... And her audition earlier in the movie?! Oh. My. God. I know of few actresses who can be this versatile. If you know her only from ""The Ring"" and ""King Kong"", you gotta see her in this one.",Mulholland Drive

Like most Lynch films, trying to convey the plot will only lead to hospitalization but Mulholland Dve has something to do with an amnesia chick, an actress, a weird cowboy who talks only in riddles, a frustrated director and Billy Ray Cyrus. I kid you not. Originally conceived as a pilot to a new series, Lych changed his mind and made a feature out of it. Thank god he did. Mulholland Dve is one of the most powerful films I've ever watched and has a tear jerking, Italian version of 'Crying' by Roy Orberson.

It's already written elsewhere but the positive reviews seem to be Emperor's New Clothes stuff, for me this movie was just plain weak.",Mulholland Drive

As soon as I heard about Mulholland Drive,I knew it would be amazing. Lynch's last film, Lost Highway, totallyblew me away, and with the release of Twin Peaks on DVD Iwanted as much Lynch as I could possibly get. And I certainly gotwhat I wanted. I'm not gonna get into any plot elements here, as they are verycomplicated and it's best to see the movie and then decide foryourself what has just happened. What I will say is that NaomiWatts' performance is AMAZING...She definitely deserved a BestActress nomination from the Academy. I can't believe theyoverlooked her. Lynch's direction is, as usual, brilliant, and I am so glad he gotnominated for Best Director...Hopefully he'll take it home this time.Every shot in the film is beautiful, meaningful, and interesting. Atno point while watching the film did I ever feel that I was doing justthat; ""watching."" It drew me in the way few films this year havedone. Angelo Badalamenti's score is, as with all the Lynch filmshe's done, perfect. It sets the scene perfectly, creates suspenseartfully, and only helps draw you in even further. Every part of this movie is amazing, from the writing and directingto even the smallest acting role. Easily the best film of 2001.",Mulholland Drive

I didn't know what was going on, who was who, it hurt my head.  The director and writer of this movie should never be allowed to make one again.  How can people praise a movie that is extremely confusing, and nothing makes sense?  I was honestly paying attention the whole time and I still didn't know what happened.  It was a waste of my time.",Mulholland Drive
908,Sherwin,"Yes indeed, the best of 2001!!",10,6 December 2002,"I watched Mulholland Drive twice only. The first time around I was able to deduce what part was dream and what part was reality, but otherwise was still left confused about apparently disconnected scenes and obscure symbols that appear throughout the movie. The second time the pieces fell together (also after some research on the web). I wasn't a big David Lynch fan before, but I always enjoyed the quirky characters and especially the mood and atmosphere that he achieves in his movies. But, by far, this movie was the one that struck me as having the best plot of them all! Of all the movies I saw in 2001, Mulholland Drive comes up on top.The beauty of it is that, not only does he create the atmosphere of mystery and tension (remember the ""monster"" behind the alley?) and brings us another array of strange and funny people, but most of it does make sense and can be explained - and the real story justifies the melancholy that flows through the movie.If you figured out that the bulky first part of it is a dream, and she wakes up after the blue key opens the mysterious blue box (and the cowboy says ""wake up, pretty girl"") - then you will probably also have noticed how everybody in the ""dream"" part have their names and roles switched from the ""real"" part, and that the ""dream"" part of the movie operates pretty much in ""dream logic"" (that is, the protagonist gets her way, Hollywood is an idealized place, her lover is at her mercy and the way she wants her to be - a blank sheet of paper). The ""Silencio"" club and the blue box are provided as symbols - for ""what"" there are plenty of theories out there. Another symbol is the (disjointed) cafeteria scene in which one character discusses his dreams and then has to confront it - this looks like the same cafeteria where she ordered her lover killed, so it makes sense to think of the ""monster"" as her guilt in real life surfacing on her dream. Many of these elements where reality tries to pierce into the dream are quite spellbinding (the other one is when she sees her own body).But what holds the whole movie together is a sense of sadness - after all the ""reality"" is that our heroine lives a terrible life of guilt for having ordered her lover killed and is about to commit suicide, and that is the time and context in which she has her dream. And right away, in her dream, her lover is miraculously saved from murder... This is also a nice twist, bending the two storylines together.Naomi Watts does such a beautiful job, reinforcing the dreamlike and unreal qualities of her character in her dream - and then forcing us to confront the reality.I am looking forward to watching this movie again and again... It's a great experience.",Mulholland Drive

Definitely wonderfully filmed (the black limousine passing on the drive at the beiginning, aerial biews of LA, the cow boy meeting, etc.. are masterpiece. Of course, you should not read about it BEFORE you go to view it, but you will want to read and discuss it a lot after you have seen. As in 2001, there is a ""litteral"" interpretation, but the best is to succumb to the part of poetry, mystery, etc... embedded in the movie. Some items (the blue box) are better if kept mysterious (like the music box in Belle de joiur) because it is also a film on phantasms, etc; even if you think at first it starts and is a thriller. I spent 2 hours and a half being driven...  many places by this movie soon to be a classic and a cult eagerly waiting for VHs or DVD .... highly recommended , but not if you want to see something as simple as harry potter . but you will not regret it, and think,of it long after !",Mulholland Drive
911,Uncle A,Disappearing up one's own intellectual orifice,3,24 February 2002,"How much longer are we to persist with this flawed belief that once a director produces great, ground-breaking work, all future work ""can't be all that bad, after all, he made such-and-such"".Mulholland Drive is a case in point, and is in fact unmitigated rubbish. The performances are excellent, particularly from Watts and Theroux, but a good film they do not necessarily make. What Lynch has clearly forgotten is that just making a film unnecessarily wierd only works when it takes the audience by surprise. When the audience is expecting the film to not make sense, then the film has to have some substance to keep the audience interested. Lynch succeeds in the first half of the film, with the murder-mystery set up with lots of twists and red herrings, and then ... plop! The story decends into a quagmire of bizarre halucinations and pointless segues. Methinks Lynch realised how muddled the film was becoming, and threw in the lesbian and mastobatory scenes to the audience awake, and to stop the male viewers from standing up and leaving.Watching the film at the preview, I was surrounded by Lynchophiles who had no more idea of what was going on than I did, but left the theatre commenting on the ""layers and layers"" of Lynch's film-making. Excuse me but these people are the same nitwits who stand in art galleries staring at canvasses that have been painted white commenting on the ""courage of the artist at painting such a brave work"".Films like these are made because (a) Lynch is trading on his previous work; and (b) because people convince themselves that unintelligeable film is art, and therefore, must be good. I queried a number of the Lynchophiles about what they ACTUALLY liked in the film and only response I recieved that wasn't a broad ""layers"" type of answer was that they liked it when the ""chicks got their kit off"".Nuff said.",Mulholland Drive
912,nleakey,"About the rot, trashed out, fallen and brilliant light of hope",10,9 October 2001,"I viewed the film at a special premiere in Dallas on Oct 1, 2001. Afterwards, Laura Harring, one of the female leads, spoke and participated in Q & A. Harring is unbelievable looking in person as well as reassuredly in tune with the craft of David Lynch.Anyhow, the film.  Wow!  This is the culmination of the Lynch themes into a film that surpasses his previous best work,  Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. The themes:  the duality of man, dreams vs reality, comic violence vs. devastating sex (the movie has one of the best lovemaking scenes between two women that I have ever seen), paintings of red, blue and black.  Gorgeous actors, esp Harring and Watts.   .Anyhow, the film.  I was captivated right off the bat by the fabulous movie poster.  The film is as strange as anything he has done.  It has very strong thematic ties to Lost Highway but is a much more coherant film in the end. The film is about LA, about the rot in it, about the trashed out and fallen. Its also about hope and the ""ideal"" Hollywood.  Darkness and Light.  See this film, it is his best work.  And this comes from a long time fan.",Mulholland Drive

914,predator4325,Great movie that leaves you craving for more!,10,25 February 2003,"Well, well, well. This is a really tough movie to review due to the fact that it is a love hate movie. You either love it for it's different plot, a great cast, or the ending that turns your mind upside down. Or you may hate it for its extremely confusing story, characters that only have one scene and never reappear, and an ending that blew your mind and when you could'nt understand it you took that as dislike for the movie. Since theres two sides of the fence I'm here to tell you what side I am on.The Movie- Great movies are ones that provide hours of discussions. You want a movie where you are still thinking of it days after the intail viewing. I first saw this movie on a Monday. After viewing it I was shocked at how the movie jerked around your mind so much. I could'nt take my mind off that movie for a whole week. Then one night I stopped at Hollywood video to pick up a movie and I ended up buying 2. Eight Legged Freaks and The Shipping News. The Shipping news sucked so I took it back and got Mulholland DR. That movie stuck with me so I had to get it. It's lucky I found it to it was the only copy behind a ton of Panic Room DVDs. You cant really tell someone what Mulholland DR. is about. You have to expeirence it for yourself. I'll try to give a brief summery. On the surface this seems like some sort of a mystery. A woman is in a car crash that takes place on the street Mulholland DR. She comes out of it and has lost her memory. She takes the name Rita and meets up with Betty, a women who came down to her aunts place to become an actress. The two work together to find out Ritas ture identity. Along with this main plot there are little subplots that seem to have nothing to do with the story. Things like the man at Winkies, the director, and the cowboy. You keep track of the plot and think you have a good understanding of everything when the plot takes a huge turn and wipes away everything you thought you knew. Mulholland DR. was origanlly going to be a ABC show but it got stopped in production. They had already filmed a 2 hour pilot but it wasn't going to be aired. The project was in the can for awhile untill a company called up David Lynch and gave him some money to film some new footage to wrap up the story so they could realese it in theaters. That may explain why the ending was so abrupt. It's a very good movie that will keep you hooked the whole way through.",Mulholland Drive

916,cat_spasms,Was this film really necessary?,6,31 October 2004,"I watched this movie a while back, and haven't taken the time to comment on it until now.Before I begin my rant, I must say: This movie is a VERY great idea and concept. It had a nice plot and a good amount of potential, but more importantly it did have what I feel was a great concept and way of portraying Hollywood.That was the ONLY reason why I gave this a 6/10...and that was being nice.The movie is so confusing and tries so hard to be something greater and awwing that it ends up a disaster. You could analyze the film for hours, and still not truly ""get"" it. People keep on trying to ""get"" this movie just because they ""get"" the idea. Let me tell you now...just give up.You can look at this movie from a million different angles, perspectives, over-analyze every single detail. It still will only lead you to the main theme about Hollywood, and won't really give you any further insight.When making a movie like this, a point does need to be made, yes. However, at the same time, that point needs to be made clear and concise, not overflowing with randomly inserted scenes that not only remain confusing, but won't contribute to any greater knowledge of the movie's main point. As a result of the telephone sequences, the boss, the homeless man that looks like a monster...all of these scenes present interesting ideas, but it is just redundant and restating it. Not emphasizing, but literally restating it in another way.We don't need 2 hours of reiteration of a main point. We would prefer to have a good movie. I'm not even asking for it to entirely make sense...I'm just asking for it to add something new, something interesting that can be analyzed and gained from.I personally feel that there isn't anything that could be added after the main point that Hollywood is a dream that becomes a nightmare...it could have just been a story of two lesbian actresses, one with amnesia and one who fails in Hollywood, yada yada yada...it could have NOT had the excessive scenes that amount to nothing. Was it all really necessary?Personally, I think not. This movie could have easily been a half hour shorter if it had been edited, but instead it had to be dragged out. It destroys the movie, leaves the viewer confused, and ends up making Lynch's entire point worthless. By the end, we don't CARE what great ideas the movie may present. We just want it to be over so we can go home and go on with our lives as far as possible from the nightmare of Hollywood that presents movies just like this.",Mulholland Drive
917,torturedwriter-44699,"Not that confusing, just stupid.",3,25 July 2021,"For so many years I heard things about this movie being the greatest of all time, and a masterpiece, but I never watched it because looking at it, it just wasn't something that seemed overly interesting. But eventually I gave into curiosity and am here to tell anyone else in the same boat; Don't. Let this one go.This movie to me wasn't that confusing. During the run of the film you obviously have no idea what's going on and it builds up some decent mystery, but as everything starts coming together in the last 10 minutes you can began to piece things together and personally, I was able to explain the timeline and understand what came where by the end of it. So it wasn't that I found this movie confusing, it was that I got it completely, and it was the answers that made it a total waste of time.For the first 2/3 of this movie, it was pretty slow and weird but actually showed some promise, if it could only all come together well in the end. Unfortunately the last third (final 45 minutes) it all falls to pieces minute by minute. And the movie you thought you were watching becomes a far less interesting and intelligent one than it thinks it is.The movie that was setup in the first two thirds was something that had some intrigue, but then it's all thrown out with an explanation that genuinely makes everything not as good. The ending to this movie undoes every single good thing that came before it, which was far better, and makes the movie about something totally different.In summary this movie is pretentious garbage, for pretentious people who want to pretend they're intelligent by liking something they were told they'd look intelligent if they did. Yet I feel like the only people who claim to like it are the ones that didn't get it and are pretending they do, to look smarter than they are. I got it, and that's the problem. It's dumb. It's trash. It's a waste of time.",Mulholland Drive

Will ya do that for me?'Seriously, work on it for a little bit in your head after the movie's over, you won't be frustrated. Everything you need is there and on film. The mystery is not as pointless as some would have you believe.I absolutely loved this . I saw it for the second time tonight... it's even better the second time, when you know what to look for. Several critics have said as much. It appears some are finally starting to get where Lynch is coming from. Roger Ebert gave it a thumbs up... what a shock!The sound and music elements of the film actually made my pulse race in certain scenes, even if I knew exactly what was coming. This second viewing, I was able to keep track of little things like that. Definitely see this on the big screen if you have the opportunity. Rebekah del Rio's performance of ""Llorando"" is nothing short of heart-stopping, well worth the price of admission on its own. Lynch and Badalamenti show us once again they are an auditory dream team.Naomi Watts gives an incredible performance as Betty/Diane... and while not everything was revealed to her when they were shooting (Lynch acknowledges that a certain power in the story is lost when the actors know everything going in), in interviews it appears she has nailed both the movie and her character as to what it all means. Laura Harring is haunting as the luminous ""Rita"", more than a perfect fit for the role.In short, a puzzle box on film, apparently more accessible to the general public than Lost Highway (another puzzle box with a key!), quite a breath of fresh air this year. Good to see Lynch back in familiar territory. If, after reading what others have written about the film, you're still flummoxed, reply privately to me.",Mulholland Drive

920,apscire,A Familiar LYNCHIAN FORMULA.,8,25 June 2006,"Mulholland Dr. Was without a doubt a breath of fresh air on the mainstream movie scene. Any time a David Lynch film receives mass media attention it renews my faith that there are still those willing to think outside the box. Like many (if not all) of Lynch's films Mulholland Dr. needs to be taken with a grain of salt. The movie is not based in reality rather a subconscious pondering of the human condition fit into the context of the Hollywood machine. It deals with loyalty,love, betrayal, sex, survival of the fittest (non survival of the leastfit?), death, fear, joy, hope, and faith. The formula, however, is very reminiscent of The lost Highway. in both movies characters appear to be something they are not, or rather, are not what they appear to be. they both make stern commentary on the inherent duality of man and the ability to commit the unspeakable in us all. I feel as though both are truly love stories told in a very unconventional manner. The only reason why I can appreciate Lost Highway slightly more is solely due to the fact that it was first released. Other wise, Mulholland Dr. Ranks right up there as one of my favorite ""thinking man's"" surrealist Films out there.",Mulholland Drive

Having said that, there are moments that are brilliant. Like Betty's audition scene. Naomi Watts is quite a find. There is 'the' scene at the end that looks more than a little like the one at the end of Polanski's ""The Tenant"".

However, for those of you who have seen Twin Peaks, this is not nearly as strange, and so I must say I'm disappointed.If you're a Lynch-fan, go see the movie, but don't expect one of his best movies!",Mulholland Drive
923,sevreschool,some thoughts on mulholland drive,10,14 July 2006,"Firstly, what is the film about? About several things, probably. What strikes me most forcibly, is the descent into madness. A madness not caused by any particular medical condition, but madness brought on by constant failure in life. This failure is due to the fact that the initial optimism and projects were unrealistic. Secondly, there is love  destructive, obsessive, misdirected love. There is nothing wrong with being gay or lesbian, but Diane, again, got it all wrong. Maybe Camilla was partly to blame, but it was down to Diane to deal with her feelings in a less destructive way.Secondly, why did Lynch film it in this way? Not to confuse the audience, Madness is never straightforward. To show Diane's irrationality, her jealousy and the awful downward spiral she locks into, we need to live her last few months with her. Then by feeling disoriented ourselves, we can, on reflection, appreciate her own feelings of incomprehension. The whole of the film, I believe, takes place at the very moment she pulls the trigger. In that split-second, she sees her whole messy life flashing before her.Thirdly, what is the significance of ""Silencio"" as we see and hear it at the very end of the film? This is an easy one, and I am surprised that absolutely no-one seems to have picked this up! Go away and read Shakespeare's ""HAMLET""! Both Shakespeare and Lynch are dealing with the descent into madness, primarily triggered by love which goes awry, and the duplicity (and the greedy hunger for power) shown by both men and women in certain circumstances. At the end of the play, when Hamlet dies, his last words are ""AND THE REST IS SILENCE"".",Mulholland Drive

I feel that after digging in , I would rate higher grade.",Mulholland Drive
926,oldpumpkinface,Could well be the most impressive film I have ever seen!,10,1 March 2007,"I think that this is my number one most impressive film I have seen so far. This has it all, lesbianism, mystery, horror, comedy, action, emotion, romance, thrills, sex... you name it! Naomi Watts showed me the most powerful and emotional performance I have probably ever seen in a film. It provokes just about every emotion a human is capable of feeling all in one weird, confusing, yet intense and lovable ride.I came to love David Lynch through my love of the Silent Hill games (which are inspired by his works). I found that whilst his story telling can be too complex and abstract for people to handle, his use of imagery and direction is actually stronger than his storytelling abilities. With his previous weird film, ""Lost Highway"" I wasn't overly impressed with the story (or Bill Pullman's acting LOL) but what made me enjoy the film most is just how well he works the camera. His surreal, dreamlike imagery is so unique, intense and beautiful even during the most sinister and horrific of images. His films are works of art. Like abstract paintings that can be looked at so many different ways and give each viewer a unique interpretation.Although I could call most of his works true classics of cinema, personally I feel Mulholland Drive is where Lynch's skills all come together. Though the story could be his weirdest and most confusing yet, it is definitely one of his most incredible. The only bad part is when I had to explain to my friends what the hell was happening in this film after I showed it to them! If you are turned away by this film the first time round and just see it as pretentious, I hope you don't be too soon to dismiss it, as I have found that repeat watchings reveal more and more depth to the film. Topped off with a beautiful and diverse soundtrack, some insanely good acting by Naomi Watts (don't worry, it's supposed to be cheesy to begin with). Mulholland Drive could well be one of the best and most memorable films in history. You won't be able to forget most of the scenes, nor find anything (except perhaps another David Lynch work) to compare it with!",Mulholland Drive
927,septic_tanks,Lynch back to his best,9,3 April 2002,"If you like David Lynch, you'll love this. If you liked memento, you'll love this. David Lynch without resorting to surreal cinematography still makes this a treat to watch. Reminiscent of Blue Velvet/Twin Peaks (TV) he uses little by way of soundtrack and still builds tension and suspense like few others can match.A straightforward 'woman trying to find her identity' film takes a major turn for the odd 3/4 through and leaves you marvelling in his directorial skill and originality.A must.",Mulholland Drive
928,mariadeprospero,It's alright,4,11 January 2021,Love the idea of a good twist movie but this was just boring to me. Wasn't for me. I'm normally good with confusing weird movies but this movie just didn't make sense to me.,Mulholland Drive
929,sonatine-1,A David Lynch Puzzle that's worth taking time to solve,9,3 September 2001,"David Lynch is one of those directors that I'm glad is out there making movies, even though I've never fully grooved on his particular style of storytelling.  I admire him far more than I embrace him.  When all is said and done in the career of David Lynch, he'll be most fondly remembered as the man who made strangely twisted noir like ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Twin Peaks"" (which held its sanity for as long as it could.)    The David Lynch films that most people find so infuriating are what I like to call his ""puzzle box"" movies.  In films like ""Eraserhead"" and ""Lost Highway"", Lynch buries his meaning in dream logic and symbols.  His refusal to explain his work only adds fuel to the fire lit by his detractors.    ""Mullholland Drive"" starts out as twisted film noir, but about ninety minutes in Lynch does an abrupt gear change and delves deep into ""puzzle box"" territory.  This will frustrate many viewers because the first half is immensely absorbing, and I'll admit as the final hour played out I was growing increasingly frustrated by what Lynch was doing with characters I had come to embrace.    But as I walked out of the theatre, my mind ready to explode, I started thinking, and working my way through it.  And as I gnawed at it, like a piece of corn stuck between my teeth, the greatest thing happened.  Something that never happened with ""Eraserhead"", ""Lost Highway"" or the final episodes of ""Twin Peaks"".  As the pieces came together, the theme of ""Mullholland Drive"" became very clear to me, and the film went from frustrating to brilliant.     This movie is a challenge, and it requires a lot of thought afterwards.  (I warn you not to see it alone.  The more minds helping you the better.)  But this time take comfort in the fact that THIS DAVID LYNCH PUZZLE HAS A SOLUTION!  Everything does make sense.  Not only that, but once I figured out the story, I marveled at how much more powerful the story was BECAUSE of the way Lynch decided to tell it.      For example (and I'll call this not just a minor *spoiler* but a clue) one character exists simultaneously at both the happiest and saddest time in her life.  It appears that one actress is playing two characters, because the two personalities are so different.  But it's the same person, and by putting them in front of you side by side, the sadness of the situation (the loss of joy) is far more powerful than linear storytelling would have brought across.    ""Mullholland Drive"" is not going to work for everyone.  If you hated ""Naked Lunch"", ""Memento"" or ""Eyes Wide Shut"" you're probably going to hate this one too.  I however think it's the finest example to date of David Lynch doing what he does best.  It's breathtaking, brilliant and one of the best movies I've seen in the last couple of years.  (Yet if I hadn't figured the story out, I wouldn't be gushing right now.)",Mulholland Drive
930,eastwoodcentral,"Interesting, weird and baffling",6,20 June 2009,"I'm not a film buff so I have a fairly simple entertainment based approach to movies. Mulholland Drive is a hard one to judge. It keeps you interested throughout with a number of interwoven plots and a dash of suspense. I managed to stay up past 2am watching this, so it not a 'boring' movie. My main problem with this film is the last half hour, where Mulholland Drive becomes hard to follow. The whole dream bit was a bit lost on me (maybe I was dreaming) and as the movie ended I was left with a sense of what the 'you know what.' An interesting movie that looks and sounds great throughout, unfortunately weakened by a baffling and unsatisfying conclusion.",Mulholland Drive
931,anon837,Not happy at all with this movie.,5,14 October 2001,"I'll keep this brief - Lynch could have done better with this movie. I left the theater hot, bothered, and confused (but with Lynch, what else is new?) You could at least follow, to some extent, what was happening in his previous films.  The last 30-40 minutes of MD goes off into every other direction instead of where it should be going - to tie together the first hour and a half of the movie.  I guess I will get it on DVD when it comes out because I have to see it again because I know there is some point to that movie.  If  you are not a David Lynch fan, and you want to get to know his style, Mulholland Drive is NOT the place to start.  Try Twin Peaks or Blue Velvet.",Mulholland Drive

The films genius works on a number of levels, not least allowing the viewer to make up their own mind as to what the events, metaphors and dreams they see actually mean.Go and see it/rent it and don't worry if you don't understand what's going on at the first viewing, it will have you intrigued and you'll go back for another look, at which stage you'll begin to put the pieces together and the clues Lynch leaves as the key to working it out.

It was kinda like...studying...to me....I mean some of it was enjoyable...but i had to crease my forehead and think hard toooo much to find it thrilling to watch. I found my self scratching my head till it hurt and repeating ""OK, that's weird"", a large number of times. The plot went totally mad towards the end...at first you feel you're with the flow of the story but then you just lose it. And it led me to believe that no sane person understood it completely the first time round. Lynch is messing with our heads...The reason I gave it a 7/10 though is simple: because it's goddam clever. The first thing I done after I watched it was read the complete narrative and narration of the movie. And finally then things started to make sense and the things I thought totally irrelevant were actually totally significant and actually quite clever.So, if I ever get down to it, I'll give it a go for the second time and I just might enjoy it. I hate to admit it, but it definitely is a unique masterpiece....but let me ask you this: Aren't movies for our enjoyment?!- Cos I don't think Lynch agrees on that.",Mulholland Drive
934,ickabod147,2 1/2 hours of my life I can't get back,1,29 April 2002,"What a lousy movie.  I affectionately refer to movies like this as ""critic movies"".  Why?  Because they're so dense and confusing that critics love them mostly because they don't realize that they're watching something horrible.  So then they label them as genius. The fact that David Lynch's name is attached to the project is reason enough for people not to understand it and label it as genius.  I must give a wake up call to everyone that thinks Lynch is the future of great film-making.  He's not.  I think the only Lynch film that I even remotely enjoyed was Blue Velvet.  Mulholland Dr. is a contrived, poorly conceived project which, over a period of time, might have made a plausible TV series.  But when you take an aborted TV project, tack on some crap that doesn't really tie up any loose ends you end up with a bunch of obfuscation.  Which is just ends up being another form of masturbation for the artist.This must be a great film for the art school crowd and impressario film maker wannabes because it perpetuates to them that any crap that no one else understands or enjoys is noteworty and new. It also perpetuates the elitism that if you don't understand a project then you're stupid and unenlightened.  Well, I'm not stupid.  I like good film-making.  I also like a good story.  I like being tricked and made to think.  I don't like wasting 2 1/2 hours trying to digest information that is irrelevant.  Lynch has failed, yet again.

The first half of the movie was okay, not incredibly entertaining, but I must admit I cared to know what happened to ""Rita"" and wanted to see her resolve the amnesia.  But the last half of the film fell apart.  It was a mish-mash of odd characters and contradictions, and nothing was resolved.  There was no conclusion -- only utter confusion, and I had the biggest headache of my life after the film's credits (note to film critics: DIFFERENT does not mean ENTERTAINING!!!) The whole film made me cringe at the thought that I spent two hours of my life watching it!  Unless you like unsolved mysteries, I mean REALLY unsolved -- not the kind where you can sit around and ponder who did it, but the kind that if you did sit around and ponder, you'd be wasting your time because there is no answer, and NOTHING makes any sense whatsoever.

No additional viewing can ever really give the same satisfaction as that first time; that experience of being fooled, having your concept of reality broken down, and being left to make sense of it all. Subsequent viewings have somehow filled the gaps, putting the pieces together. Everything from the helpful hints in the tag line (A love story in the city of dreams) to notes of objects and characters appearing and reappearing, make MD much more accessible than what appears from a first glance.Seeing a few related films later on has helped too (especially Sunset Blvd and Le mépris), in trying to understand a film that at first sight may seem like a lot of loose ends but in fact totally makes sense. The plot may not be all that complex but the format brings more depth of character than most films, as Lynch brings out some of the most fundamental human traits through his characters. Of course, the movie is open to various interpretations, but the film for me has always been about disillusioned love and dreams, vengeance and remorse.

The rhythm is slower than pet turtles running for the gold medal. And the plot? There really is none. The story is full of pointless characters who add nothing to the story. The plot is open to interpretations, but even what is considered to be the most likely plot is extremely blurred and unclear. One of the movies I hated the most of all times.

I rated this movie 1 because it is not possible to rate 0. The director (writer) spent lot's of efforts trying to create a movie with no possible story connected, no moral, no good feelings, a total waste of time. I spend some time and money in this movie and if I could I would request my money and time back but unfortunately I can't. The reason most of people do like this director is because he do not create standard boring Hollywood blockbusters, but believe me.. this movie is predictable: it's easy to realize that two girls would do some lesbian scenes just for you to feel you're seeing a special movie, and it's easy to understand that the director will make you feel fear in scenes where there is no reason to fear, and as you try to understand the story he will disconnect it in order to complicate everything. The pace of the action is so lazy, so boring, nothing is interesting in this movie unless some good actors.

The film has nothing to say, it seems to be a few different stories that are either linked by very tenuous or confusing links, or not linked at all. I agree films should make you ask questions, but this is ridiculous.After watching the film I noticed that in the DVD case it gave you a list of ten clues to help you understand the film. Well what's the point in that? Surely you wouldn't expect to have to read a summary of a book to help you understand it, it should be self contained.Furthermore, when watching the actor interviews they hardly mentioned the film, all they could talk about was David Lynch, David Lynch, David Lynch, as though the fact he made a film was such an amazing thing. The film offers no insight into life, but a whole heap of insight into the mind of David Lynch and it seems to me that he is very egotistical. When you watch a film be Spielberg or Stone you don't sit through it thinking ""What is the director saying?"", with Mulholland Drive you are constantly thinking ""This is a David Lynch film, and it is typically insane.""It seems he was trying to make a more insightful Magnolia right down to using an LA Road name for the title and having interweaving plots and characters, but Magnolia said everything it needed to and Mulholland Drive said nothing.",Mulholland Drive
946,omarstphn,It was like a visit to a mental asylum,1,18 October 2008,This movie is to David Lynch as Eyes Wide Shut was to Stanley Kubrick. Pure nonsense. It is done in such a way to make its viewers believe that something great and artistic is unfolding before them. But it was boring as hell. I got a pain in my neck watching it. The promise of Naomi Watts nudity was what Lynch relied on to avoid people from storming out of theaters. Lynch is a good director but this movie leaves you with nothing. It was like a visit to a mental asylum. At least Kubrick stated that Eyes wide shut was a piece of S. Here Lynch forces Watts into doing a total nude scene and thinks he's created a masterpiece. I read elsewhere that Lynch made this particular movie almost out of spite because when he wanted to make this movie some years ago he could not come up with an ending and so the producers had the original sets and props burned down.Maybe that is why Lynch tries to show how Hollywood is run by mafia in this flick.

I thought there weren't any movies out there that could leave me stupefied. I was wrong! Let me first state, I love mind-bending thrillers that keep you on the edge of your seat and make you use your brain to figure out parts of the movie. Memento and The Machinist are two of my favorite movies. I managed to figure those movies out, but not Mulholland Dr. I even read the 10 clues David Lynch provides on the inside cover. Immediately after the movie was done, I had to read all kinds of explanations of what each scene meant on the Internet.Although I struggled to grasp how most of the scenes came together in the film, I still found it extremely enjoyable. There is a spooky ambiance throughout the entire movie that I loved. I didn't take my eyes off the TV for the entire 2 hrs and 20 minutes.I strongly recommend Mulholland Dr. I recommend watching it late at night with complete focus.

948,mrtn-rwanda,My interpretation of Mulholland Dr.,9,30 July 2008,"This movie is the scariest movie i have ever seen, it is nothing like violent horror movies, it is scary in a psychological surreal way. David Lynch is a genius, he uses elements like dreamlike floating steadycam sequences, hollow intense sound, and everyone got these deep black eyes. I tried to interpretate my self after seeing it. I then saw the movie as being about the director Adam Kesher who is making a movie about a murder of a women,The cowboy is the movies producer, Diane and Camilla is actresses and one of the parts of the movie is actually the movie that Adam is making. This theory was full of flaws, so I read other interpretations.I am with the one with the first part being Dianes dream and that she in reality hired a hit-man to kill her lost love Camilla. I have interpreted the meaning of the movie myself(not the story but the meaning). I think the story really is about Hollywood behind the facade. We just see a perfect version of Hollywood(just like Dianes dream is a perfection of her own life). In reality it is a corrupt place with thousand of crushed dreams(just like Dianes reality) The deformed bum( if you look closely, she looks like Cher) and the back alley is a symbol for the dark side of Hollywood. The scene at Winkies is a hint that there is a darker side to the story. And in the end before Diane shoots herself the bum is the one that reminds Diane of her parents.The reason Camilla and Diane is lesbiens in the movie is because it is not as accepted as Heterosexuality, therefor also their relationship is a dark side of the story that Diane keeps inside of herself. Mulholland dr. is also a lesson about accepting others and what can happen if yo keep pain secret inside you.Club Silencio is a symbol of Dianes mind. When she is still dreaming in the beginning the man on the stage tell her that the band band she hears is not real(that it is a dream and what she sees is not really happening).When the man creates thunder and Diane is shaking symbolizes that her mind is troubled, because she got reminded by the man that everything is just a fantasy. The song Llorando(crying in Spanish)is about how Diane misses Camilla. In the end when Diane shoots herself we see the blue-haired women saying ""Silencio"", meaning that Diane finally got silence in her mind from her troubled reality.This is the only movie taking place in Hollywood where the environment reminds me of the Hollywood i know. I went there three weeks ago.",Mulholland Drive

I consider myself a huge Lynchian, but I can also sympathise with people who snigger at some of his loony scenes. I guess Eraserhead is a bit strange, Blue Velvet uncomfortable and Twin Peaks makes you never want to go near ceiling-fans again in your life (and I'm not mentioning Lost Highway, 'I thought you weren't going to mention ...').'MD' has a manual. You'll probably figure it out in the end and then (most) pieces slot in their place. Consult David Lynch's website for more clues.

950,atharvbaluja,"A ""DIFFERENT"" thriller...",10,30 January 2010,"I really am befuddled on how and from where to start. There is so much I can write on this film but it may just ruin the best part for you. So I have decided to break this review of Mulholland Dr. into two, with spoilers and without. But I strongly suggest that you watch the film without going through the second part and after watching the film read it.P1: NO SPOILERS IN THIS This is a thriller but not the ""normal"" thriller. Till the first hour or more the director David Lynch will try to fool you into believing that this is an Alfred Hitchcock crime story. A great atmosphere set up with something here and there in every scene but still that suspense lingers around without the plot really getting clear. Do not fall into the trap so well laid, keep awake and pay a lot of attention because the climax is going to blow you away. He doesn't give it away very easy, he makes you think. Many would say they got it straight away, but I doubt it. I first did not get what happened, I had to think, rewind and see some scenes again and then it all came together. So be prepared, that it will not ""blow you away"" straight on, but once you get it you surely will be left thinking for some time and will appreciate and love the film. P.S. This is the film that launched Naomi Watts and she has given a splendid performance.P2: WARNING!!! SPOILERS IN HERE In a sentence or two the plot was about a girl who gets her ex-lover murdered by a hit man because she ditched her. She starts getting frustrated and dreams about her lover and cannot accept what has happened and subsequently commits suicide. The thing different about this film was the dream I have always been fascinated with dreams and somehow try to connect a dream that I remember with my life. Everything that you dream emerges out of your experiences, your emotions. And this is just what the director David Lynch has done with Diane Selwyn. The dream was so well thought out, the blue key, the key that would signify the death of Camilla, came in Rita's purse with the money Diane gave to get her murdered. The car ride was from her experience when she was driven down to Mulholland Drive. Her interest in a girl whom she just didn't know seemed stupid in the beginning and suddenly made sense. The complete director episode was an explanation she gave to satisfy herself, the reason for her failure and Camilla's success. The more you think the more it falls into place. It is very rare to get to watch such a film. There are many films with bizarre climaxes but this was different, the climax wasn't bizarre just to be bizarre, but because it was meant to be like that, it was reality. David Lynch used the dream to express Diane's emotions, feelings hiding deep inside her and it is this concept which gives the film a new dimension. The bad thing about a dream is that we cannot remember it, but here is a dream which you can live and still remember, rewind, store in your memory and fill in the blanksAtharv Baluja http://arthafilms.blogspot.com/",Mulholland Drive
951,craig-windum,Lynch Rocks!,10,22 March 2009,"Mulholland Dr. This is one of David Lynch's best movies! It's so dreamlike and compelling, and the two actresses are gorgeous and do a very good job, especially Naomi Watts, who should have gotten an Oscar nomination. I highly recommend it if you are a Lynch fan, or if you like anything that is surreal. The film is also very frightening, which surprised me because I did not expect it. The atmosphere is great, the tone is spot on, and the screenplay is excellent. I can't say that I completely understand this film (although many of the interpretations that people talk about could be right). I definitely think that Inland Empire left a lot to be desired, but if you like OLD David Lynch, than Mulholland Dr. is likely to be a treat. The guy is absolutely amazing. The film was going to be a TV show, but in the end, they made it a movie, so clearly the guy had to write it WHILE he was directing it. Whew!",Mulholland Drive
952,jaredsalinger,Beautiful Madness,10,22 June 2010,"It is difficult for me to write a review without giving away what I believe to be the crux or the heart of the movie. But I will do my very best to discuss only my thoughts that I think will enhance the viewing experience.I have watched Mulholland Drive many times so far. The first time or two I was fascinated mostly with the wonderful little details of the relationship between the to main characters (Betty and Rita). The erotic bedroom and mesmerizing club scenes were so outstanding that I must have watched them dozens of times.The more I watched the movie, the more I began to see the underlying theme and the true reasons for all the strange scenes.This is a movie that probably needs to be watched many times (except for the cinema-gifted) in order to ""get it."" And yes, I do believe that there is a ""getting it,"" because there is a reasoned meaning behind everything. Once I got it, it became even more beautiful and filled me with awe.That probably reads strangely, without further explanation; however, if I were to make it more clear, I would probably give away some important things that need to be discovered on one's own. Without that self-discovery, the ""ah-hah"" moment is lost.Some people might claim that the movie is a series of confusing and pointless theatrics. I wondered about that myself the first two times I watched it. But after the third time, I reveled in the artistic cinematic expressions that represented the madness and beauty that is our existence.That's all I'm going to say, expect, don't give up on it if you at first do not understand it, or you feel annoyed with the movie. I honestly believe that their are very important messages that the artists of this movie are trying to convey to the audience in a way that cuts to the core of our being.Jared Salinger",Mulholland Drive
953,absurdcommathe,I stopped caring.,3,27 January 2010,"Like most of you, I watched this movie because of the hype. And generally, I don't mind a movie that's confusing. Donnie Darko is a mind-f**ker, but it was good because it was entertaining and fascinating, and it makes you want to see it again when you're finished.Mulholland Dr. is definitely a mind-f**ker, but it's extremely slow, dragged out and confusing in an ""I don't even care anymore"" way. I don't have a problem with long movies, as long as they go somewhere, but Mulholland Dr. is loaded with dead air in conversation and walking sequences that drag on for several minutes, from the same angle, with no dialogue, and no music. It's just plain boring.I would have given it a 1, but I did enjoy Naomi Watts' acting as I always do, and an extra point for her love scene with Laura Harring, which was probably the most entertaining part of the movie.But a confusing ""artistic"" movie should be something I would want to see again if I didn't understand it the first time. I didn't understand Mulholland Dr, but I don't really care what I'm supposed to make of it because it was just so slow and boring. I don't want to sit through it again.",Mulholland Drive
954,Metal_Hammer,"A great movie, but a really weird one!!",7,23 February 2003,"This movie by David Lynch is somewhat really weird.

956,b1881491,The Edge of Reason,9,11 June 2010,"Never have I seen a film that so expertly diverges from reality. It just love those kinds of movies. The problem, though, is that they are so hard to perfect. I've seen many promising psychological thrillers that border the edge of reality that, in the end, flop. With this genre in particular, there are millions of things that could go wrong. One of these is that the viewer may not understand what is happening. When I first watched Mulholland Dr., I had no clue what kind of film it was. I failed to watch closely for the little clues scattered throughout. And so, when the film ended, I had just about the biggest ""what the heck"" moment of my life. I knew immediately that a second, possibly third, maybe even fourth viewing would be required. A few days later, I gave it another shot. On the second attempt, I picked up so many things that I hadn't before. There was the dance scene at the beginning, the coffee cup, the cigarette dish, the strange way the characters acted toward one another, etc. I also picked up the brilliant way that the ""dream"" world parallels with the reality. I have since watched the film a third time, and I have watched several specific scenes ten times. Each time, I pick up something new. If you are just looking for a fun film to pass the time, Mulholland Dr. is not the movie for you. It is an intricate web that takes time and intelligence to sort through. Over most of the movie, the viewer has not the slightest clue what is happening. Then, you reach the Fight Club level twist and you still either have no clue or are left with looming doubts. David Lynch is and outstanding director. His style is meticulous and suspenseful. He is a man who understands the minds of other humans and knows exactly how to play on them.The cast also gives a great overall performance. There are some that could have used improvement, but no one was bad. Some of them were amazing.In 2001, Mulholland Dr. did not receive many awards. This shows the prejudice of the Academy Awards, the Goldem Globes, etc. Psychological thrillers have always been thrown over for dramas. Don't get me wrong. Many of my favorites are dramas, but I also love every other genre. I think each film should get a fair shot. Alfred Hitchcock's best films were not even nominated for many awards. Rebecca did win in 1940, but there have been many Hitchcock films much mire deserving (i.e. Psycho, Rear Window, North by Northwest). The only time a thriller has truly succeeded if with The Silence of the Lambs (1991). But all those films that failed at the time have now achieved that status they deserve. One day, Mulholland Dr. will surely achieve that same status.Mulholland Dr. is a roller-coaster of psychological twists. For those intelligent enough to understand it, it is definitely essential viewing.",Mulholland Drive
957,webhead54,Lynch's wonderland,8,15 May 2003,"If you have not viewed any of David Lynch's past work (e.g Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, Blue Velvet, etc.), you might have a difficult time following Mulholland Drive. People generally tend to either love Lynch's movies or they hate them. If you don't have the stomach for a movie with lots of symbolism, metaphors, allegorical elements, etc., then I would stay away from MD. On the other hand, if you like a movie that forces you to exercise your mind, develop your own theories, opens the door wide for interpretation, and leaves you wondering about what it really means for days, then MD is probably going to be your cup of tea. Just keep in mind that nothing is as it really seems--then again, maybe it is.",Mulholland Drive

But then realising that for no apparent reason, Betty has an alter ego/identity/life just shook the film on it's head. However, the gorgeous Laura Harring was fantastic as Rita. Well done you!",Mulholland Drive
961,parkinglot,"Finally ""got it""",10,16 February 2004,"SPOILER What a great film! It took two viewings and careful attention until I figured it out. The characters were intriguing, Naomi Watts' acting was brilliant, watching Rita/Camilla was captivating, and the overall creepiness of the film was perfect.If you are here then I'll assume you, like I the first time around, didn't get it. Here's my take:The key point in the film that brought it all together for me was when the Cowboy  opened the door to Diane's room and said `time to get up pretty girl.' That point marked the end of the Diane's dream. Diane lived in Apt. 17 all along and everything that transpired before that point was Diane's dream. This is why the characters came and went without any apparent continuity-just like in our night time dreams they serve their purpose for the moment and might or might not be back. The crash, Diane helping Camilla, the murder of the man, fat lady and cleaner, the Director's problems, Coco-the-condo-manager, perky Betty, the first love scene, all that stuff is in her dream. Diane wakes up makes the coffee and winds her way to the final act. The parts that tell about her real life start at the dinner party.In reality we see that Rita/Camilla is the strong one (dinner party, final naked scene) and Diane is the weak one. Of course in her dream it is vice versa. The Director's disintegrating life is dream payback for him going with Rita/Camilla. The laughing elderly couple are (perhaps) demons of conscience.  The blue key on Diane's coffee table meant the hit man did the job. In the dream, Rita opens the box with the other blue key and then disappears, symbolizing her disappearing from Diane's life . A bit later in the dream the demons come from that very box dropped by homeless guy behind Winkies. The magician in the theater says it's all an illusion, the singer in the same place is, I believe, singing Roy Orbison's `Crying' in Spanish (`cause you don't have me, and I don't have you, cry -y -y-ing over you.').

I can't imagine the dosage required to enjoy any part of it. The acting is forced and the lines poorly written by director Lynch. It appears to be a mocking of Quentin Tarantino's phenomenal Pulp Fiction as though an adolescent boy was asked to produce a derivative work. The best part of the movie is Ann Miller doing a great imitation of Ruth Gordon. This movie may generate endless discussions of what it all means, but the answer is 'your money in someone's pocket'. Another highlight is 15 seconds of coffee pouring by Missy Crider whose familiarity no doubt is a result of a couple of appearances on CSI.

966,Joshhanks777,The only film I have seen that truly captures what dreams are really like.,10,2 May 2016,"I remember when I was younger I had a dream that really fascinated me. It had the start of a strange and mysterious story but it was never concluded. When I woke up, I was obsessed with it. There was something about this weird story that took place in my head when I was asleep that meant a lot to me so the fact I woke up before the conclusion and was brought back to the boring and ordinary real world that really bothered me. I wanted a conclusion to this dream story! I wanted to find out what happened and why parts of it made no sense! But is was the fact it had no ending that fascinated me so much. It was the fact that parts were left unexplained that intrigued me so much. There's something about ambiguity, especially in dreams that are wonderful but make no sense, that really interests me. If this dream had an ending, it would not have stuck with me as much. I wouldn't have thought about it after waking up and thus wouldn't be so intrigued. This is why I think 'Mulholland Drive' is one of the greatest films of all time. I had never seen anything that resembled this incredible dream of mine before I saw this Lynch film. Nearly all dreams that are represented in films are always wrong. There is never any mystery or ambiguity to them and the atmosphere is always off. All my life I looked for something that resembled this fascinating dream of mine but couldn't; until I saw Mulholland Drive. The mysterious and fascinating dream world that is represented in the first three quarters of the film was just like this dream of mine. There was a mystery that needed solving, interesting and bizarre characters that didn't seem to make sense, a fascinating, and idyllic world that never felt real and finally; the mysteries were never solved thus capturing the beauty and ambiguity of my favourite dream.Who says a film is supposed to tell a story? Film is art. You don't look at abstract pieces of art and expect it to tell a linear story so why should you will Mulholland Drive. I believe the entertainment you get from Mulholland Drive is purely gained through experiencing it as one big piece of art which is what it is. Mulholland Drive is not a story, it is literally a dream recreated as a film. And as I love dreams, I Ioved this film. This that does not mean that it does't have significant messages and meanings which it does; like other pieces of art. This film seems to look at the corruption and bitter sexism of Hollywood and thus gives the film a meaningful and tragic undertone. In conclusion, this film is a masterpiece. It truly captures what real dreams are like and why they fascinate us so much.",Mulholland Drive
967,salamander_43,What the hell?,1,29 January 2009,"*May contain spoilers*Did I miss something? Why has everyone got such a boner for this movie? I feel like the director has just stolen my wallet, given me the finger and slapped my mum in the face. Only the wallet stands for 2 and a half hours of my life, the finger is a metaphor for the bitter disappointment I feel at being led on to believe I would enjoy this waste of time and as for slapping my mum in the face? Well that's just my mind interpreting the similar shock and dissatisfaction she must feel at sitting through the whole stupid thing with me. That's what watching this movie is like: metaphor after metaphor, symbol after symbol. You don't even find out that four fifths of the movie was clumsily representing something else until you've watched so much of it that it's too late to turn back. You grip your sweaty hands together hoping that this mess is going to make ANY kind of sense before it finishes and....no. It doesn't. OK, so everyone is saying you have to watch it twice, thrice, four times a winner. WHY THE SHIZZ would I watch it again? I've already lost 150 minutes of my time on this earth to it! All you fans are admitting that there is no right or wrong answer, that the film is open to anyone's interpretation. But what is the point in a movie that doesn't mean anything? I realise to some people it does: Diane basically dreams an idealised variation on her relationship and life with Camilla before she caps herself because she's actually mad and full of guilt over having her killed or something. Why go to all that trouble in the first place? This would have been a perfectly good film if there really were mobsters who try to kill an actress in order to get their own star in the leading role, she gets amnesia, becomes a lezzer with some other actress and they go on wacky adventures around Hollywood trying to figure out who she is. Instead Mr Lynch throws all that away with the cop out explanation that ""Ohh, it was all a dream...woooo"" and instead we are left with some crazy bint and her weird fantasy. It reminds me of From Dusk Till Dawn, a great fugitive movie until the really poor vampire costumes come out. In short - terrible movie. You can point out the marvellous cinematography, the awesome use of colours and the interesting way that dialogue is realistic/unrealistic in various places. Whatever. I don't care how well made this film is, and I will admit that; it was well made or I wouldn't have bothered to sit through the first 30 minutes. Lynch might be a great director but he's a pointless story teller. He has nothing to say in this film. What is his idea for this narrative? ""There's this crazy lady... 'Kay, and, she's crazy so she kills her girlfriend. Then she kills herself. And there's titties."" ...Please. Spare me the boredom.

971,jastercinos,Over-rated under developed.,1,9 February 2016,"I doubt I can express my dislike for the movie in only 1,000 words. It is a meaningless jumble of wasted time. It is a meandering Alzheimer patient telling a story with no start, end or meaning, and just like one, I wanted to escape from it.A piece of art without an author attempting to deliver a message stops being art and is just a thing. It's not that I don't ""get"" the message, because no one ""gets"" the message, there's not one to get. It's a meaningless journey with characters that have no appeal, are told to not act, have no emotion or personal connection, acting like pod people. The shots always look terrible, in that the camera is put some where dumb, in order to trick the viewer into thinking the movie is trying to tell you something, when instead, it's just put some where dumb, with symbolism that leads no where and is meaningless or obscure to pointlessness. Mulholland Drive is the cinematic equal to an inkblot test. An meaningless collection of shots that have no connection except what the viewer chooses to impose. But one does not need to sit for 2 hours of terrible acting and a non-story and utter molasses of a pacing to have a thought they want to have. They can just have that thought, so the movie adds no cultural depth, unlike a movie with a message.Many will say you need to figure out what's a dream, and what's real. But any scenes combined in any order is equally dull, uninteresting, and stupid all at once. It could all be real or all be a dream and it'd be an equally bad movie experience devoid of message or thought beyond what the user interposes to it, save for a 15 minute bit near the end which at least tracks, and has a story of some kind with characters that do anything, rather than wander around pointlessly, then just stop being in the movie without resolution or point to their story.",Mulholland Drive

Solving puzzles in cryptic films might be somebody's idea of a fun way to spend 2 hours, but it's not mine.

Film is dead today unless film makers change the narrative like Atom Egoyan and Tarrantino or create dream vs reality like David Lynch. Mulholland Drive is not a movie to figure out. It is an experience you can have many times with more appreciation each time. With MD the medium is the message. Lynch is an expert at his craft and he found an excellent cast especially Naomi Watts. Every human being has the same experiences but we all have different interpretations which influence our future experiences so we are all unique in that sense.

I think he is doing this weird stuff just to show (for himself) how stupid every critic that says ""Oh its wonderful and so clever""This film is like all his others...totally f*ck*dThere is no story at all and its impossible to understand anything...I bet that David Lynch doesn´t have a clue whatsoever about it himself just like in Lost Highway when he said...well I don´t know whats it about I just wanted to make a strange film......",Mulholland Drive
984,Grady-9,"If all films were like this, Hollywood would shut down",1,19 March 2002,"Put an infinite number of monkeys and an infinite number of typewriters in a room and you'll eventually get Shakespeare.  Put one monkey behind a camera, and you'll soon come up with a movie a lot like this.(WARNING:  I'M JUST ABOUT TO REVEAL A 'PLOT ELEMENT'; IF YOU ARE DEAD-SET ON SEEING THIS MOVIE, STOP READING NOW.)With no concern for logic, and the most simple, awful, overused device in all of filmdom (yes, it's the old ""it was only a dream"" chestnut), this has to rank among the worst films of all time.  It's no wonder that this piece of mish-mash was a failed television pilot -- no one with any sense of narrative or character could possibly do anything but dump this in the garbage.  Not only to save their jobs, but to save the rest of us from having to view such junk.This film is good for two things:  (1) Two fragments -- the airport scene and the audition scene -- were excellent, and would have made wonderful student films at even the better film schools, and (2) reminding us that the ""Emperor Has No Clothes"" phenomenon happens in moviemaking, too.For what else could be made of the diva singing in the theater?  The boring, pointless monologues?  The hopelessly fractured narrative?  The nauseatingly self-indulgent visual references?  To pretentious small minds and Lynch culties, it was brilliant and visionary.  To anyone watching with even a smattering of higher reasoning, it was as artistic as a gibbon playing with its own waste.Another good side of this movie is that HOWARD THE DUCK has been moved out of my personal ""ALL-TIME WORST MOVIE"" spot.",Mulholland Drive
985,Brownie-6,Best Lynch Film Yet,10,7 October 2001,"David Lynch has outdone himself.  This complex and convoluted story is beautifully filmed and stunningly inhabited by Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring.  While Lynch's films are not for everyone, this film will place its viewers into a trancelike world.  As always, Angelo Badalementi adds an astounding soundtrack that compliments the mood of Lynch's film. Definitely a new masterpiece for Lynch.",Mulholland Drive
986,Harold711,Awful movie.,1,30 August 2003,"The first 30 minutes of this movie moved along quite well.  The next 2 hours just kept getting worse and worse.  All of the characters kept changing to other characters throughout the movie.The gangsters just seemed to stand around looking scary - they mostly didn't talk and seemed to have no purpose.  The highlight for me was when one of the gangsters punched out the Director's wife and her boyfriend (about 15 seconds of the movie).  We never knew why, and never saw that gangster again.  If the main gangster talked, I couldn't make out what he was saying.The movie had a promising beginning, but no middle and NO END!  Nobody really seemed to know each other.  This was probably because they were never the same person for more than a few minutes.  (Well, to be fair, the Director stayed the Director throughout, but even his persona changed.)Can't think of a movie that I have liked less.",Mulholland Drive
987,kbrower,Lynch and Badalamenti - a great collaboration,8,21 October 2001,"Although I greatly enjoyed Mulholland Drive it left me wishing for something more linear such as Wild at Heart.  I was reminded of Twin Peaks in that Mulholland Drive offered a series of episodes that were only loosely strung together.  Discontinuities and apparent contradictions abounded, but each episode was gripping, completely engaging, and artistically surreal in the manner we expect from David Lynch.  It makes little difference that most of the actors were previously unknown to me except for Ann Miller whom I have idolized for years and Angelo Badalamenti who has always made a significant contribution to David Lynch's films in his more important role as composer. About half of the effect of each scene is due to the music.  The ""plot"" is hardly worth discussing since it is almost irrelevant to a film by David Lynch.  Lynch's predilection for cadavers and body parts is evident again, and if he enjoys it, I have no objection.   Other elements shared with Twin Peaks are a weazened old man (or dwarf) alone in a room and a nightmare that comes true.  It would have been nice to have more of the comic and grotesque elements that made Twin Peaks so enjoyable.",Mulholland Drive
988,Andron,I think you should see this movie with an open mind,8,9 January 2004,"I have seen several of David Lynch films. It has taken some time to get used to them, or shall we say ""understand"" them. Its not that hard, Lynch movies are just a bit more free flowing than the usual norm. Accept that and you will find it interesting. Otherwise you will most certainly be left in a dark and confusing place. On the other hand I found this movie to be easier to get than Lost Highway.MD is one of Lynch more accesible films. I wont ""explain"" it as you should discover it for yourself. What I like about this film is that you are left questioning until the end (and probably later too). Some may call it slow, and it is. But it adds to the films atmosphere, which is great. I always note the use of sound in Lynch movies, and here too it adds much to the film.This movie plays more to your feelings and if you pick up the ""plot"" that is a bonus.",Mulholland Drive
989,dankneece,Brilliant! A Masterpiece!,10,5 June 2001,"Mullholland Drive proves once again that David Lynch is the Master of cinematic expression. At the screening last night I witnessed a brilliant addition to the history of cinema. The performances are astounding, the score entrancing, and the photography mesmerizing. David's ability to weave the many elements of film making into a unique and stunning cinematic experience is unequalled. As I watched Mullholland Drive I couldn't help but realize that with David Lynch in this world we are truly blessed. The cinema is blessed as well for, in the films of David Lynch, we are shown that one man's vision can be realized with stunning results. We realize that blockbusters are not the only path. We realize that a true cinematic artist has a chance in this world and in that we are blessed indeed.",Mulholland Drive

No matter what the review says, the question you should be asking yourself is ""Why do I even care?""Perhaps David Lynch is an artist. Some people praise human feces spread on a canvas as brilliant art. The best thing about that kind of art is that you can spend 2 seconds, 2 minutes, or 2 hours looking at it, deciding for yourself. Unfortunately, David Lynch gives you no such choice. Film is the wrong canvas for this type feces, since I just spent 2 hours (or whatever) of my life watching something that could've been delivered in a *maximum* of 20 minutes.Brilliant!",Mulholland Drive

It's gibberish.The plot is vague, nothing is clear at the end of the movie.  Seems like the only way to enjoy this thing would to be on some heavy medication or something.Can't believe this movie got an 8.x rating.  It's horrid to the core.",Mulholland Drive
992,rjgmg-2,how does this man get backing?,1,27 September 2001,"This movie is an insult. Here is a director with half an idea for a movie, good actors, and probably plenty of financing. What does he do? He takes you for a pathetic, sophomoric ride (complete with not one, but two inevitable, gratuitous lesbian interludes) into arbitrary ""weirdness"" without making even a visual or psychological point, much less conveying any coherent plot. The message he does convey is this: ""I'm so clever that I am going to subject you to an 'experience' which, if you are enlightened enough, you will understand, but since you are all so dumb, none of you will understand it."" The result is the ironic fact that if there really is a point to this mess, the director obviously doesn't want to convey it, because he has obfuscated to the point of nonsense OR (surprise!) he really doesn't have a point at all, but would rather foist his vapid personal ""vision"" on the public in hopes that he will be able to continue making movies because he is so deep and misunderstood. I suppose his fans are the type that like to pretend there is something here to ""get"" and you don't get it, because it makes them feel intellectually superior. Don't buy in.",Mulholland Drive
993,peaksfan,A Wonderful Must-See Film!,10,24 October 2001,"Finally, the long-awaited Mulholland Drive has arrived on the big screen, and it's every bit worth the wait! Although I will admit right up front that if you're not a fan of David Lynch's films, you probably won't enjoy this film as much as some. Still, it is intriguing and draws the audience completely into the world of Mulholland Drive.The film begins with an accident...a bad accident on Mulholland Drive, under the cover of night. A lovely, dark-haired woman is the lone survivor of the crash and she wanders off in a daze, heading for the only thing she can see, the lights of the city below. It is in that city that she meets Betty, who helps the mysterious woman (known only as ""Rita"", the name she took from a Rita Hayworth poster) in her quest to learn her identity. Intertwined in this story is also the saga of a hot-at-the-moment film director named Adam Kesher, who is being strong-armed into hiring a specific actress for his newest film. Adam's story involves the mafia, a pool cleaning man who sleeps with Adam's wife, and a mysterious stranger called ""Cowboy"" who brings him an important message.All in all, a wonderful film. I'm not even sure that anything I could say right now would do it justice. I recommend doing whatever you can to see the film. And the soundtrack in itself is a beautiful, heart-wrenching masterpiece that needs to be enjoyed again and again. My hat is off to David Lynch...he has outdone himself this time!",Mulholland Drive

Watch this Movie over and over again and you will see what lynch means with this Movie. BY FAR THE BEST LYNCH TO DATE and I highly rated and recommend all the other Movies from this great Director.When you understand the Plot and the profound, this Movie will blows you away and you will never forget this Masterpiece in your Life.10+++/10Only Lynch knows how to show, the deepest fear in us !!!",Mulholland Drive

What it IS about is poor acting, directing, editing (the continuity sucks)and writing.  The whole idea of the ""movies""is ENTERTAINMENT - not playing with people's heads, or having an excuse to show perverted sex. This movie was the worst I have ever seen - BOO,HISS",Mulholland Drive

Lynch is so superbly manipulative that I love the guy.  Take one detail, turn it around and people get all confused.  I didn't even like this movie until I woke up two days after seeing it and went ""Oh, my god, I get it"".  And it's such a true story and when you do get it, you wonder how you didn't see it before - like, I think of myself as stupid that I didn't realize the whole thing when Naomi Watts' character Betty said near the beginning, ""I'm gonna fix a sandwich"".  Who says that?  And in such a cheery way?  Come on.  And how many people agree with me - top three scenes:(1)  The Audition (2)  Club Silencio (3)  The Dinner Table Scene At the EndNice casting (refreshing to finally see Naomi Watts again after what I think was her great role as Jet Girl in Tank Girl).  Nice visuals, especially the exterior stuff - Primo lighting and saturation in the colors!Great plot.Great Dialogue.I don't even care that it was supposed to be a pilot.

Quite deliberate in pace, story-wise and even dialogue-wise.  The two main actresses are quite good but the scenes were all over the place. I'm not an avid fan of David Lynch; this is the first thing I've ever seen of his, so take my 6 with a grain of salt.  It's just not to be classified as ""good"" or ""bad"" just too abstract for my conservative movie taste.",Mulholland Drive
998,uptown761,Movie of the Year? I think Not.,1,25 April 2002,"For the life of me, I can't see how this film EVER was suggested as a candidate for ""Movie of the Year"".  Watching it felt like watching 18 stories that were loosely connected, but not so much that some of them could be dropped without losing anything.  The director seemed to selectively choose which stories to bring closure to, and which to leave dangling.  By the end, I felt like the 2+ hours I'd spent watching the movie had been wasted.  Furthermore, there was little or no music to add to the film ... a major oversight in my opinion.If you're into pointless story-lines, non-existent audio, and unresolved plots ... maybe you'll like this film ... but I found it to be a complete waste of time and emphatically recommend you look elsewhere for something worth watching.",Mulholland Drive

I didn't get the message in this movie... sorry... but it's a surrealistic piece of work... you can say that again :-) It's somehow like a painting of Salvatore Dali... but as a movie... Again: If you ask me, if I liked the movie, I have to answer yes and no... It was fascinating to figure things out... but finally I couldn't figure really out what happened... or what the whole thing was about... Sorry... not the type of movie I enjoy watching! There are some parts in this movie, that are amazing - some parts really make you think - some parts make you shake your head - some parts make you finally think, you're crazy yourself - and you may consider to shut it off, but you can't! That's amazing! You simply HAVE to look at it...",Mulholland Drive
1000,Sovereign,This is not a pointless movie.This is a masterpiece,10,14 January 2002,"I strongly recommend this movie to everyone that has an open mind.If you are a conservative type of cinema-goer or just like to go there for the fun of it and to have some nice hot pop-corn,then you may like this movie for its suspense or humor,but not for its logic and sense. Despite of the many humorous moments of Mulholland Dr. I find it to be one of the most depressing films I've seen in some time.Truth is you have to catch the meaning to feel that way.Second truth is I only started figuring it out in the second viewing.As far as atmosphere, music,directing and acting,I thing this is one of the strongest moments of cinema in the last decade.I want to insist on Naomi Watts performance:Actually,she plays two different characters in such an inspired way that you find yourself wondering whether there are two different actresses and not just one in two roles.SPOILERS ahead!(If you saw the movie and still think its pointless,go ahead!If you havent,try to figure it out yourself first!)I dont know if someone has thought that before,but could it be that it's Mulholland Dream?!?!Perhaps the title(Mulholland Dr.) is explicative enough if its like that.Perhaps its some kind of Lynch's little game with us...I find other users' ""dream-theory"" very very attractive,I must admit that.I just came from a second viewing and everything fits alright!I really cannot understand why great film-critics find there is no explanation or meaning in this scenario.I strongly believe there IS a meaning and that's a very clever one!So clever,it has deceived nearly everyone.There are four levels in the movie,actually.One is the girl's dream,the other is the present situation(after she wakes up),the third one is the memories she has of the past(referring to before the dream she saw:going to that party or at the studio rehearsals) and the fourth is fantasies she has about the present(she ""sees"" Camilla in the kitchen,the old couple hunting her and so on).The way Lynch links those four levels together,thats the reason this is a true masterpiece.Hints are given throughout the film,but truth is you are so absorbed by suspense,that you hardly notice them...The cowboy telling Diane to ""wake up now"" is one of them.The first scene,with the camera approaching the pillow is another one.Its the time Diane is going to bed.This is the begining of her dream,a dream full of great expectations,surreal situations and with heroes that exist in her real life but with different names and roles(apart from Adam,the director-I think he is the only person who's the same).Thats,what the film's about.Its about great expectations,its about rising and falling,its about dreams,nightmares,subconscious truths,awful realities.Diane's suicide is the tragic ending to all this.Well,I recommend anyone that thinks he/she found no meaning in this movie that he/she go and see it again,having in mind this dream-theory.I really dont thing this is a spoiler.Not for this movie.Perhaps you can appreciate it even better if you have that clue.Even if I'm wrong,even if Lynch didnt have this in mind,I still think it makes great sense.Either way,this is a beautiful movie.
10/10(Excellent)",Mulholland Drive
1001,fiuwriter,From the mind of David Lynch...Comes the Best Film of 2001.,10,24 November 2001,"David Lynch never seizes to amaze me. Mulholland Drive, a film so utterly captivating, unique, fresh and masterfully directed, sets a precedent that will be difficult to conquer. This experiment of a film, with its wonderfully interwoven parts, dialogue, sequences and commentary is awesome. I will be bold enough to say that this movie can only be compared to a series of epiphanies, sequentially followed by plot devices and a brilliant follow through that ties it all together in the end. See this movie. Experience it. Digest it. Lynch never fails to deliver.",Mulholland Drive

1003,ngusev,Must be seen twice,9,5 June 2003,"There is a bunch of movies that we say must be seen twice. In most cases this is mainly a recommendation: you understand the movie anyway after the first viewing, and watching it for the second time helps you catch the plot twists you just did not notice. However, for Mulholland Dr. this is different. The sequence that worked for me was: see it first time - spend a day in Internet trying to figure out what this was all about - and then see it second time. Otherwise most likely you will not be able to enjoy this film to the full extent. Then you start to understand that this piece is ingenious, camera work is stunning, and the aftertaste follows you for weeks.9/10",Mulholland Drive
1004,jesper_tved,The movie without a story - absolutely awful,1,13 August 2002,"After I had seen ""Mulholland drive"" I felt that it had been a complete waste of time.The movie has a fine beginning. You are presented to a story which seems to be interesting enough, but when you have spend half your time wondering when the plot really will begin, the movie takes a bad turn. Suddenly the story has no meaning at all, it contradicts itself and introduces the same actors as different people in the movie. After the movie changed I just couldn't wait to se the credits roll over the screen, but I was trapped watching the movie become even more strange for yet a considerable amount of time.When the credits finally came the thougts that gathered in the head was ""what have I just seen"", ""Why me, why me"", ""Why was this ever produced"" and if I had been a US-citizen the next thought would have been, if I could sue them for wasting my time.The only good thing I can mention about the movie is that it contains a very hot sex-scene with the beautiful actresses, but I can absolutely not understand how this movie got such a good rating. I rated it 1, and can only recomend it as cruel and inhuman torture.",Mulholland Drive

What is clear from this movie is that your on a great and exiting journey that understanding is not the the key.,Mulholland Drive
1008,mayway-2,An absorbing movie if you are willing to figure it out,10,16 August 2007,"My wife and I watched this movie on DVD. We found the atmosphere and acting to be absorbing. The plot was complex and mysterious, difficult to figure out. In reading comments about this movie, it seems that those who made some progress in figuring it out enjoyed it. Those who could not or were not willing to give it the effort it requires didn't like it so much.We located a list of clues attributed to David Lynch on the web. They involved paying attention to who did what and where at a specific time. For instance, who are the older couple that arrive at the airport as the movie begins? Something is happening during the opening credits: what is it? We watched the movie a second time paying attention to the hints.Then we watched the movie a third time with the knowledge we had gained from the hints. It unlocked whole realms of additional meaning hidden in the movie. What a satisfying experience.We like it when a move asks an investment from us, and then rewards us for making it. We have nothing against movies about muscle-bound men shooting at each other or stupid people acting stupid, but we like this, too.If you're not willing to give this movie a little effort, then you have no one to blame but yourself for being in the dark.",Mulholland Drive
1009,homerjfry,A Masterpiece of Mystery,9,6 May 2002,"It's been a long time since I have seen a movie that made me think this much. Perhaps I have never seen a movie that made me feel this way, but at long last I have, and I am glad I did.  There hasn't been a director since Hitchcock that has made such thought provoking, mysterious pieces, that pull every string in your mind, and doesn't let go. The only difference is that Hitchcock told you the secret, whereas is seems that Lynch  keeps it to himself. He leaves it up to the watcher to figure out what happened, like a detective solving a case. It reminds me of Robert Forester's character in this same movie. He is on screen for about 2 minutes, and it is like we are playing his role, trying to unravel this mystery. All the clues are there, we just have to look hard enough. I know what the ending meant and all that stuff (it required assistance as I only figured out half of it on my own), but it didn't matter if I ever found out because the movie was still enjoyable, and attempting to figure out what happened is most of the fun. Lynch takes us on this wild ride, and t just gets wilder at the end. Who is real? Who isn't? Are people what they appear to be? The answer is no. The details of this movie hung with me the whole day after I saw it, and i spent the entire time trying to piece together what happened myself, and it was a blast. I only hope more writers/directors are talented enough to deliver a genuinely chilling, mystery such as this wonderful film. Watching this movie was creepier than watching any of those crappy ""horror"" movies out there. And it was nice to see Lynch get a nod from the Academy for this brilliant work, even though he didn't win. A wonderful movie, with a wonderful cast and an amazing ride.",Mulholland Drive
1010,IdontH8movies,"If your mind craves logic, or you just don't like movies, this isn't the film for you.",9,20 April 2002,"In response to previous comments, particularly those that claim ""Mulholland Drive"" to be pretentious and indulgent on David Lynch's behalf, allow me to offer one simple reminder: If we, as viewers, do not suspend all belief the very second those lights dim and the reel starts rolling, we may as well throw away one hundred years of cinema and all its acheivements.  Film, by definition, is one big fat indulgence.  All art is.  There is no real ""need"" for a film like this, or any for that matter, to be made.  The reason we create art is to express the inexpressible, to speak of what is taboo, and yes, simply to entertain.  When people complain about a film being too hard to grasp or lacking in a cohesive structure, I feel the urge to remind them, ""Hey, it's only a movie.""  Why not concentrate on the blissful, ethereal visual style Lynch serves up?  Or perhaps take pleasure in Angelo Badalamenti's brooding score.  Maybe, if nothing else, one can merely enjoy the stunning beauty of this film's two lead actresses.  Optimism is the key when watching any film, and I found that there was PLENTY to keep my heart racing in the fabulous, mysterious, and altogether brilliant, ""Mulholland Drive.""

At no point did I ever feel emotionally for any of the characters except perhaps the Justin Theroux character.  But I can't say that I cared about the women at all.Lynch obviously was hoping to affect me somehow, but I left the theatre unaffected.  The only interesting thing in the film is the scene with ""No hay banda"" and that great version of ""Crying.""  The rest isn't so much boring as tiresome.  I became irritated.  It's so convoluted and nonsensical.  And YES, it makes sense if one thinks about it for a while, but I it doesn't make me care about the characters or the situations.",Mulholland Drive
1012,andyandyandypandy,"Beautiful, spontaneous and satisfying through effort on viewers part",9,18 January 2007,"I came to this with no previous experience of David Lynch films and I have to say 'Mulholland Drive' is a wholly fascinating film, although incredibly difficult to decipher. Many fans have come up with multiple theories about what the film is about, but nobody knows what exactly. David Lynch gives a set of 10 clues along with the DVD to keep audiences going back to the film to think about it, but the clues would appear to be trivial, or are they? Although the film is completely unconventional and surrealist through its lack of conventional plot, non-chronological time order and mixture of realistic events and events that suggest the supernatural/unrealistic, for example the concept of the blue box seemingly being a portal between fantasy/dreams and real life, it can still be greatly appreciated as a recent masterpiece. Where earlier films that didn't conform to conventions were shunned and disliked by audiences, the audience satisfaction here comes from the process of unravelling your own personal interpretation of the film. The film is also emotionally involving through the lead character Diane, who very convincingly reaches a huge state of despair at the loss of her lover Rita. This film is a wonderful attempt at portraying a spontaneous surrealist vision of the director, which some would argue is a fundamental paradox because how can film-making be spontaneous, but from watching 'Mulholland Drive', it's hard to think that it isn't exactly how Lynch imagined it to be. This is a wonderful piece of art, thoroughly worth watching and will provide a focal point for fascinating theory debates. I personally think one of the major themes that the director is portraying through this film is the way people deal with rejection in one form or another. There are no right or wrong answers as such, and I feel that Lynch wants us all to feel satisfaction from our own interpretations, however different from the next persons, but I also feel he wanted to create a film that wouldn't just be seen as a piece of everyday entertainment that is just consumed, replaced by the next film and forgotten, but as art, that stays in the mind and people can return to again and again.",Mulholland Drive
1013,zephram,"Weird, Disturbing, Disjointed, Brilliant",10,19 April 2002,"David Lynch has confirmed himself the master of modern cinema in this weird, disturbing, disjointed, brilliant Film Noir. A film that takes such outmoded conventions as linear narrative and hurls them violently out the Window, Mulholland Drive is an exploration of conscious and subconscious that will leave you troubled and confused, but ultimately fulfilled as you piece together this pasticcio of one girl's memory (or justification for murder?). A veritable treatise on modern film, Lynch runs concurrent stories with overlapping characters that may or may not be related, fascination cultural cross-sections, seemingly meaningless asides, creepy porn-theater opera and the world's only Film Noir cowboy, and molds them in to a piece of cinema that critics will love or loathe, but that cinema buffs are required to see 4.5/5 Stars.",Mulholland Drive
1014,rmonyb-1,Watch your step in the courtyard,10,8 November 2001,"In possibly the most telling scene of this late-career student film by David Lynch, screen vet Ann Miller warns relative newcomer Naomi Watts (""Tank Girl"") about dog poop on the courtyard of their apartment building. The camera lingers significantly on the little series of turds. ""Pets are allowed,"" says Miller, but they have to be kept under control, or cleaned up after, or some such adage. It's a clear metaphor for directors and pet projects, but one many reviewers seem to forget by the end of this seeming intentional mess by one of the kings of oddness. Cameos by Billy Ray Cyrus and Chad Everett liven up this extremely well-acted flick. Lynch's directing is also at the top of the game, even if it was edited by a monkey (sans typewriter).",Mulholland Drive

And I know all of those indie losers said that they loved it, but thats only cuz they had no idea what was going on. I felt as if Lynch was trying to fool the world, but he didnt fool me. He just put together a bunch of random crap together, and then expects it to be a masterpiece. You know what I think a masterpiece is, Royal Tennenbaums, why? Cuz it made sense. Why? Cuz i did not need cliff notes for it, later",Mulholland Drive
1017,eyesolation,A broken Hollywood dream.,10,22 January 2002,"Many reviewers say the movie starts as a normal story, but gets unexplainable at the end, with character shifts etc. But the actual character shifts are made in the first part of the movie (in Diane's dreams). In the last part (when Diane is awake) Lynch gives us the ""real"" or ""actual"" situation. We get to know where Diane got all the names, places and objects from her nightmarish dream.Lynch didn't make a total unexplainable movie. He even made one of the most intelligent scripts of the last few years. There are many details that do make sence, but just not enough to make you say, you fully understand it (which I like).But it's not only about the plot.-There's the typical lynch humour (the espresso scene).-The supurb soundtrack. -The atmospherec photography. -The references to his other movies (Twin Peaks, Lost Highway,...)-The references to the Hollywood's Film Noire period (the poster of Gilda, the music, the close-up of the Sunset Boulevard streetname etc.)It's even a mix of all different movie genres: film noire, thriller, horror, comedy (even slapstick humor), romance, cheap erotic movies,action, even western (the cowboy)...they're all there (and not by accident).
Above all this movie is a big f*ck you towards Hollywood. How everything is ruled by one or two mighty persons. How an actress can get to the top by not only using her acting skills. How a young, unexperienced actress with high hopes, can fall so low or in other words how the so called Hollywood ""dream"" can be broken.10/10",Mulholland Drive

1019,Xhen,Mulholland Drive explained,10,27 September 2002,"***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** Don't listen to anyone who tells you that this movie is impossible to understand. That's not true. Difficult, yes...especially on first viewing, but there is method to David Lynch's madness and there is an explanation to be found for those willing to look.Mulholland Drive is a brilliantly structured film even though the structure is unconventional. Basically the first two hours play out as the dream of a very troubled young woman by the name of Diane Selwyn. In the final 30 minutes we are taken into Diane's reality. Mullholland Drive is a very disturbing portrait of the inner world of a woman about to commit suicide and we learn about her life and what led her to murder and suicide through the dream imagery of the first two hours.What confuses many people the first time they see Mulholland Drive is that David Lynch doesn't use the normal cinematic techniques to tip his audience off that they are watching a dream segment. In fact, the dream plays out in fairly conventional linear fashion while it is the reality portion of the film that plays out in non-linear form, jumping back and forth in time and introducing psychotic hallucinations as well. This further blurs the line between reality and fantasy in this film.Contrary to popular belief Mulholland Drive is actually very intricately plotted, although the narrative is not readily apparent on the first viewing. The dream portion is a mirror image of reality and it displays a reversed reflection of Diane's real world. A few examples: In the dream Rita exits the limousine and walks downhill; in reality Diane exits the limousine and walks uphill. In the dream Aunt Ruth is alive; in reality Aunt Ruth is dead. In the dream Adam Kesher's world is spinning out of control and he is losing everything; in reality Adam Kesher's world is very much in control and he has everything. In the dream the hitman is incompetent; in reality he turns out to be all too competent. In the dream Camilla is alive and Diane is dead; in reality Diane is alive and Camilla is dead.Betty is, of course, the idealized dream version of Diane. She's a prettier, more wholesome, and more talented version of Diane. However, Diane is not Betty in her dream as most people automatically assume...she's Rita.Mulholland Drive is a challenging and haunting film that I believe will only rise in stature as the years go by. David Lynch spoonfeeds nothing to his audience but challenges them to explore the nightmarish inner world of Diane Selwyn for themselves. There are great rewards for those willing to do so.",Mulholland Drive

1021,dolcry,Why it deserves movie of the year.,10,22 December 2001,"What is Mulholland Drive about?  Well, having seen it 4 times in the theatre, I can safely say that I know the answer to this question.  Making such a statement is dangerous.  If I tell the answer, then it might take away something from the movie for those who have not seen it.  On the other hand, not saying it might give people the impression that I don't really know, but I'm trying to come off as smart.  Let me just say this then. It's about dreams, expectations, ideals and ultimately, failure.
There is nothing like Mulholland Drive.  The acting is flawless, as is the immaculate direction and writing.  David Lynch is a true genius, and he operates in a realm that is not accessible to the average person, or for that matter, most people.  Mulholland Drive is the freshest, most exciting movie of the year.  It's rewarding, when you figure it out, and it's moving. It contains every known genre, and it possibly even forges a new one that is as of yet unnamed.If this movie does not win then it will be a great tragedy.  A movie like this comes along once every fifty years.  It's an immediate classic, and I can't see how anything can possibly surpass it, unless it's something that David Lynch can find in his pond of ideas.",Mulholland Drive
1022,lord-reign,An absolute masterpiece!,10,10 July 2008,"David Lynch, possibly one of the strangest but most adventurous directors in cinema. Fact.I began watching this film expecting something different from what I got, I was expecting an exceptional film, from all the hype. But what I got was one of the most intense, mysterious, atmospheric, brilliantly plotted, dark and most cinematically masterful and intriguing films I have ever watched.What starts off with a seriously trippy opening sequence and then an horrific car crash, ends with the viewer almost hypnotised with what has gone by. I wont tell you anything that would spoil the story, but be prepared for surprises.Every scene in this film has the sort of intensity rarely found elsewhere, it's a truly nightmarish and dreamlike experience, with one of the most creepy scenes I have experienced. It has moments of almost unbearable silence, with the viewer on the edge of their seats as to what will happen next, as in this film...anything can happen.The story is so complex and almost brain meltingly confusing that many people may be put off by being left in the dark till the end where mostly everything is revealed. But even than it may not be possible to understand what has happened, close attention must be given in a lot of the scenes, especially the scenes with Betty and Rita.David Lynch should of won the best directer award at the Oscars, as he has created a true masterpiece, with haunting cinematography, subtle but sharp satirical underlines to the narrative and a superb control of the smart and hypnotic lot.Hell...I've just finished watching it and I'm still hypnotised from what has happened...",Mulholland Drive
1023,trnovice,Contrary to what many may thing a completely coherent film....,10,14 January 2002,"...though admittedly only after the second viewing.The first time round I was left feeling like I had been in the presence of brilliance, but not quite figured out why? There was a nagging feeling that (perhaps unlike some of Lynch's work) that there was one piece missing and all would fall into place.That piece fell between the two viewings and the second time round I was taken with how explicit and consistent the film was.SPOILER ALERT (not that if you have got this far it will be much of a spoiler - I must be repeating what others have said)It's not just the facile, Dallasesque explanation of ""it was all a dream"" and that's why it was weird. Rather it this realisation brings a profound logic to all the film. Lynch does give you clues. After the titles, the camera zooms in on a red pillow - two thirds of the way through Diane wakes up on the same red pillow. In between, we have the crazy, but real world of dreams, where things are impossibly good, or impossibly bad and all sorts of people and things are juxtaposed in odd ways. What follows (including some flashbacks) then makes perfect sense - yes, some things are out of sequential order, but Lynch provided clues to the timing - presence or absence of the ashtray, the appearance of the blue key. It's complicated, but then so are people's emotions and memories in times of severe stress and remorse (what Diane is going through).Every element of the dream (with possibly the exception of the grotesque man behind the diner - see later) appears in its real context and we she how Diane's troubled psyche has assembled the pieces. IMO the only thing that happens after she wakes up is the extended scene of her in her robe in her apartment - ending in the denouement. The flashbacks were all prior to her waking and thus her dream.Back to the man at the back of the diner - my take? The man who dies is representative of Diane's innocence or possibly sanity which when confronted by the ugly deed she had commissioned dies. Why pick on the random guy from her diner conversation with the hit man? Well I have no idea, but haven't we all experienced such random associations in dreams. One thing I though was a work of true brilliance was the way in which how Lynch represented a dream was so close to my own (rather less colourful) experience of dreams.Yes, it was a satire on the dreams of Hollywood, but to me at least it was a bit more fundamental than that - a treatise on the human spirit and its occasional collapse into oblivion - a more universal theme.Before I get RSI I'll sign off and finished by commending this film to any viewer who wants to be stimulated, challenged and have to think a bit - surely quite a lot of what film is meant to be about!",Mulholland Drive
1024,lcpeters23,"A trip that will ironically not have you following the film's catch phrase, 'Silencio'.",9,11 August 2002,"Lynch, Lynch, Lynch.  A name synonomous with mind games.  If you go along to Mulholland Dr. because of the buzz don't expect anything less than his reputation.  Perhaps more mainstream than his other efforts (The Straight Story excluded) Mulholland Dr. features one of the best performances by an actress this year.  Naomi Watts is so believable in her dual roles you can't help but wonder what has taken the industry so long to allow her to take the leap from Australian television screens to substantial film material on the big screen.

It is doing just what Lynch wants: stimulating people to think and react.STOP READING NOW IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW!This film is Diane's story.  Betty is Diane's fantasy self and Rita is Diane's fantasy Camilla.  The entire first half is the fantasy.  D knows she can never have C because C is not interested in her (even though C could have lesbian tendencies).  If C is recreated as an amnesiac,R, and D is recreated as the perfect small town girl, B, than the slate can be wiped clean for the two of them to be together.The second half explains the circumstance leading to the fantasy.  Perhaps the actual fantasy takes place during the split second from the bullet entering D's brain to its exit and her death.As usual Lynch has included a number of inexplicable intricasies that have some sort of subtextural relationship to eachother.  Just that much more to discuss with friends.I recommend everyone watch the film at least twice in an attempt to understand.",Mulholland Drive
1027,robogil,What Mulholland Drive Means to Me,10,16 April 2002,"Let me try to sum up this twisted masterpiece.(****Plot Giveaway****)To understand it, you must begin at the scene between Camilla and Diane as they are topless on Diane's couch (I just love to say that, by the way). Diane is madly in love with Camilla and can not stand to be rejected.  We then learn that Camilla is using Diane for her own pleasures.  Camilla invites Diane to Adam's party and Adam is about to propose to Camilla. This pushes Diane over the edge and she decides to have Camilla killed.  If she can't have her, then no one can.  She hires a killer with money that her aunt gave her, which she has been saving.  The blue key opens a Pandora's Box, which signifies the evil that will be brought out by Diane's actions. Diane realizes that she has ordered someone to kill her true love and can not live with the consequences.  She, therefore, kills herself.Now, we must return to the beginning of the movie.  The first scene is the jitterbug scene- Diane is remembering what brought her to L.A. in the first place.  She is dying.  They say that people can see their lives flash before their eyes when they think they are about to die.  Diane is seeing her life the way she would like it to be.  In the next scene, we hear heavy breathing in the same bed where Diane shot herself.  Was Camilla killed?  Diane has no knowledge of this.  She invents a scenario where Camilla avoids the death by the most outrageous of circumstances- a car crashing into the back of Camilla's limo.  The remainder of the movie is Diane's dream before death. She takes pieces of her real world, distorts them and makes them part of the dream.  Betty is the waitress, Bob Booker is the director of the movie where Camilla and Diane meet, Coco is Adam's mother, etc.  How many times have we had a dream where people in our consciousness become other characters in our subconscious?Rita is really Diane.  Diane has identified herself as the one that she is in love with.  When Betty says that she loves Rita, it is really Camilla telling Diane that she loves her.  This, of course, is what Diane is longing for.  Camilla wears the blond wig to emphasize the point that Camilla is really Diane.The rest is just pure David Lynch at his best - an image and audio feast master.I might be way off base, but I could be right on.",Mulholland Drive

The dreamlike scenes, some critics liked, were disjointed and disturbing, like Lynch's own nightmares perhaps.

1030,fetisha369,Greek Mythology?,9,2 November 2002,"I'm a film student and in our studygroup this film has been analysed already for over 7 weeks and very, very interesting things came out. First of all, the film is really stuffed with Greek Mythology. For instance, the blue box is a straight reference to pandoras box. Second, the names Diane and Camilla are very important in one Greek mythology (i can't remember which one, I'll ask). Third, there is the myth of 'Olympus rock','where all the heroes live'. Hollywood Hills is where all the stars live, under the Hills lays LA. And guess what road leads from LA to the Hills? Yes, Mulholland Drive, exactly were the accident happens which sort of symbolizes that reaching stardom is all an illusion. There's a lot of more Greek stuff in it, like Medusa, but you should really read a book about it to figure it out. The concept of '(Hollywood) it's all an illusion' is definitely a big theme; think of the Silenziotheatre, the failed love between Adam and his girl and of course Camilla and Diane. Actually the whole point of the film is that it's all an illusion, cause you can't quite figure out what is dreamed and what is 'real'. You could also say that the sequence after the opening of Pandoras box is a reconstruction of Rita's/ Camilla's memory, but probably a misleading one; the myth says that when Pandora's Box is opened all the bad things come out. This might be an explanation that we get to see the reconstruction trough DIANE's eyes, who's clearly sort of insane and bad because she hires a guy to kill Camilla. About the opening sequence; we see that 'Camilla' is supposed to get shot by highly professional do-ers; certainly not the one Diane hooked up with. That sort of stuff makes we wonder again if it's all just a dream or psychosis of Diane to try to forget the fact that she murdered Camilla. Anyway, I'm definitely not out of this thing yet, actually I have to write my first assignment now about MH Drive, so I'll stop for now. Still one thing left to say; I think the whole name thing with Camilla, Diane, Betty,etc. is one of Lynche's way to confront the fact that the name of the actor, like Tom Cruise, makes the movies nowadays, it guarantees success for the studio's. This is all disregarded of the persons they are..they're totally replaceable;the same point is made in 'Simone'. This sort off stuff establishes the fact that MH Drive is totally postmodern, like there's no real truth, and if there were then it's definitely not to be found in Hollywood. There's a dark 'something' under the thin fake Hollywood surface which has more truth in it than the things we see and take for real...",Mulholland Drive

The visual style of the movie progresses from his earlier work, continuing to find new and thought-provoking viewpoints of his subjects. So far, so good. The problem for me in this movie was that it seemed to lose its way half-way through. Too many undeveloped threads (female lead for director's movie), too many broken threads (still haven't sussed the link between Betty and Diane) and maybe he didn't quite succeed in tying all the diverse threads together into one entity (a movie).

1036,Duerfian,A nice movie.,8,14 July 2002,"Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie. I also think it would have made a great TV series. And that is exactly what is wrong with this movie.
Originally shot as a pilot for a TV-series, it got the thumb down from the TV networks. A financier from France (Canal Plus?) gave Lynch the rest of the funds to make something out of the pilot. So what we have here is a mix of material that would have been the starting point of a TV series that I suppose would have lasted us longer then 2.5 hours and some added material to make it a movie.I am pretty sure this is not the story Lynch wanted to tell (at least not in this form), I am sure what critics heralds as wonderful use of red herrings were not intended as such.My take on the whole thing is that the first part of the movie is largely the pilot, since this is where basically all characters are introduced and the latter part with the identity switch is what Lynch added to make it into a movie. I like what he did what he had to work with. The movie actually creates a very dreamlike atmosphere and it does make sense in many different ways. And in other ways it doesn't make sense at all.I would give this movie a 8/10 for that unmistakable Lynch touch and it is a joy to behold. The main actors also are remarkably good. But in the back of my head I still think we would have had a 10/10 TV series on our hands, if the TV networks would have had some guts.For all who have had the pleasure of watching Twin Peaks and the first Twin Peaks movie (also a modified pilot, with a very poor tacked on ending - some homeless guy with no relation to anything killing Laura Palmer) probably understand my point here.",Mulholland Drive
1037,shanebuckland,A paradox of perfection,10,22 November 2002,"Drama, mystery, suspense, intrigue, eroticism, love, existential questions, brooding philosophy, worldly parallels, nightmarish visions.................... such is the world of Mulholland Drive. Simply put: This is David Lynch at his invariable finest.
For some, the words: ""A David Lynch Film"" will be all the review you need. Fans of his previous work will instantly understand where I'm coming from. For those new to Lynch, his work is really something that you need to experience for yourself. No words can adequately describe what you will obtain from Mulholland Drive as no words can adequately describe the workings of your own inner psyche. Your interpretation of what unfolds will to a great extent be a reflection of yourself, what makes you tick, how your mind goes about interpreting and analysing information and emotion. Do not expect a literal storyline, do not expect anything clear-cut, do not expect anything to be handed to you on a plate, do not expect the film to be one of escapism, and do not expect to turn your brain off.To quote from Blue Velvet, ""It's a strange world"", and Lynch knows this only too well. Prepare for a perfectly executed, beautiful and arousing cinematic venture into the unknown. 
In a sense you can in fact look at Mullholland Dr. in a literal fashion, although I think this is cutting yourself short of what can actually be obtained from the film. One of the more literal interpretations I had of the movie is just the whole basic play with the 'dark underbelly of Hollywood' theme. After my second viewing of the film I always saw the first half of the film as a dream(non-reality) and the second half of the film as the actuality of the situation (reality). Take away all Lynch's moot cryptic clues and random scenes of unrelated (or are they?) madness, and what have you left? A woman who travels to Hollywood to follow her dreams of becoming an actress. In the first half we are shown her dream (or a manifestation of her dream): She is instantly loved and recognised by some of the Hollywood 'powers that be', scores a part as an actress almost simultaneously, falls passionately in love, lives in a beautiful house, etc, etc. And in the second half we are shown her reality: she scores small parts and even then, only as a favour of a friend who is dating a famous director, she remains unnoticed, yearns for love that is eternally unobtainable, lives in a small and crummy flat, and worst of all...... her dreams are nothing more than that, and will never ever eventuate.This is but one interpretation. There are many more. And each cryptic clue or Lynchian twist that you add (the blue key, the cowboy, the dark man, the ashtray........and so forth) changes or gives entirely new meaning altogether.Another way to look at it is as a jumble of metaphors. For example..... the dark man in Mulholland Dr. is nothing more than a visual representation of Hollywood (the actuality of Hollywood, not the glamorous one we are led to believe on television). The dark, seething underbelly of tinsel-town itself.For me, I look at David Lynch films in the same way I would look at my own dreams. I find this the best way to describe to people, or at least make them understand where he's coming from. You know how in a dream things are all a bit mixed up and yet to you, at the time, they make perfect sense? Friends of yours who have never met talk in dreams like they have known each other their whole lives, locations by no means near to each other are walking distance in comparison, something that happened to you five years ago and something that happened five days ago blur together seamlessly in your dream and yet....... TO YOU..... it all makes perfect sense. It is more a representation of ideas (like a dream) than a linear story. And what you make of it really comes down to your personal interpretation of what it made you feel............ which may or may not be what Lynch intended you to feel in the first place.Perhaps his most poignant work since Blue Velvet, Mullholland Drive is a cinematic masterpiece from a director at the height of his craft. A riddle within a riddle. A paradox of perfection.""Now you will see me one more time if you do good. You'll see me two more times if you do bad"".",Mulholland Drive
1038,david_hands_of_fate,Afraid to bad-mouth this movie? Don't Be...,1,28 September 2002,"An pathetic attempt to imitate the plot switcheroo of ""The Usual Suspects"". But without any of the character development, and no characters that you can care about.  The plot switcheroo at the very end has nothing to do with the excruciating hours that preceed it.These types of films should only be attempted by those capable of subtlety. David Lynch has none, as one can plainly see by the coarsely integrated acting. Like so many other minor moments of this movie, it is a poorly executed attempt at suspense, that is not done by gradually building rapport with the viewer and proceeding with a momentum that has you wondering ""where it will go?"", but rather by tediously stagnating at a point until you are wondering ""when will it move on?"".It also demonstrates how NOT to do mystery.  A good mystery would lead the viewer through a series of incremental insights that when realized awe the viewer with how tied together the whole story is.  What is unknown to the viewer in this flop throughout it's plot is the plot itself, which is unrelated to the majority of the film itself.It is a pathetic attempt at ""Jacob's Ladder"" but without the directing skill needed to capture the existentialism. As far as it's existential qualities go: it has none.  It's moments aren't filled with an experience of any kind. It's moments are focused on the tedious suspense, and the big question of ""Why this experience at this time?"" whose answer is ultimately randomness, or a contrived purpose which can only be explained by the author.  Any experience that might escape that, fails to escape the horrible acting.I laugh at the fact it was recommended to me by someone who hated it also, but was afraid to bad-mouth it because want to admit that he didn't get it.

1041,maggiedb-1,Simply Lynch,10,24 October 2009,"One of the few films that actually starts with the formula- Lights! Camera! Action! But what do we see? Dark bright mysterious shades of purple, red and yellow. A dreamed up Mulholland Drive. What do we hear? a tragic mysterious exiting score, old jazzed up Hollywood tunes and disturbing sounds. What do we experience? Hollywood, ""this dream place"" or this nightmare? Lynch has created a visual masterpiece that is disturbingly simple, just follow the clues. The film is about Bette (Watts), the ultimate image of a failed Hollywood actress, who mysteriously meets a beautiful stranger, Rita (Herring) and ends up in a dangerous pursuit to find Rita's true identity. That's reminiscent of the old Hollywood film noir genre and feels like a mixture of the films Psycho, Pulp Fiction, Chinatown, Sunset Boulevard and LA Confidential. Under the subtext of the mystery we discover a Hollywood we never knew existed, a world where films are controlled by unknown creepy underground figures that no one has ever heard of. Lynch's directing can only be described as ""Lynchian"". He knows what each camera shot, word, sound and color represents in every scene. It feels as though you're dreaming while you watch the film. You see things that are not there, yet you know they are there. You hear a band, but you see no band.Etc. Naomi and Laura both give brave unique performances. On the one side of the spectrum their performances feel artificially mocking and stereotypical and on the other side you realize they are stuck in Hollywood, the land of the cliché. The set design, film score, soundtrack and all of the other cinematic elements magically fit into one puzzle and Mulholland Drive creates a dream, the most beautiful place, that turns into a living hell of a reality. The one moment you feel as though you want to be there, the next moment you disappear into this disgusting place that you never ever in your life want to experience again. A harrowing place that is so sad that you close your eyes and try to forget it. And then you open your eyes and realize it's the world you live in. Watch it twice, to understand it the first time and read up on the clues before the second viewing.",Mulholland Drive
1042,TwistedRoaches,Watch it again and again,10,5 March 2003,"MAJOR SPOILER ALERT If you have not seen this movie already, I urge you NOT to read on as this review will ruin the experience for you.If you did not like this movie, it's either because you should stick to movies such as Pearl Harbour.  Another could be that you just did not try to understand the movie.  A real movie lover will love this ovie as it offers a major challenge.  The challenge is to understand this movie by sort through the clues that are given to you.  Some clues bear no meaning, so do.  As happens in our dreams.The story actually begins when Noami Watts' character wakes up as Diane. (not Betty).  This movie is a story of obssesion.The first part of the movie, Diane dreams that she is Betty, an aspiring actress that comes to Hollywood to be an actress.  Yes, many weird things happen.  She falls in love with the amnesia plagued stranger - Rita - and they go off on a quest to find Rita's identity.THEN, Diane wakes up.  Now Diane (which is the dead girl in the bed when Betty and Rita climb in a house through the window - She dreams about her own death), she is obssessed by Camilla.  They where both actresses and fell in love, Camilla eventually dumps her for a movie director.  So Diane cannot bear the pain, she hire a contract killer to kill Camilla, because she is obsessed and jealous.Diane wakes up and the combination of everything gets to her.  She hallucinates that her grand-parents come in form under the door and go after her, and then she shoots herself.  At this point, this lady has lost her mind.  That is the movie.  Now the way to understand the movie is to Watch it Again.  Once Diane wakes up, pay attention to every little detail that you see on the screen. Because when Diane wakes up, that is reality. Sure, we are suggested to a few flashbacks, but the informartion in these flashbacks is crucial.  That information explains the unexplained elements of the first part.We all know that things that happen to you during the course of your day, can come back in your dream in different circumstances.  Here are a few examples.  When Diane is contracting her assasin in the DINER, the waitresses' name is BETTY.  The blue key?  That is the key that the assasin will give to Diane once the deed has been done.  Did you get the cowboy? I did not think so.  It's very stupid...when Diane is at the supper party with Camilla, the director and whole bunch of other people, Diane glances through the room and a man in a cowboy hat walks by... and that's how a man with a cowboy hat ends up in her dream.I won't spoile it all for you, because the beauty of this movie is to find all these little unexplained details and associate them with their meaning.  Most commenteers on here have not given this movie a fair chance. You need to watch this movies several times before getting everything - and that is what i call art.No, this movie is nothing like Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks, but is that not a good thing?I am not trying to say that the poeple that have given bad reviews are idiots that do not know movies, but I think that real movie lovers  are missing out by not watching this movie over and over.",Mulholland Drive
1043,surprised_by_witches,This movie is a complete waste of an evening.,2,4 March 2003,"David Lynch seems to think he's the American Fellini. That's the only reason I can think of for the bizarre and (in this case) pointless characters he throws at us in this ultimately depressing, unfulfilling movie that continues, not very successfully, in the tradition of Twin Peaks. I kept waiting for someone to ask for pie.No one is what they seem in this movie, and by the end I didn't really care for any of them. I realize that the latest trend in movies is to create protagonists that no one can like, and if that's your bag, by all means see this flick. I guess I'm old fashioned, but I like to have at least one character I feel I could spend half an hour with, let alone waste an entire evening. This movie left me feeling empty and thinking, ""who cares?""My recommendation is to read a good book instead.",Mulholland Drive
1044,t6lem,Pretentious Crap,1,30 March 2003,"First of all, I think it is really stupid to make a movie that is crap and then justify it in the end by making it all a dream. I have read posts on IMDB about what people think the movie was about and I have come to the realization that none of them know what the movie was about anyway. Movies about reality and alternate realities are easy ways to make a movie where you have complete freedom to do whatever the heck you want, even if it makes no sense. Trying to understand a movie where reality and dreams and alternate reality conflict is a waste of time. Dreams and alternate realities don't make sense to begin with, why would a movie about them make sense then?",Mulholland Drive
1045,DeadlyGibbon,Dreadful and dull...,1,16 February 2011,"A very bad film. Dreadfully acted, irritating, uninspiring characters, dull imagery and cinematography, poor dialogue and most of all, it did not make any sense. Yes, I know, films do not always have to make sense to be good. In fact, i love films which go off-track occasionally, and most of my favourite films are full of strange and weird images. I could point to films such as ""Brazil"" or ""2001"". However, what these films do have, is a plot. Not necessarily a strong one, or one that can easily be described, but you watch SOMETHING in those films. Something happening, interesting occurrences.In Mulholland Drive, a desperately horny David Lynch exploits his sexual fantasies amidst dozens of nonsensical sketches, which are neither funny, witty, interesting and do not evoke any emotional response. I have watched this twice, hoping in vein that I might GET IT, something those beret wearing film buffs constantly, tell me I do not do. They WANT to love this film. It appears original, if you watch it trying hard to get into it, or do not try at all but occasionally glance up at the screen while reading a book. However, watch this film normally, and i mean normally, analyse individual aspects of the film, and trust me, you will see the truth.I hate this film, people who like it are not necessarily idiots, but they are blinded by that 'artiste' Lynch, whose only good films are ""The Elephant Man"" and ""Blue Velvet"", but not much else.",Mulholland Drive
1046,miguelreporte,The Greatest Movie Of All Time,10,20 February 2014,"Years ago I saw 2001 A Space Odyssey. I thought it was spectacular and that no other movie could match it. Its artistic vision combined with wonderful entertainment, and deepness were things that had a huge impact on me. I would consider it the best movie ever made.But it was also sad that with only 17 years old, I had already seen the best movie of all time. That every other movie was going to be below it. That no movie could match it.Anyway, after watching Inland Empire (and disliking it) and Blue Velvet (and loving it), I thought I should watch Mulholland Dr. So I did. I watched it when everyone in my house was sleeping and there was nothing but silence. And at first, I disliked the movie.As day passed by, I began thinking on it, and I decided to watch it again. And that was a wise decision. After watching the whole movie for the second time, I knew 2001 was matched. Everything in this movie is SO intriguing and genius, that you may dismiss it on your first view. The movie is a GIANT puzzle. A puzzle that is at times dramatic, and sometimes frightening. This is THE MOVIE that I had always wanted to watch. A movie that had a lot symbolism for you to figure out what happened. Lynch's directing is just top notch. He creates this masterpiece with facility, and uses the perfect music for his perfect scenes. Watts acting is just hypnotizing. I couldn't believe she was Australian, because her American accent is amazing. You will know what I am talking about when you watch a scene where she is acting for a movie inside of the movie. A Hollywood paradox, right? Well, that is my point. It is a dreamlike movie. You will see what I mean. This is the greatest movie of all time-tied with 2001 A Space Od. Go watch it. Then watch it again. The movie is like a dark encyclopedia on many themes. In order to understand it, you must pay close attention to every detail! Perhaps taking notes while you watch it is recommended.Sorry for my grammar/spelling. English is not my mother language ;)",Mulholland Drive
1047,endrit7,It's beyond dreams and reality...,10,24 December 2013,"IMDb's description of this film is actually quite correct. Mulholland Dr. is that kind of movie where you have no idea which scenario is real and which is a dream. I don't say that the first part of the film is happening in a dream while the second part is real. Cause you can not categorize this film that easily. The movie is more than a dream, it creates a parallel universe of Betty or Diane so basically is not just a dream is more than that, it's who she wants to be, who she wishes she was. So the film is actually not so hard to understand if you pay close attention. Sure there are some things only David Lynch could explain like the cowboy or that book with the secret of the world or the monster-person we see and other stuff which make the movie even greater and give it a mystery feel that no other movie can provide. So basically the movie is really underrated, mostly because people don't get it or don't want to. I actually think ,Mulhollan Dr. is a must see for any movie fan who doesn't want his/her movie to be straight forward or understandable at first sight and basically doesn't make you think at all. Mulhollan Dr. , the most UNDERRATED movie of all time.",Mulholland Drive
1048,JokerWhySoSerious,A failure of a movie,9,27 January 2012,"I've seen Mulholland Drive twice now. The first time I saw it, I severely disliked it: it was weird for weird's sake, and was so hell bent on confusion, that I had difficulty keeping up with it.I did decide to give it a second go, because I had heard so many stories on IMDb and other online forums about how they hated it on first watch, and gradually fell in love with it on multiple watches. On second watch, it is far more clear and makes a lot more sense. I really wanted to fell in love with it, to make Mullholland Drive to enter my dreams and my nightmares, for it to have something to say. It doesn't. It isn't stimulating in any way, and the only thoughts it provoked were about the mystery, not any hidden message the film may have. It isn't thrilling at all. It isn't sexy, it isn't funny, it isn't effective. In the first hour or so- it was perfect, but the second half went drastically downhill, the narrative was made into shambles.However, Mulholland Drive has some fantastic photography, the acting is great, and it can create some suspense. The rest is unfortunately- a mess.",Mulholland Drive

When the movie was finally over i just started laughing because i had not a clue what the hell the director expected us to get from that mess of a story.  You really shouldn't have to come online and find guides to understand what the hell you just watched. Even so, i appreciate complex movies and movies that have deep meanings. But this movies' story sucks anyway.  even now that i know what really happened it really is just a waste of a time.  A jealous, no talent actress, that hires a hitman to kill her ex lesbian lover, then regrets it and kills herself... if that really deserves the ratings it gets i'm truely convinced that anyone can make a movie and make money as long as its marketed right and you put a lesbian scene in it.

1051,DrunkenBuddha,"Unfortunately, not worth a second viewing",6,24 September 2012,"As a huge fan of movies with twist endings, and also of the stunningly beautiful Naomi Watts, I guess I maybe had some fairly high hopes when viewing this movie. Maybe my expectations were too high?All the ingredients were here for an outstanding movie!Hot and steamy actresses? Check. Great storyline/script? Check. Sweeping Cinematography and great Direction? Check. ...but I just don't see this as worthy of 8 stars.I think the 8 stars are a culmination of those who found the passionate scenes with the main characters arousing, which is understandable ;) and possibly David Lynch apologists.Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against David Lynch films, but this one seems a bit like a gimmick that we had to have clues about the film provided in order for us to ""get the concept""Well, why only 6 stars?For some reason when everything here was put together, it just didn't turn out right. The movie seems to run too long, and the tempo takes too long to pick up. I was left intrigued for about 4/5 of the way through, and then all of a sudden the story line starts racing by WAY TOO FAST. I'm not saying that everything is too confusing for your basic movie goer to grasp, but that there's just too much happening all at the end, like everyone had a long tug of war during the entire production, and the writers won and it came through in a jumbled finale. Your ability to piece things together in a way where you are still being entertained just seems to get exhausted.If you ever been at an excellent all-you-can-eat buffet where you have enjoyed everything pretty much, but after a while the server drops your check off without asking if you're done, and then circles around your table like a shark and has that ""time-to-go"" look on their face,and then that dampens the quality of the meal overall in your estimation...... well then that buffet is located on Mulholland Dr.",Mulholland Drive
1052,el_totob,A true masterpiece... entertainment for the brain,10,4 September 2005,"I must admit it: I didn't understand a single thing after the 1st viewing. Yet, I'm not the kind of guy who comes and b*tch about a movie after one viewing only just cuz he didn't take some time to analyze it properly.So I started thinking about it, replaying some key scenes in my head, then came here and read a few more about this movie... then I could figure it out, in a way. I don't pretend I fully understand it and get every single detail Lynch placed here and there... Still I can pretend this movie is a work of art, in all its form. From lighting, music, mood, colors, camera work... to the remarkable performances of the actors. Everything is delightful!Yet I was disappointed by the incredible amount of viewers who hated this movie. Most of them just thrashed it cuz of the plot, not even noticing the brilliant visual work of Lynch (which, that alone, deserves an award). I have something to say to these ""undoubtedly-Michael-Bay-flicks lovers"": Mulholland Dr IS NOT a popcorn movie! It is not meant for entertainment, if not the fact that it entertains your mind the same way a puzzle or a rubick cube does when you are messing with it. It stimulates your judgment, your logic, your ability to memorize a bunch of stuff given to you. Besides, the story, even if pulled that way looks more like an IQ test than a script for a film, remains human. Stay close to the human emotions and reactions... And this dream/reality connection goes, in my opinion, far beyond everyone is let to believe.So if you don't get it after one viewing, watch it again. And again. And again if necessary... but if you still don't get it, just give it up. You probably don't have the brain capacity required. But cuz you just can't understand it, doesn't mean it sucks. Seriously, you think the movie would have been nominated in so many film festivals if it wasn't that great?So quit b*tching on David Lynch's directing skills. Love him or hate him, that won't change the fact that this guy is a genius and that his name is as great as Hitchcock or Kubrick.P.S: To all those who mentioned: worst movie ever, I got some news for you: there are far far worse movies out there. Check out Battlefield Earth, Burton's Planet of the apes, Armaggedon or Pearl Harbor. Now that's some pretty awful movies! And I only named 3...",Mulholland Drive

They were all naked but were duped into pretending they could see stylish clothes to seem as intelligent as everyone else. This movie has its moments but all it is is a collection of moments--in other words, a student film with studio dollars behind it. Congrats to David Lynch for making a movie so slick and so vague there is a social pressure amongst people to pretend they not only get it but adore it. Suckers lol. Sure the lesbian scene was hot and when you really analyze the film you can derive some intriguing thoughts; but apply your brain to anything this much and hopefully you come up with some gems too.",Mulholland Drive
1054,flood-eamonn,Enjoyable but as futile as its narrative,6,1 April 2013,"I really enjoyed this film most of the way through. It is well-made and entertaining but what is it all about? I see it as a mash-up of the dreams that Hollywood inspires and how they can both come true or turn into nightmares. It doesn't really matter what the names of any of the characters are, and even their roles are interchangeable as yet more aspiring stars arrive to have their dreams put through the mill every day. It could turn out any and all ways for each of them. The obvious character to examine arrives in LA fresh off the plane but even more established characters in Hollywood like the director are being turned inside-out day in, day out all the way through the film. How many of the characters are trying to live their dreams in hope (or dread) of them coming true? There is much more that can be said about the film, and many interesting theories about how the narrative can make sense in a less abstract sense exist, but I don't consider it worthwhile to pursue any of these. Regardless of how the it came into being, it must be considered on its own as a whole film. That is where it falls down: it is so deliberately opaque that it is an affront to the audience and deserves to be treated with a proportionate amount of contempt. Not so much that the film falls below the enjoyable, diverting and watchable - just enough that it doesn't deserve all of the analysis that is has gotten. There are similarities to Sunset Boulevard, but that film is so much more focused, and ultimately has something to say about Hollywood that is tangible and not so deliberately confused as to be worthless.By all means watch this film, enjoy it, dissect it. There is fun even in the dissection, but I feel that if you do not approach it in the spirit of mockery, you allow the film to make a mockery of you... and perhaps that's what it sees you deserve for being the root cause of all the fakery that results from so many trying to present a pleasing image for some audience or other.",Mulholland Drive

It confused me beyond a point I can't handle. I couldn't event tell if I liked the movie while I watched it because it was so bizarre but after it ended, I thought it was brilliant because it impacted me.

She meets Diane who is trying to become a Hollywood actress. Mysterious things start to happen and Diane is interested in helping Rita explore/solve those mysteries. As is typical in Lynch fashion, things begin to become unclear quickly, and there is a definitive point in the movie where things switch around.When the box is opened, the perspective changes. Although the viewer may not realize it, he is now in the real world, the waking world of Diane/Betty. The entire first part of the film, up to the opening of the box, has been in Diane/Betty's dream. Betty has ultimately come into contact with all of the various people (in real life) that she has seen in her dream, and (as is typical with our dreams) faces / events are re- arranged, mixed up, and re-associated to form bizarre stories. The opening of the box symbolizes Diane/Betty waking up. The order of events are re-arranged so the we, the viewer, are able to piece together the puzzle (ie. Betty coming into contact with a person in real-life...who then becomes a face --but an entirely different person with different motives--in her dream). A much more thorough analysis can be found here.",Mulholland Drive

The main characters find a literal key sitting next to them in a theater while the main point is being driven home (that point being, ""yes, we all know that a movie is a fictional recording of events, but it will still sock you in the mouth!"") The key opens up a literal Pandora's box that unleashes the side of Hollywood that drives you mad, where the main character's old decisions come back to haunt her. What I love about the movie, other than its depth, is that the traditional-feeling first half is the dream and the nightmare-like second half is the reality. After the start credits, we literally see a first person perspective of a character laying their head on a pillow (followed by a fade to black), and at the half-way mark, she wakes up and the reality-nightmare begins. I interpreted the point to be this: the dream is the early stages of a relationship, where we see ourselves as the innocent one (discovery and amnesia). It is when we learn more about ourselves and others that we wake up and see that we are really corrupt and self-serving.",Mulholland Drive

1062,Azytzeen,My First David Lynch Film,6,6 September 2006,"Like the title said, this is my first David Lynch film. I do not know who David Lynch is, nor have I heard of his previous films. So maybe I am missing something by not seeing the others. I do hope that this is not the case. I was told to watch this my a close friend as she regarded it quite highly. This is not an easy movie to understand, so to be fair, I watched it three times, each time with a different mindset. The conclusion, unfortunately, is that this film is not one that should be hailed for being a ""piece of art"" or anything extraordinary. This film has some beautiful scenes, but that is about it.Many people have claimed that this film is art. Well, I must respectfully disagree with them on this regard. If all art is is putting pretty pictures together, then anyone can be an artist. True art goes much deeper. This is where Muholland Drive fails. During my second time of watching, I was told to ""think less and let it (the movie) flow"". This is quite impossible as whatever flow this movie tries to achieve is destroyed by its inconsistency.My final time I tried to pick up certain parts of the movie, and tried to make some sort of sense to it. However, it leaves 40% of the scenes unexplained. Is the director trying to lure people in by showing us eye candy and hoping the rest would flow as people get too caught up with their desperate attempts to scrounge up some meaning for it? I think it might be the case.Should you watch this movie? I don't know. It is a beautiful movie but that is it. Pure eye candy with no substance. I really wanted to try to find some meaning to this film, but it seems that it is the movie that is preventing me from doing so.",Mulholland Drive
1063,yesserlaham,Mulholland Drive...,4,26 June 2017,"This was my take on ""Mulholland Drive"": Like most, I decided to watch/rent this after I heard the universal praise- and knowing that Naomi Watts is on it (since I really like the actress). And despite COUNTLESS bizarre, unexplainable moments along the way, I was still very hooked and intrigued. 100 minutes into the film, then the two women go to the ""performance"" at like 2 am after of them/Rita wakes up out of the blue saying over and over ""Silencio"" or whatever the word was. The rest of movie (which is another 40 minutes by the way) is even WEIRDER than the first part AND completely contradicts and dumps on what I had already seen. Then the movie abruptly ends. You'd think their trip in the middle of the night (which could've been cool) would somehow tie to the story? None of the stuff had anything to do with anything. Introducing like 100 characters that one doesn't connect to/ cares about. Even the 2 main characters turn out to be not what they claim to be the entire time? Made a couple of good film fanatics and clever friends see it too and they were like WTF? Baffled, I wandered over to my computer to see if I could buy a clue as to what just happened, but to no avail as still nothing made sense. Someone's dream? Not real? An imaginary character that the other creates? Then what's the point of a 2 hour 30 minute movie if it's ""not real?"" Or is it real? I'm forced to make a choice. The movie is weird for weird's sake and just doesn't make sense. Everyone who loves it is trying to save face and pretend like they ""get"" it. Until someone proves otherwise. I give it 4/10 for the cool cinematography/ decent acting and creepy ominous chills it gave me in the beginning. Storyline though?",Mulholland Drive

Everything that it was billed to be it didn't achieve. After the first hour I was waiting for the story to at least start going places, but no, completely disjointed, half of the scenes had NO relevance. This movie is a product of an incredibly depraved mind, throwing in random scenes for what I can see as to having no point what-so-ever.Yes, it may be good (acting, scenes etc.) if you knew or at least had an idea of where this piece of tosh was going, rather than face disappointment at every scene hoping that the next one will bring you closer to a semblance of what the film is described to be on the box. Disjointed and weird films can be good, there are many out there but this is not one of them.It was not entertaining in the slightest.

I loved the comedy elements woven into the threatening atmosphere, the colour palate reminded me of Twin Peaks, and I cannot wait to see the new Twin Peaks program. If you like David Lynch, and I do, and you tried to watch Mulholland, and it didn't work for you the first time, you might try again and have a different experience.

Then after finally buying it on DVD and watching it again, I understand and appreciate it more.One of Lynch's greatest head-scratchers, a movie where reality and the dream world meet. The plot follows a mystery brunette (Laura Elana Harding) who loses her entire memory after a car crash on Mulholland Drive and stumbles into a apartment. That apartment is rented out to Betty Elms (Naomi Watts, in a great performance) a perky blonde who comes to LA with big star dreams.After stumbling on the woman, Betty decides to help her find herself, but their are other events afoot. Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux), a well established director is being forced to cast this woman ""Camilla Rhodes"" for his upcoming movie against his will, a man sees a evil thing behind Winkie's, Betty and Rita (the mystery woman assumes this name after a Rita Hayworth poster) become closer, but once the blue box is opened everything changes and the (possible) truth behind the mystery is revealed.Mulholland Drive is a beautiful rush of mystery, dark things, colors, and confusion. For any new Lynch fan, i would recommend watching this and Eraserhead to get into Lynch.",Mulholland Drive
1067,johnjones-33051,Enigmatic,9,21 November 2020,"Now I like 'thought provoking' art. Sometimes, I forget that a film, or for that matter a TV show can be the basis for 'artistic expression'. A simple narrative thread is sometimes what I want from a film. But some films require me to work hard at interpreting them, and then being satisfied that I have all I want from them in terms of achieving personal understanding of, indeed satisfaction in, what I have experienced.Mulholland Drive is a film that demands interpretation by the viewer as the story is neither straightforward nor focussed, not building to some conclusion based on a fairly obvious 'timeline' and typically linear storylines.It may be that the tale was meant to be spread over many television episodes a la Twin Peaks, and it's clear that the multiple storylines and disjointed timelines could well have fleshed out a far longer TV show - indeed I've only recently become aware that the film was, in large part, a pilot for a TV show.As a viewer - I've seen the film twice now - I became aware that the first part might well have been Diane's dream based interpretation of her predicament as presented in the later part, ie what she would have liked her experience to have been rather than what it actually was. This became clear to me on my second viewing.And what Lynch appears to me to be doing is building a world around Diane's dream(s). Whilst Diane would be aware through her dreams would be event outcomes - Lynch provides backdrop which perhaps may be best viewed as one way that the part perceived by Diane could have come about.The 'dream state' and reality, like so many of my dreams/life share characters and situations which cross over to/from reality/dreams but which may differ radically - and this is what I see in Lynch's film.The Diane's dreamworld/reality is focussed on what she perceives to be happening around her - Lynch offers a broader perspective on fact1ors which may determine both.There is a relationship between our dreamstate and real lives. And the film appears to me to be about that - fleshing out a possible dreamword and illustrating the potential crossover between that and the reality of Diane's world as it could appear to an observer.",Mulholland Drive
1068,tonytanti,Many will disagree with me but...,7,20 September 2005,"I thought of giving this an okay score, I can admit the movie was well shot, good acting etc.. all the components of an average to good movie. But I can't be disingenuous and pretend I liked it. I didn't. I thought it was art for the sake of art. If there was some grand point to all the character changes and plot changes I missed it and I have a feeling that all my friends who said they loved it were saying that because they thought they should. Sort of like Shakespeare, I like his writing but I suspect that many who say they love it say it because they feel they are supposed to.This movie tried way too hard to be different for me, it was neither entertaining, nor moving, nor purposeful.",Mulholland Drive

Perhaps not as intriguing or interesting as I had hoped. Sure, the ""twist"" is not bad, but that's just one part of the story. The weirdness in this movie is also not bad but not near perfect. I guess Lynch could have made some of the dialog a bit less unpretentious. They sometimes comes out so perfect you can't help but thinking of the written lines. I wasn't really captured by the movie experience, nor was I bored. I have to admit that even without the fact that it's supposed to be a acclaimed movie, I felt the lack of interesting characters. I didn't leave me wanting more. The music is fantastic though. Great variety. The acting keeps high class except for some villains.",Mulholland Drive

1071,loathsomedog,David Lynch is an indisputable genius,8,16 October 2008,"Its the story of Hollywood, its the story of America; glitz and glamour on the outside, lies and deception rotting away at the core. Its noir, it looks great and feels great. But its the way David Lynch tells the story that makes this film a masterpiece; instead of defining the characters and rounding off their roles, Lynch tells the story first and the characters eventually become almost irrelevant.After watching Lost Highway and especially Twin Peaks I was left thinking I know that was a good film but I didn't really understand it and I feel like I've missed something. After watching Mullholland Dr, I now know that the only thing I've previously missed in a Lynch film is the predictable start / middle / end of a story, stock characters, heroes and villains, happy endings, loose ends neatly tied up.The story is told in a way you don't expect, and I think this is the point. I believe that your pre-conceived ideas about how a story should be told are the only things preventing you from enjoying a David Lynch film.The thing that absolutely grips me with this kind of film is that now, 3 weeks after watching it I'm still thinking deeply about it. And just search the internet for discussions about this and other Lynch films (especially Twin Peaks!) and you'll know why this man is a genius.I'm off now to watch Lost Highway again!

1072,samridhh,"A real review, from an actual movie buff.",2,8 June 2018,"Ever been to a lecture of that overtly fervent English professor who analyzes every single word of a poem when your common sense tells you that it is the most abhorrent load of crap you can ever read? That is what most of these other reviews are analogous to. A movie with a promising beginning, no matter how somber or bleak it might be, sets the foundations at the right corners. I, a mere foolish mortal, anticipated it to be a gripping tale of crime, thriller, and mystery. With the incessant plot and chronology changes, the film looses it's glitz and becomes lackluster. It doesn't make me question my sanity but off those who really call this movie remarkable. With so many undeveloped plot lines, character development, and continuity crises dismissed as a figment of imagination, it feels like Lynch is kicking the audience in the gut with the boot he and his fellow cabal of esoteric film reviewers call art. Don't get me wrong, I love non-linear films. I absolutely adore genuine masterpieces of the arduous genre like Pulp Fiction, Primer, Triangle etc. What separates this abominable movie from the legends, or even the mediocre is that every minute of the film is essential to build up the climax which assuages our grey matter with adrenaline. If you cut out half of the reel, this movie will still make the exact sense, i.e. no sense at all. My request to anyone who is looking forward to witness this mind-numbing atrocity is to not be deluded by pseudo-intellectual reviews proclaiming how 'brilliant' this kick in the nuts is. They have no real educational qualifications or aptitude and want to feel what being an erudite feels like by joining a small little circle of nincompoop intelligentsia lauding Mulholland Drive as an artistic venture when it really is an eye gouging experience what the viewer has to endure and validate because of social pressure enshrouding it.",Mulholland Drive
1073,CrazyFrog-fan,No Blue Velvet but still a Lynch movie,6,10 January 2006,"Mulholland Drive has a very surreal structure which is the central part of the movie. If you like the surreal narration of David Lynch and aren't too afraid of mediocre acting, you might like this movie, because that's what Mulholland Drive's mystery is all about: Who's who and how are the different situations related.There is something in Mulholland Drive that gives all the madness some kind of logical meaning; but first of all it makes you more distanced from the actions in the movie contrary to Blue Velvet which was surreal, too, but still very serious, near and frightening, since in Mulholland Drive it's all some kind of hazy dream; and second I'm personally not too fond of movies that MUST have some kind of meaning to it. If you hated Videodrome because it was too confusing and it didn't make sense, you might like Mulholland Drive where the craziness make sense and don't pull you too much into the story.Mulholland Drive is definitely a Hollywood movie with Hollywood actors but it tries to move away from the Hollywoodness by having a critical view on Hollywood movie making, but in my opinion Mulholland Drive doesn't succeed in this the way for example Adaptation does; mainly because of Naomi Watts and Laura Harring. The selection of actors has a Lynchian kind of irony to it but in Mulholland Drive it is far too obvious.If you are mostly in to very mainstream movies, Mulholland Drive might be a nice change which still isn't too hard to digest, but if you are mostly in to movies that are a bit more crazy, this might be too mainstream.Mulholland Drive isn't too bad if you take it for what it is: A light version of a David Lynch movie, but personally this movie just makes me like Blue Velvet much more, since it reveals all the mistakes Lynch avoided making in that movie.6/10",Mulholland Drive
1074,patient742617000027,no reason not to like this movie.,10,19 January 2006,"I must start of by saying this was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. First of all, the suspense was really killing throughout the whole movie, and even at times when really nothing much was happening, I was still afraid that somehow it could all turn into a nightmare in less than a second. I must give a lot of credits to the music/sound as well because it did not only influence my own film-making, but It really completed this movie.The acting and directing was superb, I really don't have much to say about it. Lynch was Lynch, only the surrealistic plot seemed less hard to believe than some other films he had made. there's nothing wrong with any of his films, I just thought it would be worth mentioning.I suggest that, when you want to watch this movie, that you pay close attention to ALL details given in this film. from the very first second it begins! I cannot stress that enough. I do not want to give any spoilers because if you only know 1 it would be a hell of a lot less fun to watch. however, if you have seen this movie and still do not get it, just watch it again until you're really sure you can't figure it out by yourself.I can only give away that the outcome of this movie is worth thinking about. Oh, and I'd like to recommend having a high IQ for this film, or watch it with someone with a high IQ. Cause it will help. It won't be crucial, but it will help.Now, I started writing this with a rating of 9 out of 10 stars (9/10) but when I tried to explain why I didn't gave it 10 stars, I couldn't find any possible explanation. So here you have it, 10 stars. Lynch is without a doubt one of the greatest directors of all time. this movie convinced me of that.",Mulholland Drive

Just watch it if you have the chance and make sure you do so with an open mind. Like most of Lynch's films, the plot isn't exactly straight-forward or simple; but that's not to say it's nonsensical or pointless. There's a lot going on, some of which you won't pick up until you've viewed the movie a couple of times. It's also beautiful, maddeningly so. Every scene is incredible to look at, the acting is perfect and the tone of the film is very distinctive.

1076,zip91413,This Movie Is Worth Investigation,10,20 April 2008,"I didn't understand this movie until the third time I saw it and after reading the comments here. I wasn't sure if I liked the movie before I understood it, but now I love it. To me every second of the movie makes sense now and the investigations were worth every minute invested.**SPOILER -- QUICK SYNOPSIS*** There are three sections of the movie: the blonde's dream, her flashbacks (what really happened), and her suicide. There are much better descriptions in this forum; I just want to make mine quick: Dream: In her dream, she flies into Hollywood from Kansas and is quickly discovered by the director. She brushes off the director to go back to the brunette. The brunette is helpless and at her mercy. The director loses his job, all his money, and his wife is sleeping with the pool man. The hit-man is a bumbling idiot. When they break into the apartment in the dream and find a dead blonde on the bed she almost wakes up from her dream (cheap visual effects, holding her head, premonition of her own suicide). Etc...Flashbacks: When she wakes up and finds the blue key on the table, she goes to make some coffee and the flashbacks begin. We learn what really happened: her girlfriend (a successful actress) broke up with her and got engaged to the director. She was still in love with her girlfriend. She hired a hit-man to kill the brunette.Suicide: Then in the last minute of the film she realizes it's over (because the blue key is on the coffee table): the brunette is dead, and she goes to her room and kills herself.***Why This Is One Of My Favorite Movies*** There is so much more to this movie than just the (unconventional) story line.I like how the director in the dream was required to say 'this is the girl' to some bubbly charismatic girl who was doing an okay but not great job lip syncing to that bubble gum pop song. (Did she sleep with the producers to get the part? Or is she related?) But then in Club Silencio, after the M.C. (who also runs the seedy motel) announces several times in several different languages that 'everything is pre-recorded' we are still surprised when the singer passes out behind the mic and her voice carries on. So the bubbly little girl gets the A movie part for whatever reason, and this amazing singer/actress is lip-syncing to a mostly empty theater behind a seedy motel. Great commentary on the movie business (as experienced by David Lynch) and commentary on art in general, and perfect casting of Rebecca Del Rio.I also like how all the scenes that involve the blonde actress in the dream sequence leading up to her 'audition' seem mis-spoken: listen how the landlady describes the kangaroo and listen to how they talk back and forth: the ennunciation and rhythm seem like 'bad acting'. (Or is the woman who plays the landlady just a bad actor? Well, investigate that by looking her name up on IMDb -- hmmm.... this is getting deeper by the minute). This 'bad acting' not only contributes to the 'dream' feeling, it also causes the blonde's audition to really punch you in the stomach when she nails it.I could go on and on... there is so much depth to this movie, in similar ways - not just the image and story, but casting and history and the director's experiences etc...Please don't dismiss the comments from people who love this movie as pretentious, because when you've seen the movie a couple more times after some investigation it will make sense. Once it makes sense, that's just where the fun begins, because then it gets REALLY good. And the more you investigate, the better it gets.The songs I like the first time I hear them usually don't please me for more than five or ten listens, but my FAVORITE songs (just like this movie) keep getting better every time I listen to them (like Tina Turner singing 'Edith and the Kingpin' on Herbie Hancock's latest). But I digress. Thanks for reading this.",Mulholland Drive
1077,leavittstaff,Icons and US myths,10,28 December 2019,"What I love most about this movie is its allusive qualities. MD draws on mid-20th century US culture so brilliantly. The heroine's arrival in LA and her quest to help a ""dark lady"" whose path crosses hers come straight out of a Nancy Drew mystery. (Just as the boy & girl sleuths in Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" come straight out of a Hardy Boys mystery -- that is, until the plot lurches into the seedy, realistic side of US life.) Unless you grew up watching TV westerns during the Eisenhower adminstration, you will not get what Lynch is doing with his Cowboy character -- a Cowboy with a silly, oversized sombrero -- whose friendly warning to the heroine strikes terror into her heart. Also, two fairy tale characters who are icons in western folklore appear in opening scenes, and -- if you know your essential fairy tale plots -- will provide clues to the tragic crime story unfolding before us.",Mulholland Drive

Short on dreamstate atmosphere. Short on ideas. Short on imagination. Who would have thought that from Lynch. And left too many unintentional laughs in to change the mood. All that was left was a slow, overlong letdown. Too much Dune, too little Blue Velvet, resulting in Twin Peaks Goes Hollywood. I was waiting for a giant in a red bowler hat to talk backwards while the fire is licking the drapes...If you're a Lynch fan, and want to get the most of this, you need to be less cynical than I am.

Remember how the moment after the car accident, there is a smoke covered scene? That scene repeats itself towards the very end where the grossly disfigured person walk out from it.Notice how the singing audition and the movie sets are actually of the 50's? This is the hint that the actual event (reality) happened during that time. When the homeless Rita/Camilla picked up the blue box from the dead detective, the box unlock her memory, so the entire movie is actually about the flash back some 50 or 40 years ago.",Mulholland Drive

1082,hauk-2,I must admit that this movie has more than first believed,1,31 May 2002,"After trashing this movie big time I still could not stop thinking about it and I started to regret that I did not pay more attention while watching it. My first impression was that this movie is absolute pointless crap, but after reflecting a bit further and reading Martin Andersons thoughts I must admit that there probably are a story or plot or whatever to call it. Realizing this made the movie a bit more interesting. I do now understand that people are facinated by this movie and even call it the best movie ever made. I still personally think this is a crappy movie by all means. Why conceal a story underneath such a thick LSD cloud? Why deliberately make it so complicated? Why must all the important signs be so tiny? I do not like to do that amount of detective work to get the point of a movie. Besides, even after seeing the ""point"" of the movie I figure it is still not very interesting as a story and I still consider this movie way too long, dull, and surreal in many ways. Even with the ""point revealed"" I still see around 70% of it as pure nonsense. This movie could have been excellent if it was not made so deliberately overcomplicated and to be honest, psyco. And there are way to much symbolism for anybody to chew. An interesting idea destroyed by its lack of sharpness and clarity. I still hate this movie despite the fact that I am tempted to see it one more time now as I think I might know what is going on. That is scary!!! I guess the reason some people love this movie so much is caused by the releif they excperience when they break the riddle. I guess that people solving the riddle totally by themselfes might feel the same satisfaction as others have solving other kind of puzzles. A great puzzle for the fans of those things, but not a great movie. Certainly not what I call quality entertainment. Breaking into the core of this movie is too hard work.

Its much more entertaining when you don't know what to expect and are challenged on the fly.Mullholland Drive never gives you chance to even start a theory of what is going on at any point.  Its a waste of time.  Like another reviewer commented, it appears the director just threw it together in editing and knew that eccentrics would be entertained.",Mulholland Drive
1085,bkuchar,"Somewhere, David Lynch is laughing his head off",9,27 October 2001,"I have to agree with an earlier review that stated that there is nothing here to ""get"", my sentiments exactly. David Lynch has done what no other American film maker has the courage to do, and that is put a dream on to film. Dreams do not unfold logically. In a dream, one minute you're in your house, the next minute you're at work. Sometimes you're yourself, other times it's as though you're watching yourself. ""Silencio"", silence is golden, just shut up and watch the movie, don't try to analyze it logically. It really is structured like a dream; we know that there's a point underneath layers and layers of information, but we can't quite get at it. There are certain facts we know to be true:*SPOILERS*-a filmmaker named Adam has been forced to cast a woman named Camille in his movie-a woman named Diane Selwyn is dead-Naomi Watts' and Laura Herrings' character(s) know each other and were/are lovers*END SPOILERS*Everything else is debatable. Dreams don't have a typical 3 act structure, nor does this. Don't sit there trying to make sense of the dream, just admire the skill with which Lynch has crafted his dream world. Anybody can create a place where, say, dogs talk and the sky is upside down and say ""whoa, this is weird!"" However, Lynch roots his dream world in real life. All of the various ""realities"" we see are perfectly plausible explanations of the truth, and because there is no information that is dismissible, the puzzle becomes richer. This is a great piece of movie making for Lynch fans and for fans of good cinema in general. It's only a head scratcher if you've got an itch, otherwise it's a rather exhilarating, reality bending journey into the sub-concious. Lynch hasn't been this good since season one of ""Twin Peaks"", don't miss out.",Mulholland Drive
1086,matthew.gream,"innovative technique, modern story : excellent!",8,27 January 2002,"Lynch's expose on the failure of Los Angeles only comes to light as his the final parts of his cinemagraphic technique come together. This movie works on many different levels. Firstly, it's style reminds somewhat of Lost Highway, but also Memento : the movie is primarily a mystery, but also a drama and a thriller. He unfolds the puzzle by using symbolism (the old lady who warns of danger within, the homeless ""man""), surreality (dreams), and rearranged-time: it is for the viewer to separate reality from dream, and earlier from later. It's a very innovative technique that extends traditional approaches and brings them into modernity. Secondly, it's about the failure of a girl to make it in the dream world of hollywood (and only at the end do we realise that the first part of the film was not real, it was her dream), and the corruption in hollywood (the power politics behind the creative parts of the film industry) and some of the personalities involved.

Seeing it once could not give the many nuances that Lynch has squeezed into the film.  The film primarily deals with ones own identity, but towards the end will hit many other themes.  The acting is wonderful.  At times you may think that it seems out of place, however this could not be further from the truth.  Everything in this film happens for a reason, and although at times it may seem like something was inserted as a mistake, rest assured, its not. Mulholland ranks with Lynch's best, even topping Blue Velvet and Lost Highway (my two personal favorites.)  If you are a Lynch fan, I don't think I have to tell you to see this film immediately, but even if you are a casual viewer, check it out anyways.

No plot, no logic, not even surrealism, just a cheap attempt by the director to make a meaningful piece of art. Don't waste your money, don't waste your time.

Watts is perfect for the role - - - she contrasts her character's self-perceived bubblegum dream facade with her character's broken-down reality wonderfully. Laura Harring was also equally perfectly cast for her dual roles in the film. Rumor has it that on the way to meet Lynch for the first time, Harring got in a serious car accident.

But no! Things just got weirder. No explanation whatsoever for anything that had happened all throughout the movie.Most characters where actually useless. Let's take the cowboy for example. ""Do right, and you'll see me again one more time. Do wrong and you'll see me again twice."" were his words. However, Did the movie director wind up seeing him again? No. So, where does that lead us?I am not a conservative person and don't mind sexuality and nudity in films. However, the lesbian sex scenes in this movie were pointless.

1094,ricky-nj,Timeless Masterpiece - A must watch,10,22 March 2013,"First things first: This Movie is a must see - Even if you hate it afterwards. The story of Mulholland Drive is built and woven with layers. Each layer when peeled off takes viewers a step closer to the conception of ""truth"" or perceived truth.When watching this movie, one must be very very careful in not judging it at first by simply viewing it at face value, if you do so, you'll be surely disappointed and be scratching your head over what you just witnessed. Every scene, every moment, every act(s) is a consequence of previous act for sure, but also has deeper layers (deeper causes), To describe the layer/deeper causal example in a practical way: if you were driving on the street and suddenly a bank robber stops you and gives you a 100$ note and you gleefully accept his generosity because you are in dire need to do so, is the cause of your glee bank robber giving 100$ bill, or his insidious agenda to take money away from someone and make others happy? or is it simply play of events and its a coincidence and your ""luck"" that caused all of it; Or is it that you drove on the street hoping that perhaps today is the day when someone will come and help you since you are dire need As we can probably make out that there are different sides, different causes of a simple event, how we perceive such events and are affected by it is what makes our reality. Like if we go in even further, what motivates us to act or participate in the event and affect our own reality?Mulholland drive is a that confusing road that leads to nowhere until some agent flushes our misperceptions and takes us to the ""higher truth"" whatever it be using a secret path, and perhaps when all of it plays out, our illusion gets over. To all viewers, I won't talk further in riddles, but there are some important elements you need to consider when you watch this movie:1. Each segment is important, so be careful to watch and let it run through your minds.2. This movie relates and centers around a woman and what goes on in her mind, and beyond the conjured up world. Understand that sometimes thoughts running in mind are hard to describe in their physical sense of meaning so a lot of expression that comes out in the movie maybe hard at first to fathom, but movie is clearly able to distinguish between: correct, incorrect, devoid of thought patterns (blankness)/deep sleep, imaginary(hallucinatory) and memories. Not only that sometimes colorings of thoughts, our state mind (one-pointed, dullness etc.) are very hard to describe in their physical counterparts: movie to some extent is able to put that forward as well.3. Movie centers around how other characters spun out from the woman's mind and how she ""feels"" about those characters (this can be far from truth), characters like betty or Rita or characters like ""the girl"" for example. (No Spoilers for you guys reading this and have come this far).4. Movie can be complete but still incomplete - that is how mind works and there is a limitation on how all things/patterns fit together based on observer and what is being observed and what are the colorings of the thought stream that have been witnessed thus far.5. Movie has some sexual acts that some may find disturbing, but again its mind field, in the world of mind-field anything is possible, we all have fantasies, we all have hallucinations, we all have objects of affections.Many of the elements seem apparent but they really have deeper meaning to them, like ""It is an illusion "" or Silencio at the end. Overall I would say, this movie requires a lot of patience to understand and grasp, if you are looking for pop-corn drama, go watch inception or some other flick that gives you just that, there's a lot of those out there (nothing against those as well, they are fantastic but they are too apparent and too easy to follow). Movie often is like life - it can be as easy as you make it to be, or as hard as you make it out to be Overall a fantastic value for money.",Mulholland Drive

It is very hard to follow and to be perfectly honest, drains you so much, you have to rest your brain cells! I like the camera work and the directing. The story itself is really not worth the effort trying to understand it! I go to the movies to be intertained and I was intertained.

A great number of the negative critics deride the film as incomprehensible but give kudos to the great lesbian sex scenes.I believe comments like these pretty much speak for themselves.  If you think the bodily fluid/beverage scene in ""American Pie"" is the height of sophisticated comedy or you rent a DVD like ""Mulholland Dr"" just because entertainment options are limited in your town and ""what the heck...the box art includes some hot chicks""...then yeah, you're going to be disappointed.

(Sorry to the writer, but, it is!)",5,22 December 2004,"Well, I have to admit, after watching the first half of this movie, I was already formulating in my head the horrible review I was going to give it; I was going to talk about how I like to give off-kilter movies a shot when others call them ""stupid"" or ""horribly-done"" because I can understand how maybe one thing or another wouldn't go right while making a movie, or the filmmakers didn't have the budget to fix something, or, they just didn't have the know-how to make a decent movie, or whatever the case may be.For example, the film ""Smoke Signals,"" which was most likely low-budget, which had a good story and (mostly) decent acting, in spite of distracting parts of the film, like the god-awful wigs some of the characters woreI was prepared to say that I usually give what some would consider ""bad"" movies the benefit of the doubt, but that this was just a horrible movie; first and most obvious, the acting was wretched, and then, the story was all over the place, and lastly, the script was questionable. Of course, it didn't help that I'd read a bad review beforehand, but, even without doing so, I think I would've noticed the sour notes this movie hit.In all honestly, I was almost going to turn the movie off. That's how much I disliked it. But, being the obsessive-compulsive person I am, I had to see the picture in its entirety, so, I hung in there. I was hoping for it get better, wondering where it was going, pondering what on earth the filmmakers were thinking, etc.Well, anyway, I decided I'd try to watch the whole film, and, there was a definite turning point, probably more towards the end than the middle. I can't say whether it was positive or not, but, it was most certainly an improvement from the first portion of the movie, if, in nothing else, at least the acting performances.All in all, some of this movie was intriguing, and did have a few high points (Possible spoiler: I'm not going to lie, the love scene between Naomi Watts and Laura Harring was very erotic.) After it was finished, it probably left me with more questions than answers. Would I recommend it? Only to film buffs who feel the need to see movies for curiosity, or their own satisfaction and education.It is possible that I've completely missed the deeper meaning of this film. I do have to give it credit, though, for taking me on an indescribable journey of confusion, suspense, anticipation, fear, frustration, and disgust (and not always from what you're supposed to be frustrated and disgusted by.) So, if you're looking for an escape - a twisted, tumultuous, nightmarish escape, one which you may never hope to go on again - this is the film to do it with.",Mulholland Drive

1102,mpc1,Incompetence masquerading as profundity.,2,20 October 2002,"If you don't like bad acting, poor editing, ridiculous dialog and unbelievable characters you will hate this movie.  If you like all of the above, that is to say if you are a Lynch fan, then you will love Mulholland Drive.  This is quite possibly the worst film to be rated above an 7.0 on IMDB.Outside of Naomi Watts work, you will be hard pressed to find any competent acting in Mulholland Dr.  The other female lead went to the ""hide your face with your hands when you don't have the chops"" school of acting. Given the script they had to work with it's a wonder all of the actors weren't holding their heads in their hands.Characters wander in and out of the film that do nothing to advance the storyline.  You have a hitman, a mysterious cowboy, an adulterous wife and her cliche'd poolman lover, a mafioso type figure sitting in a darkened room who speaks through an external voice box and a host of others too numerous and tedious to mention.  Suffice it to say that they manage to do little more than fill up screen time.This isn't so bad however in that it distracts the viewer from the fact that the movie has no discernable plot.  You will wait and wait for for all of the loose threads to come together and in the end you will be abysmally disappointed.  The hardest thing for a writer to do is to bring everything together in a believable fashion at the end of a movie in a way that leaves everyone feeling fulfilled.  The easiest thing for a writer to do is to create a lot of odd characters and put them in scenes that are not connected to the movie as a whole and then to take what few coherent threads there are and jumble them up at the end for the sake of surprise.  Guess which way Lynch goes.  SURPRISE!!You know you have a bad script when you have to resort to dream sequences to make any sense out of it.  After all, a dream sequence covers all sins. Dreams don't have to make sense.  Anything can happen in a dream.The editing is similarly disjointed.  Let's just say good editing does not call attention to itself.  Much of the way this film is edited seems to be done for the sole purpose of calling attention to the editing.  ""Look at me... You can see my editing... Aren't I a genius?""  Uh, well... NO!  This movie has all of the earmarks of the worst and most self-indulgent French films.So why is this movie so popular?  My theory is that it is just another sign of the decay of our culture.  Melodies are hard to compose so let's listen to rap.  Plots are hard to follow so let's dispense with them. Pictures are difficult to paint so let's pee in a cup and stick a crucifix in it.  These are the symptoms of our times and Mulholland Drive is just another part of the affliction.",Mulholland Drive
1103,claus_horn,frustrating vagueness,4,7 January 2002,"I like David Lynch's work a lot: I've been fascinated by Eraserhead, shocked by Blue Velvet, and deeply impressed by Wild at Heart. And I enjoyed Twin Peaks years ago. However, I don't know what to do with Mulholland Drive: To me, the structure of the story remains unclear, and there's no solution to the questions it poses. And, for my taste, it takes a minimum of structure to make a film worth seeing it. This kind of vagueness is well known from Twin Peaks. However, being vague was one of the substantial characteristics of the sequel - it was even necessary to keep the story open, thus creating a never ending desire to see more and more of it. But that's not the way movies work... I don't have a problem with open-endedness. But I do have problems with a film which seems to end without any motivation, just as if the director would say something like ""OK folks, this should be enough for this time. Thanks and goodbye."" Besides that, I don't like those comic elements in a film announced as a thriller, such as when director Adam Kesher demolishes the car of the studio bosses just like an angry schoolboy, or the killer who eventually shoots 3 persons dead just because he's too foolish to get his job done properly, or the bodyguard who smashes Kesher's wife's friend first, then the wife. You may find some deconstructing irony in these scenes if you can. I can't. And I don't like trivial imitations like Kesher being designed as a parody of German director Wim Wenders, or the pseudo-diabolic old couple resembling the frightening neighbours from Polanski's Rosemary's Baby. No friends, I'll sit back in my seat and wait for the next Lynch to come. This one was a waste of time for me.",Mulholland Drive
1104,desper,a David Lynch masterpiece!,10,10 January 2002,"And I had thought Lynch was losing his fastball...Mullholland Drive is the best 2001 movie I have seen.
Like a lot of Lynch movies, there are all sorts of loose ends lying around, characters who appear, and look like they may be important, and then vanish. There are a lot of characters like that in Mullholland Drive.
Mullholland Drive deals primarily with two female characters.If you don't want any spoilers, you should stop reading.OK, now I'll assume that you know the basic structure of the movie, that the movie starts with a brunette miraculously surviving a hit on Mullholland Drive and tumbling down the hills into LA, where she wanders with amnesia until she is taken under the wing of an absurdly perky young blonde aspiring actress named Betty.  The two of them have some Nancy Drew-ish adventures aimed at determining the truth of the brunette's identity (she goes by Rita after she saw a movie poster of Rita Hayworth).   These adventures include sneaking into the apartment of a ""Diane Sellwyn"", whom they discover dead, as well as a remarkable audition by the Betty character, in which she transforms herself instantly from a perky Canadian innocent blonde into a sultry, sin-ridden temptress.  At the blink of an eye.  And of course this part of the movie culminates with some fantasy lesbian sex, and a trip to a bizarre late night show ""Silencio"" where the actors appear to be saying things but everything is simply lip-synching.Also, there is a running sub-plot with a director who looks like a possible David Lynch who loses control of his film, is forced by a sinister cowboy and the world's pickiest expresso drinker to film an actress named ""Camilla"" for the lead role in his movie.  Also, his wife cheats on him with the pool guy.Then...after Betty and Rita come back from the Silencio - poof Betty is gone.  And then Rita opens a mysterious box with a mysterious key and disappears, too.At which point the sinister cowboy knocks on the door and says ""wake up"", and suddenly ""Betty"" is Diane Sellwyn, a mousy actress wannabee with half the sex appeal of ""Betty"".  She is having flashbacks to an affair with a woman named Camilla, who is ""Rita"".  Camilla has dumped her for the same Lynchesque director we saw in the first half.  He's practically the only constant from the two parts.  There are a few scenes in which the bitterness of Diane is developed, and then she hires a hit man to take out Camilla. The hit man tells her that, when he's done, he'll leave the key at her apartment.  The movie ends with Diane coming home and finding the key, and being plagued by demons who appear and drive her to suicide, where she dies in exactly the same position that the ""Diane"" corpse was found in the first half.I subscribe somewhat to the ""dream"" interpretation of this movie.  One structure which reviewers have tried to put on this film is that the entire movie is a dream sequence of Diane's, and that the first two-hour sequence is an extended fantasy of her denying her own identity and complicity in the murder of Camilla, including bring Camilla back as a woman in need, and Betty being a perky, yet sultry actress on her way to the top.  The key appears repeatedly to try to bring Diane back to her reality, which finally occurs after the lesbian sex fantasy.  Under this theory, the sequences after Diane wakes up include many flashbacks which Diane is experiencing as a ""waking dream"" as she drives herself to suicide.
I think there is a lot of truth to this: certainly the exagerrated characters in the first part have dreamlike qualities to them.  Betty is essentially Nancy Drew: hopelessly perky, but ready to commit breaking and entering without a second thought.   And throughout there are assorted quick stories which appear and disappear without a trace, the kind of narrative structure which is typical for a dream.  The forces of evil are infinitely powerful and inscrutable, but bizarrely clad as Roy Rogers.  And there is a sequence in which a guy tries to kill somebody, but make it look like a suicide, but runs into a sequence of absurd problems, the kind of thing which also happens a lot in a dream.But there is some lack of fit to this theory.  How is it that Betty and Rita break into Diane's apartment and discover her dead already, if it is Diane's dream?  Is she dreaming her own suicide with pinpoint accuracy?  And also the tail end of the movie includes many dreamlike elements, with Camilla magically appearing on Diane's couch, and tourist demons chasing Diane to her suicide.If you need to fit a narrative structure to the events as an entire entity, probably the dream sequence theory is the best.  But this is a Lynch movie after all.  Think of an Escher drawing: there is no reason that there needs to be a ""real"" up and down to an Escher stairway, but our mind still needs to fit those dimensions to his looping monks.  Similarly, there is so much inter-reference between the two parts of the movie that I am tempted to treat the whole thing as an extended sexual fantasy of the director character, who is himself merely Lynch in disguise.",Mulholland Drive
1105,verkoelen,Dream/Nightmare: A Lynchian view of Hollywood,8,12 February 2002,"Mullholland Drive is an utterly spellbinding experience that leaves one gasping for answers.  From the word go, a colliding miriad of dancing strangers, the viewer is proppelled into a confusing and haunting world. Everything in the movie seeths with danger and it seems as if anything could jump out and bite you. While the movie is at first confronting and confusing,reflection after the fact ( saw this movie two days ago), reveals more and more insight into Lynch's vision of the hollywood dreamworld. Love, sex, violence and humour are all used with skillful moderation.  The one detracting feature is the occasional silliness, it does seem at times to be wierd for wierdness' sake, although for the most part it is a vastly and hauntingly entertaining cinematic experience8/10",Mulholland Drive

1110,lovefromabove,This is so much more than no comprehendo,10,14 April 2002,"I've decided that this is my favorite Lynch film, but it is an aquired taste nonetheless. I saw this film several times when it was in theaters and a couple more since it was released on DVD. I really don't care about the whole thing about the blurring of Laura Herring's private area (David Lynch even admitted he did that on purpose to prevent perverts from exploiting it) or the whole one chapter DVD thing. Mr. Lynch is demanding you to watch the film in its entirety. What's so bad about that? I was actually ANGRY when Lynch got Oscar nominated. Only then would an ununderstanding mainstream actually watch this film, only to gripe about they didn't ""get it."" I would insist that the serious film-watcher not listen to anything those people have to say. I was also very disappointed when I heard that this wasn't going to be a television show since I had loved ""Twin Peaks"" so much, but Lynch is a cinema person. Network television just doesn't deserve his talents. I still hoped he would release the pilot in some fashion. Then I heard he won Best Director at Cannes. I wondered what the lovely was going on. As it turned out, the project turned out to be a surrealist gem! I think most of it makes sense. I've tried explaining what I think the ""meaning"" is, but not many people will listen b/c I guess more people want to pay attention to b.s. like ""Zoolander"" or ""Panic Room."" I've heard every theory from the film is just a masturbation meditation on how modern Hollywood is the destruction of Zen to the whole thing is actually taking place in the 1950's and is the realization of the film that the director is casting. Whatever the ""real"" meaning, I think the whole thing is perfect! The music and cinematography is GORGEOUS and deserves EVERY AWARD in the the book! It is definitely Lynch's sexiest with beautiful locations, occasional Spanish language and lovely female physiques on display everywhere. It certainly surpasses the boredom that ""Lost Highway,"" ""Eraserhead,"" and ""Dune"" conveyed and the love theme is stronger than the ones in ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Wild At Heart."" I'm not quite sure if this is better than ""Elephant Man,"" and ""Straight Story,"" but they don't count since those were TRUE stories. ""Mulholland Dr."" seems to be total surrealism with realistic moral messages involving obsession, unrealistic dreams and mortality. There is a lingering grim sadness floating throughout the narrative, particularly in the second part (probably b/c of how ABC treated Lynch after he delivered the pilot). I'm really not quite sure what to make of that stupid blue key or whatever it is supposed to ""open up,"" and the ending IS just a tad too hokey with the loss-of-innocence and embracing-of-the-abyss metaphors for my tastes. But what the film did for me was open up the possibilities of cinema (independent or mainstream) and suggested that imagination does actually exist and is necessary for survival even in this day and age. Naomi and Laura were really great too, especially in bed (tee hee)! You go Lynch!",Mulholland Drive

Yes, I have to agree that it seems a little cobbled together (TV pilot turned into a feature) but I don't think the ending is as confusing as some reviewers make it out to be.  Once the mysterious union between the two women is symbolically consummated by the Blue Box and Key, the movie jumps forward perhaps several years.  At this point, the names of the lead characters are interchanged with those of some of the incidental characters.  Could the point be that most Hollywood hopefulls end up in one of several roles: waitress, prostitute, or jealous ""nobody"" forever envious of the people who ""made it""?  Does the Man in the Alley represent the dark truths about glamour and vanity?   Do the crazed old people at the end represent Betty's memories of the simple life she left behind coming back to haunt her?  One thing is clear: the innocent and naive Betty is taken advantage of, and has her dreams shattered in a very brutal and bizarre way.  When she falls in love with ""Rita"" she doesn't know who she's falling in love with.  In fact, nothing is what it seems.  Lynch has called it a ""love story in a city of dreams.""

To all of you who dislike the movie, because it makes you feel a numbness, I can assure you it's because you haven't stopped and thought about the movie, if only for 10 minutes.!!!!!!!!!---SPOILERS---!!!!!!!!!!! The first 1½ hour is Diane Selwyn's dream / soon to be dead - thoughts. Every single scene displays her inner demon's, her broken heart and her jealousy! The many excellent cross references between the dream and the real story, is what makes it all so relevant and brilliant. Furthermore David Lynch makes a connection between death and dreams - symbolizing that there is movie to the dreams as there is more than meets the eye. This IS far beyond the very easy to access storyline in Memento, as one mentioned in an earlier comment...Notice in the first part of the movie how Lynch uses the same rooms and buildings in different scenes and as different locations, which makes it clear for us that it's a Dream world.

To give anything away would be a crime other than to say that this started as a TV pilot so we get a bit of explanation of the main characters, or do we? Along the way we are treated to a dwarf mastermind, the mob, lots of phones ringing, a mysterious box, a diner which acts as a vortex to some other reality, a cool movie director, a mysterious corpse, a man having bad dreams, a monster in an alleyway, a grungy hit-man, a fat woman getting shot in the ass, keys, Billy Ray Cyrus, an impossibly happy old couple, unrequited love, jealousy, sex, a mysterious nightclub, Roy Orbison in Spanish, an oracle like cowboy Hollywood archetypes. They're all here and all connected but Lynch doesn't tell us how or why, That's for us to work out. God bless him! This film is definitely a cryptic jigsaw puzzle which will give you a headache trying to figure it out. Just sit back and watch the most original and bizarre talent cinema has given us at full strength. If, on the other hand, Forest Gump is your idea of great cinematic art, stay the hell away. Mulholland drive is not for everybody, but if you like to be challenged, baffled, seduced, stimulated and entertained all at once then go and see it now! You won't see a better film all year.",Mulholland Drive
1120,matt_maggard,worthy of discussion and repeat viewings,10,20 April 2002,"I don't typically post my comments about movies.  I vote and thats usually it.  But with the comments I've been reading for Mulholland Dr., I had to add my 2 cents and fend off the ""its pretentious crap"" comments.Is this movie confusing?  Yes, incredibly so.  With careful examination is there sense to be made from it?  Yes, absolutely so.  You may not agree with the person next to you about what exactly happened but that is OK.  I like the kind of film where I can't stop thinking about it and wanting to discuss it.This movie takes a giant leap in the clarity department on second viewing.  Especially if you have read a little about it or discussed it before re-viewing.  There is a core story there - it just happens that most of it occurs in a dream/fantasy state where visuals may represent more than the obvious.  And to the person that said the Club Silencio scene was unnecessary, wrong.  That is the most pivotal scene in the film because it carries the message that what we are seeing may not be real.  It may feel real and evoke emotion but that does not change the fact that it is not real. This movie is like no other that I can think of.  See it.  More than once.As for my explanation: Betty/Diane never dated Rita/Camilla.  She dated the brunette that lived next door and wished she was dating Rita/Camilla whom she worked with in movies.  She fantasized about her, had her killed, and then dreamed of a new world where they loved each other.I can't give this movie enough praise: 10",Mulholland Drive
1121,Nonzealot,Best Film of 2001,10,8 January 2002,"I was lost in the moment with the lesbian lovers during the Spanish version of ""Crying"" only to have Lynch pull the very rug out from under us that he told us he would five minutes earlier as the stage characters let us know that nothing was real.  What was real in Mulholland Dr.?  I've only seen it once and I am not naive enough to think I have it all figured out.  This is Lynch and there may be less to figure out than we think, but then again sometimes less is more, especially with Lynch.  The important thing is that Mulholland Dr. has tapped into our subconscious like no other film since 2001: A Space Odyssey.",Mulholland Drive
1122,mondrian,amazing.,10,6 January 2002,"There's something brewing just beneath the surface of every scene in Mulholland Drive, and it isn't the usual Lynch weirdness. Sure, that's there in spades; we are treated to scenes of bizarre inexplicable characters doing bizarre inexplicable things again and again. There's the powerful movie mogul who doesn't like his espresso, and so spits it into a napkin, complete with wretching sounds. There's the crazy next-door neighbor, who appears to have an insight that no one else has, calling up remembrances of The Log Lady from Twin Peaks. There's a cowboy who shows up to give a cryptic instruction that never quite pays off, then leaves the film. And there are symbols - a blue box, a key, a phone, a dead body.Those are touches that make this a recognizably Lynchian film, but they are not what make it great. Unlike the flawed stylistic masterpieces Wild at Heart and Blue Velvet, or the impenetrable and infuriating Lost Highway, Lynch has quite a bit more up his sleeve this time. Mulholland Drive, you see, almost makes perfect sense.Well, almost. Everything is in doubt, open to interpretation, and sure to fuel more than a few heated conversations. But something actually happens in Mulholland Drive, something that drives the movie from a to b, even though it doesn't happen in that order.It would be unfair to say what that is, and the movie requires a second viewing to piece it together in any way that (almost) makes sense. But the craft exhibited here, the moral center that the movie has, the carefully thought-out dream logic, easily make this Lynch's best film, and the best film of 2001. For once, we can clearly see Lynch making a movie he loves and wants to say something with, instead of some dismissible piece of trashy modern art. He has finally gone from being a filmmaker who invites comparisons to Bunuel and Godard to being one who earns them.Laura Harring plays the film's voluptuous, nameless heroine. We see an attempt on her life turn suddenly into a car accident, leaving her would-be murderers dead, and her without a memory. She stumbles down a famous hill overlooking Los Angeles, and finds refuge in what she thinks is an abandoned apartment.Young, wide-eyed, and droolingly idealistic Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) steps off of a plane from nowheresville into LAX, and on to her aunt's apartment, where she finds a woman in the shower. The woman says her name is Rita, but in truth, she has gotten the name off of a movie poster for Gilda. Betty sympathizes with Rita's predicament, and sets out, in a manner that more than a little suggests Nancy Drew, to find out who she is.Meanwhile, a hip young director (Justin Theroux) broods over a long conference table, angry that two strange and powerful men have just told him in a non-negotiable way who to cast in his next film. He goes outside and smashes the men's car. Then he drives home, only to find his wife in bed with the pool man (Billy Ray Cyrus, in a hilariously understated performance). He does what any man would do. He gets his wife's jewelry box, and fills it with paint.But back to Rita and Betty. Rita, it seems, has a great deal of cash in her purse, along with a strange blue metal box for which there is no key. She finds a phone number, and calls what might be her own home. Someone named Diane Selwyn answers. Or is that just a name she got off of a waitress's nametag?If all this sounds like bad, hokey noir, it is and it isn't. One of the film's pleasures is the way it plays with familiar film devices (the amnesia, the cash, the `mystery') and eventually turns them into something far more nightmarish.To tell more would be to spoil the movie's surprises, but without giving away too much, two-thirds in, the film and its whole logic are turned on its head. Betty becomes someone else, Rita becomes someone with a name, the director turns out to know them both, and it's all somehow tied together by a `cowboy' with a truly silly getup and a menacing look about him. Lynch even finds time for the fleshiest sex seen ever to see the inside of a multiplex.The movie's theme is Hollywood itself. Lynch has, in effect, made his version of The Player, thumbing his nose at the very establishment that releases his work. It's not The Player, though, not by a long shot. Lynch would never dare to make a movie that is anything less than completely weird.In the end, we are left comparing the Betty we saw step off the plane at the beginning of the film, full of wonder and hope, and the `Betty' we see at the end of the film, completely broken. In between is Hollywood, Lynch is saying, that comic mish-mash of broken dreams and over-realized ones, poverty and affluence, bad actors and good ones.For Lynch to take on the town that has for so long ignored and hated him, in his own style, with his own perfect movie, is the kind of `auteur director makes good' story that the Independent Film Channel loves to trump-up. It may not be exactly true in Lynch's case, because he has made some pretty bad movies, worthy of derision. But he has never made an inept or stupid movie, and to see Mulholland Drive is to realize why this is. Trashy, he may be, but he's sure as hell an artist.",Mulholland Drive
1123,joe012_,See this film!,10,8 January 2002,"This is probably the best work David Lynch will ever make, all of his typical themes combine with a great story to make a funny, scary, and moving film.  The acting by the two female leads is also excellent and I was absorbed into the film by its rich atmosphere However the film may confuse some, as the twist which explains the film is subtle in its shown but once you understand what it is the film is very rewarding.",Mulholland Drive

1125,jimjoeo,Surprisingly funny,9,21 January 2002,"*********************This review contains spoilers********************** Definitely a film that needs to be viewed more than once in order to fully appreciate its many layers. Probably the lightest of all Lynch's films, Mulholland Drive is surprisingly funny, though of course it also contains the trademark nightmare-inducing sequences that you would expect. The funniest scenes include a robbery where the body count spirals out of control and the sequence where the film director (Justin Theroux, Louis' cousin) finds his wife in bed with the pool guy (played by Billy Ray Cyrus!). The best theory I've read to try and explain the shifts in identity and location would be that the majority of the film is a dream by a failed would-be actress who came to L.A. with hopes of being 'discovered' and that only at the end of the film does she wake up. This theory would also help to explain some of the strange acting at the beginning of the film. Watts, a relative unknown , carries the film admirably. Some of the film suffers slightly by characters being introduced never to appear again, an unfortunate hangover of the film's origins as a pilot for a TV series. If the pilot material was written before Lynch made 'The Straight Story': which represented a major shift in tone, it is interesting to consider what he will do next: will he return to non-typical material like 'The Straight Story' or will he continue in the manner to which we have become accustomed.",Mulholland Drive
1126,veronica1761,A masterpiece,10,7 January 2013,"it really cant get better than this . lynch is a genius , his brain and his soul and his level of being an artist is beyond a genius.i give this movie a 100 out of 10 , i can watch it over and over again and each time it will effect me strongly , who ever says this movie is crap clearly doesn't understand it , not everyone has the intelligence to understand lynch and his dark complex world. i wish there were more films like this being made instead of the typical Hollywood movies. the acting is also great in this movie. Watts is amazing . the music as all of lynch;s movies is extremely touching and beautiful. people that are seekers for deep concepts of life and are interested in the human condition are going to like this movie. the club silensio scene is one of my Favorite scene in the movie , and blue haired lady and the cowboy are my Favorite characters. there is so much depth and mystery in this movie . this movie takes you to a journey and you need to go within yourself as a human to be able to relate to it .",Mulholland Drive
1127,afro-don,Lynch's best movie... the worst movie I've ever seen,2,6 December 2007,"This movie is just plain bad. And before you Lynch disciples start lynching me for not being intelligent enough to join your supercilious horde, let me say that I DID GET IT. How could anyone not? It's painfully juvenile. It's obvious and predictable. And it is about as philosophical as a bowl of puke.I don't mean this as an insult; I genuinely mean it: this movie is for people who are 5% smarter than the average action-flick-junkies but not quite smart enough to swallow Kurosawa. In other words, this film is for the bourgeoisie of cinemaphiles. You guys should pat yourselves on the back because at least you're not wasting your time on Cronenburg (or are you? heh heh). But don't get too cocky. At least not until you're old enough to drive. Hope this review didn't make you cry.",Mulholland Drive

A lot of people say this movie makes you think, Which is true, I was thinking the whole time, Why did i buy this lousy movie. This movie is compared to memento ( as is it makes you think ) Well this movie is nowhere close to memento in my opinion. This movie has such an unrealistic feel to it that you cant figure out, but then again it was so lousy that i didn't want to even try to figure out.None of it made any sense, a lot of unanswered questions..........like where did all that money come from? Never answered, Who was the guy that was in the diner who had the dream? Never answered, i cant figure out why he was even in the movie.Anyone that wants to attempt to explain this movie to me, please feel free to email me at fligh3@aol.com and put mulholland dr in the subject heading so i don't delete your email and give it your best attempt",Mulholland Drive

1130,SpitzGirl,Without redeeming features,1,3 February 2002,"'Mulholland Drive' was probably the worst experience I have ever had in a cinema.  Somehow, it manages to be both overwhelmingly irritating and totally boring at the same time.  Utterly pointless, contrived and without any form of conclusion; recycling exactly the same elements that David Lynch productions have contained for the last 20 years.  Even the music is in the same vein as Twin Peaks - just not as memorable.",Mulholland Drive
1131,Whyyes,A sheer piece of crap,1,11 February 2002,"This is quite possibly one of the worst films that I have ever seen.  Don't get me wrong; I didn't go into the movie thinking that it was going to be something easy to watch.  Also, don't think that I'm some simpleminded ""True Lies""-watching moviegoer who has no appreciation for the art of cinematography.  I've watched and appreciated many of the greats: ""Citizen Kane"", ""The French Connection"", ""Blue Velvet"", etc. just to name a few.  I just can not believe what moviegoers let David Lynch get away with these days.  He can make completely nonsensical drivel and people automatically assume that it is ""art.""  I must say that this movie was well filmed and stylistically quite beautiful.  Purely from a cinematography perspective, this movie is great (take, for example, the filtration on many of the lights in the movie and the completely blown-out backgrounds to create a dream-like effect).  However, the lack of a plot towards the end (which makes the movie completely boring) and the voyeuristic, testosterone-driven lesbian scenes make this movie almost unwatchable.  These scenes were so long and drawn out that I couldn't help from laughing; not because lesbian scenes make me uncomfortable, but because it was such thinly disguised softcore porn and yet people believed they should take it  seriously!  I have a hard time believing that people can fall into David Lynch's ever-so-predictable trap of making something completely weird but yet unbearably boring and still end up thinking that the movie has some sort of meaning or value.  Yet, I must excuse myself.  I'll admit, this is purely a rant, but I can't believe I paid money to see this trash.",Mulholland Drive
1132,insan,In Mulholland Dr. it all comes together,10,23 February 2002,"I'm not a devoted David Lynch fan; some of his stuff is really good but I find myself less enthusiastic about other projects. In Mulholland Dr, however, all aspects of his previous work blend into a compelling unity. This movie is fun, bizarre, tragic, sexy, demanding, symbolic, intelligent; I could go on. This movie is the work of a true genius. If you've ever seen a David Lynch movie before and found it remotely interesting, this is one you can't miss out on. Personally I regard this to be one of the very best movies of the last few years.",Mulholland Drive
1133,Tiesemans,An absolute mindscrew kinda movie,9,28 July 2007,I must say ... This movie is an absolute mindscrew film. I couldn't leave my eyes of the screen for a single minute. It's like you get fired at with super glue. So if you need a dose of mind screwing suspense go watch this film !! Anyways I love it ! The humor is of high quality. The acting is also very good. I won't mention a specific character in the movie but you sure come to really like or dislike them. Especially one that really comes across as being dumb even do the actor is known as being really smart. Again worth every minute of my time !

1134,cagarcia013,Mulholland Dr. (the truth),10,27 October 2012,"The truth behind the meaning of a film is, simply, to watch it. David Lynch is a genius in the realm of filmmaking. Mulholland Dr, for what it is, may be considered a masterpiece, a piece of crap or just a regular film. But in all honesty, it is what you make it. Lynch is a man that isn't going to give you a simple explanation to a film's meaning, he wants you to decide that for yourself. Because in almost all of David Lynch's films he not only writes, but directs plots and situations that give the viewer a sense of confusion. A sense that not everything is meant to be understood. And he is good at it.A film is something of an abstraction. A puzzle that is made broken to be solved, not by the director, but by the viewer(s). David Lynch makes the kind of film that you can watch over a million times, only to find hidden clues that you didn't see the first million times that can chronologically, and inevitably change your insight of the films purpose. I have seen ""Mulholland Dr."" over and over, and I can for one say the film could be about one of many things. David Lynch is a man who doesn't believe in telling people what the his films mean to him, because thats just his opinion out of another six billion. A film is meant to be strange, obscure, and even abstract to the viewers. Because if a film was to give one and only one purpose of meaning to the minds of everyone's imagination, there would be no diversity. No mystery. and that's what ""Mulholland Dr."" is. A mystery.",Mulholland Drive

The scenes with Betty and Rita are Diane's dream from which we wakes up after returning home from 3 weeks of depression after Camilla dumping her for Ray Kessler and her new lesbian lover. Camilla is dead and killed by the hit man she hired as indicated by the blue key she finds in her room. Diane is tormented by what she has done and ends up killing herself which eerily matches the scene in her dream. The love scenes are very intense and realistic.The key to unravelly this cinematic masterpiece is the waitress's nameplate.If you are a David Lynch fan, it's quite a ride.",Mulholland Drive
1136,gwyneth_65,Mulholland Drive is David Lynch's masterpiece,10,14 March 2002,"********** SPOILER ALERT *********In real life, Mulholland Drive is a circuitous road that glides atop the beautiful Hollywood Hills. By day, the road provides some of the most astonishing views of Los Angeles. By night, however, the road can be one of the most hazardous imaginable. One moment you can be riding along with ease, the next moment, you can be caught in a blind curve. The film is a lot like the road itself. It has moments of rare beauty--images that haunt you for days after you leave the theatre. And it has images so shattering that you wish you could forget them, but you can't.Naomi Watts plays the dual role of Betty Elms/Diane Selwyn in the film, a neo-noir with a biting edge.The first portion of the film focuses on the dream-like ideal experiences of Betty, a young, beautiful ingenue. (It is only later that we discover Betty is a projection, the dream-self of the destitute failed actress Diane Selwyn.) In her dream, Betty arrives fresh from Deep River, Ontario to stay at her aunt's beautiful Hollywood apartment. An aspiring actress, Betty finds herself caught up in a mystery when a gorgeous and sultry amnesiac (played by Latin beauty Laura Elena Harring) who has narrowly escaped death, finds her way into her aunt's apartment. Betty asks the beautiful stranger her name. Not knowing the answer, she sees a movie poster for ""Gilda,"" starring Rita Hayworth, and decides to call herself ""Rita."" (The irony here is that in more ways than one, the amnesiac ""Rita"" becomes a kind of ""Gilda"" femme fatale figure who ultimately torments and betrays ""Betty."") Betty, wanting only to help Rita, gladly takes her in and the two women set out to find Rita's ""true"" identity.At the center of the film is the slowly evolving relationship between the two women. The relationship (as it is initially portrayed in the dream sequence of the film) is one in which both women fall madly in love with one another. And, the apex of the story occurs when they make passionate love in what is surely one of the most gorgeous love scenes ever filmed.After they make love, the narrative focus shifts and we are introduced to Betty's doppelganger, Diane Selwyn. With the narrative shift, we realize that the first portion of the film is Diane's dream, a dream in which she recalls herself as she once may have been....an aspiring screen hopeful with stars in her eyes...a romanticist who believed she could find love and succeed, but who in reality is now a lonely,  tormented and fading ""B"" actress whose ship never sailed. The stark reality of Diane's story is that she did indeed sleep with beautiful ""Rita,"" (who in reality is named ""Camilla."") She slept with her in order to get help with landing roles, but she fell in love with her along the way. However, in true femme fatale form, we see that Camilla not only does not help her, but simply uses her for sex, drops her, and marries the director who rejected Diane for the role that could have been her big ""break."" Diane is devastated, and in her crisis of identity, she cries out for a reality that might justify her lost dreams.Ultimately, the film is hauntingly beautiful. It takes us on a ride through the land of dreams and shows us, like Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard,"" the dark underbelly of Hollywood....a place haunted by the shattered dreams of once-hopeful young would-be stars. As Wilder's classic noir and Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" show, for every star that is on the walk of fame, there are a million others that never make it.In a year almost devoid of eroticism or even mystery, this movie echoes back to a time when filmmakers were unashamed to show the power and the beauty of physical attraction and the mysterious dualities of love/hate, passion/power, rejection/acceptance. The eroticism of the film is both innocent and highly-charged. Not since the lost days of cinematic sexuality echoed throughout the 1980s in films like ""Body Heat,"" ""Damage,"" ""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" has a film generated this much heat.The film is subtle and unique in its interpretation of identity and love. In terms of originality, it surpasses any other film in 2001. Watts' performance as both hopeful ingenue and jaded Hollywood ""B"" actress is in a word, phenomenal. She is able to move seamlessly between the polar opposites of character that are required in this complex, bifarcated role.",Mulholland Drive
1137,EvilMikey,A masterpiece of cinema. No film has blown me away like this for years.,10,24 August 2007,"Part Fellini's 8 1/2 part Bergman's Persona, the key to Mulholland Dr. is to imagine that you're dreaming. In your dream, you're with a good friend, but there's something different about them. You're in a house that's strangely familiar, but you're certain you've never been there before. Your friend leads you down a dark hallway and you follow. Something in your gut tightens. You stop and call out your friend's name, but you realize that you're alone. You can't breathe. You can see the light at the end of the hallway, a soft glow, and you know that something wonderful or terrifying (or both) is waiting for you just around the corner.That kind of uneasy excitement is what I felt throughout the entire running time of Mulholland Drive, which may be the best film David Lynch has ever made. Sure, Lost Highway captured the bleak, nonsensical feel of a nightmare lost in a huge, windy world, but Mulholland Drive reaches another level entirely, playing on the emotions with a ruthless precision that's absolutely stunning and makes you even go to extreme lengths to question your own sanity...a film that can achieve this deserves all the praise it gets.The film is centered around naïve, overly ambitious blonde named Betty (Naomi Watts) arrives in Los Angeles with dreams of becoming an actress. As Betty is settling in at her absent aunt's apartment, she walks in on a woman taking a shower who calls herself Rita. Rita was in a tragic car accident the night before (on Mulholland Drive) and she can't remember who she is or anything about herself. Betty takes a liking to Rita and offers to help her unravel the mystery. While Rita and Betty are embarking on Nancy Drew-style adventures of self-discovery, a film director (Justin Theroux) is ordered to cast a specific actress in his new movie (or else) by a cryptic cowboy who doesn't like smart alecks.Sounds simple? Well no. It certainly ain't, keep in mind, this is a David Lynch movie. In the last half of the film, a transformation process happens and everything is messed up. Nothing is clear, and every scene seems like assorted pieces to a puzzle that has been dropped all over the place. And that is what is so amazing; Mulholland is intriguing and will not fade on multiple viewings like many films of its kind. It becomes a completely different experience/interpretation every time.This is a movie that makes cinema feel exciting again. It takes you so deep into its world that it ceases being a movie and becomes an experience. It keeps you on edge, laughing in morbid delight at one moment, then recoiling in fear the next. Consider, for instance, the hilarious sequence in which a hit man's simple hit goes terribly awry, one little mistake starting a domino effect that causes things to go from bad to worse as he realizes that this just isn't his day. It is like being on a thrill ride, a roller coaster that has many different aspects, many different turns that evoke a new feeling each time.Mulholland Dr. is clearly going to go down as a cinematic masterpiece. It has become famous for its plot, and perhaps more so for its lesbian sex scene between Watts and Harring than has been discussed countless times. But there is more too it. Just go ahead and watch it, twice and then again. You wont be watching the same film all three times, I guarantee it.GRADE: A+",Mulholland Drive

I also think Lynch is one of the greatest directors of our time, so if you haven't seen it then I recommend you see one of the best films ever made.Complex, dark, sensual, sad....vivid mindfuckery at its best. The acting is top notch, the cinematography and direction perfect...I don't think its possible to capture the essence of a dream (or nightmare perhaps in this case) better...Lynch is a master of the subconscious, and though it might take you a while to work out exactly what happened in this film (unless of course you read the plot spoilers here on IMDb) its well worth it.",Mulholland Drive

I feel this is a film that needs to be interperated by each individual viewer. The acting and photography were wonderful. I really didn't care about the plot twists and symbolism since the film was so emotionally resilliant that I really felt for the girl and what she went through during at that party, whether it be because of sexual molestation, jealousy, a setup or whatever. David Lynch makes everything seem heartbreaking, and that's just not an easy thing to do. Though this is not a film for mainstream viewers (DAMN that Oscar nomination-the source of all of these undeserving bad reviews) David Lynch has reassured my faith in modern day filmmaking and I will watch whatever he creates next, even if it is another failed television show pilot. He just rocks my world, and that's a good thing for me!",Mulholland Drive
1145,James Cole,This movie really makes you think!!,10,9 July 2002,"The first thing I think after seeing Mulholland Drive: ¡...! I couldn't think at all!! My head was so full of ideas, theories... Even when final credits ended, I couldn't move out of the room.Walking back to my house I didn't see nothing, my brain was too busy yet. What is the cause of all those things I felt?: That wonderful, surprising movie, that masterpiece of cinema.Mulholland Drive has a good screenplay (not good, EXCELLENT!!), an excellent actors (all of them, but most Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring) and director, an enigmatic original score... Well, every element of this movie is made in a perfect way and put in the perfect place, and these things all together give the movie an hypnotic (sometimes horrorful) ambient.There are a lot of theories about this movie, to make you an idea about this: a friend tell me that she didn't see as an important thing for the movie the relation between that two characters (I don't want to reveal anything, you know), and for me is a very important thing. Don't give up when you don't understand something, think a lot, it's a pleasure!!I think Mulholland Drive is not one of the bests' of this year, I think it's on of the bests movies of all time.SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A DISTURBING AND DAZZLING TIME",Mulholland Drive
1146,franlaux,Atrocious,1,14 July 2002,"If I could have given this movie a '0' rating, I would have.  I have better things to do than to watch a movie replete with bad acting and with a ""plot"" that goes nowhere.  This isn't art.  This is pulling the wool over the eyes of those who want to be considered ""arty"".",Mulholland Drive
1147,jfahey-1,David Lynch Lame Again.,2,26 July 2002,"The hot lesbians are the only redeeming quality about this underdeveloped, wannabe artsy and mysterious, intentionally confusing and misleading, dark, poorly acted, waste of time. It took me a while to understand it and when I finally did........I didn't care.  Mulholland Dr. as most of his other films fail to tell a coherent compelling story.",Mulholland Drive
1148,red_october,A movie for all and none,10,27 July 2002,"Mulholland Drive has already become one of Lynch's masterpieces, unfortunately many people see this movie as outstanding simply due to its mysterious nature.I agree with David Lynch's statement that all his movie have different interpretations for different individuals, however I still shake my head every time I hear somebody new ""discover"" this movie and praise the talent of the director. A common phrase is quite often heard: ""I didn't get this movie, but it was so awesome!""A great film, regardless of its gaining popularity among the mainstream crowd.",Mulholland Drive
1149,The_Plague,This film is NOT like a dream...,1,29 July 2002,"... because dreams are filled up with symbols which uncertainly indicate desires and anguishes, and it's contexts aren't clear, nor linear. This movie is actually based on a straight-forward, symbolism-free story that tricks you with the idea it's a dream by adding mysterious characters doing things you can only guess how and why, but indepedently of their reasons you can clearly understand their intentions, and by adding multi-explainable plot twists that all in all lead to nowhere.So it's basically a film that acts like mindless suspense and soap opera at times. MY OPINION ABOUT THAT: I hate both genres, and find the represented situations in this turd unoriginal and uninteresting, so watching it soon got boring. Since it lasted two and half hours, it was quite a pain. Nevertheless I enjoyed the sex scenes.It can be enjoyed by people who like the genres I listed above plus mindless guessing on what's happening. The photography and direction are great, the plot is awful and the ""Dream-like movie"" idea behind it turns out a total disaster, just like the overall quality of this one. I give it 2/10.",Mulholland Drive
1150,JoenJelsted,Lynch on point,10,9 August 2002,"Speaking of Mulholland drive, I think it's not the best of his films, but that doesn't mean that it is bad. Alot of the critics in this forum, are very vocal about how bad ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""Dune"" is, I don't agree. I think the message is very clear in Mulholland, but how you interpret it, is very dubious. Because how do you interpret a dream! this is important in allmost all of the films David Lynch has made, except ""Dune"" and ""Straight Story"" Mulholland Drive is alot like Lost Highway, suddenly the story twist when Rita opens the box, like when Bill Pullman, awakes as a boy in prison. this is apart of the Dream/reality, Dream/Dream or just reality. but it has something to do with the duality of mankind. for eksample O.J. Simpson the, moviestar, football player, the killer and so on. Samething with people wh o abuse their kids, they are quite often normal people with jobs, house, dogs, cats, good neighbours and care about the environment. But along with the good, is a parallel evil and absurdity. This theme is often used i Lynch films. a good example is Twin Peaks. this little town of nice people, with alot of dirty thoughts and secrets. ""The owls are not what the seem"" Not even Dale Cooper is uncorrupted, because for Lynch it is alot about the Body and Mind. Dale Cooper is not what he seems. Bob says ""Leland has been a good vehicle and I enjoyed the ride. But now he's weak."" ""Leland is a babe in the woodswith a large hole where his conscience used to be."" and Bob later says to Cooper ""I have this thing for knives. It's like what happened to you at Pittsburgh that time."" So Cooper's conscience is not clean, it has a crack, and in the end Bob uses the crack to invade and corrupt Cooper.
But about Mulholland Drive I don't quite know how to interpret it yet. but like Dale Cooper says.""Gentlemen, when two seperate events occur simultaneously pertaining to the same objekt of enquiry, you must always pay strict attention.""
So watch Mulholland drive and enjoy.",Mulholland Drive
1151,loriana,awful,1,19 August 2002,"Although it had its moments I thought this movie was truly awful and quite boring. It is one of those movies who seems to think that by being totally impossible to understand the audience will automatically lable it as ""deep"" and raise it to the skies. Well I don't.

It is a very complex piece which ¾ the way through suddenly changes direction from being fairly straight forward and the first time I saw it I was a little confused. The Musical Score is fantastic and the Cast is also Brilliant.This Movie fully deserves 10/10.",Mulholland Drive
1153,manuhuiabond,This film is rubbish even when you can understand the story.Plot Spoilers!!!,2,7 October 2002,"Most of the comments on this movie are positive so I thought I would try and redress the balance. I came out of this movie wondering what was going on. I now know and still consider it to be a poor movie. I intially discounted a dream sequence as that seemed too obvious. I was glad that I had a free ticket to the movie or I would have asked for my money back. Movie reviewers and critics love this movie, which only confirms to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy a film. The 8+ rating this movie has is so misleading. In 20 years time this film will not compare to true greats such as The Godfather. The film does have fine performances from both the leads but that isn't enough to save the film. (nor are the lesbian scenes!)",Mulholland Drive
1154,super__unknown,"I'm fairly new to Lynch, and i was incredibly pleased with this effort",10,29 October 2002,"When i heard about this film i wasn't sure i would enjoy. I thought it would be pretentious and weird, and although it may be both of these things it still had me hooked.Lynch is clearly a very talented director. Mulholland Dr. is an incredibly atmospheric, tense film and at times extremely moving. I've heard the film being describes as esoteric, which is true to a certain extent, but it was only the second Lynch film i saw (the first being Dune) and i adored it.The ambiguity of the film may be a bit too much for some viewers, but i certainly enjoyed trying to figure it all out (and only getting parts of it).To me the inconsistencies thoughout the film reflect the mixed up views people have about life in Hollywood. This theme also seems to be shown in betty's attitude when she first arrives in L.A.Mulholland Dr. is certainly an experience. Lynch excells in creating a moody, atmospheric movie that seems to stay with you for a long time after the initial viewing. But the ambiguous nature of the film along with it's non-linear structure might put some people off.",Mulholland Drive
1155,Tyra_T,If you like Lifetime Movies and Danielle Steele...,1,23 October 2002,"Most directors have a gimmick (or a 'hook') and David Lynch in the past (""The Elephant Man"", ""Twin Peaks"", ""Blue Velvet"" etc...) always had the ability to manipulate an audiences emotions - to take them down a road less travelled and freak everybody out...But with ""Mulholland Drive"" he fails with his own gimmick - he can't make it work, instead he gives us his drug induced fantasies.He introduces two female characters one blonde, one brunette ala ""Diabolique"" who team up to solve the mystery of the brunette's identity. (She was in a car accident and has amnesia)...I know, I know this already sounds like a plot for a Lifetime movie - but it gets worse.  Soon, they're best friends, daring each other to dealve further and further into danger. I won't give away the end - but it's fairly predictable if you know Lynch's work.  Anyway, the end really isn't the point - it's this long meandering path, like Mulholland Drive itself twisting and turning - - and very, very boring.The acting is horrible, the two leads compete for camera time, while Lynch plays dress up - - showing them off in Hitchcockian wardrobe to impress those few people who've never seen ""Vertigo"" or ""North by Northwest"". They both give wide eyes, coy looks and constant sexual intensity - even while looking at a dead body... sometimes they cry - but only in the ""hottest"" way, snuggling up close to each other while one tear falls down a cheek....so trashy.The third lead is a ""director"" (apparently Lynch himself) who basically has a bad day and goes home to find his wife sleeping with the pool man. Wow! That's original, huh?!  (sarcastic).  Again, the movie borrows from the untapped cache of Danielle Steele and Lifetime movies of the week.  Gold! What a diamond mine! (sarcastic).In conclusion, I can't believe I watched the whole thing.  I was waiting for something Blue (as is his trademark) - - and finally came the Blue Key and Blue Box...uh...so what?  Oh ya, there was also the girl with the Blue Hair at the ""Silencio Club""  The second I saw her I knew she would say ""Silencio"" and she finally did...yay.The only people who will like this film are men who want to watch a little girl-on-girl-action with their wife beside them so snuggle up to them and say ""SEE?!!! It's art!"".",Mulholland Drive

1157,slanerush,The Hard Truth: I did not like this movie,5,12 November 2008,"David Lynch is on of those film directors that you can't help but to hear about in film school or in any circle of movie buffs but though I have tried to find all the fantastic qualities that my friends and classmates find in this film, it is something that I just can't see for myself. That is why I have to say: I DO NOT LIKE THIS FILM. Strangely and maybe speaking to the greatness of this filmmaker I do not like this film for all my usual reason. For one, the movie IS unique and imaginative. I can see in the film that the David Lynch was trying to say something and not just please the masses; finally the acting and cinematography were suburb, but in the end I was left exhausted. Mulholland Dr. sets its self up just like any mystery film and this engages the typical viewer to try and solve that mystery. But in the last 30 minutes (when the movie starts to fall apart for me) I'm still looking for answers while David Lynch has gone on to something that is just beyond my rational mind. I've been told that I'm not innocent enough when I watch David Lynch films and maybe that's true, but when I compare Mulholland Dr. to The Straight Story (the only David Lynch film I've ever loved) I tend to believe that David Lynch is still experimenting with the way he tells stories on film and being a true artiest cares little for what he losses in the wake of his creation.",Mulholland Drive
1158,Denzer,A dream set to film,10,1 November 2002,"Lynch's best film ever. More of a dream than a movie, with all the strange twists and turns of a dream.

Beautifully shot and acted, a true masterpiece from David Lynch.",Mulholland Drive
1159,killinsomnia,"""Hey, pretty girl-time to wake up.""",9,2 November 2002,"The reason why I think Mulholland Drive is so great is because I think the dream sequence is dead on accurate.

1160,FifthHorseman,As bad as Twin Peaks became.,4,9 November 2002,"Great performances, beautiful cinematography, and a competent score. These things are a given in Lynch films, and almost make them all worth seeing.
Almost.  When it's clear that he's been wrestling with his ideas, found a way to make it all make sense to himself, then put it out here in meatspace thinking ""...somebody will get it.  If the rest of them have to debate, whatever..."" then it's not worth the pain.  Or the paying.After a promising ninety minutes or so, this movie devolves into the abstruse garbage that Twin Peaks became.  You start expecting to see flaming dwarves on unicycles drifting in slow motion through the air.  The movie was probably big in France.  Of course, reviewers here would say ""The flaming dwarves represent the fiery end to all of Diane's early beliefs about Hollywood, which she had previously thought was very magnificent, towering and un-dwarflike.""Kudos to the cast and crew, and shame on Mr. Lynch for separating me from my five dollars and fifty-six cents to rent this thing.

1162,goodnightandgoodluckyou,"I fell in love with this movie and the master behind it, David Lynch.",10,19 July 2010,"I'm used to seeing different movies. I have prior to this never seen a David Lynch movie though I've heard quite a bit about Blue Velvet and Mullholland Drive for sure. I rented Mullholland Drive because of Naomi Watts, an actress I admire greatly. The first time I watched the movie, it played as a straight up tale of an aspiring actress mostly, if jumbled and what I thought was blah oddball blah /messy at times. Like I say I have never watched a Lynch movie before. Since I had the movie on rental I decided to make the most of it and give it another go. I have now become obsessed with it. You see I went along with the movie, I went with the flow.At the moment I am in love with Betty's storyline but the movie has a lot more going on. It will take me time and a re watch, oh what a hard life, of Adam's (played by Justin Theroux) interactions with the producers and with The Cowboy. I also still don't have a clue about the two dudes laughing one minute in an office, and quite a different story the next. And much has been made of the kiss scene. To me, it's not that big a deal, I would say more sad than titillating, and even though I enjoy titillating, it's not the thing that sticks in my mind about Mullholland Drive. Sad that people talk about that over a brutal shooting in a movie.I had read some time ago the different interpretations of Mullholland Drive. The movie is haunting not because of the interpretations but because of the Winkies diner scene and the ending. And now, I see something else that gives me creeps in such a way I fell in love with Naomi Watts for being able to convey something through one look, the power of mental strength. Wanting something so bad. I will say no more! I don't know if I follow the interpretations religiously but I do know that I am grateful for putting in a DVD in that requires all of me to pay attention. A movie has been made that isn't mindless entertainment or lazy in any way. I LOVE David Lynch for truly creating something and for introducing me to a world of a movie that is so different to the ones I know and love. I'm a lay person when it comes to all things ""Lynchian."" I can't define yet what Lynch does that makes him different to the other greats, directors like Peter Weir, Antoine Fuqua, but if you know their work you can understand what I mean.After I watched the movie for the second time, I got the strangest dreams. What's real? I read a criticism of Lynch's work, that if his characters had any soul he wouldn't have to create oddball or quirky. I had been watching movies before Mullholland Drive all about the souls and characters, I am now thinking there is more so called quirk and odd ball in this world than deep, meaningful events, our ideas are deep and meaningful but strange, strange things happen and whilst Mullholland Drive is not quite just about strange things happening, it's a movie that you give your own meaning to. If you need to do that.This movie inspires me. I want to see all of David Lynch's work and I can't get the song, I Have Told Every Star out of my head. ""A poisonous ode to Hollywood."" I like that but it's not the be all and end all statement for this beautiful, intelligent and mysterious movie. A class above.",Mulholland Drive
1163,lr774,"Mulholland Dr. is about lots of things, including...",10,14 December 2002,"I think that a major theme of the film is about discovering things and then having to deal with these discoveries. Perhaps it's to do with dreaming, I don't know, but Betty initially comes across as an innocent, who stumbles upon mysterious things. Her eyes widen in wonder when she arrives in LA, and she can't believe her Aunt Ruth's place; but then... who's that in the shower? A stranger? Why is she here?What about Diane Selwyn and the body in the house? The scene in which Betty and Rita find the corpse is filmed so slowly, so carefully: Lynch must really have enjoyed shooting this scene.The scene in the theatre when it is revealed that the singer is miming: This has a shattering impact on the two women.It's not just Betty and Rita who discover things: Angelo Badalamenti's character is sweaty with anticipation as he takes his friend behind the diner to show him where he saw the figure in his dream.
And then there's the scene near the beginning, when the car is weaving through Mulholland Dr. A similar scene recurs throughout the film.Of course there are explanations for many of these things, but I think that the reason why they are 'there' in the film is to create a sense of the wonder and the terror of discovery.",Mulholland Drive
1164,lr774,A film does not have to be 'great' to be important.,10,8 January 2003,"Just reading through some of the comments below convinces me that Mulholland Dr. is a significant work.It's not that people are simply divided over it: some believe it is a masterpiece/milestone in cinema history, while others believe that it is the worst thing ever made.Personally I love the film, and I do not claim to understand why so many people dislike it, but I am delighted to see that it remains provocative and hasn't become an instant 'classic' like so many others.",Mulholland Drive
1165,michaeleicht,This is a fantastic riddle with many possible solutions all inside!,10,17 April 2009,"This film is just the best of the best for me. In fact, it IS my favorite film, so it come as no surprise to you that I rate it as excellent. There is almost not a single thing I would like to be different.INLAND EMPIRE, Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Twin Peaks- Fire Walk With Me and Blue Velvet are also all in my top 20 movies overall, but why it is the best? You could argue it has the very best acting. Naomi Watts would have absolutely deserved an Oscar (e. g. not many actresses can start crying when filmed, most use tricks), even more than Laura Dern would have deserved one for her fabulous EMPIRE role. This performance alone has elevated Watts as one of my all-time favorite actresses. It is also great to see how cold and understated Theroux handles his role, or how bizarre some side actors behave - all contributing to the truly unique mood.This is another thing. The mood is very strong, brooding, emotional, surrealistic, thought changing and elevating. Los Angeles has become an ""actress"" in this film, seriously. The cinematography is well thought-out, just right almost the whole time, and the soundtrack is very moody and original.Another thing that makes it the best Lynch film for me is the thought-provocing, non-linear, Moebius strip resembling, multi-layered script. Lynch wrote he had the key ideas to finishing the story in a meditation session, so an expanded consciousness has to do with its greatness. The dialogues are very believable and at times quite strange - even if e. g. the scene where the old couple laughs in the car is even of more artistic value in my opinion. It can get you thinking about what just happens in our lives.Then, the last thing that makes it the best of his movies for me, is the cut and thus, the pace. It begins dark, in a mid tempo, then mostly slows down a bit with some fast interruptions to keep the tension high, then the last fifth reminds me of a tornado, really.You should know by now, that I absolutely recommend this film to all viewers which are old enough.Now we come to some interpretations: About the specific meaning, there has been talked in depth. But here about some more abstract ones: First, this is sort of a meta-film (but not quite like Fellini's 8 1/2 or his later EMPIRE) all having acting and directing as part of the story, and ultimately showing that all movies are illusions, created ""dream world(s)"". The absolutely beautiful ""Club Silencio""-scene can be even expanded in its meaning to life and freedom in general.Then, it is also a movie about how you create a better world in your fantasy if you made - and often make! - a lot of bad decisions in your life.Additionally, it shows just how hard earning money in Hollywood actually is for young new actresses, even if they are talented. Jenifer Syme was not tough enough for it, Mulholland Drive was dedicated to her. Another motive is the Marilyn Monroe-one, more concrete: a sexual very alluring and active person lives with multiple affairs at once, making other people jealous and possibly self-destructive, and at the same time, getting better film roles.Finally, it is a film about identity. Not to go in depth here, it is shown in a specific case that we sometimes want to have the identity of a more successful person we love, possibly in a compulsive obsession. Also, after a tragic shock, we often like to escape our own lives, identities.You see here that Mulholland Drive has many layers, both concrete and abstract, and that is the most beautiful thing about it.If David Lynch should ever read this, he can send me a message whether he wants to read one or two scripts by me or not.",Mulholland Drive
1166,atish-banerjee-tech,A poem in the form of movie,10,5 November 2009,"I think this movie is a masterpiece creation. Apart from wonderful cinematic treatment and wonderful use of music and sound, Lynch able to create a strong grip over the audience thru a very smart narrative presentation. The plot is very surrealistic but presenting surrealism in the form of a gripping cinema is something what very few people can do successfully. Have you guys ever read Sukumar Ray's poems(famous film maker Satyajit Ray's father)? His poems are very rhythmic and seems quite nonsense when you read first, but having a strong understatement(!)...I should not say statement...it has strong directional notion when you see how easily poet is marrying some social problem with your desire and then again jumping back to reality. It is roller-coaster ride questioning your ethics, thinking, moral values, conscience but still not very rude and real. In contrary to most of the movies - the final statement is kept open for it's audience, not something exerted by director. It is a process of awaking your inner-self and leave a question for you to answer it in your own way. Thanks Lynch for such nice poem - I can feel same rhythm here!",Mulholland Drive

1169,datchery,The first great film of the 21st century,10,23 January 2003,"Mulholland Drive is undoubtedly a difficult film that requires attention to enjoy, and multiple viewings to truly appreciate.  Many viewers won't have the patience, will, or ability to devote the necessary effort this film demands, but for those who do then a finer film experience is not to be found.I leave the extensive explanations and theories to other reviews, observing here only that one of the best things about this film is the way that it engenders many possible explanations.  If you believe that film should have the capacity to fascinate and arouse ongoing interest long after you leave the theater, then this film is for you.  If you prefer a passive experience, then you will probably just be confused and unsatisfied with this movie.
To list just a few of my favorite tidbits before closing (not spoilers, just things to notice): the drifting camera work in the first Winkies scene, the recurring line ""this is the girl"" and its significance, and the Hamlet death scene references.

After the first half an hour i figured some semblance of a plot would emerge after the hour mark I gave up any hope that this pretentious movie leading to anything. Although this movie did resort to cheap gimmicks ie. Lesbian love affair and OMG it's a dream! I read that the script was written day to day it really shows. Ambiguity can work in a movie, but Mulholland drive seemed like and ego stroke for David Lynch. Don't waste your time with this movie it jumps around in an incoherent manner and lacks any semblance of a thoughtful story line. Just because you put random unrelated events in a movie does not make them symbolic. The movie seems to rely on people to feign a belief in the ""symbolism"" (ex cowboy?!, first diner scene, the black book which remains unanwsered) of the movie and the ambiguity in the ending and how thoughtful and provocative this movie is. However it is none of these things. The finale scene seems hasty and forced appearing to be a hasty ending to a lacking movie. There are other movie's out there to leave you thinking, with out wasting 2 ½ hours of your life and putting you in a bad mood.

1172,seal_point_siamese,When does Art in Film go too far?,1,23 November 2003,"Okay - I get it - Mullholland Drive is a cinematic masterpiece and David Lynch goes where no man has gone before. The same can be said for Goya as an artist and Bret Easton Ellis as an author, but nobody said you have to like them and I certainly dont. Before I go on I will mention in all fairness that I am biased, I hated Dune and I hated Eraserhead also much for the same reasons that I loathe Mulholland Drive. In my opinion much of the film is unecessary rubbish. It certainly starts off well - I was enthralled by the mystery created at the beginning - I was dying to know the significance of the scary bum (and boy was I dissapointed when I figured that out!). Only Lynch could take a great mystery and turn it into weird, cold, depressing nonsense. Everything was fine until that cinema show - I mean really?! I could go on for hours about how ridiculous and pointless all those so-called representations of evil are. This is the kind of film that intellectuals adore because there are so many odd, strange pointless references that they can pore over for hours and find hidden meaning in - and I believe that there is no real meaning - these scenes (the bum with the blue box, the cinema show, the grandparents)are written with intellectuals in mind - Lynch doesn't need to really write the script coherently, all he has to do is throw in some weird nonsense and let everyone who sees the film pretend they are intelligent by stroking their chin and finding freudian references in it. This is precisely how I felt about Eraserhead. Unreality within Reality within Unreality. I dont even think Lynch really knows what he's talking about, he just hopes that the film comes across as so incoherent and nonsensical that it becomes ""an art film"" and therefore ""a masterpiece"". This is the kind of film that when asked ""How was Mulholland Drive?"" the answer is ""It was fantastic! Im not really sure what it was about - but it was great!"". I would like to compare this film to ""Donnie Darko"" which certainly leaves alot for discussion also. These films are very similar in style and mood - however, why I enjoyed Donnie Darko so much was that even though it was weird, strange and non-sensical in parts - the writer did give you some food for thought in the concept of time travel - exploring the possibilities of time travel certainly does answer most questions that come to mind about the film. Mulholland Drive just throws it all at you and leaves you to guess. Time Travel is a much more logical concept to deal with than the alternative reality psychosis of an individual. (Sorry, I really needed to get all that out!!!) anyway, after my huge whinge, I would like to say that the acting in Mulholland Drive is phenomenal, Watt's character is annoying and insipid at the beginning and you wonder how she landed the role at all - then when we find out that the character she is playing is an act itself we see that she is in fact a VERY good actress indeed, her alter-ego is a wishy washy insipid twit and what comes across as a falsity in personality is indeed an astute observation as we see that her real personality is bitter, nervous, depressive and passionate and that is what is trying to break through throughout the first half of the film, the character comes off false because it is false. Very well done. Other than that I hereby declare that I am obviously in a minority but I hated this film.",Mulholland Drive
1173,frozentitan1,Should have been better,6,10 April 2003,"This movie was very interesting, but I kept waiting for it to go somewhere and it never did. The last part of the movie that should have wrapped things up just made things more confusing. I was disappointed. It had some unique elements that could have led to a great ending, but instead just got weird without any good explanation. I cannot recommend this movie, unless you just want to see a movie showing off Lynch's trademark style. The problem is this one just builds your expectations and never delivers.",Mulholland Drive

1176,tim-g-greene,"Good cast, good idea, moderate execution...",5,15 April 2011,"I like this film, I love the genre, but have to confess to finding David Lynch a bit of an amateur surrealist.The plot is fast paced and immersing but may lose you if you aren't paying much attention, although there's something about Hollywood films about Hollywood that strikes me as thoroughly disingenuous.For me the attention to detail & continuity between dreaming and waking does not fit the paradigm commonly portrayed in dreams or in fact dreams I have.Also, a lot of the more surreal scenes are meant to add to the sensationalism of Diane's dream, but unfortunately, they really don't. They drag out and lose sight of the whole and become separate ideas altogether.Films that are composed of long dream segments are hard to get right, as many have found. I respect Lynch's attempt, but he has tried to combine too many different styles and too many different ideas which seem as if they would suit their own titles.I may look out for more from David Lynch, but having seen Eraserhead also, which was undeniably the most repetitive film I've ever seen, I may be skipping future titles.",Mulholland Drive

Everything that you seek in a movie, BUT it is also very confusing for the simple audience. For example Memento is also confusing, but you'll figure out whats going on if you observe carefully. In Mulholland dr observing has no point if you don't know the fact, that 2 hours of the movie is just Diane's dream. Even if the turning point was meant to be not obvious, it's still impossible to crack, because it consists daydreaming and other confusing scenes and overall it ruined the ""gag-line"". It's like getting a present, but the present turns out to be a level 6 puzzle and i wouldn't call that entertaining. Also about those nude lesbian scenes - one shocking lesbian scene is enough.",Mulholland Drive
1179,tltpanic,don't waste your time,1,14 May 2003,"Save your precious time and skip this one!  Mulholland Drive is clearly a poor attempt at a movie.  The first 2/3 of this movie finds the viewer wondering what will happen, how everything will tie together.  The rest of the movie draws the viewer deeper into confusion, as nothing is made clear - only more muddled.  And at the end of this YOU will be saying - out loud - ""WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED - WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?!"" The only redeeming quality is the material this will provide for our pals at MST3K.If this is David Lynch at his best, I'm glad I missed the rest.",Mulholland Drive
1180,dniven1-1,"Murder, love, jealousy, fame and the grit of reality.",10,18 February 2004,"Mulholland Drive is one of the most elegant and sophisticated films this century has yet seen. In brief it is about two young women in Los Angeles caught up in a murder mystery and how they try uncover what really went on. However, in the end it is not what really happened that matters, but what the people are like inside, how they relate to each other and what they aspire to be. This is where the true mastery of the film making lies - built on the brilliant directing of Lynch and the fantastic acting of Watts and Harman.Just to pick up on a couple of points which people seem not to have mentioned before. This film is about how people relate to each other and especially so in a relationship. At the beginning Betty is strong and sure of herself and helps the vulnerable Rita solve her problems. But by the end the roles have swapped over - but the reasons for it are quite unexpected. Both Watts and Harman create this complicated character and relationship change in a most convincing way. They receive my highest commendation for their work in this film.As many people have already mentioned, Mulholland Drive has some plot twists that leave people very confused since they are not spelt out. However, even if you accept the standard twist and can get some meaning out of the film, there is much more to be enjoyed. In Mulholland Drive the film grips you because it communicates non-verbally and on a subconcious level. It does not matter if there are twists in this film or if there are none. What we have here is elegant story telling that goes beyond words and simple plots, it works somewhere deep in our feelings, combining beautiful shots with illogical day-to-day routines. Submitting your attention to this film is like taking a journey into a beautiful and terrifying dream. It is this essence of the film that can make you watch it again and again without ever getting bored. Go along with the ride, don't resist the incomprehensible logic, and I guarantee you won't be dissapointed.",Mulholland Drive
1181,alikays,I think this movie was crap.,2,1 June 2006,"I was a fan of David Lynch because of Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks TV series. This movie was pretentious compilations of a confusing plot and scenes that were only there to shock or offend. The music was like a replay of Twin Peaks. Not very original.Naiomi Watts' performance was very good. It's just too bad she had to perform in such a bad movie. She's got a great career ahead of her.Lynch must be so full of himself that he thinks this type of movie will be what the general adult movie goer would like or, at least, be intrigued. There aren't many movies that I dislike and I'm shocked that I'd even write this comment. I just feel I have to do it.",Mulholland Drive
1182,Lturner4,I'll have one of whatever Mr Lynch is Having,9,7 September 2003,Wow....what an amazing work.  I've watched this movie 4 times now and I still don't get everything and I really don't think I ever will but  that doesn't matter....maybe if I could think like  David Lynch for a day I could grasp more.  Loved this flick and there are very few movies that I watch more than twice and NEVER 4 times.,Mulholland Drive
1183,exiztone,A new perspective of Lynch,10,19 October 2003,"I must say, I was never a huge a Lynch fan before. I was always curious watching his films but it was merely because people had told me they were spectacular and brilliant. I had watched Blue Velvet before. Probably his most famous work, but I just didn't get how it was.... ""amazing"". I found it a bit cheesy actually. So, here I was having my doubts about this man, and one day I remembered I had a DivX (shhh, told tell the feds) of Mulholland Drive and I think I only put it on to test the DivX player on my Xbox. 5 minutes in, I was already keen on watching it all. It sort of grips you in from the start. So I let it run on untill the end, and then I was totally amazed. I had loved this. BUT (there's always one of those). It does require a decent amount of concentration, so I didn't fully get everything the first time around. I searched on the internet to confirm my thoughts of everything and I was right about most things. The week after, I watched it again. This time knowing what to pay close attention to. I was just astonished. You realize how much depth and emotion that is the foundation of this masterpiece. I rarely use that word and I'm highly cynical of everyday type of film, but this is really just mind blowing. I give this 10 out of 10.For those who realized. I did not mention a thing that happens in this film. That was intentional... for if I told you, it was spoil allot more than you think.Happy watching.",Mulholland Drive

1186,texan_mirage,Lynch must regret this movie!!,1,12 September 2011,Just don't bother to watch this. I wonder how does it have an IMDb rating of 8!! Might be thrill for some but was real crap to me. Even if this is the last thriller left on the planet don't care to watch. Messy script and awful cinematography with horrible sound effects. The director has tried to thrill the viewer by adding UN-necessary events and is able to build up the suspense to some extent in-spite of crummy cinematography but fails to keep the thrill and soon starts annoying instead of thrilling. This is probably one of the worst thrillers i have ever seen. Highly over-rated movie. I must say that Mr. Lynch himself should be regretting this.,Mulholland Drive

If you're a passionate movie watcher like me and wish to watch carefully, solving any mystery and connecting the dots, Good luck with that. After one complete hour of watching this movie, I understood something is very wrong and I don't know what it is. Halfway through the movie, I still have hope that I'll be able to figure out something as possibly everything will start to connect. 20 minutes remaining and I'm thinking hard in my mind, what am I watching ?? I wanted to go back and re start and give more attention to what happened after half, But was too scared. The movie got over, and I was just by myself, no one to talk to..... I just hope this night is over and everything will be fine in the morning.

1188,sunmouse,A woman with amnesia attempts to understand what's happened to her,8,23 December 2003,"This is an educated and well crafted film with many of the hallmarks that make David Lynch one of the finest directors working today.  There are moments of great tension and vivid cinematography.  Lynch imbues the film with intelligence and thought provoking ideas.  He creates in the viewer a sense of sympathy for the main character's plight but also keeps the plot tight and full of intrigue.  You are repulsed (intentionally) by some of the darker characters but paradoxically it is quite difficult to ""take sides"". The sugary sweet nature of the secondary lead is soon left behind as we realise that she too has a more ambiguous nature.Lynch squeezes every ounce of talent out of the performers who turn in believable and convincing performances.  This is a compelling, erudite yet thoroughly watchable film.",Mulholland Drive
1189,Hellblazer2003,Lynch's masterpiece. One of the best psychological suspense thrillers ever made.,10,4 January 2004,David Lynch creates an amazing film here. He is one of the most under-rated director/screenwriters in film of the last 25 years.  Naomi Watts turns in a magnificent dual role which garnered her few awards but heavily snubbed from an oscar nomination. Lynch excellently convinces the viewer the film is heading one direction as he grasps the viewers full attention he pulls a 360 on the audience.  Lynch is a master of mise-en scene. The suspense and mystery he creates behind this story is wonderful and amazing.Mulholland Drive leaves a lasting effect on the viewer for a long time. There are many notable performances but outside of Naomi Watts the star is David Lynch that proves why he is a master auteur in his own right. The film might even keep a good number of viewers guessing after the curtain goes down.  Some scenes can't be fully solved but its meant to be that way. Only Lynch in his deranged mind fully knows the true puzzle of Mulholland Drive.,Mulholland Drive

Like they'd be able to figure out the meaning of anything above the level of a Marvel comic book.MD rocks.  It's got a great score, great performances (especially by Naomi Watts), and, yes, Virginia, there's even a plot buried under all those dreams.Is trying to decipher the plot worth your while?  Not necessarily; a lot of people would probably find that a waste of time, and of course that could be considered a drawback by some.  But it's inherent to a movie that's supposed to be a mystery.  Even if you don't want to obsess and compulse over it, it's at least worth a viewing.",Mulholland Drive
1191,roie-263-895755,very good.........if you like movies that annoy/bore the living sh*t out of you,1,12 January 2012,"OH MY GOD I started to watch this because I saw all the outstanding reviews about it, anyone who likes this film is a moron. To say the acting and directing was terrible is an understatement. The acting was so bad it was like they were deliberately over-acting to over-compensate. It doesn't make any sense. And that is not because I am to stupid to understand the plot, there is no plot, it is just pretentious drivel, seriously. Back to the 'acting', I think they just grabbed people off the street because any serious actor could not be expecting to continue following their career path after appearing in this movie. It was like watching a cheesy 70's crime thriller, but worse. I have to say I didn't watch the whole thing, couldn't is more accurate, aside from the fact that i will NEVER get that hour of my life back, it was infuriating! It made me want to claw my own eyes out. It made my boyfriend feel ill watching it. Well done David Lynch it was certainly a mind f**k if that was the intention, it messes with your head because you can't decide if the acting and plot is that bad on purpose and just when you think it can't get any worse....it does.(Spoiler alert!!) Oh yeah, the bit where the guy goes mad and starts shooting people and then shoots the fat woman through the wall is possibly the only bit of the film that was slightly entertaining. That was quite funny.",Mulholland Drive
1192,freshas_vision,Enlightenment!,10,1 November 2006,"Mulholland Drive is a beautiful, masterful and hypnotic portrait of the human condition and contains Lynch's sharpest observations so far. David Lynch is a practitioner of transcendental meditation and clearly presents within this film a deep understanding of Eastern concepts regarding states of consciousness, desire, ego, greed, love and death.This is what it's about: It is about IDENTITY. We follow the adventure of a woman submerged in Western ignorance, pursuing a dream that is in fact a nightmare. She wants to be an actress. ""Mulholland Drive"" itself refers to the winding road on the outskirts of L.A., like the life of the protagonist, winding, unpredictable, with steep cliffs, what's around the corner? The tagline, ""A love story in the City of Dreams,"" presents the ultimate in human weakness; ego, desire, greed. For as long as she is pursuing ego, desire and greed, she is moving further away from her real identity. When she dies we see images of her parents, a reminder of her real identity.The cowboy, the fifties dancing at the beginning, the film director, the hit-man; these are all stereotypes of Hollywood Movies; artifice. At the theatre, we are reminded, ""It's a tape, it's a tape;"" artifice. Her perceived love; artifice, dazzled by surface charm and fake smiles. For as long as she pursues the life of an actress she is living artificially, she is not her own IDENTITY. The amnesia: she forgets who she is! The film ends where it begins, yet she can't figure out how to escape this CYCLE - get it..? The hit-man shoots the cleaner, the vacuum cleaner sets off the fire alarm... a chain of events a bit like karmic cause and effect, no?Surrounding her is the private nightmare she herself created, in the pursuit of desire and ego. Those miniature old people, so admiring before in the car, now so deranged and small, those old people are her ego. She is driven over the line. Where is happiness? In this City of Dreams? Or in reality? Mulholland drive is a modern day, very intelligent Dharma from David Lynch, a very wise man.",Mulholland Drive
1193,scotteicholtz99,pure genius,10,24 February 2004,"This is David's best work to date and stands to be a Lynch classic.  My favorite scene is the opening sequences that lead up to the eerie limo driving down the dark road.  There is a funeral tone set by Angelo Badalementi's excellent music scores that are very captivating through out Lynch's masterpiece.  I wish David lynch would allow commentary on his DVD's, even the actors perspective would be of interest.  This film could be watched several times and inspire different revelations as to what is really going on.  Naomi Watts and Laura Herring gave amazing performances, as did the cowboy.  Does anyone have a good theories for the significance to Winkies and the guy having nightmares about the ""thing"" behind the dumpster? Mulholland Dr. is like a never ending puzzle that I cant stop analyzing!",Mulholland Drive
1194,scotteicholtz99,good film for Lynch fans,10,25 June 2005,"This is one of my favorite David Lynch films, I liked that the room for interpretation for the viewer is wide open. As the story unfolds there is a great deal for one to ponder and try to figure out. Naomi Watts and Laura Herring give excellent performances. In true Lynch fashion, he delivers the unusual and the twists and turns are plenty. This is a movie that can be watched more than once and still be interesting. Angelo Badalamente composed beautiful scores that were haunting and helped to set the film's eerie tone. If you are not a Lynch fan or are the type that likes to be spoon fed plots, this is not the film for you. David Lynch was nominated for best director in 2002 and should have one the honor for doing such an amazing job, but the Oscar went to Ron Howard for A Beautiful Mind.",Mulholland Drive
1195,tadams20032004,David Lynch is the most talented and original filmmakers today...,10,29 July 2006,"And this is his best film. This film is absolutely amazing; David Lynch reaches the pinnacle of all of his techniques: this film never succumbs to any typical sequences or things to do with thrillers. It is the most original film I have seen in years. After watching this, i thought 'I absolutely love it; what does it mean?'. I watched it again. And again. And again. I bought it. And watched it again. Then i thought 'I absolutely love it; I love what i think it means.' This is a film, like all Lynch films, that is up for almost any interpretation. It represents what you want it to. The dual characterization of the actresses boggles the mind and manipulates the senses. David Lynch is an auteur in every sense of the word. He is an original. He is a master of the ART of film. Not the business. Because, after all, film is an art. Naomi Watts gives an amazing performance: mastering TWO characters, who, although (my interpretation) either one of which can be a mental creation of the other, have different natures. One is real, the other is not. Just like in this film. Everything can be real and unreal at the same time. Everything real is also unreal. This may all sound quite confusing, and it is, honestly. If you are a person who cares for straightforward(sorry if i sound pretentious), moderately bland, pure money-making films; even if you love all films, but can't stand to not understand them, then don't watch David Lynch films. But even if you are those people, watch this film, and be annoyed, sure, but respect the art that Lynch puts up there on the screen. Pure, unfiltered, visual, kinetic art. This film brings together all the visual techniques: light, sound, music, movement, actors, costumes, props, locations, facial expressions, fades, effects: and all were done, at least with Lynch over the shoulder of the workers, if not by him personally. He manipulates you; your mind in this film, and twists your perception of reality. What the characters know, you know. What the characters see, you see. No more. No less. It is a film in which all perception is never assured, yet you feel content as long as the characters are content. He envelopes you in every situation, and the film is like your mind: all reality is input, then manipulated to suit the needs of the situation the mind sees.Lynch seems to know more about human nature than most directors, as he can show you human nature without flat out, straightforwardly, SHOWING you it. For example, the scenes at Winky's. The first scene there has no bearing on the plot. It is only a visual, complete scene with characters and everything, representation of the manifestation of fear in Naomi Watts' characters' mind about the area surrounding the Winky's. The dirty man behind winky's is not a real person. He is the manifestation of all fear, and everything that is bad. He is there, at Winky's, when Naomi Watts' character tries to get her Laura Elena Hardins' character killed. He is the one from which the conscience which kills Naomi's character springs from. He is who has the 'Blue Box' (watch it and you'll get it). He is the representation of all fearful, bad things. This movie, in addition to all things above, does what i believe a great film (and filmmaker) should be able to do: Say everything that needs to be said without a word being said about it. The stuff on the screen speaks for itself. Turn off the volume. It'll still be amazing. The stuff from the speakers does too. Close your eyes; it'll be just as great. That is what film-making is all about.",Mulholland Drive
1196,sukruakyuzmd,The main reason for confusion about the movie.,8,2 February 2017,"The movie lasts approx. 140 min. Except for the first few seconds, the first 120 minutes are a presentation of a dream completely. Thus, it's normal having difficulty to understand this weird part. Let's call this part as Part B. The last 20 minutes are real which can be divided into two sections: Part A (=events that are the underlying reason for why she -Naomi Watts- had such a dream) and Part C (=events that take place after she waked up). I would prefer to watch the scenes in the order of ""A - B - C "" as chronologically expected. However, it is presented in the order of ""B - C1 - A1 - C2 - A2 - C3"" (note that Part A was divided into two sub-parts and Part C into three sub-parts). In addition, the scenes were interspersed with some hallucinations. All these make the movie very hard to understand. Watch the movie once again as you are aware of the chronology presented above. You may then enjoy this time because I think this movie presents a brilliant analysis of some part of human psychology.",Mulholland Drive

1199,cbrimhall08,"Terrible acting, boring plot, horrible directing, and a waste of time",2,17 August 2014,"David Lynch is the kind of director that drives you crazy. He often has great stories to tell with intriguing plots, like Lost Highway or Twin Peaks. However, the execution of directing his stories purposely sabotages all the potential they start out with. In Mulholland Dr., it's no different. The poor acting makes it impossible to connect with the characters or become engaged in the plot. The slow development leaves only small moments of mystery and just when you think the film is going to turn the corner into something exciting, it is quickly halted by weird, nonsensical scenes that leave viewers frustrated. I have seen several David Lynch movies/shows but Lost Highway is the only one that has enough mystery to keep you watching through the endless boredom David Lynch lays out on the screen. I do not understand how this movie has received the praises of critics. It is hard to watch and even more impossible to enjoy. There are countless examples of movies that are so bizarre and so intriguing, you have to keep watching, even if they don't' make sense. For instance, take Donnie Darko, another dark, mind-melting, mystery that tells the story of a mentally disturbed boy who is being told the world will end in 28 days by a rabbit named, Fred. Donnie Darko is more bizarre than Mulholland Dr., but it is incredible. The difference between an incredible, weird film like Donnie Darko and Mulholland Dr. is simple. Donnie Darko tells an unforgettable, creative, original, mind-blowing movie that leaves you with more questions than answers. Mulholland Dr. on the other hand, leaves you frustrated, exhausted, bored, and let down.",Mulholland Drive

And then I recommend watching it again just to see if you missed anything. But then again, that's David Lynch for you. A master of the strange and intriguing. That's why I loved Twin Peaks so much. Sure this movie makes your brain hurt sometimes and sure there are things that aren't going to make sense what so ever. But that's what makes it good. And I love that my little piece of Canada is mentioned in this. Naomi Watts' character Betty says ""I just came here from Deep River, Ontario, and now I'm in this... dream place. You can imagine how I feel."" Deep River is mentioned in a David Lynch movie. Are you kidding me? That is so awesome because Deep River is so awesome. I was born and raised there and it gives me great pride. That is so cool. Anyways, just go out and watch this movie. If you want the weird and the different, then this is the movie for you.

1201,petrillijack1,Weird and unrealistic,3,23 May 2014,"Walking 9 miles in high heels and a tight dress after being in an accident is not realistic (Mulholland to Sunset). Dreaming a scenario and having it come true exactly as dreamed is not realistic. Dying from a heart attack when shocked is very unusual for a normal healthy male. Drinking an espresso and spitting it into a napkin because you don't like it is just plain stupid.I just wish people would stop highly rating movies where characters act in weird and unusual ways. It's a cheap trick and very easy to do. It's also incredibly unimaginative. I could do it and so could you. It's much more difficult to have people behaving within the human norm and still keeping it symbolic or metaphoric. (The scene in ""Saving Pvt. Ryan"" comes to mind where the Jewish soldier is being killed by the SS soldier, and the gentile Upham does nothing about it when he could have saved the Jewish soldier. Realistic and brilliant in its metaphor of Nazis slaughtering Jews while the gentile world did nothing about it.)These so-called artistic movies that depend heavily on weird-acting characters for their art are simply not art in my estimation.

I'm trying not to spoil anything but this movie is definitely something I think everyone should watch at least once.Might not be for everyone, but this movie is everything David Lynch does executed perfectly, it's his masterpiece and not many films will live up to it.",Mulholland Drive
1203,ericbray23,The woman in Apartment #12 is key,9,1 June 2021,"I love this movie and have seen it many times. I think the first 2/3 dream and last 1/3 reality theory of the movie works pretty well, but I wonder if the last 1/3 could actually be a mixture of psychotic daydream and reality. In other words, both Rita and Camile are dream/fantasy figures and the reality is that Diane and the woman in Apartment #12 were lovers and had a falling out and Diane with the help of drugs has become very unhinged. Why else would Lynch introduce the woman in Apt. 12?I guess Diane did come to LA hoping to be a star but things did not go well, she's gotten into drugs, lost a love and she's now psychotic. The first 2/3 of the movie is a dream and when she wakes up it is to a mixture of reality and a psychotic fantasy that she experiences. She is sick. She has broken up with the woman in #12 and moved out and is having trouble dealing with the failure that is her life. She has fantasized about having the woman in #12 killed and that guilt plus the awareness of the fact of her absolute aloneness are what is in the blue box. She can't handle it and kills herself resulting in ""Silencio"" that is her only refuge.The reason I may prefer this interpretation is the strange way Betty and Rita merge in the Club when listening to ""Crying""/""Llorando"". The nightmare of her life she is able to experience completely at that moment is what was in the blue box. Loss and failure is hard to take.",Mulholland Drive

If, at least, somebody had told me the reasonable summary of this one, certainly I wouldn't see the film. David Linch, for me, tried a different way to show his idea but, unfortunately, was bad! I believe I lost my Saturday night, because at the same time, in other channel, I could see, for the first time of television in Brazil, the movie ""The Passion of Christ"". These last one isn't a ""very good film"" but, in my opinion, is a mega production and make more sense then ""Mulholland Dr."". The actors are very good so like the directors.

I think his the best films ever made. If you are want to feeling emotions you must be watched Mulholland Dr. There is no doubt, it's a masterpiece and amazing. My favorite other Lynch films The Elephant Man,Lost Highway and Blue Velvet. But Mulholland Dr is different for me. It is art, and feeling different after the film.Mulholland Dr. One of the best movies last ten years.I love this movie and all of them must thanks Lynch for Mullholland Dr. Please watch it again.!",Mulholland Drive
1207,imdb-6323,Take an unemployed bum and give him the price of a bottle to come up with a screenplay.,1,3 May 2005,"Actually it would be a more credible explanation for this film if you took two unemployed bums who don't know each other and never meet and neither knows they are collaborating. You would then have a string of odd characters and odd events. Mix the whole lot with some people who know how to crank a camera and spend $17 million making a movie. Call it an intellectual challenge, sit back and wait for the critics to call it a masterpiece.To be fair there are some talented actors, camera and sound people involved in this. There are some nice clothes and in a couple of short scenes a nice lack of them. But you can see all those in a cheap weekly celebrity magazine and it won't take 2 hours and 25 minutes of your life to do it.I have heard that Kubrick's 2001 is considered by some to be a masterpiece because no one understands the ending. I never understood it anyway, but I did like the film. It had some fabulous things going on that were understandable right up to the last 20 minutes or so. Even at the end it was interesting to look at even if completely incomprehensible. Mulholland Dr. is just not in that category.Some arty intellectuals will say that I just didn't get it. That I am lacking in some way and that while the movie might be hard to figure out it is like a hard to figure out mathematical concept. Mathematics might be hard to understand but the fact is it can be understood. And all those who understand it will agree on what it means. In this case we have ""no right answers"". I have no objection to being left wondering if such and such a movie idea could really happen or, what if I were caught up in Groundhog Day or, did he/she really do it? But these are questions to do with aspects of a film not the entire ""piece of work"". Did I just not get it? I don't think so.

I however do not enjoy a movie that makes no sense no matter how much i think about it. I also don't think that a movie should have websites designed to offer their help in figuring out what happened. This movie just plain sucks. It is definitely not worth watching, unless you skip to the good part. And of course by the good part i mean the nudity. That is this movie's only redeeming quality. in short, this movie is completely worthless, don't even waste your time. And if you have seen this movie, and do truly enjoy it, there is something wrong with you.

This is one of those movies that was made deliberately to make no sense. Movie critics and all sorts of snobs see such a film and they think there must be something more to it. And then they search for something in it until they come up with something crazy to justify this movie's ""greatness"" even though that might just be their interpretation. Does ambiguity make a film great? Absolutely not. Is this movie something significantly more than a mess of scenes that are made to connect nonsensically? No, it isn't. Sure, the dream theory is nice but it definitely wasn't in the writer's head. It's not horrible, but nothing great either.",Mulholland Drive
1210,AilMergor,"On of many David Lynch's masterpieces, and my favorite one.",8,15 February 2016,"Diane (Naomi Watts) is a naive young woman who moves to Hollywood with dreams of becoming a movie star. She falls in love with a veteran actor, Camilla (Laura Harring), who brings her to glamorous industry parties and gets her bits and pieces of work. But Diane's just a casual fling, as she learns when she sees Camilla first get engaged to a man (Justin Theroux) and then move onto newer, younger mistresses. She has no intention of living with Diane or truly advancing her career -- so Diane hires a man (Mark Pellegrino) to kill her, and then kills herself.Most of the runtime isn't in reality, but in Diane's fantasy before dying. At the very beginning, the camera lowers onto a pillow; everything from there until the end is in her dream. But it's not an ""It was all a dream!"" twist or something lame like that -- it's pretty explicit about being a dream, and the dream is a way to depict Diane's fantasy life falling apart as reality intrudes, and to have everything you see show emotion and fantasies rather than boring reality.The dream begins with the hit on Camilla being carried out -- the guy up front pulls a gun. Then, miracle of miracles, a car crash saves her life, and kills her memory and personality. The amnesiac Camilla is a blank slate who is now reliant on Diane's care and has no connection to anyone but her. That's what Diane really wants, Camilla all to herself and all her rottenness gone, to not have to kill her.There are two diner scenes. In reality, this is where Diane hired the hit-man. A man stares at her, she imagines he knows what he sees. So in Diane's dream, which tries to suppress all of this information, the man is talking to his therapist, talking about something evil exists at that diner, which he can't bear to look at in his dreams, and how a man was looking at him, making him feel guilty. Diane is bitter and twisted at this point, and jealous of the younger, still-upbeat, still-naive waitress Betty -- in her dream, she takes the name Betty.If you watch the movie from this perspective, everything feels right; it retains the surreal mood of a dream, but the plot turns all fit into place. The dream is divided between these upbeat comedy sequences depicting Diane's fantasy -- Justin Theroux, who stole her SO, has his SO cheat on him (with Billy Ray Cyrus, for added humiliation) in a comical series of disasters, the hit men are inept, her auditions go amazingly -- and these very bleak, tense scenes where reality intrudes. The phone calls about missing girls, phone calls in her own voice, hearing that the movie will never get made because 'this is all bullshit.' The dream all comes breaking down when Diane discovers a corpse and finally remembers what the blue key is for (it's the sign the hit-man gives to indicate the completion of the job). The last thing you see in the dream is this extremely theatrical and beautifully-done concert performance being revealed as a tape playing over speakers, because none of this amazing stuff is real.Then the whole spirit of the movie is compressed into one minute for the scene where Diane masturbates thinking about Camilla while crying her eyes out.",Mulholland Drive
1211,speakvisual,Lynch's biggest achievement,10,2 September 2006,"This movie is too good for words. Captivating through its great camera work, intriguing in an almost demanding matter, brilliant performances by the whole cast, music that is enchantingly fitting and as usually things that don't make much sense but are thought-provoking and moving on a gut level. This is my favorite David Lynch film, and the film that first got me into his work which I encourage everyone to watch. For this film especially you might want to devote 3 or 4 viewings if you are eager to shed light to its mysterious and confusing plot-but trust me, it's worth it.

In this case, Lynch had created a beautiful and weird love story, full of plot twists. The non-linear structure he uses it's perfect for this film and lets you thinking over and over about the sense of time and ordering in your mind several scenes and dialogs. I was very impressed by this film. I can compare its effect on me, solely with the hard and long-lasting emotions of books like Faulkner's The Soung and the fury or Borges' Fictions. It's the kind of film you love, or hate, but anyway, you ought to see it. I almost forget it. Naomy Campbell's work is astounding, by far her best ever. Laura Harrings also, proved herself as a great actress.",Mulholland Drive

Besides, the actresses were pretty good.But I have a theory to add on top of those emperor's new clothes theme comments: people rate this high so as to make other people suffer as well.

1215,chrisfi,Once again operation mindfuck,5,11 January 2006,"Don't believe the hype! Or do believe?This kind of films drives everyone crazy, and is for those with good will who believe in the good a topic for discussions for some days at least, for others it's a pure waste of time.I am writing this comment to get rid of the aftermath, I have watched this film half an hour ago, and my intention is to get an ANSWER! That is what probably everyone wants after watching this movie. Besides no one mentioned the term ""mindfuck"" what amazed me.It is absolutely to be categorized in the mindfuck genre, for those who are not familiar with this term have a look at wikipedia, or read the Illuminatus trilogy. In these books the meaning of mindfuck is just overloading the brain with that much nonsense with literally ""no sense"", so that the brain after endless loops trying to solve the riddle just ""resets"", and all brain washings you had had in your life are just erased and you are able to see the world as it really is. Just as far as I remember it.There is a hype about such kind of movies, they tend to get cult, although no one is able to describe the meaning, there are just some guessings. I am not that person who follows the hype, although I am quite impressed. And I do like solving riddles.OK, let us start systematically - what possibilities are there?A) It has got a meaning, but is just very (very very) hard to find.B)It is mindfuck. C) It is ""art"", i.e. compare it with a painting, there are always several interpretations, they just have an (subtle) effect. In other words: It works on the subconsciousness. Or - in other other words - it is dream-like.C: I cannot imagine this solution, therefor it is too much complicated and ""mindfucking"". And in my opinion, movies with a story line cannot just be art and just have effect. A story line implies something that can be understood by the mind.B: From the first impression: that's it. It has got no meaning. But why then this love for details, this sense for art and this truly complicated plot. What is the intention of Lynch? Is it just to confuse in a very artful way? Then it would be just manipulation of the viewer, to create a superhuman aura, why is someone creating and telling a riddle what cannot be solved? If this would be true I would be really enraged.A: Would be nice, but all the attempts of explanation I have read so far seem to be very far-fetched.Everyone thinks that just because no one is able to understand the plot Lynch has to be a genius, somehow superhuman. And the movie has to be great. Is it this way? I do not think so. I think staying on the ground is the best thing to do.But nevertheless I will try to solve this riddle, trying to get on the bottom of the plot. Perhaps Lynch has just a very complicated way of expressing things :).PS: As far as the vote is concerned: No extremes for this movie.",Mulholland Drive

A lot of it strikes me as bizarre for the sake of bizarre. Yes there are some wonderful acting jobs in there and the fact that I can re-watch it so many times is a testament to the movie itself. However I have problems with directors whom feel that something is only art is the Philistines don't get it.

I can't say how much I was taken back when with 45 min of movie time left the director decided that everything up until that point in the movie would be reversed with a lesbian scene and some lightning strikes. That isn't film making. Another truly amazing turn in the movie came with the two inch tall senior citizens crawling under the door for absolutely no reason. which made me say ""You have got to be efing kidding me!"".

His main tactic for confusion was using pronouns.  Throughout the movie people are referred to as him, her, they, and it.

1230,Martin-77,My views on why Mulholland Drive is a hair-raisingly good movie,10,9 May 2002,"There's a sign on The Lost Highway that says:*MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD*(but you already knew that, didn't you?)Since there's a great deal of people that apparently did not get the point of this movie, I'd like to contribute my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense. As others have pointed out, one single viewing of this movie is not sufficient. If you have the DVD of MD, you can ""cheat"" by looking at David Lynch's ""Top 10 Hints to Unlocking MD"" (but only upon second or third viewing, please.) ;)First of all, Mulholland Drive is downright brilliant. A masterpiece. This is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head. Not often are the comments on the DVDs very accurate, but Vogue's ""It gets inside your head and stays there"" really hit the mark.David Lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it - cinematography-wise, has great   acting (esp. Naomi Watts), a haunting soundtrack by Badalamenti, and a very dream-like quality to it -- but on top of it all it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before. (After all, when is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldn't leave your mind and that everyone felt compelled to talk and write about, regardless of whether they liked it or hated it?)Allright, enough about all that, it's time to justify those statements.Most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion/a dream sequence.Of course, that's too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting ""traditional"" methods in which the story is laid out in a timely, logic and linear manner for the viewer. But for those expecting that, I urge you to check the name of the director and come back again. ;)MD is the story of the sad demise of Diane Selwyn, a wannabe-actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor, Camilla Rowles. Due to Diane's lack of talent, she is constantly struggling to advance her career, and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents' expectations. Upon realizing that Camilla will never be hers (C. becomes engaged with Adam Kesher, the director), she hires a hitman to get rid of her, and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces.The movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller; which is some 50s dance/jitterbug contest, in which we can see the main character Betty giving a great performance. We also see an elderly couple (which we will see twice more throughout the movie) together with her, and applauding her.No, wait. This is what most people see the first time they view it. There's actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits - the camera moving into an object (although blurry) and the scene quickly fading out. If you look closely, the object is actually a pillow, revealing that what follows is a dream.The main characters seen in the first half of the movie:Betty: Diane Selwyn's imaginary self, used in the first half of the movie that constitutes the ""dream-sequence"" - a positive portrayal of a successful, aspiring young actor (the complete opposite of Diane). 'Betty' was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at Winkies. Notice that in the dream version, the waitresses' name is 'Diane'.Rita: The fantasy version of Camilla Rhodes that, through Diane's dream, and with the help of an imaginary car-accident, is turned into an amnesiac. This makes her vulnerable and dependent on Diane's love. She is then conveniently placed in Betty/Diane's aunt's luxurious home which Betty has been allowed to stay in.Coco: In real life, Adam's mother. In the dream part, the woman in charge of the apartment complex that Betty stays in. She's mainly a strong authority figure, as can be witnessed in both parts of the film.Adam: The director. We know from the second half that he gets engaged with Camilla. His sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for Betty/Diane, since she develops such hatred towards him.Aunt Ruth: Diane's real aunt, but instead of being out of town, she is actually dead. Diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for Camilla's murder.Mr. Roach: A typical Lynchian character. Not real; appears only in Diane's dream sequence. He's a mysterious, influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair. He serves much of the same function as the backwards-talking dwarf (which he also plays) in Twin Peaks.The hitman: The person that murders Camilla. This character is basically the same in both parts of the movie, although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence (more on that below).Now, having established the various versions of the characters in the movie, we can begin to delve into the plot. Of course I will not go into every little detail (neither will I lay it out chronologically), but I will try to explain some of the important scenes, in relation to Lynch' ""hint-sheet"".As I mentioned above, Camilla was re-produced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a car-accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie, which left her completely vulnerable. What I found very intriguing with MD, is that Lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn't. I've already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow, but notice how there's two cars riding in each lane approaching the limo.Only one of the cars actually hit the limo; what about the other? Even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves, wouldn't they try to help the others, or at least call for help? My theory is that, since this is a dream, the presence of the other car is just set aside, and forgotten about. Since, as Rogert Ebert so eloquently puts it ""Like real dreams, it does not explain, does not complete its sequences, lingers over what it finds fascinating, dismisses unpromising plotlines.""Shortly after Rita crawls down from the crash site at Mulholland Dr., and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into Aunt Ruth's apartment, Betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away, staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera. This is the first indication that what we're seeing is a nightmare.Although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to Betty, I think they're actually her parents (since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest). Perhaps she didn't know them all that well, and didn't really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted, so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream. They also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder, and Diane's sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life.A rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman. Diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept Camilla's part in the movie (from Adam's party in the second half of the movie), and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream. Because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of Camilla, a part of her wants him to miss, so she turns him into a dumb criminal.This scene, I think, is also Lynch's attempt at totally screwing his audience over, since they're given a false pretence in which to view the movie.Gotta love that 'Something just bit me bad' line, though. :)The next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at Twinkies, who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they're sitting in. After a little talk, they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence, accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene.When reaching the corner, a bum-like character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner, scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare. This nightmare exists only in Diane's mind; she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder. So, in short, her obessions translate into that poor guy's nightmares. The bum also signifies Diane's evil side, as can be witnessed later in the movie.The Cowboy constitutes (along with the dwarf) one of the strange characters that are always present in the Lynchian landscape -- Diane only saw him for a short while at Adam's party, but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams, so can he be awarded an important part in her dream. We are also given further clues during his scenes that what we're seeing is not real (his sudden disappearance, etc.)The Cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the Director, when he meets up with him at the odd location (the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream). Also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he (Adam) does good, or two more times if he does bad. Throughout the movie he appears two more times, indicating to Diane that she did bad. He is also the one to wake her up to reality (that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice), and shortly thereafter she commits suicide.The espresso-scene with the Castigliane brothers (where we can see Badalamenti, the composer, as Luigi) is probably a result of the fact that Diane was having an espresso just before Camilla and Adam made their announcement at Adam's party in the second half. It could at the same time also be a statement from Lynch.During the scene in which they enter Diane's apartment, the body lying in the bed is Camilla, but notice how she's assumed Diane's sleeping position; Diane is seeing herself in her own dream, but the face is not hers, although it had the same wounds on the face as Diane would have after shooting herself. This scene is also filled with some genuine Lynchian creepiness. Since Diane did not know where (or when) the hitman would get to Camilla and finish her off, she just put her into her own home.In real life, Diane's audition for the movie part was bad. In her dream, she delivers a perfect audition - leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performance.Also interesting is the fact that the money that in real-life was used to pay for Camilla's murder now appears in Rita/Camilla's purse. This is part of Diane's undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back, as the murder now hasn't taken place.When her neighbor arrives to get her piano-shaped ashtray, another hint is given; she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves, yet later when Camilla and Betty have their encounter on the couch, we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table, suggesting that Betty's encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy.The catch phrase of the movie Adam is auditioning actresses for is ""She is the girl""; which are the exact same words that Diane uses when giving the hitman Camilla's photo resume.The blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie, and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed. There's much symbolism going on here; the box may represent Diane's future (it's empty), or it may be a sort of a Pandora's box (the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open). Either way, it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key (which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place). The box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bum.Club Silencio is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s/he is viewing is not real. It also signifies that Diane is about to wake up to her reality (her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from, even in her dreams).During the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear, Diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears.Anyway, that is my $0.02. Hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it 'the worst movie ever' or something to that effect, without realizing the plot.As usual, Lynch is all about creating irrational fears, and he certainly achieves that with this picture as well.10 out of 10.",Mulholland Drive

But then I bought the Cliff Notes and everything seemed to make sense and I actually admired the book. ""Mulholland Dr."" is similar; when I finished the movie I was completely frustrated, but once I read an article that explained it, everything again seemed to make sense and I do admire the movie.However, I cannot help but feel that a movie that requires an outside source to make it enjoyable and meaningful is nothing more than a cheat. I am impressed with the film and Mr. Lynch's direction, but that doesn't make up for the feeling that he is trying to pull the wool over his audience's eyes. I am telling my friends not to see this film; if they absolutely must see it, I am telling them that they MUST find an article, a secret decoder ring of sorts, that explains it or they will be utterly disappointed.",Mulholland Drive

Don't be fooled, Lynch has no idea what he's doing and resorts to inserting cheap emotions (such as the admittedly hot lesbian sex scene) in place of real feelings. If you want to taste a sample of real cinema from last year, try ""Ghost World"" or ""Waking Life"" instead.",Mulholland Drive
1234,ylph,some comments,10,16 November 2001,"Reality is not linear.  Our reality is just a sum of hopelessly unreliable recollections of our perceived past, our hopes and fears of the future  all colored through the kaleidoscope of our subjective point of view  and all mixed together in a timeless and dimensionless sphere of our mind. Fragments of our experiences (already subjective as such) appear throughout this reality, but they shift and change with time.David Lynch attempts to capture this reality on film.Linearity is un-reality.  It is an attempt of our logical mind to take and order fragments of our thoughts and memories into a sequence that satisfies its own needs for simplicity, order and sense.  It picks and chooses, forms and transforms, censors, embellishes, exagerates these as it sees fit.Traditional american movies attempt to capture this un-reality on film. They are meant to make us escape reality, to satisfy our logical mind, our craving for simplicity and order.It is the process of dreaming that lets the mind untie these previously formed linear constructs, and re-order them, re-shuffle them, try different combinations, try fitting pieces together in different ways to make them fit our ""current"" reality more closely.  This can be driven by hopes or by fears, both making prominent appearances in Lynch's movies.In movies like Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway, Lynch tries to break down the linearity of our mind by showing us how the same pieces can be put together to form very different but still self-sustained logical linear worlds - which is very close to the process taking place during a dream.  I think this is why many people explain these as being dreams.----In many respects, Mulholland Drive is a big-budget version of Eraserhead (one of my favorite movies of all time)  Many of the same themes are repeated, as well as visual and plot elements.----I also think, that in some forms of art, one has to learn the language of the artist to be able to experience it (or at least more of it).  This is obviously true in literature (poetry for example) - and also to great extent in music (there are different musical ""languages"" - rules of forming rhythms and melodies, that at first might sound strange and alien, but once we get familiar with them, we often discover the real genius in the piece.)I think this is true for movies as well - seeing a David Lynch movie for the first time for someone used to conventional american cinema is like hearing jazz for the first time for someone trained in classical music, or hearing the alien beats and soundscapes of Richard James for the first time.Many of the elements that repeat in Lynch's movies are just elements of his artistic language.  While these in themselves are pleasing to look at (much like a foreign language poem might be pleasing for its rhythm and flow), it is what is being expressed using them that really completes the picture. It is not about getting the plot  it's about learning the language, to hear what is being said.  And this is also not so much a question of intellect, but more of effort and open mind.People who complain about the movie having no plot and not being interested in the characters are like people who see a movie in French and complain that the dialogues made no sense.",Mulholland Drive

As far as I'm concerned it's a pretty good film except for the part where the moviemakers ran out of money and decided to make a cheap artmovie out of this plot. It's very surprising to see this movie gets an 8/10 from the viewers. Those voters must be very happy people who can stare at modern paintings for hours as well. Use your fantasy and make up the story yourself and...tell others you figured it all out. You're so smart and we're so stupid. I bet Mr. Lynch is having a lot fun right now; his viewers came up with answers he didn't even think about himself.

A common complaint I have heard is that Lynch tells an interesting tale in Mulholland Drive but goes off the rails in the last 20 minutes and ""just gets weird"".  But it's these last 20 minutes that throws the preceding 2 hours into a perspective that you wouldn't suspect, and you realize that the story you've been watching up until that point is... well, I won't give it away.

Director David Lynch overuses a few cheap thrill tricks here and there, but he intersperses them with other cinematographic techniques to keep it from becoming obtuse.Altogether surreal, this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sensible.  I am still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to catch things I missed and which may help me understand it better.  It is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together, so you must be patient and pay attention.  Get your bathroom trip out of the way before it starts.  And yet, the plot is overshadowed by the theme, the mood, the character development, and the filming techniques.The dual roles of the main actress, Naomi Watts, showcase her enormous talent.  That is, when I could get my eyes off of her co-star.  What an acting pair.Lynch surprises throughout the movie with unusual camera angles, the length/timing of editing cuts, jumping back and forth between scenes. Combined with smart use of music and sounds, it all helps to build suspense in our minds, doubtless a major objective of the director.  Well, he kept me on the edge of my seat, even had me talking to the actors to be careful here, and not be so naive there.

1246,VILenin,My theory...,9,22 October 2001,"Before I start, I want to say I loved...*loved*...this film.  It was the first Lynch film I've seen, and I was thoroughly impressed.  It was most certainly the most enthralling, entertaining movie I've seen this year.Anyways, I have a theory about what it means.  This is just my interpetation, and I'm most likely wrong.  But, I think there is no correct answer to what a film like this means.  This interpetation is just what I would like the movie to mean.  I think that that the first part of the movie represented the kind of movie that most audiences would like to see.  A mysterious beginning followed by a detective story to keep the pace. The main characters are a successful, beautiful actress and a up-and-coming, beautiful actress from Canada. In between, we have humorous scenes such as the director with his golf club and the bungled hit on the man with the ""black book"".  It culminates in a love scene between the main characters, and a trip to the theatre.  It my opinion, this trip to the theatre is the key to the entire film.  The recorded music represents ""perfection"", or what we would like to hear.  Tapes can be edited and re-done so that the music does not have the slightest imperfection.  The woman singing that wonderful song faints in the middle of it, revealing to the audience the true nature of the music.  Notice the theater is called 'Silencio' and that the last word in the film is the same.  The point here is that sometimes perfection is misleading, and that silence is a better option.  I'm not sure if I want the silence to mean just silence and facing reality, or if I want it to mean death.  The death idea would make sense because we can interpret the old people from when we first see Betty that were smiling and laughing as a sign that they are eagerly awaiting the silence and destruction of the attempts of ""perfection"" in life.  Obviously, the second story featuring Diane is anything but perfect.  It represents reality, and unfortunatley reality is very far from being perfect.  We see the fall of Diane and her relationship with Camille.  In the end, she is stalked by the laughing old people we saw earlier and Diane kills herself out of desperation.  Again, I'm not sure if I want her death to symbolize the affects of trying to reach perfection in life or for it to be Diane realizing that death is the only way to silence society's pressures of ""perfection"".  All I know is that I was profoundly moved by the movie, and my immediate reaction was that I didn't know why I was so moved and that maybe it was too deep to verbalize.  Although I've obviously tried to verbalize my thoughts on it, I think that Lynch has somehow created something that is impossible to emotionally describe in it's entirty.",Mulholland Drive

1248,rhipidon,Very good.,10,12 April 2002,"If David Lynch's Mulholland Drive is going to do anything, it will confuse the hell out you.  In all likelihood, most who exit the cinema will wonder, was that a very weird film, or was it an incredibly bizarre dream?Originally intended as a television series, Mulholland Drive was cancelled shortly after the pilot was made.  Not wanting to let his dream die, Lynch added some new scenes converting it into a feature length movie.  Because it began as a television series, a number of affairs remain unresolved.  But after seeing what Lynch has managed to create with what little he had, this is forgivable.The film reeks of Lynch's earlier work.  In fact, this one acts almost as a show reel of its predecessors.  Some fantastic camera pans and lush music make appearances here, which are now Lynch staples.  To boot we have the usual dark settings and bizarre characters.  We're also treated to a narrative that decides upon changing directions somewhat.  In fact, after a time it basically allows another story with new characters - or are they? - to take the helm.The film depicts the move to Hollywood of an aspiring actress named Betty Elms, played by Naomi Watts.  She is the starry-eyed small town girl who, upon arrival meets Rita (Laura Harring).  Rita had been a woman by the name of Camilla Rhodes, but suffered amnesia after being involved in a car accident before she could be murdered.  Betty decides to help Rita find her identity and, to put it mildly, the two become close friends.Sound complicated? There is more.  The film also plays host to a number of characters, all seemingly unrelated but connected in some way or another.The key theme here appears to be dreams, or some sort of notion of them. Not only does the film play out like a dream, but they are referenced frequently by characters.  A seemingly unimportant character at the beginning mentions that he would never want his recurring nightmare real. Betty on the other hand decides to make her ambition of movie stardom come true, following the cliché of the small town girl making good in Hollywood. However, this is a David Lynch film and dreams can quickly turn into nightmares.  Guess what? They do.The nightmares appear to be concocted by seemingly unrelated forces, in the form of bigwig movie producers and a very scary hobo.  These people, not only manipulate the casting of a film but the lives of those around them in an almost supernatural manner.For those unacquainted with David Lynch, Mulholland Drive would a good movie to start off on.

1251,Rufy Boy,Let's get this plot thing out of the way . . .,10,18 June 2002,"I think this is a masterpiece, but would not qualify as such if it had no coherent plot to it. WARNING: TOTAL SPOILER FOLLOWS-- DON'T READ ON UNLESS YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE WHO THINKS THE STORY MAKES NO SENSE, AND HAS NO DESIRE TO WORK AT FIGURING IT OUT. It is possible that once you see the story for what it is, you can open up to the rest of the delights this film has to offer.
There seems to be a lot of confusion about the plot-- even among the professional reviewers-- and much talk about how ""one sees what one wants to see"" but the actual plot is quite clear and definite once you unravel it: Two aspiring actresses show up in Hollywood at the same time (the blonde, Diane, after having won a jitterbug contest in Canada). They meet while making the rounds of auditions and become friends, even fall in love with each other and have sex-- only the black-haired one (Camilla) is much more successful at landing acting jobs and eventually drifts away from the blonde until the culmination at a party on Mulholland Drive where she announces she's marrying her director. The blonde can't take both her failure to find work and the complete rejection and has her ex-lover killed, then kills herself out of guilt and despair.Confusion arises in the viewer because virtually the entire first part of the movie (more than 80 percent of its running time) is a fever-pitch nightmare had by Diane which, in the fashion and with the ""logic"" of dreams, revisits this story but in a desperate, wish-fulfillment mode, in which she (as Betty) is talented, successful and in control of her relationship with Camilla (as Rita) who, by virtue of her amnesia, is the needy one. A very critical point to understand is that the dream occurs after Diane has paid for the hit on Camilla and before she awakens to find that it has been carried out. The dream is her last desperate attempt to arrive at some meaning and beauty in her life; it is also quite funny and prodigiously inventive. The dream's frantic re-casting of facts to protect what is left of Diane's decimated self-esteem-- often displaying a profound comprehension of the true horror and absurdity of Hollywood in its bizarre characters and incidents-- is the source of much of its humor. In this nightmare, ""Betty"" achieves the success she longed for in real life, and the admiration of ""Rita"" and many others, including Adam Kesher. In the course of MULHOLLAND DRIVE, the dream begins before the titles-- right after the opening jitterbug sequence, when the camera zeros in on Diane's bed and pillow. (Note that the strange older couple-- who I take to be Diane's proud parents-- appear in the jitterbug sequence.)The nightmare ends only at the point where Diane awakens to her neighbor's pounding at her front door. At this point, Camilla has been killed (see blue key on coffee table-- but I'm not going into all those details-- find them yourself, using Lynch's ""ten clues"".) At this point Diane has only a few hours to live. From this point the movie gives us at least one hallucination (Diane sees Camilla standing there before making coffee) and a hallucinatory flashback (the ensuing scene with Camilla on the sofa) but for the most part this final section serves to give the viewer the ""straight story"" of what really happened, using normal (shall we say, ""objective"") cinematic flashback narrative to bring it up to date. Keep your eyes and ears open and you will find many of the faces, names, locations, incidents-- snippets of reality that popped up in the nightmare, in the normal manner of our dreams. (The party at Adam Kesher's house is the greatest source of these-- keep in mind it is directly following this party that Diane arranges Camilla's murder, and has the nightmare that forms the bulk of the film.)At the very end we have one more hallucination of Diane's, as her parents reappear as mad demons, assaulting her with the horror of her failures, her guilt and her total degradation. In the panic that ensues, her only perceived escape is to shoot herself dead.Take it from there-- there are many wondrous layers to be explored in this film.

1256,argyro2331,A Film Poem,10,18 April 2006,"Never seen in my life, a film like this before.. Absolutely perfect. Of a kind that opens your mind. Of a kind that apart from entertaining, offers lots of hint to think, and think in a way that you haven't done before. Did you have? It is a totally different, innovative, amazing, unbelievable film. David Lynch is a genius. If you haven't still seen the movie, you have to see it to understand what I exactly mean. ""It's all an illusion!!"" ""Do you believe a man's behavior determines his life?"" And what about your life? Which certain behavior and choices have determined or will determine your life? ""We don't stop here!"" Where you in the wrong place the wrong time? ""My name is RITA?"" Would you prefer sometimes to forget who you were, what you had done and become someone else? Would you prefer, sometimes, to be someone else? Someone like Rita Hayworth? Have you regretted for your choices?? Oh, yes! It's all an illusion. That's not the reality. This is not, what you thought it was!! This is completely something totally else!! ""We wish you all the luck of the world with you!"" And where did the luck gone?? It went to Rita who probably stole your dreams...and left a small second part/role for you! You choose which reality you will live? Which you like most? What about behavior? What about conformism? What about "" I sense trouble?"" What about a strange key? Will you keep it? What about the fear in front of an illusion, in front of a big lie? What about meanings?That's how I sensed this unique film.. I highly recommend it as a masterpiece of a kind!

Anyway - soon you will begin to realize that only some of the events of the movie is what have happened and the rest is more or less fictional.I consider a young girl's refusal to accept reality as (the outstanding) main theme of the movie.Reminds me of Memento (2000) but this one is even more mind twisting.9/10 (my highest).

The first time i saw it i understood absolutely nothing of what was going on. I was blown away and i kinda HAD TO watch the movie again. Because i needed to understand it. But as i said i understood almost nothing of the film the first time. The second time though, i discovered a lot of clues and saw different things that could help me unsolve the riddle. It is impossible'to solve the mystery completely. And every viewer will come up with their own conclusions. And that is what makes this movie so great. The characters are great, the actors are great (the acting starts a little dull, but it is all done for a reason)the camera angles everything. I have seen this movie about 4 times or something like that and it is definitely the best riddlesolving movie and it is actually as good as other classics like memento, the usual suspects and donnie darko.p.s i have to say, this movie IS NOT for everybody.

But starting from the 20th minutes something drastically changed and I got sticked to the screen. After watching it till the end I realized that I understood nothing from it. I started rewatching it from the beginning. I took me 6 hours on watching it back and forth, and another week to understand what I watched. In the end I came across with an article that said there are 10 hints to the film. But it's was not enough. You can watch it many times (what I did) and find something new each time.

But the longer I watched the more ridiculous it became. The longer it went on, the more ridiculous it became.  Too many characters were introduced that had no relevance to the story. The plot was shaky, erratic and just plain bizarre.  I honestly believe that David Lynch puts garbage together, slaps his name on the box, and laughs as everyone tries to figure out his montage of nothing.  I truly appreciate movies that are unique and take chances but this was a giant waste of my time.  All of the poetic eccentrics will say that those who didn't like this movie are too dumb or lazy to figure it out.

So why watch it at all? Honestly, I made the mistake to believe what thousands of critics said. My life would have been better without watching it. However, I guess it is not only the incredible stupidity of the plot why many become so enthusiastic about Mulholland Drive. It could very well be that ""some strong sexuality"" which entertains the perverts.

Some will describe it as being suspensefull but no, its just slow.

1270,zzen321,Emperor's New Clothes,4,16 October 2001,"What is the point? Well, no one is really sure (maybe Lynch knows)... but the film seems to be about Hollywood's corruption of innocence and artistic integrity.Ok, if you'd like to make such a point, why do it in such a convoluted way? Well, apparently David Lynch thinks it's great art to leave the audience confused. That is, to make a film so surrealistic that there is really no logic, and therefor it leaves critics unable to attack the lack of structure in the story.It's really a worthless experimental piece. Much like the exploration of jazz music in the 60's that slowly peeled away the structure of music, to the point that one is left with incomprehensible and chaotic noise. Guess what? Random noise is not music ... and incoherent structure is not great art!Lynch spends a great deal of time developing interesting characters in the first half of the film. A comedic bent is shown with the hit man who has everything go wrong, and with the sinister cowboy Bob. But do these sub-plots go anywhere? No, they don't really... after Rita wakes up muttering ""silencio"", everything in the movie turns into a dream sequence. And all the sub-plots are tied together in a cursory and nonsensical way, as is often the case in a dream.Does nonsensical dreams make great art? I don't think so ... and neither does this movie.",Mulholland Drive
1271,tatefamily,An in depth look at a tortured soul,10,7 November 2006,"David Lynch is an artist. Pure and simple. His most recent film MD is a beautiful look at such topics as jealousy, fear, love, hate and betrayal. The concept of a film as a perpetual mystery where the viewer is asked to explore the hidden meanings as opposed to ""who did it"" is a wonder to behold. I have read interpretation of the film ranging from a veiled blasphemy to a modern day rendition of the Wizard of Oz. I believe that Lynch requires an open mind and a superior intellect from his viewers if they hope to tap the arcane wisdom that his movies hold. Is Mulholland Dr. something that will appeal to everyone? No, and that is just fine. As long as Lynch enjoys what he is doing and has the respect of his peers and fans, everyone else can go pack the local multiplex to see the drool du joure.",Mulholland Drive

Its totally fine having your own opinion about things and i rly dont mind people having bad opinions but.. when i see people writing how this is the worst movie ever, how it doesent make sense and how they actually were finding clues about this and answers and how it still didnt make sense fore them( saying also how they are clever guys..), or things like ""what is the point about this movie when all was a dream"", or pointless story that goes nowhere, or how only hardcore Lynch fans can like this.
This movie is actually the first movie i have ever voted. The first movie that i have ever felt a need to vote, because i just cant stop thinking about him. This for me makes movie so great, when you actually watch it and then you are keep thinking about it days, even weeks after, when you are crying couple of times because of him, when you almost every day listen to Angelo Badalamenti's track and feel gosebumps. Beleive me guys i think i have never been so in love with some movie like this one even if i watched a lot of movies.
I felt a need to create an account on imdb just to vote this 10/10, even if i knew about imdb and ratings and stuff, and was always on imdb checking out votes of movies.
When i watch a movie that have a straight forward basic story and there was nothing behind it, that is just not that good for me, i watch it and its over, no feelings, no needs, nothing. Maybe i have some kind of feeling for 1 hour, then its over, i am gonna probbably forgot about him after some time. Of course i am not gonna say that movies are bad, its just something is missing, something that exist here in ""Mulholland drive"".
And now for those people who i meontined before...
This movie actually make a perfect sense, i am not gonna explain it because there is already a lot of stuff on internet where you can actually find a great explanation of this, and also some user reviews here who actually explained good. Maybe you are not gonna find everything explained at the first place but that is not ""0 sense"". So stop saying how this makes no sense after you even try to find clues, because i just cant understand that.
What is the point of movie if all was a dream? Well.. the point is how Hollywood actors have their worst nightmares when they come there and how tragic their story ends. Their dream of success which represents the dream in this movie turn into their worst nightmare, and thats so sad, haunting, etc..
Only hard Lynch fans can like this? I am not a Lynch fan, i didnt even know who the director of this is when i watched this, i didnt even know that he exists.
Pointless story that goes nowhere?
As i said this movie makes perfect sense, and when you get it there is a story behind, and its not the bad story.
And yes, i forgot about someone saying ""who gets this movie, they are only pretend they get it"", please just make some effort to find an explanation for this.Cheers guys, great movie, i want to give it 11/10 but it doesent work.

However, the slow-moving plot (?) crept along and tried my patience.  The lesbian sex scenes were well done, however, without being couched in a logical plot with some explanation, they came off as voyeuristic eye-candy that would unquestionably appeal to male-dominated Hollywood moguls.

1278,belshel-22096,Mulholland Drive is beyond a movie. It's a darkly magical Journey,10,13 April 2021,"I have watched MD at six or seven times during the last twenty years. I like to watch it anew every couple of years, and each time is a complex, exciting, highly-satisfying experience. For me it is the only film that is a round, perfect 10.Everything is amazing - the mysterious atmosphere, the vivid cinematography, the outstanding acting. Naomi Watts is no less than sublime in her role. She is very intense and succeeds in conveying this intensity in the most spectacular manner. This is a movie that makes you live with the characaters and Feel an array of emotions.It deals with jealousy, ambition, failure, love, insanity, guilt, total despair.The process is very fluid, tense and at times melancholic. The conclusion is tragic and scary in equal measures.Two scenes that are particularly remarkable for the emotions they evoke (in me, at least) and that I consider as among the most powerful in cinema are -
1) The guy in the diner with his shrink. He insists that at the backyard there's a monster, and he's awfully scared. The shrink then encourages him to go check the backyard together, to see for himself that there's no monster there. But when they do exactly that, a frightening figure suddenly peeks from behind the wall and briefly shows itself with a hideous smile. Upon seeing it, the guy loses consciousness on the spot.Interpretation - The moster is the darkest part of the subconscious, perhaps a terrible deed, a sin so horrific that the sinner cannot deal with it, thus it is well concealed in the back brain. But should the sinner confront it, stand in front of her/his secret with open eyes, s/he would not be able to take it, it would instantly kill them. (That, of course, what happened to Diane). In a wider sense, it doesn't have to be a sin. It could be any serious past trauma, devastating truth or great fear that maybe would better stay buried in the subconscious.2) The masturbation scene of Diane. It's one of the saddest, powerfully emotional scenes I've ever seen. Naomi Watts is brilliant here and the directing is genious too.In short, give yourself this special experience. Read the interpretations afterwards. Watch it again. I know that I surely will.",Mulholland Drive

About the movie itself, here goes: The first 2 hours of the movie is Diane's ""dream"" or nightmare if you prefer. The last half hour, is reality. People have a tough time figuring out what's in the ""box"" that camilla opens. This box, (In Diane's dream), represents the desire to return to reality. Think about it, the box gets opened, then we cut to the scene to Diane being woken up by here neighbor knocking on the door. The box itself is pure symbolism...the symbol to return to the real world.

I went to see it anyway because it was recommended by several critics whom I normally trust.  Ten minutes into the movie I was regretting my decision.  The characters are intentionally shallow and archetypal, almost grotesquely so.  I presume this is so that Lynch can more easily use them as pivot points for his ""brilliantly surreal"" ideas and imagery but I found myself wondering if he even knows how to explore depth in a character.  Furthermore, the dialogue is atrocious.  Conversations are filled with meaninglessly profound statements that have little to do with the scene or the character who says them.  Added to this are long, artificial silences and shared, pregnant gazes that, all told, made me feel like I was being clubbed in the head repeatedly by Lynch's ""vision"". The plot itself is muddled and irrelevant.  It is merely an excuse for Lynch to disgorge his self-indulgent whims.  Lynch does not portray a story but ideas.  The problem is that the ideas aren't related.  Random scenes with characters who play no part in the actual furtherance of the story are liberally sprinkled in among relevant scenes. The cinematography and music were effective in their design but I found myself questioning Lynch's choices.  He built tension in harmless scenes and jubilation in ordinary ones.  After two hours of this the net effect was that I was tired of being manipulated to no discernible end. There are those who would claim that all of the flaws I have mentioned are simply elements of Lynch's peculiar and captivating style.  To them I say that it does not take a genius to throw a random sampling of fever-dreams and drug fantasies together in front of a camara and it is certainly does not make art.",Mulholland Drive

It makes me wonder if maybe the director is sitting somewhere laughing at the critics and all of the other Hollywood parasites running around discussing the profound meaning of this quote or that scene. Okay I get it...she was in love with this girl and she is betrayed so she has her killed and feels guilty and shoots herself and imagines a whole new life ala ""life flashing before your eyes, don't go into the light"" blah blah blah....I think that he best clue is the scene in that theater with the guy saying there is no orchestra, and telling us it's all just a recording.

Approaching this movie, I was trying to understand whether what ""people"" think is true or if it only reflects a lazy approach to cinema, where everything is not clear should be revealed brightly at the end of the plot, with a wonderful and heartbreaking twist. This is not the case. The story is so linear and simple, but it appears this way only if you are able to reconstruct and give a sense to every single scene. Anyway, this is not the classical movie where a story is broken into pieces which are then mixed ad-hoc, allowing you to understand everything only at the last scenes. Here there is more: you have to think, to watch with your eyes, with your brain and, of course, to restart the movie from the beginning more than once.

From a technical standpoint, Mulholland Drive is stunning, as David Lynch's films usually are, and it is also superbly acted, especially by Naomi Watts. David Lynch's direction is par excellence and he definitely should be nominated for the Academy Award, given his stellar work. His biggest task throughout the film is weaving in and out of a scattered yet brilliant screenplay, which Lynch wrote himself. At one point, the average viewer might not know exactly what to make of Mulholland Drive, and many who have seen the movie still dont have a clue. Most of the film's detractors despise the film primarily because they cannot understand it; those who praise it just dont care. Last but not least of which is David Lynch, who has made a career of going against the grain. He has finally found a way to top Blue Velvet(1986), his previous best, for which he was nominated for best director. This film is truly his magnum opus. This film is infinitely superior to The Lord Of the Rings and every other film this year. Mulholland Drive is an absolute classic.",Mulholland Drive
1294,teva_man,What the ****??,1,12 September 2003,"This is the only film I've ever seen that I watched all the way through and had no idea what it was about.  If there's any semblance of organization within it, it was beyond me.  There's *nobody* well known in it, probably because they couldn't get anyone famous to even read for it. I can't say much more because I don't understand it enough to even make comment on it.  I thought ""A Clockwork Orange"" broke the record for weirdness; I think the writers of ""Mulholland Dr."" were just trying to break that record and make something that was weirder. And if they were trying for that, they definitely achieved that...but ""A Clockwork Orange"" makes sense and is beautifully written, despite the porn. The *only* thing that I didn't say ""what the ****?"" to in ""Mulholland Dr."" was the nasty car crash at the beginning. I hope none of the old actors in the Motion Picture Retirement Home (which happens to be located on the same road) didn't jump out of their wheelchairs in shock!",Mulholland Drive
1295,therightperson-55028,Outstanding film!,8,15 August 2021,"Haunting, beautiful, depressing, deceiving. David Lynch captures broken dreams that is the essence of Hollywood. Watching this movie, especially on a repeated viewing, the film evokes so much emotion in ways that you just get wrapped up in it. Everything isn't as it seems when a young and naïve woman named Betty arrives in Los Angeles with hopes of becoming a big movie star. Or a great actress. Or both! She meets a brunette woman in her aunt's apartment that has lost her memory as the result of a terrible car crash. Together, the pair set out to find her true identity. What follows is bizarre, surreal and most certainly will have you reeled in till the credits. This is probably, without a doubt, David Lynch's strongest film.",Mulholland Drive

The film had made no sense and nothing came together.Then I started to figure it out (and its pretty straight forward).  It seems to me there are two different ""worlds"".  The fantasy(first half) and reality(second half) are separated by the blue cube.  If you watch the second half first, then think of the first half as a fantasy redo created by Diane, most everything makes sense.  I'm not saying this is definitely what Lynch was going for, but it makes sense.I'm only posting this because it seems like a lot of people didn't come up with this.  For about 20 minutes after watching it, I couldn't either and it was driving me crazy.I think the people who hate the movie would like it more with an explanation.  However, the people who were in love with it, but couldn't even come up with an explanation for it would actually like it less knowing it makes sense.Before I had an explanation for it I was going to give it a 3, but now I think I will give it a 10.

1297,alexeldertheman,David Lynch's Nightmarish Masterpiece,10,2 August 2010,"Wow I first watched this movies with my friends because we all heard of a hot lesbian scene. I wasn't expecting much, as had no real interest in David Lynch, ( at that time i had only seen Dune, which was a pretty crappy movie to be honest). Well after watching the movie I had left feeling awestruck. I was mesmerized by its non-linear and confusing film noir-narrative. But I was still left in a daze of what the hell it all meant. This was my first Lynch film, so i wasn't prepared for the weirdness that transpired. First thing I did after watching Mulholland Dr. was that I went and logged into my computer, 'googled' it and read several theories on how people deciphered the film. I later regret doing this, as Mulholland Dr. is a film for you, the viewer, to draw your own conclusions on. This picture merits countless viewing and requires careful focus to catch all the clues and hidden themes. This film also contains great acting performances from all the cast, mainly Naomi Watts, who is captivating as she switches between multiple facets of her character, Justin Theroux who is perfect as the casting director, and Laura Harring, who gives a darkly sexual performance as the woman with amnesia. This movie is a must-watch for the intelligent film-goer, it stands apart with a certain group of films from the recycled Hollywood garbage that people watch today. Mulholland Dr. is a work of art, it isn't meant to be interpreted logically scene after scene but rather an experience of the mind, as if unraveling the mysteries of a sinister puzzle box. The movie contains a lot of metaphors, and I believe one of them is how Hollywood and the studios control everything, and how they give the lurid promise of stardom to upcoming actresses",Mulholland Drive
1298,cinemasnob,"Sexy, Mysterious, and Thoroughly Lynch",9,9 October 2001,"David Lynch may be the sanest madman working in film today. He is a dark, sinister, and cynical overlord trapped in a world of Eisenhower-era optimism. At his best, Lynch can cast a long, menacing shadow of doom and dread over an idyllic and innocent tableau. And when he really excels, his films -- like ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Wild at Heart"" -- smolder with a psychosexual tension that's hotter than Georgia asphalt.Immediately sexy and mysterious, ""Mulholland Drive"" plays with the conventions Lynch toyed with in the underrated ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me"" and in his truly bizarre ""The Lost Highway"". Characters are not whom they seem to be, lightness and darkness collide with a cool, enigmatic flicker, and people and objects vanish without a trace. Welcome to Lynch's world: a world that is simultaneously comforting and unsettling. But if you take a few deep breaths and relax, it's a strange world that you wish would extend beyond the film's two and a half-hour running time.With only one viewing, it's nearly impossible to pinpoint exactly what ""Mulholland Drive"" is all about. This aspect is sure to frustrate moviegoers who look for easy answers to the point of exhaustion. But for those who exercise patience and have an appreciation for auteurism, the payoff is worth its weight in dancing midgets.As with nearly all Lynch films, the protagonists do not necessarily remain the center of attention. The supporting cast of creeps and oddballs are just as important to the director. And the weirdoes and wackos are in no short supply in ""Mulholland Drive"". To the viewer's delight and confusion, they keep crawling out of the woodwork that frames Lynch's seedy vision.But as fascinating as the peripheral characters are, their vastly unexplained existence mars the film. It's as if Lynch was so enamored with his own character concepts that he chose to ignore that they don't propel the plot forward. The viewer is constantly in a state of wanting to know more about the characters, their seemingly inexorable duality, and their frequently iffy motivations. Despite this, though, ""Mulholland Drive"" is richly entertaining in its own disjointed way.",Mulholland Drive
1299,movienerd7,"Just 'cause it's weird, doesn't mean it's good!",1,27 April 2002,"this is the first - and last - film i've seen by lynch. needless to say i thought it was horrible. the acting is bad, the dramatic pauses are gut-wrenching, and there is no plot. well, okay, i take that back, there *is* a plot, but it's *bad*. you can tell that most critics have no idea what the film was about other than it was dramatic and pretty. lynch butchered the plot (he cut it up and rearranged it), and gave the viewer no clue as to how to put it back together again. this is more than a little frustrating. many have argued that the cinematography was wonderful, and the scenes were intriguing. yes, the cinematography was good, and all the pauses were *very* dramatic, but i like my movies to make at least a little bit of sense, or at least admit that they're not going to. instead, lynch drags you through the movie, with plot twists and characters, and allows for the shadow of a hope that maybe it'll all come together in the end. it doesn't. instead lynch confused the audience even more by changing both of the character's names and status. so, to anyone thinking of seeing mulholldan dr., be forewarned that the movie probably isn't going to make sense the first time you see it, so if you like movies that have plot you might want to skip this one. however, if you just want to watch beautiful, confused girls talk to each other then this movie is for you.

Once the big switch happens, everything good goes away and we go so far down the Lynch-only road all we want is to go home. Far too many loose ends for me.Theatre was standing room only, I say that because there were no seats and one guy actually stood the entire movie, though he wished he had seen another show when over.

What really surprised me though, was that there is an uncharacteristically strong message (The evils of Hollywood- not that its is in any way unique)in the movie, contrary to some of his former films. Also, many aspects fall into places quite well in the last half an hour. I cannot agree with those who claim the film lacks structure or is scattered.( And - wow- who looks for things like ""identification or compassion with a character"" in a David Lynch movie???)",Mulholland Drive

I think I'll go and make a movie that seems like it's going somewhere, only to get more and more random and unintelligible. Then I'll just tell the audience to draw their own conclusions while I rake in the cash.I loved the beginning, especially the fact that I only knew a couple of actors playing small roles. More films need to do this; how can you take a film seriously when a leading character has just been larking around in a slapstick comedy for example.My enjoyment of the movie carried on through to the moment when Camilla opened the blue box. Then it got a lot more random and I quickly realised that the film was going nowhere. I tried to justify spending money on the DVD by convincing myself it's a thinking mans film but it just wouldn't sink in.The only way I can comfort myself after watching this film is to believe that David Lynch has secretly took the mickey out of everyone by pretending it means something.Now that really would be clever...",Mulholland Drive

I had no chance keeping up with the plot (as in many Lynch films) , but actually because of this I think this film was so intense to me. Lost Highway was disturbing too, but cannot compete with this one. It's great to see that David Lynch is still the master of his genre. Naomi Watts acting was astonishing. Also it was nice to see so many new faces in this great film. Don't see this movie, if you just want to eat some popcorn and have a nice evening with your friends.

What a gorgeous movie!,10,26 October 2001,"If one of the functions of art is to increase one's capacity for empathy and encourage adoration of the human, Mulholland Drive is an incredibly effective work.  I can't imagine anyone seeing the movie and not falling in love with Betty and Rita. Any character who takes a chance like the one that Betty takes at the beginning of the film will always grab me.  Rita is nearly a blank slate through most of the film, but even when Lynch starts to layer onto her character a few unsavory pigments, it detract from my fondness for her.The movie also has a non-linear sort of layout that I found very pleasing. This seems to allow Lynch to show us just enough in the way of what might be cherished ideas for him: without revealing so much that he cheapens those ideas.  The film has the sort of evanescence that tends to hang over most beautiful things.  And yet, it's not simply a series of lovely images strung together.  Each of the scenes that brought me close to tears (A scene from Wild at Heart is the only one that ever made me cry in a theatre) brought to mind this phrase/fragment: adoration of the human.I feel tempted to go out and buy a television and VCR so that I can watch this movie over and over again.

1306,sandradh,Mulholland Drive's myriad interpretations,10,4 February 2007,"The weird thing about watching Mulholland Drive (probably 15 times now)is that each time I try REALLY hard to understand it, each time I see new things, each time I find new revelations, and then if enough time has passed, I have new discoveries that I then ""remember"" that I actually figured out a while ago. At least it's riveting. Also, it's the most REALISTIC view of the topography and people of LA I've ever seen, and I'm from the Valley. I actually saw it the first time in York, England and couldn't believe how homesick it made me. I kept turning to people and saying, ""Yeah it really looks just like that!"" Which is odd because it is a fantasy. I've read a few comments on this site and others. Everything sort of makes sense, but not really. My daughter said the first time when I thought it was a comment of the degrading nature of Hollywood, ""Mom, she isn't even an actress! She's a prostitute!"" Which I believe is true. Then I couldn't figure anything out the first time. It was 3 times before my son (my twins are 25 in case you thought I was letting kids see the film) ""Mom, the blond kills her cause she's jealous!"" I didn't even know she did that. And it was a few more times before I realized the girl on the bed was Diane. Once I read an interpretation that the whole thing was not Diane's fantasy but Camilla. I thought that was really crazy until last night when I watched it. Believe it or not, it actually makes MORE sense that way. Camilla is the ""expresso"" and the director (member that look when Adam and Diane look at each other?) picks Diane and Camilla kills HER. He's used to messing with prostitutes.

And I didn't even have a date.  I went with family members.David Lynch is my favorite director.  I have never, ever been disappointed with anything he has produced.  Can you really say the same about other directors (Bruckheimer, the latest Batman travesties, Reiner, etc etc and so forth).  Everything was in place, everything was on par - the acting talent of the cast, the imagery of the environments and scenery, the music and audio background, the shooting angles of the cameras, the plot twists and turns, the colors used, the openings for further potential and further dreaming.  What does Lynch do differently?  How can he do so much better what virtually every single other director out there is screwing up?No spoilers here.  Go see it.

Film inspires the mind and takes us to places where we can never go, or have never dreamed of going.  Great directors allow me to dream, while awake and asleep.  A great film inspires me, kickstarting my imagination and creativity to new levels, providing me with esthetic euphoria.David Lynch's Mulholland Drive...what can I say.  The best two and a half hours spent in a movie theatre in a long long long time.  Not since Being John Malkovich in 1999 have I been so ""wowed"" by how powerful film can be.I know that many many people will ultimately loathe Mulholland Drive.  I know that those like me who appreciate it for what it is, will be forever thankful to have been taken on such an amazing trip.  What an outstanding collage of scattered images, glossed over with moody Badalamenti music, industrial sounds and kitschy dialogue.  I love being surprised by a film, and I love being teased, tormented and forever tainted by a brilliant director who is comfortable enough with his own inner instincts and private thoughts to commit them to celluloid.  This film embodies everything that I love about film.  I will see it countless times and will discuss it endlessly with those, like me, who appreciate powerful filmmaking like this. Totally uncompromising, Mulholland Drive is a clear view into the subconscious minds of one of Hollywood's greatest mavericks.  David Lynch must be the happiest man in the world.  How many people on this planet ever get to fully unleash their full creativeness with carte-blanche.  This film is exactly what he intended to create, and there were producers willing to finance it.  Thank heaven.I won't even begin to discuss plotlines, ABC network executive decisions, ""getting it"" versus ""not getting it"" like so many other user comments are doing.

I have a collection of favorite moments from this masterpiece, but the one that sticks, that plays in my head over and over again, is the heartbreaking Club Silencio scene. Easily the best picture of the year (followed, I think modestly, by ""Memento""), I hate that it will inevitably be ignored come Oscar time. Not that the awards matter. Lynch is far above that.

I was yelling in anger at the screen when whatever shred of a plot there was completely disintegrated. This movie gave me emotional repercussions similar to what I would experience if 90% of the way through Indiana Jones we find out that there actually is no Arc and Indiana was actually on meth the whole time and everything was his drug-induced hallucination.

Imagine you go to see a movie, and you really start to like it.  You get really interested in the plot, which is both intricate and mysterious.  You start to really care for the characters.  You get really involved in what is happening.  The characters begin to work things out, to solve their problems.  It seems that a climactic resolution of the principle story arcs is about to be consumated.  But then it is revealed, that you were actually just watching actors who were making a movie, and the movie you are watching now concerns itself with the lives of those actors.  That would be quite a jarring non-resolution to the story you thought you were watching, would it not?  You would likely feel that such a ""plot twist,"" while clever, was ultimately unsatisfying, like heavy petting that almost goes all the way, only to be interrupted by the discovery that your partner's gender is not what you thought it was.  Well, that's what it's like watching Mulholland Drive. It takes more than good casting, great acting, excellent cinematography, good editing, inspired directing and interesting events to make a good movie.

The lead actresses were stellar.  Watch for Laura Herring to become a major star (surprised this is my first notice of her--stunning!). Great Lynchian moments throughout--camera dwelling on objects, jump-edits to unexplained scenes out of the blue, characters enter and exit leaving the audience hanging, dread inducing soundtrack/ambient sound, and more.

Until today, U-turn was one of the oddest film spectacles I'd seen, this movie made U-turn look like the Care Bears movie. The plot is almost beyond explanation. The main characters are either the same person, in love, or only exist in a complex dream sequence. The subplots and supporting characters are dark, eerie, and never resolve. In fact, the whole movie never resolves. But, that isn't the point and you realize this very early. This movie is extremely sensual. It completely envelopes you while never fully revealing the direction of the film. You hang on every detail hoping to deduce the plot, but it is that attention to detail and the non-existance of reality/logic that makes the rich textures of the film almost orgasmic. The acting from Naomi Wells and Laura Harring (both of which are extremely, extremely, extremely hot -- especially during the remarkably tasteful and poignant lesbian sex scene -- yes you heard right) is phenomenal and their ability to transition in and out of characters seamlessly keeps the audience wonderfully bewildered. I don't know how to do this thing justice. Quite frankly, you don't understand the imagery, metaphor, or the overall themes of the movie fully, or at all for that matter, but at the same time -- you don't care.

Lynch has done, with Mulholland Drive, what filmmaking should do.  He is pushing boundries, he is not giving the audience easy answers, he is not force feeding you plot lines and obviousness.  As I said in my one line summary I do not care what this film was about, what it means, or what was happening, I was simply in awe by the film.  It was like a dream, and just like I dream I ended watching the film scratching my head but also realizing how great it was to experience.  I hope that Lynch and others make more films like this that don't lend to stupid ""Hollywood"" expectations, or mass audience tastes.  >",Mulholland Drive
1323,theuns,Could you explain this to me?,4,17 January 2002,Great moviemaking but I have to see it again as I lost the plot a few times.

""Unconscious expression""...""Somehow victimized""...""In a sense""...""Seemingly random"". I think the only people who enjoyed this are the same snobs who go to wine tasting parties, and ""teach"" each other how to sniff a glass of wine, and swirl it, and then stare at the wine, and talk snobbily to each other about the aroma and body of a certain year, and how the wine awakens the spirit and blah blah blah, and Oh! isn't that a lovely painting on the wall over there it looks like the artist was trying to randomize the pointless expressionism and searching his inner childlike quantitative randomness of the pointlessness of blah blah blah.

About the cast...Naomi Watts it's an excellent choice!! The changes her character goes through work extremely well due to her ability to morph her character so well. Justin Theroux and Laura Harring make it work too. David Lynch is a great director!! He takes you on a hallucinating trip in his own world! I must say...i love the ride!

Mulholland Drive is actually the only film that distinguishes intelligent people from the rest. To this day, I only know one other person who understands the film.  And yes, to the nay-sayers, Lynch intended for there to be more questions raised than answered, but the questions are of our waking state and ourselves, not questions like ""what was up with the homeless dude and the old people?""

The plot is so twisted, with characters who are merged together, and swap names etc that the film is impossible to understand, let alone enjoy. As far as i could make out there are THREE storylines, one of these involves a guy who has bad dreams, the other about a film producer who is forced to hire one particular girl as the lead, and the third about a woman who is in a car smash, and loses her memory. in the final storyline, with the woman in the crash, various parts of that thread are repeated, with the characters as different people (ie swapping places)....

Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems that the contents of Mulholland Drive were already covered in Lost Highway.  There are striking similarities in the two movies that no one else has yet commented on.
So, because Lynch didn't have the budget to make the movie he really wanted to with Lost Highway, he simply remade the movie again once he had some more money.  It rather angered me that Mulholland Dr. was almost predictable in where the movie was heading for any David Lynch fan.  As a fan, I would really like to see some new ideas from him, if he has any.    Now, that being said, Mulholland Drive is a fantastic movie for someone who isn't a Lynch fan. The dream landscape, beautiful camerawork, loss of innocence theme, non-linear plot lines, great soundtrack are all the stuff an art film fan dreams of.",Mulholland Drive
1333,zero1071,A real mind-f***er of a movie.,7,11 May 2002,"Weird, very, very weird.  If a plot, story, or conclusions is what you're looking for this is not the movie for you.  It's like a weird disconnected dream.  You're not sure what's going on or who the characters are.   You think you know who three of the characters are, but you have no idea.  You think you know what they're doing.....you don't.  Characters become other people, people show up, die, are never heard from again, then pop up in unexpected places for no real discernable reason.  It's confusing, and somewhat irritating because there's no conclusion.  It just ends, like a dream.  I'm glad I saw it, but if I knew then what I know now I would have rented something else. As I said, it's a real mind-f***er of a movie.",Mulholland Drive
1334,jlee462,One of the most intricate plots I have ever seen,10,23 January 2002,"I expected Mulholland Drive to be very peculiar based on David Lynch's earlier work.  It was definitely different than most movies and much better. This movie displays Lynch's originality, but also defines him as a great visionary.  Never before have I seen a movie that weaves reality and perception so beautifully.  At times Lynch is purposefully vague so that you will walk out of the movie scratching your head trying to put the pieces together.  The great part about the movie is that the pieces do fit together.  Everything in this movie has meaning and represents either something tangible or intangible.  This movie is definitely a movie to play close attention to.  I believe David Lynch has set the bar for moviemaking. Absolutely ingenious!!",Mulholland Drive

Please Mr. Lynch, dont believe your hype and get a grip.",Mulholland Drive
1336,chriswhite-7,I hate this film!,1,11 June 2007,"'Mulholland Drive' has now replaced 'Bad Boys 2' at the top of my list of movies never to see - here's why:1. All of the information needed to understand a film should be contained within it - if the audience leaves the cinema needing an explanation of what happened, then the film has missed it's mark. Leaving things 'open to interpretation' is what the Wachowski brothers claimed to be doing with their two dire Matrix sequels. If a writer's answer to 'how do I convey this information?' is 'I just won't bother' - that is the sign of lazy writing. If the explanation for the first half of the film is ""it was a dream"", then that is a piece of information that needed to be communicated by the film, not by the wikipedia entry.2. The visuals are not beautiful, they are not haunting - they are not even cinematic. The made-for-TV pedigree absolutely shows through, the whole thing is shot at a low standard. Point me towards one, single frame that is memorable or striking, one image that actually sticks in your head. (For example: Cillian Murphy walking through the streets of an empty London in '28 Days Later' was striking imagery)3. The music is irritating. Most of the time we have a low keyboard drone, presumably meant to generate an atmosphere of foreboding or menace, but actually it's just annoying.4. There's no pace, especially during the first half of the film; I wondered whether it was actually running slowed-down, perhaps as some clever David Lynch trick. The dialogue is repetitive and shallow. Now I know this first part of the film was a dream - so what? It isn't an excuse for making a large part of the film feel like running through treacle.5. The blue key. The weird man who jumps out behind the diner. The whole bit in the 'Silencio' theatre. The man spewing his coffee back up. The man in the wheelchair who gives orders. The cowboy. What? What the hell is going on with any of those things? Perhaps there's some hidden, cryptic meaning to be gleaned from them, but honestly I don't care. I don't watch a film so I can spend ages afterwards trying to make sense of it - there IS a difference between 'thought provoking' and 'needlessly confusing'.This film is not entertainment, it is art - with all of the negative, art-for-art's-sake, ""It doesn't have to mean anything"" connotations that go along with it. A movie doesn't need car chases and gunfights to be entertaining, it doesn't need a straightforward simple narrative to be good - but if it's going to spend most of it's running time being either tedious or weird, it had damn well better have a good reason for it, a decent pay-off at the end, and this film really, really doesn't.'Mulholland Drive' certainly did provoke a reaction in me - a negative one. It certainly does stick in my head, because of all the unresolved questions (see point 5). But to say that ""any film that provokes a reaction is a good film"" is naïve, and just because I'm still thinking about it does not mean it was good. After all, a swift kick to the nuts provokes a reaction, and an unfinished argument leaves you stewing - I'd rather avoid both.",Mulholland Drive

So I did watch it. First I have to admit that I dislike mainstream movies and prefer to watch movies with a real meaning.And this is the point, why I dislike this movie. It doesn't have any meaning. It's just a combination of funny, stupid, boring, entertaining, absurd and thrilling pieces.At first I thought that this movie could be a real mystery thriller (as the German packaging read), but the movie was too mysterious for me.David Lynch may be able to make a combination of the most different images, but the composition tastes to me as awfull as a combination of milk with beer.

Lynch, like no other director (okay, maybe Altman in ""The Player"") has the ability to tell a story in a complex layering of plot lines imbedded in a feature length social commentary. And in this film he explores the nature and, ultimately, the devastating power of illusions.

1344,edais,"A movie that is visually appealing, with a story line that is appalling",5,28 April 2002,"Upon first watching ""Mulholland Dr."" I was eagerly waiting what would be, as near as I could tell, another creative drama that falls into the same genre as ""Magnolia"" or ""Requiem for a Dream.""  While it did live up to at least that expectation I had for it, it certainly did not live up to the expectation I had of it to be a good movie.  By the time the movie was over (all 2.5 hours of it) the only thing I knew for sure about it was how bad it was.  It seemed throughout the entire movie, especially the latter half, the director had been purposely trying to make every single person who watched it lost.  The end of the movie doesn't even make an attempt to tie things together, only to make them even more confusing.  Usually one can go back and watch a movie a second, third, or even fourth time until he/she understands it.  I however would not want to waste another two and a half hours of my life, again.The movie begins with a terrible accident on a road called Mulholland Drive. Just before the accident happens, a woman in the car that is hit is held at gun-point.  She ends up being the only person to make it out alive.  She flees the scene of the accident and heads into Hollywood.  The next day, after sleeping on the sidewalk, she invades a stranger's house who turns out to be the aunt of a woman named Betty--  who is new to Hollywood.  Betty finds the stranger in her aunt's house and interestingly becomes friends with her.  It turns out the woman from the accident has amnesia, so Betty decides to help her find her identity.I won't delve into the plot anymore, basically because it would take a lot more than 1,000 words.  That is not the only plot that the movie deals with. The movie deals with about 14 plots simultaneously, then decides to change everything about 3/4 of the way through the movie.  The only thing that is good about ""Mulholland Dr."" is the acting and imagery the director portrays. It appears that according to the rating this movie has gotten, the imagery doesn't have to make sense for the movie to be a masterpiece.  I am actually past the point of caring to understand it.  Watching this kind of movie makes me think that movie-making is all about shocking the audience with originality.  This movie had originality, but its originality is without a point.  If you want to watch a GOOD original movie that will keep you thinking, watch ""Donnie Darko.""  If you want to waste your time, watch ""Mulholland Dr.""",Mulholland Drive

I understand that the film is not meant to make sence and is supposed to be left up to interpritation but how can you interprate a film which has no plot or substance.

Well, as movie ended i was speechless; i thought Lynch was joking, we were all stupid and it had been a waste of time. Ten minutes later Lynch was a genius. Half an hour across that, a couple of beers and a great dinner took me to this point: How many recent directors (except Chris Nolan´s Memento) make you think about their movies after watching them? Bingo!! Lynch is Lynch, not a linear director as in The Straight Story (a joke about how simple the plot was on this one...?), and back to be a round and round upside down plot as Lost Highway was.

This is the type of movie that people pretend to like and describe as ""intellectually stimulating"" in order to justify the critics. In fact I created my account just to comment on how bad the movie was and to warn people to stay away from this movie. Plot is terrible and pointless. It's incoherent from the start which adds to either the ""mystery"" if you're a critic or plain foolishness if you're a normal person. The movie really is all over the place and ends on an even more curious note.

1352,veryhornyfox,Tedious and Doesn't Make Sense,4,15 January 2011,"SLIGHT SPOILERS I felt that this film at times managed the neat trick of being simultaneously gripping and tedious, while at other times was just plain tedious. The dark atmosphere, and tension created in ordinary scenarios drew me in and, in conjunction with the good quality of the acting, kept me from turning off at least, but the film was a massive triumph of style over substance. It makes increasingly less sense as the second half of the film develops. While it is not hard to come up with an interpretation of it, I doubt there is a truly satisfying one, and any film that has to revert to dreams before it can make any sense should be marked down in my opinion. I believe films are better when they offer a more coherent plot and entertain, rather than leave us guessing: or at the very least have just one or two explanations which most intelligent people can be reasonably expected to figure out without tremendous effort. I wonder if some people rated this film highly because they were afraid to admit they did not understand it. Fear not, the film is empty and there is nothing to understand. Either that, or the director has decided to create something pointlessly complex that cannot be easily understood. I also prefer that mysteries should be decoded within the film itself for the most part, rather than leaving them for people to guess.As the film went on, it became clear first of all that this would not be the type of flick to tie up all the loose ends. My next realisation was that it would not even resolve the main plot line (not without resorting to ""it was a dream"" anyway). As it deteriorated into further mess and nonsense, seemingly more interested in random images and symbols than telling a story, I began to expect an ending that trailed off anticlimactically. Even though I fully expected a poor ending, I was still a little stunned by how pathetic and awful the ending was. I will be making a mental note of all Lynch films and will make a reasonable effort to avoid them because the film was so desperately pretentious and delivered so little that I am convinced that I will never enjoy any of his films.For this film to unravel to make sense, some of it must be a dream. That is not good enough to me.Also, why should I have to watch it 2-3 times before I fully understand it all. It's nowhere near good enough on any level to warrant that. If I had paid money to go to the cinema to see this I would have felt cheated by those who told me to watch it again before it can be understood.Possibly the most overrated film I have ever seen and I would say one of about the 20 worst films I have ever seen.",Mulholland Drive
1353,mr-roque,A masterpiece - and much much more,10,5 September 2007,"I stumbled over this movie in April this year (2007) and didn't know what to expect. I had never seen a movie from David Lynch before. After first watching it, I was confused - I didn't understand it, but i had the feeling that it made sense anyway. It sucked me in for the whole 140 minutes and didn't let me go afterwards. I began surfing the Internet and talking to my father, who had already seen it and when I first came across the dream/reality-theory it suddenly all seemed to make sense to me. I had to watch it again.Watching it the second time changed my whole view on movies and since then nothing is as it was before. I was emotionally touched in a way i can't really describe. The movie haunted me for weeks afterwards and I had to watch it again two more times in the same week.The movie let's you take a look into a main-character's mind and heart by showing us her dreams and hallucinations, in contrast to the cruel reality she is facing.And this is done so perfectly. The haunting score of Badalamenti, the shaky camera work of David Lynch, the lighting, the music and of course the acting. Naomi Watts is just terrific - as Betty who is the nice, naive little girl from Deep River, Ontario - and as Diane, heartbroken and desperate. You can almost feel the anguish of her tormented soul. It is, in my opinion, one of the best performances in movie history.There just isn't a movie that can move me the way ""Mulholland Drive"" does - and I've been looking for one. All the other David Lynch movies are great, too, but not one comes close. ""Vertigo"" might be the best contender so far.Thank you David Lynch for this extraordinary work of art.",Mulholland Drive

The homeless person comes into the movie all of the sudden and than again towards the end with the mysterious blue box but yet just when I thought that would open up my eyes to some hidden, brilliant meaning that I was simply missing, it went nowhere.  One more example, who were the two guys that forced the director to pick Camilla as the actress. Why did they want Camilla?  Oh, that's right, they never say why.  Why should they?  The movie never says why it does anything.  I rented it knowing that I would hate it.  I have always hated David Lynch movies.

The only solice that I take from this movie is that it was an aborted TV pilot so I now do not have to worry about flipping the channels and seeing any of this pile of garbage.

The overall idea of the movie is a familiar one that has been examined in several movies, including one that I saw back in 1973 in junior high (I won't tell you the name of that movie because it would spoil your first time viewing of MD).  Lynch makes excellent use of texture and lighting in MD and the haunting soundtrack, a trademark of his movies, just helps you along.

Yes, the acting was relatively good, and the scenes themselves were artfully done, but as a movie, it falls far short.  When one watches a movie, you should leave the experience with an idea of what went on.  With Mulholland Drive, who knows what happened.  Is it all a dream? Are parts of it real and others imagined? Or more likely, did a director with too much time on his hands make a series of unrelated scenes and put them together and call it a movie? Seems like the latter is the most realistic, mainly since many reviews of the movie even admit this.  This isn't art, or a movie, it's a self-serving piece by a director who can't weave a storyline.",Mulholland Drive

It has a couple of good sex scenes but apart from that i reckon mr lynch ran out of ideas half way through the film and a monkey finished it for him.

Twenty-four hours later, I'm still wondering what happened and recommending it to friends so that they can tell me what happened.  I won't go into the plot, not out of fear of spoiling the movie, but because it seemed to not matter to the movie itself.  The closest equivalent I could make would be to describe this movie as the film making equivalent of stream of consciousness storytelling.

Lynch has been accused of selling the audience short by not explaining the meaning of it all...

A young criminal which cause a car accident , enabling thus the meeting between Betty(Diane) and Rita(Camilla)in one world, throw Camilla(Rita) from the other by killing her at the end. The passage from one existence to another is possible by opening a small blue box,like using a wormhole passing. The same people live different identities in the two worlds and in this concert conduct God Himself (The Cowboy).

1377,SSZ1-1,One of the best. Comments on Martin Andersen's post.,10,3 June 2002,"This is a great plot map of MD. I've inserted my comments in color after each SteveMartin Andersen (Martin-77) Bergen, Norway Date: 9 May 2002 There's a sign on The Lost Highway that says:*MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD*(but you already knew that, didn't you?)Since there's a great deal of people that apparently did not get the point of this movie, I'd like to contribute my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense. As others have pointed out, one single viewing of this movie is not sufficient. If you have the DVD of MD, you can ""cheat"" by looking at David Lynch's ""Top 10 Hints to Unlocking MD"" (but only upon second or third viewing, please.) ;)First of all, Mulholland Drive is downright brilliant. A masterpiece. This is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head. Not often are the comments on the DVDs very accurate, but Vogue's ""It gets inside your head and stays there"" really hit the mark.David Lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it - cinematography-wise, has great acting (esp. Naomi Watts), a haunting soundtrack by Badalamenti, and a very dream-like quality to it -- but on top of it all it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before. (After all, when is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldn't leave your mind and that everyone felt compelled to talk and write about, regardless of whether they liked it or hated it?)Allright, enough about all that, it's time to justify those statements.Most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion/a dream sequence.Of course, that's too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting ""traditional"" methods in which the story is laid out in a timely, logic and linear manner for the viewer. But for those expecting that, I urge you to check the name of the director and come back again. ;)MD is the story of the sad demise of Diane Selwyn, a wannabe-actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor, Camilla Rowles. Due to Diane's lack of talent, she is constantly struggling to advance her career, and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents' expectations. Upon realizing that Camilla will never be hers (C. becomes engaged with Adam Kesher, the director), she hires a hitman to get rid of her, and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces.The movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller; which is some 50s dance/jitterbug contest, in which we can see the main character Betty giving a great performance. We also see an elderly couple (which we will see twice more throughout the movie) together with her, and applauding her.No, wait. This is what most people see the first time they view it. There's actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits - the camera moving into an object (although blurry) and the scene quickly fading out. If you look closely, the object is actually a pillow, revealing that what follows is a dream. >this is a critical observation that I never understood...although I only watched the movie once.The main characters seen in the first half of the movie:Betty: Diane Selwyn's imaginary self, used in the first half of the movie that constitutes the ""dream-sequence"" - a positive portrayal of a successful, aspiring young actor (the complete opposite of Diane). 'Betty' was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at Winkies. Notice that in the dream version, the waitresses' name is 'Diane'.Rita: The fantasy version of Camilla Rhodes that, through Diane's dream, and with the help of an imaginary car-accident, is turned into an amnesiac. This makes her vulnerable and dependent on Diane's love. She is then conveniently placed in Betty/Diane's aunt's luxurious home which Betty has been allowed to stay in.Coco: In real life, Adam's mother. In the dream part, the woman in charge of the apartment complex that Betty stays in. She's mainly a strong authority figure, as can be witnessed in both parts of the film.Adam: The director. We know from the second half that he gets engaged with Camilla. His sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for Betty/Diane, since she develops such hatred towards him.Aunt Ruth: Diane's real aunt, but instead of being out of town, she is actually dead. Diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for Camilla's murder.Mr. Roach: A typical Lynchian character. Not real; appears only in Diane's dream sequence. He's a mysterious, influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair. He serves much of the same function as the backwards-talking dwarf (which he also plays) in Twin Peaks.The hitman: The person that murders Camilla. This character is basically the same in both parts of the movie, although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence (more on that below).Now, having established the various versions of the characters in the movie, we can begin to delve into the plot. Of course I will not go into every little detail (neither will I lay it out chronologically), but I will try to explain some of the important scenes, in relation to Lynch' ""hint-sheet"".As I mentioned above, Camilla was re-produced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a car-accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie, which left her completely vulnerable. What I found very intriguing with MD, is that Lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn't. I've already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow, but notice how there's two cars riding in each lane approaching the limo. >Another key point here is that the cars are moving too fast to be real...an indication of the dream sequence and the hint of non-reality.Only one of the cars actually hit the limo; what about the other? Even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves, wouldn't they try to help the others, or at least call for help? My theory is that, since this is a dream, the presence of the other car is just set aside, and forgotten about. Since, as Rogert Ebert so eloquently puts it ""Like real dreams, it does not explain, does not complete its sequences, lingers over what it finds fascinating, dismisses unpromising plotlines.""Shortly after Rita crawls down from the crash site at Mulholland Dr., and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into Aunt Ruth's apartment, Betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away, staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera. This is the first indication that what we're seeing is a nightmare. excellent observationAlthough the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to Betty, I think they're actually her parents (since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest). Perhaps she didn't know them all that well, and didn't really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted, so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream. They also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder, and Diane's sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life. While I do believe they are her parents, I feel they have a wonderful relationship...so good, in fact, that it's their haunting guilt that drives Diane to kill herself.A rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman. Diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept Camilla's part in the movie (from Adam's party in the second half of the movie), and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream. Because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of Camilla, a part of her wants him to miss, so she turns him into a dumb criminal.This scene, I think, is also Lynch's attempt at totally screwing his audience over, since they're given a false pretence in which to view the movie.Gotta love that 'Something just bit me bad' line, though. :)The next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at Twinkies, who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they're sitting in. After a little talk, they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence, accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene.When reaching the corner, a bum-like character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner, scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare. This nightmare exists only in Diane's mind; she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder. So, in short, her obessions translate into that poor guy's nightmares. The bum also signifies Diane's evil side, as can be witnessed later in the movie. > I'm not convinced that this translation theory is correct, but I do believe that Diane sees the masked man as the evil resident in the dark corner of every mind.  I'm wondering if there are two forces at work in the diner...the evil disfigured bum vs. the hardworking, lonely, and tired waitress (representing the other life Diane could have chosen).The Cowboy constitutes (along with the dwarf) one of the strange characters that are always present in the Lynchian landscape -- Diane only saw him for a short while at Adam's party, but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams, so can he be awarded an important part in her dream. We are also given further clues during his scenes that what we're seeing is not real (his sudden disappearance, etc.)The Cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the Director, when he meets up with him at the odd location (the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream). Also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he (Adam) does good, or two more times if he does bad. Throughout the movie he appears two more times, indicating to Diane that she did bad. He is also the one to wake her up to reality (that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice), and shortly thereafter she commits suicide.The espresso-scene with the Castigliane brothers (where we can see Badalamenti, the composer, as Luigi) is probably a result of the fact that Diane was having an espresso just before Camilla and Adam made their announcement at Adam's party in the second half. It could at the same time also be a statement from Lynch. interesting...I'll have to think about this one.During the scene in which they enter Diane's apartment, the body lying in the bed is Camilla, but notice how she's assumed Diane's sleeping position; Diane is seeing herself in her own dream, but the face is not hers, although it had the same wounds on the face as Diane would have after shooting herself. This scene is also filled with some genuine Lynchian creepiness. Since Diane did not know where (or when) the hitman would get to Camilla and finish her off, she just put her into her own home. > this is a critical observation and the confusion surrounding this theme is one of the strongest reasons I have to see it again.In real life, Diane's audition for the movie part was bad. In her dream, she delivers a perfect audition - leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performance.Also interesting is the fact that the money that in real-life was used to pay for Camilla's murder now appears in Rita/Camilla's purse. This is part of Diane's undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back, as the murder now hasn't taken place. more to the point, she's getting all the money back and Camilla back, ready to love her.  In the dream sequence, all that was lost (acting skill, money, her Aunt, parental respect, Camilla) come back to her.When her neighbor arrives to get her piano-shaped ashtray, another hint is given; she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves, yet later when Camilla and Betty have their encounter on the couch, we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table, suggesting that Betty's encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy. here I disagree.  I think the Camilla and Diane scene on the sofa occurred several weeks earlier...pre murder...she was simply reminded of it because of the ashtray.The catch phrase of the movie Adam is auditioning actresses for is ""She is the girl""; which are the exact same words that Diane uses when giving the hitman Camilla's photo resume. perfect.The blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie, and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed. There's much symbolism going on here; the box may represent Diane's future (it's empty), or it may be a sort of a Pandora's box (the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open). Either way, it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key (which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place). The box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bum. I think the box is intended to keep the secret of the murder.  Control of the blue key controls the memory.  The memory of the crime is what results in Diane's undoing.Club Silencio is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s/he is viewing is not real. It also signifies that Diane is about to wake up to her reality (her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from, even in her dreams).Club Silencio...club secret...again, it's the secret that she cannot live with.During the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear, Diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears. They are her parents.  Their upbringing and values make the secret of her misdeeds unbeareable.Anyway, that is my $0.02. Hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it 'the worst movie ever' or something to that effect, without realizing the plot.As usual, Lynch is all about creating irrational fears, and he certainly achieves that with this picture as well.10 out of 10.",Mulholland Drive

I just could not stop myself from finding some meanings for this film. I hated it when a movie makes me work. I especially hated movies that made me watch them more than once.And then, after sleeping on it and watching it a few more nights, everything started to come together. All the pieces started to fall in the right places one by one. *****POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD***** 1)the fantasy-like opening dancing scene 2)the second scene of falling onto some blood red pillows and bed sheets 3)and then a full hour of story telling in a style of a small town girl's dreaming fantasy 4)and the final hour which had all the elements of the first hour reappear again in opposite directions 5)the main characters, the blue key, the blue box, the accident scene, the boogie man, the cowboy and more first appeared in wonderland after Alice encountered them in realityThe main character (Betty Elms/Diane Selwyn) went from a fantasy world of innocence and beauty to the real world of misery and pain we all live in. We all have our secret fantasy of the world around us. More we face the harsh reality of the real world, more desperate we are to fantasize a dream world for us to hide in. Dreams that will make us forget about pain and unsolvable problems. Dreams of being well-received for the care we give to someone we love (Betty's care for Rita). Dream of punishing for people that are bad to us (Adam Kesher, Camilla Rhodes's new love). Dream of good luck and achievement and explanations for failures (Betty's audition and Cowboy's hostility). I started to love this movie, love the director and his success to show us how we are all in desperation to make fantasy of our own world and the others to the moment we die.Finally, the obsession. David Lynch, the director first make you hate him by throwing you all the sensual elements and a confusing plot. Then he laughed at you in your dreams for not figuring it out and for calling him stupid. Finally you started to know what he is trying to do, remembering all the purposeful hints he has given you along the way, you start to marvel his brilliance. More I think about the main character more the word obsession and desperation being implanted in the my mind. David Lynch presented his characters to us in a way that is both natural and vivid.

The movie begins interestingly, with a few twists and turns, leaving the viewer thinking ""mmm, what Daliesque surreal twist will this take"".  Let me tell you tell you that it will take you nowhere, only about two and half hours closer to your grave being none the better for watching this inane waste of good film stock.  Mr. Lynch shows us nothing new here.  He peddles out his usual odds and sods of his previous movies - freaks in front of dimly lit red drapes, midgets, magicians, trumpets, bizarre people talking nonsenscially trying to appear menacing.  I for one think David Lynch must of lost the plot in more sense than one during the filming of this movie.PLEASE i urge you people, if you are person with any common sense what so ever avoid this mindless no plotted crap at all cost.",Mulholland Drive
1389,robinsk,The meaning,10,11 July 2002,"Please note that this is my personal interpretation of the movie.The first half of the movie - before Rita/Camilla (RC) is sucked into the blue box - is how Betty/Diane (BD) wanted her life to go. She came to Hollywood, got a role in a movie, got to knew the everlovely girl RC, which she had a healthy lesbian relationship with. Everything went the way she wanted it to go.The other half of the movie, is how it really went. BD came to Hollywood - the city of dreams, wealthy successful lives - but got her dreams crushed. She just gets s****y roles in random movies, and RC ditches her, to the advantage of Adam Kesher. She sees no other way but hiring a hitman to kill her. When the job is done, she finds the blue key on her table, and she is driven to death by the old (f***ing scary!) couple. Sort of because she had done one/several of the seven deathsins.The movie's message is how dreams are broken in Hollywood. On the screen we see happy people, all healthy and successful, but in the reality, most people are tuned down, and end their lives in anger and despite for broken dreams.The only way to fix it all, is to flush it all away.

Everyone says that it's a great symbolic masterpiece about Hollywood, but there's nothing to it, even many of the films admirers don't know what it means. People who say that it's wonderful are English and Theater majors who are looking for some deep meaning and looking too much into the text when there's really nothing there. I love intellectual movies but this doesn't qualify, it's just something from Lynch's mind that he may understand, but because no one else can critics assume that there must be some great meaning even though many viewers are left confused about what it is. This is not intellectual, it's just confusing, ridiculous, garbage. It's the ONLY movie that I have ever seen that I can honestly say nothing positive about.

The entire first half of the film was written as a pilot for TV.  And the first part was great -- I would have hoped it would have made it.  After it didn't make it though, throw in a lesbian encounter and some female masturbation, then contradict the sub-plots of the first portion of the movie.

Watching this film wasted two-and-a-half hours of my existence; if you haven't seen _Mulholland Dr._ yet and are considering doing so, I suggest you not even bother.

She loses that dream.  She kills herself.What makes this movies so moving is the way the story is told.  I disagree with most that the movie `is Diane's dream.'  Rather I think that the story is told in a dreamlike way.What seem like dead-ends, actually have deep meaning to the story, just like our dreams.  Some examples:  1)  The two guys laughing about the `kids in a car accident.'  This was Rita's story to Betty.  Diane now knows that story to be made-up and Camilla's past was mostly made up.  2)  The cabaret scene: Hollywood is a bunch of phonies.  3)  The `man' behind the diner: Hollywood has it's dark and scary side.  4)  Rita, and then Diane, in the seemingly same scene in the limo:  The terrible accident that brought Rita to Betty has the same significance as the terrible incident that made Diane want to kill Camilla (the dinner at Adam's).

It's all about weaving these ideas together, in which Lynch failed miserably. The storyline is pathetically disjointed and it seems like Lynch hasn't got much to say. So yeah, it's not enough to have ideas for a movie, they should be good ideas as well.When watching this thing, you have some hope that maybe something will happen and everything will make sense.

1407,utku_fener,Hi,10,22 May 2009,"After two brief scenes that at first seem unrelated to the rest of the film, we see a dark-haired, obviously rich beauty in the back of a limousine. Her driver stops at an odd location on Mulholland Drive, which is a twisting, thickly wooded two-lane road full of mansions overlooking Los Angeles. Just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turn around to kill her, two drag racing cars from the opposite direction come crashing into the limo. Only the dark-haired woman survives. She works her way down the ridge to Sunset Boulevard and hides in a vacationing woman's apartment. Shortly after, Betty (Naomi Watts), the vacationing woman's niece, shows up at the apartment and runs into the dark haired woman, who now has amnesia. The bulk of the first part of the film is Betty and the dark haired woman trying to figure out who she is, why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse. This is interspersed with oddly surreal threads about Hollywood producers and directors, with occasional forays into a land of hoodlums and prostitutes.The above may sound a bit complicated and disjointed, but that's not the half of it. The film is constructed so that the meaning will always be open to interpretation. It's basically guaranteed that you will not understand this film and you will not have very much confidence arriving at your own interpretation the first time around. Even if you have a lot of experience with like-minded films--such as Memento (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), The I Inside (2003) and The Butterfly Effect (2004)--you may not understand it on a second viewing, either. The studio was aware of this to the extent that they had director David Lynch write ""10 clues to unlocking this thriller"" and they put it on the back of the chapter listing insert in the DVD. Lynch being of a particular disposition, these clues are almost as cryptic as the film itself. It doesn't help when trying to figure it out in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex. It takes a very long time to figure out what parts are supposed to be ""real"" and there is a complex nesting of flashbacks in some sections, with only contextual clues that they're flashbacks.But is the film worth watching, or worth trying to figure out? That depends on your tastes, obviously. On a surface level, the film is certainly attractive if you are a fan of surrealism, although it will tend to seem a bit slow and overly disjointed to some viewers. But those qualities, and many other surrealist aspects of the film, are typical of Lynch. A prime Lynchian moment is the old couple in the beginning bizarrely smiling almost as if they're alien pod people trying to put on a front. If you're familiar with that style and like it, you'll find much to love here, although in many ways, Mulholland Drive is fairly understated for Lynch. It's also worth noting, for viewers who'll primarily be interested in it or who enjoy it just as much as other aspects, that Mulholland Drive has a quite steamy lesbian scene. It's not gratuitous, although I have no problems with gratuitousness, but is instead an important hinge in the film.Like all of Lynch's films, it's easy to become enraptured in his unique approach to every aspect of film art and his attention to detail. Any serious student of film (including ""armchair students""/""cinephiles"") should study Mulholland Drive; many will love it. Lynch doesn't let anything pass unmanipulated. He includes brilliant color schemes (such as the plethora of reds and pinks) with important symbolism. He makes unusual use of sound, such as the ringing telephone carrying over into the section of score that follows it (when Betty first arrives at the airport). He directs his actors to deliver their lines in a plethora of bizarre ways, such as his characteristic odd pauses. He lets his odd and surprising sense of humor poke through, such as the name ""Winkie's"", and the ""Hot Dogs--made for Pinks"" sign that provides a clue to some of the color symbolism.Lynch's attention to detail in production design provides important, subtle clues throughout the film to help one unlock the meaning. It's interesting to note that Lynch even apparently demands that the DVD programming be unusual--there are no chapters on the disc; you must either watch the film in real time or fast forward or rewind to get back to particular points.If the surrealism and veiled meaning of the film are attractive to you, or if you're just fond of ""puzzles"", then Mulholland Drive is well worth watching for that aspect. There is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film, at least on a broad, generalized level. I won't recount the standard interpretation here--it is worth researching, but only after you've seen the film a couple times and have reached your own conclusions. Many articles and monographs have been written on the film and interpretations; there are even websites dedicated to it.For my money, however, although I generally love Lynch and find many things about Mulholland Drive attractive, it is not quite a 10 for me, at least not yet (I have a feeling that my score could still rise on subsequent viewings). To me, though, the ""twist"" aspect of the film is done much better in other works such as The I Inside and The Butterfly Effect. Mulholland Drive is more attractive to me for its surface surrealistic touches, but the plot doesn't carry them as well as some of Lynch's other films.Still, Mulholland Drive is certainly recommended for the right crowd. If you're serious about film and do not mind having to think about what you watch (as if those two would not necessarily coincide), you shouldn't miss this one.",Mulholland Drive

1410,qulcinozel,A travel into the real life!!,8,25 May 2009,"Mulholland Drive,perhaps it is one of the most successful movies which deserves to be rewarded in the top and seems mysterious at first.Firstly,you have some confusion in your mind,but after watching it carefully one more time, you understand the real theme of the plot.It is such a gripping and original movie that you can not help watching it.When I first watched,I could not understand the main theme and I went completely insane trying to work out what it was about.Because it was both complex and bizarre, but despite this, there was something which was intoxicating and drew my attention.Later on, I watched it again and towards the end of the film, I utterly started to understand something.Basically,the film is not really meant to be understood.It includes many absurd and bizarre things which have no explanation.Lynch'n intention probably is to force people to formulate their own theories,exercise their minds,open the door wide for interpretation and leave them wondering about what it really means for days and in my opinion, that is the beauty of films like this.There are symbolism, metaphors, allegorical elements in MulHolland Drive and if one doesn't have the stomach for those kind of films,I think they have to stay away from it.Another point which I want to emphasize is that, you have to watch it without being disturbed.Because if you miss even a line during the film, you will have much more difficulty than you have while watching it and if you search for Lynch, you will see that he is famous for enigmatic films and Mulholland Drive also looks like one of those movies.You have the concentrate on every moment's of the movie at the beginning or you won't figure out anything, and Lynch managed to combine the real life and dreams,fears and mind-confusion successfully.It has a very logical theme I think, because we live such things in our lives and this confusion is reflected by Lynch very prosperously and finally I strongly advise you to turn off the lights,take a seat,make a cup of coffee and push the play button.You will never regret!!!",Mulholland Drive
1411,juniorbahri,mulhollan drive,6,24 May 2009,"It's a great film. I don't have it fully figured out, and perhaps it can't be, but if you take into account that a large portion of the movie is a dream, it makes it a little easier to understand. Exactly where the dream begins and ends is not so easy to understand. The first half or so is her dream. I think this accounts for some of those bizarre scenes. She has had her lover killed; now she dreams of how she wishes it to be. A mixture of fear, regret, among whatever other emotions you may experience is such a situation is twisting the dream about. The movie is loaded with symbolism, and if you are into dream interpretation you can go a long way with it as well. The scene with the singing woman is great. She sings ""Crying"" in Spanish. She is a representation of her love for her lover. She cries because she loves her, but she is now gone. The singer collapses, apparently dead, but the singing goes on; her lover is dead, but her love for her still lives on. Great film because you can watch it so many times and pick up new things.

1420,gurbet-akad,The most compelling movie,10,25 May 2009,"This is the most interesting movie I have ever watched and also the most complicated one which have left me under its effect for many days. Although I watched it a few times, I still have asked questions such as why,who, where...to myself and tried to make a sense of them.During the movie the events are passing through imagination to reality and than to dreams again.So everything is confused and seems as a complex sense which is felt when you wake up from a dream on which you can not decide whether it is true or not.This is a result of an analysis of both aesthetics and psychology.The movie tells the story of human not with the shape of outer parts of the world like space,time and causality but with the figures of inner world of human such as memories,dreams and feelings.It goes into the world of Diane/Betty and gives examples of artificial,misleading lives of Hollywood.In the film there is a beautiful,blonde girl called Betty/Diane who wants to be a movie star and she is fond of Hollywood.Her aunt dies and leaves some money for Betty.She gets the money and goes to Hollywood,to the city of dreams.There she meets Camilla/Rita who is lost and does not know who she is.Betty takes her care and tries to find about her life,at the same time they fall in love to each other.Betty takes some little parts in a few auditions but she becomes unsuccessful.Camilla performs as leading lady in movies while Betty doesn't have big roles.Than Camilla has a relationship with the director and thinks that sleeping with him will give her much more fame.She deceives Betty.After being deceived by Camilla,Betty can't accept it and give some money to a man to murder Camilla.The man says where he will put a blue key when he finishes his duty.These are the dream of Diane and the reality as well.They exist spontaneously.While Diane has this dream the cowboy wakes her up,her door is being knocked at the same time.Her neighbor has come to take her belongings.Than Diane sees the blue key(this means Camilla died.),prepares a coffee to herself.While drinking she thinks about Camilla and their relationship,she is anxious and very sad.She can't escape from the effect of her dream.The man and women who led Betty happiness and way of Hollywood at the beginning of the film turn into monsters.Diane goes mad and commit suicide.Most of the film is composed of Diane's dream.We watch it normally but than many events happen at the same time and each of them is in relation to the other one.Imagination and reality exist together.But Club Silencio clarifies everything;everything is recorded,this is a tape recorder. People see the things like (people,objects) in their dreams in a different shape rather than reality.For example,a normal key can take part differently as a blue key,or the name of the girl who work at Coffeeshop may be the the name of Diane.And also in dreams everything is exaggerated,people's character's,facial expressions and physical appearance...Betty is seen as a perfect girl who is very helpful and Rita is very defenseless.Although the movie is seen very complex,it depicts how the subconscious can be so effective and lead to bad results.It sends some messages to the world of Hollywood and shows its real face,how it is dirty and full of deceptions;and how some dreams of people can be so harsh.",Mulholland Drive

Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - all that what remains unspoken; emotions that are often repressed. 'Mulholland Dr.' has the intensity calling for a cast that completely takes issue with the substance. Actresses and actors who are ready to follow the visions of the director selflessly.Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux solve their task in such an impressing way that you wouldn't want or couldn't imagine another cast. While their acting at the beginning seems to be a little superimposed you soon will realize that this stereo typing is set in with a purpose to manipulate the viewer and to baffle him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible.Thus.it worths watching.",Mulholland Drive

Moreover,I could not find the relationship between the dark –haired thing and the movie.Also what do the blue box and the key signify ? The movie is really like a puzzle with missing parts.I think, if you want to watch this movie, you should read the plot before.

Furthermore, when I watched the film, I didn't understand what was happening during two hours. But then I saw that the film was aimed at criticizing the marvels of Hollwood's life. As far as I see Camillia had a magical life in the film. And all Diane wants was being a famous person like Camilia. Since Diane wasn't well-known like Camillia, she wanted a man to kill Camillia. Meanwhile, she had fallen in love with Camillia, and so she started to hallucinate about her. Once everything started to be a deadlock, Diane couldn't stand this situation. And she committed suicide. In contrast to other people, I liked this movie. Because this movie was very attractive for me. In my opinion, if you like psychological films, you must watch it.

1429,maicorvo,"A unique masterpiece, but it requires commitment to fully unfold",10,22 July 2009,"Per aspera ad astra - that's especially true for ""Mulholland Drive"", David Lynch's ingenious masterpiece, which is admittedly quite confusing and overwhelming at first, incomprehensible even. While the requirement of a thorough, analytical way of watching the movie (several times even, at least in my case) and the necessity of a great deal of attention to grasp its full scope and magic provides the singularity of the movie, it is coincidently the reason for any sceptical or even negative review ""Mulholland Drive"" may have received.David Lynch yet again succeeds admirably in creating a dense and enthralling atmosphere, nightmarish, captivating, beautiful. The developments around the relationship of a mysterious beauty, distraught and amnesic after she barely survived a nocturnal car crash, and a young and naive prospective starlet, enthusiastic about the ostensible glamour of Hollywood are promiscuously interwoven with a number of additional story lines such as a stubborn director getting into a major conspiracy by powerful figures of the motion picture industry or the troubles of a somewhat clumsy hit man. There's a strong touch of film noir with dark rooms, mist, the tough guy, the jealous husband and the femme fatale, there are brilliantly staged bizarre characters and partially hilarious situations, all leading to a major twist, fundamentally messing with the heads of the audience...The acting is exquisite and especially lead-actress Naomi Watts provides a stunning performance. Angelo Badalamenti's mystic and mesmerizing score creates the perfect ambiance. And most importantly: contrary to the first impression (and the final judgement of far too many fans of ""Triple X"" and the like) IT ALL MAKES PERFECT SENSE, while still leaving room for individual interpretation here and there.What I love most about ""Mulholland Drive"" and the reason why I admire this movie more than any other (even legendary epics like ""The Godfather"") is the fact, that beyond its marvelously elaborate construction and the artfully utilized symbols and signs, it is still incredibly entertaining and a unique and rewarding experience even for a viewer lacking the most basic understanding of the afore-mentioned coherence. ""Mulholland Drive"" is not only a great movie, it is perfect in every way and that is too rare a thing to be missed by ANYONE...",Mulholland Drive
1430,swessence82,Don't expect to understand it after just one viewing...but well worth the effort for those who watch it again (and again!),10,21 April 2003,"***CONTAINS SPOILERS*** The tagline of ""Mulholland Drive"" reads ""A Love Story in the City of Dreams.""  I can't possibly think of a more appropriate phrase to summarize this film. ""Mulholland Drive"" is a twisted journey into the darker side of Hollywood, love and relationships, and the darkest corners of the human psyche.  Naomi Watts delivers an amazing performance as Betty Elms/Diane Selwyn; the former, an idealized, sugar-coated counterpart to the latter, a woman so utterly overwhelmed with failure, guilt, and regret she resorts to fantasizing how things might have been in a extended ""Wouldn't it be nice if..."" sort of dream sequence that creates the first 2/3 of the film. After watching the film (preferably more than once), you cannot help but wonder if Diane has been driven to such an end by the corrupt functioning of Hollywood film making in Los Angeles, by being constantly toyed with and led on by the manipulative, but oh-so-seductive Camilla (Laura Elena Harring), or if she has simply fallen victim to her own seemingly delusional perception and mental/emotional instability.  Perhaps it is a combination of all three.Whatever your interpretation of the film may be, you should see it more than once.  The hypnotic nature of ""Mulholland Drive"" is one of the many reasons it is such an incredible film.",Mulholland Drive

1432,bruno-sousa-moraes,Lynch and his Pure Cinema Art,10,2 August 2009,"David Lynch is no ordinary director. His surrealist and unique style, along with his typical filming way and nonsensical dialogues gave him a mixed reputation. What some might call a wacky, stupid and disconnected movie is regarded by fans and followers of the director as a visionary and revolutionary film. And the meaning of revolutionary is also revisited in Mulholland Dr. The plot is a little complicated. It transmits to the watcher a sensation that something is going on, some mystery is in the air. From the moment the film begins, following a young actress arriving at L.A. filled with dreams, to the bare end, this big feeling of mystery, of some meaning on every scene to be understood and solved, follows the mind of spectators, who are subliminally told to make their own theories about the movie. One of the most characteristic traces on Lynch's way of making his movies is the 'cult' atmosphere. This atmosphere is reinforced by the professional acting, the uncommon scenes and the insertion of some apparently disconnected situations in the movie. Here on Mulholland Dr., these traces are strong and remarkable. The elements and the feeling of watching a thriller are reinforced by the Lynch elements. The expressivity of the nonsense here is a proof that a movie is not always a way of telling a story. The pure cinema art of David Lynch is the art of touching the spectator, of expressing feelings and ideas even with no coherent story. And this creates the atmosphere I'm talking' about. That's an allegory to the real plot of the thriller, those metaphors, those apparent useless bullsh*t to uninitiated people. The coolest thing about this surrealism here in Brazil is the fact that some stupid translator changed the title of the film to 'Cidade dos Sonhos' (City of Dreams), which is somehow allusive to the dream-like sequences that appear sometimes. The last piece on Lynch's masterpiece is all the mystery around the plot. We are introduced to new things, to new elements and new characters by the end of the movie, which are there to help on fulfilling our need to explanations in part. Because Mulholland Dr.'s ending isn't conclusive at all. Lynch opens the door so we can enter and finish the story with our own theories and versions. For people who like solving problems, the director left ten clues to solve the thriller and find his own version of the story. But that's not really necessary to like Mulholland Dr. or any other Lynch movie. You don't necessarily have to understand one of his movies to like them. You have to watch and immerse yourself into the film, I guess. And that's why Mulholland Drive is really a fantastic thriller, which's worthy of watching many times so you can make your own version and get clues that reinforce it. All the pieces of a multiple combination puzzle are there on a brilliant plot. Along with great acting, shooting and arranging of sounds (another trademark of Lynch's movies, the experimentalism of sounds to make a scene), this is what makes watching Mulholland Drive a remarkable experience of the senses, and elects this film to a status of pure expressive art.",Mulholland Drive

1434,chrisflofood,WARNING- CONTAINS SPOILERS AND COMMENTS THAT MAKE YOU THINK,10,7 March 2003,"WARNING- CONTAINS SPOILERS AND COMMENTS THAT MAKE YOU THINKWhat a great website! This is my first post and the movie that led me to this website and this message board was Mulholland Drive. After viewing the film three times and then reading the posts on this message board i thought it would be good discussion to mention a few things that i observed about the film: It can not be said that the entire first 2/3 of the film is a dream, nor can it be said that the last 1/3 of the film is "" reality "". The entire film is a mix of both.There are definite visual clues in every scene to let the viewer know in which state of ""reality"" we are in. It is helpful to note that most things ( i.e. characters, objects, names. etc. ) appear at least twice in the film- at least once in "" reality "" and once in "" non-reality"". I use "" non-reality"" to refer to dreams, hallucinations, flashbacks, etc.Using these guidelines it is possible to divide the film into two categories and then to try and piece them together chronologically. The first thing that came to mind in trying to explain these two conflicting stories was that possibly Diane is mentally ill- i.e. schizophrenia/ multiple personality. There is proof that she ""sees"" people who are not actually there- the dinner party scene, the making coffee scene in diane's apt. after her neighbor wakes her up. The apt. scene is a very convincing in that you see a shot of Camilla standing, profiled against the window, looking at Diane and then Diane has an "" episode"" , followed by a shot of Diane standing in exactly the same place/position against the window. Many of these ""non-reality scenes"" seem to be entireley fictional- created from the mind of Diane. They reek of paranoia and imagination. One great example of this is the mob influence scenes. They are so far fetched and "" everyone's out to get me"" that you can't help but think Diane is fabricating it all herself. The odd man in winkies who tells about his dream of the man out back. "" he's the one who's doing it"" he says- as if there is some indescribably evil man behind it all. So, putting all of this together, you can draw the conclusion that Diane is a sick puppy who is creating a fictional world of paranoid delusional fantasies about people and events from her real life. Things that were only coincidental or benign become plots against her and she drives herself to madness and possibly suicide. I am not certain that she actually does kill herself. Why- because the suicide scene is to dreamlike in nature- the lighting, the excessive smoke, etc. Also when she fires the shot there is no bullet, blood, etc. Watch the scene again- see what you think. I would like to hear other peoples ideas on why Dianes ex-roommate ( i dont think its her ex-lover, more on that some other time) says ""Where have you been? It's been three weeks."" This is a truly great film. Anyone can argue that they didn't like it but that's not really the point. The point is, it got us all talking about it and it got us to THINK. That is, in my humble opinion, the mark of ANYTHING great- DID IT MAKE YOU THINK!? Besides, when was the last time you watched a movie 3 times in three days?",Mulholland Drive
1435,palcorn,Lots to unravel.,10,10 March 2003,"A beautiful movie, not only visually, but also conceptually. Certainly a challenge.

It was visually stunning and with top notch directing. Something different catches your eye or ear with each viewing. And to think this film was originally a pilot for the ABC network. What Mr. Lynch did this to bring it to the screen was pure artistic freedom that he wouldn't have if it was picked up on a public network. I don't understand the poor reviews or when people say they don't understand it because of how the narrative jumps back and forth from reality and a dream.

1437,Karlzburg,How do you film a dream? Ask David Lynch.,9,16 November 2013,"This movie has become somewhat of an obsession for me and I have a very different idea of what the movie really is about. In my analysis, the movie really has two central themes. The first is a grim depiction of the reality that awaits those who come to Hollywood seeking fame and fortune, and how many who go there end up in very bad shape. The second theme revolves around David Lynch's attempt to literally film a dream/nightmare and contrast it with the reality of ""Diane's"" life. ""Diane Selwyn"" is the ""real-life"" character - a naive Midwestern arrival (who is also lesbian) seeking fame and fortune in Hollywood. In ""reality,"" Diane is the waitress at the diner who, between shifts, scurries to and fro doing screen tests, looking for her big break. Diane meets the ""real"" Rita during a film shoot and they do some other gigs together and develop a romantic relationship. All hell breaks loose when the ""real"" Rita announces her marriage to the director Adam Kesher at a cast party held at Kesher's Mulholland Drive home. Thus begins a downward spiral for ""Diane,"" who realizes that her ""big break"" (as well as her love life) will vanish once ""Rita"" is married. Also at the party, she realizes that ""Rita"" has another girlfriend on the side and has ""moved on."" Soon, Diane is hiring hit men to kill Rita, who (I think) end up killing, not Rita, but Rita's new girlfriend who was in the wrong place at the wrong time (I say that because it looks like the dead body in bungalow #12 has blond hair, so it can't be Rita). That is the ""reality."" The ""dream"" is Diane's psychotic nightmare after everything goes down and the police want to question her. In Diane's dream/nightmare, she is innocent ""Betty"" who comes to Hollywood and becomes a star. And rather than the reality of trying to murder Rita, she dreams that she is helping an amnesiac Rita remember who she is as they wander through Diane's dreamworld seeking clues. Various characters from Diane's ""reality,"" like Kesher's mother Coco, assume different identities and roles in the dream. In Diane's dreams, she was screwed out of fame and fortune by Rita, Kesher and other sinister forces who control the movie industry (Dan Hedaya's movie mafia). Towards the end of the movie, we realize that ""Diane's"" life is unraveling. The movie, then, is a glimpse into the mind of a shattered soul who is cornered and hours away from ruin. I won't go any further into the plot, but I marvel at Lynch's attempt to film a ""dream."" The movie is not perfect, but it is a wonderful type of ""whodunnit"" that simply cannot be understood in one viewing.",Mulholland Drive

Lynch takes us to the edge of madness and with a gentle push, throws us over the precipice we have been staring into. Lynch's use of color is stunning... the reds and pinks set against the blues literally jump off the screen. Laura Harring convincingly portrays the dark amnesia victim, that we simultaneously feel a mix of empathy and distrust for. The music is haunting and the Spanish rendition of ""Crying"" at the Club Silencio left me staring at the screen with my jaw open. If you love David Lynch, this is a must-see.

How is that possible? I am a fan of Naomi watts and i liked Ring and Eastern promises. When i was going through her biodata, it said that Mulholland Dr was the best movie in her career. I gave it a thought and downloaded the movie. What followed was 2.5 hrs for utter boredom and some seriously weird stuff. I was like ""Oh the movie is slow. But it will catch up.."". This was my thought for almost 2 hrs. This 2 hrs had some odd scenes like The guy in the wheel chair who face was really bent out of shape, the stupid director who poured paint in his wife's jewels after seeing her sleeping with the pool boy, a rehearsal scene with Naomi intimately kissing this old guy and the crazy club silencio scene. I was like ""What the hell?"". I thought the director had an answer in the last half hour. But the last half hour was even more bizarre than the first 2 hrs. Here we are introduced to a new storyline which contradicts to most of the first 2 hrs. And suddenly the creepy old couple come in and scare the lead character to shoot herself and the movie ends. I have never been this frustrated my whole life, even when i failed for the first time, in AI in college. I read some of the good reviews and it said that we need to watch at least twice to fully understand it. A movie is something which should give a closure when it ends, how complicated the storyline maybe (Eg.Inception, Memento etc.,) But this movie was pure rubbish. Although for some scenes there maybe some valid reasons to be there in the dream, but some parts in the dream absolutely made no sense, like the hit-man's botched kills, the disfigured guy behind winkie's, the blue box, the guy in the wheelchair, Adam's childish/insane acts etc., The reviewers are saying that these are made up by Diane's mind. Did they tell that in the movie? I can't believe people are really defending this bad movie with some of their own interpretation when actually the director should have done that. A director can make one or two scenes or maybe the ending with no proper closure so that the audience may interpret it their own way (Inception, Eastern promises, Wrestler etc.,) but not the entire movie?!??! I know i have seen lot of bad movies, but this is the worst and definitely this doesn't belong in the top 250 among the Greats!",Mulholland Drive

Even the Director/Writer wouldn't have realized that their movie had such deeper,inner meanings or such interpretations as shared by some here.It is really pathetic that people are appreciating a weirdly directed movie with unconnected pointless events which needs ""clues"" from the director to understand it.Those who admire this crap is doing so for the fear that they may be labeled as idiots - who don't UNDERSTAND the movie.Please don't encourage such garbage.Don't waste time or money for such a joke.",Mulholland Drive

1444,eleanor-hicks,Thoughts on the meaning of the blue box: dont read if you havent seen the film yet as I think it is a crucial plot element!,9,18 April 2003,"A main theme of the film is the fakery and lack of substance or meaning behind the pompous glamour of hollywood: Betty, on arriving at Hollywood is evidently seduced by the Hollywood dream, and dazzled by its grandeur when she first arrives. However, she soon discovers that inside this pretty packaging there are sinister secrets and ugly truths, as shown by the suicides and the attempted murder. The filthy bum too is especially representative of this internal rottenness. It is also made clear that in Hollywood, nothing is as it seems. This is illustrated at the club, Silencio, where what is thought to be live music and singing turns out to be a series recordings, and the actors seem to be hollographic projections. The falseness is also illustrated by the Hollywood agents, actors and general cronies at the auditions and on the sets: they are very shallow, superficial and incompetent. The blue box is a metaphor for this since it is intriguing and rouses anticipation as to what riches it could contain. However, it is found to be empty and dark inside, just like Hollywood inside the seductive packaging.Further, the box echoes the structure of the film, full of ""red herring"" plot lines that appear to lead nowhere, such as the scene where the hitman shoots some people who appear to have no significance to the plot as a whole is never followed up by a concrete explanation, and the scene in which the director's wife is found in bed with another man: this likewise appears to lead us knowhere. Similarly, the box, mysterious and tantalising, contains nothing, contrary to our expectations. In this way too, it undermines our expectations of the film: we think everything will eventually be made clear, but instead we are left to make our own conclusions. Nothing is made too obvious.There is also the pandora's box metaphor: the key, given to Diane by the hitman, indicates the havoc created by her request to him. Hoewever, the fact that it is Rita/Camilla who opens the box shows that it was infact Camilla who began the chain of events that leads to all the tragedy in the stroy: indeed, as soon as she opens it we are shown the key scene at the dinner where she rouses Diane's anger and hatred. In this way the box indirectly does contain/reveal something: the fact that Rita, previously thought to be more or less innocent, infact instigated these sinister events.",Mulholland Drive

I looked for the explanations on the net, I am satisfied with the answers but I still feel weird about the film. After the passionate scene of Watts and Harring, the movie became a porn. It is not wrong to use eroticism in movies if it is a contributing factor to the movie but for this one I felt like the director made them kiss and do other things just for his own pleasure. What was the point of that scenes? That scenes just made the movie weirder. From beginning to the end it was weird and unnecessarily complicated. There are other complicated movies including erotic scenes and when you see these kind of movies you feel impressed,you don't say to yourself, What was the purpose of all this?

1450,otherdistractions,Laura Harring: a cruel lover,3,11 May 2013,"Mulholland Drive is basically a master-clinic on the horrors of ones reality becoming indescribably different or foreign, and of comforts that reveal themselves in tragedy or agitation. The story is alinear to say the least, and takes place entirely in the fantasy life of niomi watts who cannot tell fact from fiction. Not ironically, her obsession is a woman on the brink of a terrifying eureka, about the events of her life which are esoteric and completely unknown to her. The fractured plot flows effortlessly because of the unified feeling it conveys. However, the fantasy climaxes in antithesis with the crushing blows of Laura Harring, a cruel woman who only toys with Niomi's hearstrings. A bold piece of work, an interesting love story.",Mulholland Drive

Police officers? Actress? Bodyguard (or whatever)? They add nothing to the plot at all (if there is any plot).I'm just surprised how many good reviews and awards this movie has.

The night DIane goes to the party is the night Diane has Camilla killed. THe next day she kills herself. There are flashbacks to when Cmailla and DIane had a real relationship but Camilla started hooking up with the director to further her career and left Diane. Stuff like that.

Betty suddenly disappears (from the movie as well) and so does Rita after she opens the blue box. Immediately there is a shift back in time where Betty's aunt enters the room and then, a scene change to Diane Selwyns appartment where she wakes up. Given this timechange you don't even have to resort to characters dreaming each other up! I tend to believe though, that Betty is Rita/Camilla's dream version of Diane.

After that, one of the men kills the other and takes a black book from his table. His attempts to conceal the murder and try to make it look like a suicide were very funny (he also kills a woman who lived next door and the cleaner)!

(Maybe he will explain the whole film one day in a book or something) :)The first time I watched this film I tried to concentrate on the plot and was very dissapointed at the end. But the second one I focused on the pictures and cinematography and was much more pleased!

The plot is awesome, besides the puzzle it is, and the acting is the best. The cinematography is groundbreaking, and the movie REALLY has a nightmarish feeling. The style is unique. It has noir and horror movie elements in the first half, then it turns into a whole horror sequence in the second half.

1467,tommim-166-575629,"Genius or not genius, this is the question",3,21 September 2011,"*** not ""may"" - this review contains spoilers ***The movie doesn't tell a linear story, but gives unconnected self-contradicting puzzle pieces that give the viewer little clue about what is going on. Unfortunately the film makes the viewer believe half way through the movie that it was linear. It is not telling that it is a puzzle up till an abrupt ending, where nothing is revealed. Thus leaving the viewer as puzzled as the story.So much for the content. I disclaim the following is a personal impression and you may (and possibly will) judge otherwise.Some believe Lynch is a genius and the movie is his ""masterpiece"" - yet, I'm not so sure.This work has many parallels to a guy I went to school with. He had put up an art exhibition. His ""masterpiece"" was the an old lady's hat stand glued to a stick that he had put nails in to fixate drawers. But his woodworking was so bad, you were not allowed to touch as you could either harm yourself with a splinter or destroy the thing all together. As the work made no sense to the audience he explained it as being his ""interpretation to the suffering of women in modern society"".Ignoring the fact that he was a guy, 16, never had a girlfriend and no idea what the suffering of women would be - some visitors claimed him to be a genius, while most kids said he was just a little soft in the head.Same with this movie. Some people say Lynch is a genius while others say he is just crazy.I think both is not true. The movie has a good story with some interesting elements, but Lynch is cryptic for being cryptic. Story and characters lack depth and at some points have a hard time transporting emotions. He is unable to transport the characters struggle with insanity and guilt. His setup of a gay relationship between the main characters is not convincing at all. Two heterosexual girls suddenly turning gay because one girl has slept on the other girl's couch for 2 nights? If that were true I would have seen many Catholics sweating blood before sending their kids to a youth hostel. It all becomes an old man's wet dream when the girl turns out to be bisexual and non-monogamous. The story may have made sense in Lynch's head but just as with the kid his actual woodworking is terrible and viewers have a hard time seeing what he was trying to say.I would suggest: if you write something that makes sense in your head and one year later you look at your work and don't remember what it was you were thinking that day - it's not art. It's been just you celebrating your own ingeniousness.The story may have been a great idea that turned out to be a mediocre movie.

This movie, like Blue Velvet, sticks with you long after you leave the theater.  I read a review before I saw that movie that theorized that the first two thirds was a dream and the last third was the cold reality. Viewed in that context, I thought it was possible to come up with a reasonable interpretation of all that happened.Naomi Watts is a star now and largely because of her amazing performance in this movie.  Can anyone think of a role that required more of a range of emotions than this?  She is perky, depressed, seductive, hot, cold, crazy, fearless, consumed by fear, you name it.Some people are turned off by the symbolism and cryptic approach, but if one takes the time to pick it all apart it is extremely rewarding.I can't wait for the next David Lynch movie.10.",Mulholland Drive

This is my impression of Mulholland Drive.The acting and cinematography are superb.  Suspense builds in the first 75% of the movie in a consistent and engrossing manner.  But in the end we find the movie devolves into a typically Lynch morass of plot twists and vexatious imagery.For most people who prefer to watch a movie ONCE and completely ""get it"", this movie is frustrating and unsatisfying.  However, for the viewer who enjoys the challenge, there are sufficient details, clues, and hints dispersed throughout the movie which may be aggregated to piece together a unified interpretation.If you are a fan of David Lynch, you will probably love this movie.

1471,rachael-33,A life-changing story that will immortalize Lynch's name like no other,10,11 January 2006,"Warning - Contains Spoilers Mulholland drive is a story that had to be told and is one that most of us will identify with if we have ever experienced 'unrequited love' of any description. Although the movie is about much more than that. The basic storyline is simple enough - a plucky ingénue (Naomi Watts)makes her way to Hollywood to be a glamorous actress, with all the innocence and optimism of youth. Naomi's acting is no less than Oscar worthy in every sense and her over-exaggerated naive optimism at the beginning starkly and beguilingly contrasts with later scenes which uncover the reality of what her life becomes.This movie is surreal but perfectly constructed and developed with a true sense of meaning with no hint of ambiguity in what the director is wanting to achieve. Basically Naomi's character Betty is having a convoluted and symbolic dream (as dreams are)of what she would like her life to be, compared to her reality of unrequited love and her subsequent immoral and desperate actions which follow. The director does a brilliant job of displaying the inherent vulnerabilities in us all, inspiring feeling pity and care for a murderer, and showing the hopelessness of the human condition at it's lowest point. The human psyche is explored in a depth rarely attempted by even the most competent of directors ; Anyone who has ever felt the 'human condition' and all of the implications that follow will surely marvel at the greatness of this Oscar worthy and inspired film. One of the most moving and emotionally complex movies ever made - has to be seen to be believed.10 out of 10 ; and then some",Mulholland Drive
1472,obstacle-1,Excellence in every aspect (Possible Spoilers),10,10 April 2005,"Upon viewing this for the fourth time, I decided i would post a review highlighting the elements that I enjoyed the most. Firstly, I must warn that this film is not for those who are looking for a simple ""turn your brain off"" movies. Also, to truly appreciate this film it takes numerous viewings. **Possible Spoilers Herein**Every performance in this film is amazing. Although Naomi Watts has excellent scenes in which she cries and explodes, the true talent is in the subtly of her acting. When she opens the purse for the first time with Camilla, you can see the expression on Betty's face showing that she knows its actually hers, but still acts out her role as Betty (enjoying seeing Rita's guilt). The first time I saw this I thought the acting was ridiculous, but now I see this was David Lynch's way to show the fakeness in Betty's dream. Also, I found Laura Harring's performance excellent in its subtly.The sound quality is amazing. Everything is crystal clear. Example, when Camilla in running down the street we can hear her shoes clicking against the road. The score was excellent, and helped further the mood. I also noticed quiet, almost inaudible noises throughout the movie.The lighting in this film is excellent. If we look at the difference between Betty and Diane, we can see that Betty is bathed in a aura of light, whereas Diane has dark shadows cast upon her.Overall, this is the most thorough movie I have ever seen, and for this reason it is my favorite. Highly recommended for those who enjoy an intelligent film.",Mulholland Drive

Now grab your nachos and your beer and go sit down and enjoy these great films you have just acquired.Please, Please, Please resist the peculiar temptation of watching this film because I fear if you do not you will be back on this great sites message boards cursing those that told you anything other than that this film is complete rubbish and you will desperately be wishing that you had those two precious hours of your life back. I know I did.For those of you that have seen this movie, I apologise that I didn't write this sooner, I saw MD at least 2 1/2 yrs ago but have only now felt the urge to express my loathing, mainly due to the fact that I recently saw two other equally mind numbing and time wasting films, those being Donnie Darko & Its all about love. I now have a top 3 worst movies ever made list I can chat to my friends about.Yes, I did experience an odd twitch in my grey matter when this film came out to go and watch it, but mainly because of the hype and that I also thought it would make me think. And make me think it did (but not how I wanted to) All I can say to those of you who liked, even loved this movie (and the other two mentioned above),(and I'm aware that there are plenty of you freaks out there)is this. Please put aside your attempted intellectual interpretations of these films and quit telling those of us that don't feel as you do about such rubbish that we are not thinking enough, or looking beyond the surface, or that we didn't pick up the hidden or obvious clues or messages. These things whether perceived or actual make no difference to a movies watchability, rateabaility or greatness. OK, there may be some people who love to waste two hours trying to decipher some deranged directors intentions or underlying concept, theme, plot or conclusion but just because you wish to do so or actually think that you did find some startling interpretations in the movie does not make it a good one. Most of you are the ones who like to appear clever on these boards by impressing strangers with your irrelevant findings.Don't get me wrong, I'm not scared of thinking about a movie, I do enjoy the occasional no brainer action flick and a laugh-a-minute comedy but I'm always on the lookout for a thinking mans flick. MD just confuses the viewer by twisting stories, character & dialogue without any meaning or conclusion. I feel a movie MUST make sense even if a bit of thought is involved, this movie does not satisfy any of the viewers thirst for plot, suspense, action, emotion or conclusion.If you must, view this movie only for its hype or to satisfy your own curiosity. but don't expect much.

1477,matthewc-weir,awful,1,2 March 2004,"David Lynch may very well be a genius, but movies are in large part supposed to be about story-telling.  If I want to be confused about a movie, I could just watch two minutes of it.  If I sit and see the whole thing, I want to be able to make sense of it.  I realize that it gets at the part of life that doesn't make much sense, but it does so in such an overly-complex way that it loses its ability to actually hold me as an audience.  I never knew what was going on in this film. For my money, I would much prefer a film that actually invites the viewer to engage in some kind of dialogue afterwards.  The only dialogue I observed dealt with how much we were confused, or how stupid we must be for not getting such a bizzarely constructed film.  Movies that are acclaimed for being complicated are not necessarily good.  As this one shows, they can be downright awful.",Mulholland Drive
1478,jamesadam-96,A Vibrantly Beautiful Drive,10,7 September 2013,"To my mind there is hardly a film in existence that evokes the very essence of the art so vividly and unforgettably as 'Mulholland Drive'. Every frame, every image, every second acts alone; driving the whole disarranged plot to it's revealing conclusion with an oddly sensible illogicality while still retaining the power to speak directly to the emotions. Despite being void of any clear logic on their own, these images displayed in the film live long in the mind: some repulse, some enlighten, some merely dazzle, but each and every one is a piece of lynch's vision; free from convention and description and explanation to attack the senses and truly captivate the viewer in a world that doesn't let go. Lynch's film begs to be seen, not funneled into words. Film truly is his medium, his tool for entering the mind, and this fact is as present as ever in MD, establishing it as one of his outstanding pieces and a true great for film fans.",Mulholland Drive
1479,freestylin20,NOT TOP 250,1,27 June 2004,"Here it goes... this movie does not belong on the top 250 movies of all time. Yes, i did only watch it once and I'm sure everyone says it makes more sense the second time around, but I'm not a masochist. i feel that this movie had decent acting and some good camera work and music. going by this alone, it deserves maybe a 4. I have seen some movies with complicated/ disoriented story lines that leave me guessing, and i enjoy them very much, but this incoherent movie is ridiculous. with the little research i've done it seems that the movie is about a dream (very original), but no one knows what the last 45 min mean and the director intended it this way. I think that people gave this movie a good rating for the sole reason that they say to themselves, ""I don't understand it so it must be good, and if i give it a bad rating, i'll seem stupid."" well I for one am secure with my intelligence and a movie that has random useless scenes with no meaning whatsoever does not have the right to be considered one of the best movies of all time. I see that in the demographics, males under 18 gave it very good ratings, not because of the lesbian scenes of course, but because the symbolism was so intriguing, right?If you truly enjoyed this movie, then thats fantastic, I am not not trying to insult those who liked it for whatever reason, I'm just trying to make a point of how it should not be considered one of the best movies of ALL TIME.",Mulholland Drive

1481,ddibenedetto2000,anti-linear,9,6 September 2004,"I appreciate Lynch's challenge to the linear narrative. This process of story-telling is not for all film viewers, but for some viewers, the challenge of unscrambling this plot is worth the time and effort. Lynch films this story so colorfully that it is hard to look away and easy to view again. I love this film and in fact have taught it in several of my English classes. Students respond in varying ways, as one might expect. A handful obsessively want to solve the puzzle, a handful think the film is useless, and most are curious to discover the film's meaning in subsequent class discussions. I think the film's message about Hollywood is important enough to study since H'wood's influence so profoundly pervades life in the US. The definitive message of MD is indeed obscured in Lynch's art, but I believe the obscurity is purposeful. The psychology of Hollywood and the people that populate it (actors, directors, wannabes, etc.)and shape its myth are complex, the identities of those people are fragmented (like the film), and the answers to the questions of its meaning are far from easily answered.",Mulholland Drive
1482,cemceboglu,Very excellent,10,20 April 2005,"This film is about losing your innocence and becoming corrupt, losing everything including your mental health and personality.

So you try to cling to , but you lose it and you find yourself not yourself anymore and one day you take a gun and pull the trigger and...you know how it ends. in my opinion, lynch always focuses on ordinary evil and bad ,and people of that sort we see everyday around us. It is a very bleak and very pessimistic view, but it is at least very real although his films always depend on dreams more than reality. The films look like dreams, but the feeling is so real...just like the real world.",Mulholland Drive
1483,duckman4824,This movie is not confusing...,4,7 December 2006,"POTENTIAL SPOILERS WITHIN!!!!This movie is not confusing. That would be an inappropriate and highly inaccurate adjective. Some more accurate adjectives would include pretentious, dull, self-absorbed, uneven, tedious, and irritating. Don't give me the whole, ""it was all a dream"" excuse. That is one of the weakest of all plot line excuses, and a plot line excuse that is often reserved for these overly ambitious films that try to convey some sort philosophical, surreal aspect or meaning but fall flat because they're just a bunch of pretty colors, spooky sounds, and celebrity tits. It is quite clear that the plot is out of order and rearranged. In fact, one of the few endearing qualities of this two and a half hour mess is how elegantly that story was wrapped up. Those twists were effective and certainly had a lot of work put into them by Mr. Lynch. But is this movie really worth two and a half hours of our time to see a fairly good ending wrap up? In this case, no, it is not. Why? Because the vast majority of this meticulous, obnoxious, pompous movie is made up of pointless visual effects, shots that go on way past their expiration date, and uncomfortable, and, even worse, uninteresting dialog. And seeing Naomi Watts prance around with the attitude of a caffeine addicted, giddy moron with the off-kilter adrenaline dysfunction of a high school theater student makes me want to punch her in the scrawny face. It's that grating. Sure, there are some lovely ladies, some intriguing and artfully used shots and cinematography, and at times the psychedelic effects work. But not for the whole movie! This is a tiresome quagmire of a film. It's not confusing -- the elements that might seem confusing actually work fairly well. It's the fact that it's so full of itself, so poorly executed (for the most part), and so uneven that makes this film junk. It wants to be good. It wants to be provocative. It wants to be sexy. It wants to be deep and surreal. Sadly, this movie does not succeed in those goals. The good parts are rare and sparsely distributed. The provocative parts are tame. The bedroom scenes seems forced. The supposed deep quality is horribly shallow and unconvincing, and the surreal bits are unoriginal, irrelevant, and feel like the discarded remains of previous, better Lynch films. I would almost feel sorry for this mess, if it didn't annoy me so much. 4/10",Mulholland Drive

The range of sorrow, fear, foreshadowing, ingenue virginity, sensuality and despair exceed those of Blue Velvet, the other Lynch film I know well. Oddly, what appeals to me most is the incomprehensibility of the plot, Diane's utter transformation in the middle. (Normally this type of veering development (really non-development) annoys me.)

1489,rf026,Probably the worst Hollywood film I've ever seen,1,25 March 2005,"Don't buy into whatever anyone tells you about this film, don't let it be said it is a ""masterpiece"" - films don't come more pretentious and self obsessed. For a start, the acting was unbelievably appalling - i felt like i was watching a sunset beach rerun, where they had no other way of conveying emotions rather than saying ""i feel xyz"" or ""my god i totally get that"". Whenever the plot broke down into a sludgefest, they'd try and overcompensate with heavy breathing, at every second of silence. There wasn't a lot of silence either though - in an attempt to cover up the complete lack of suspense, or atmosphere, clichéd background music ripped from every horror and thriller of the last fifty years would play over everything. The dialogue was uninspired, and overused - ""i guess they aren't in"" - and lo and behold the door opens. Gratuitous nudity was the only was to cover up a plethora of untalented actors and actresses - though to give them some credit Lynch somehow managed to create characters that make the Mr Men seem more 3D. The plot was awful - I've seen plots with holes in them - but never the thinly covered self gratifying rubbish that mulholland drive subjects the hapless viewer to. You can say all you like about abstraction, surrealism, but i'm afraid you simply can't defend characters like ""the cowboy"" and that ridiculous ogre - they have no purpose other than to sustain Lynch's ego. The ending was rushed, and even when you do ""get"" the film, its embarrassingly crap, and you want 140 minutes of your life back. Seriously, if you want surreal and abstract, watch Art-house films. If you want good time shifts in Hollywood, look no further than something like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. If you want to see the same actors playing different characters, changing faces - Vanilla Sky did it well enough. If you want Lesbianism, download some porn. If you want entertainment, don't watch this self-indulgent pile of crap.",Mulholland Drive
1490,dthpsc,One of the greatest cinematic achievements... ever?,10,14 February 2005,"Yes, in my strong opinion, Mulholland Dr. is one of the greatest movies of its kind. In many ways, Mullholland Dr. is more a work of art than a movie intended to entertain and amuse. After seeing a Mullholland Dr., you'll feel many different things depending on what kind of person you are. My feelings were a mix of awe and sadness (as corny as it may sound), and most of all confusion. Many will be turned off and ultimately hate it for its complexity, which is unfortunate. The cinematography is breathtaking (the film takes on a very soft, colorful and dreamy look). Almost every scene is memorable: from the opening jitterbug sequence, to those downright disturbing smiles on the old people's faces, to the man behind Winkies, the cowboy, Club Silencio, and the ending... just to name a few out of the whole movie. After seeing the movie more than 5 times, I still find myself amazed all throughout the film, picking up a little more of something new each viewing. This is also one of the darkest movies I have ever seen next to Lynch's other classic Eraserhead. Not accessible and by no means mainstream, if you can bring yourself to appreciate it, you will be more than rewarded.

Everyone has different interpretations and that's what I love about David Lynch's movies. I think it's just a story repeating itself over and over and it's orchestrated by those people in the theater and around a diner somehow with that magic blue box.

1495,ghawbjby,Dream explanation,9,27 March 2021,"In the western world, 'The Interpretation of Dreams' by Sigmund Freud as a cornerstone of psychoanalysis scientifically justifies the significance of subconsciousness and further unveils the mystery of psychology. However, in the eastern world, 'Zhougong's Dream Dictionary' is one of the most ancient Chinese works on dream interpretation by its motif. Westerns regard dreams as the interpretation of the past and a representation of true self; however, easterns tend to emphasise on the prophetic function of dreams.It is generally believed that a person is made up of two parts - consciousness and subconsciousness. The feeling of conflicts, entanglements and loss of control are attributed to the fact that consciousness runs counter to subconsciousness. Subconsciousness can be realised through stilling the mind with exceptional retrospective ability, or, the most mysterious way - dreams.Freud thinks that dream is a fulfilment of desire. Dream = repressed desire + disguised satisfaction. The concept of imitation, in a nutshell, is a psychological phenomenon in which a person substitutes himself/herself into anther person for a certain reason - this happens many time in the dream of Mulholland Drive.The director David Lynch confuses the audience with interchanging dream and reality. It is the sense of loss and confusion from my personal experience creates an prolonged 'aftermath' for me - which is 'exploring my dark side'.",Mulholland Drive
1496,aristide575,The key to understanding the story line,10,2 September 2013,"A film often seen as surrealistic and entirely incomprehensible, I am to provide the course of events of the plot line here, as they must be in chronological order.You have to see it like this: The moment when Camille puts the blue key into the blue box is the moment when finally not only her consciousness comes back. She remembers who she is and what her life was, and what happened just before the accident. This is when the movie shows the spectator how things came to the point where they are now.(The fact that Betty disappears just before Camille puts the blue key to the key hole of the blue box fits perfectly into the metaphor – Betty helped Camille unto now to try to regain some memory, but of course, one can only regain one's own memory by oneself.) The second part of the film, after the blue triangle key opening the blue box, tells what happened before the accident, it is as simple as that.But no wonder the film is so confusing. The whole story is related through the eyes of a woman who lost all her memory, and is regaining it piece by piece.The story is not that complicated, and is really very clear in the film: Two actresses, Diane and Camille, have a relationship. When Camille has an affair and ends up marrying the director of a film she is in and ends the first relationship, jealous Diane hires a professional killer to get her ex-lover killed. However, because of a freak accident at the moment that Camille should be killed, she survives. Having received head trauma, she walks back into the city. There, she finds refuge in an empty apartment, in which she hides until discovered by the new inhabitant, a young woman from out of town coming to stay for a short while in the apartment, while the owner is on holiday. This young woman, also an aspiring actress, and whose name is Betty, will help Camille try to find back her memory. After two nights, the two become lovers.In the meantime, Camille's ex-lover Diane received the agreed on sign to say that the murder has been executed - even though it has not: in the beginning passages of the film already we saw that the killer she hired was a bungler, so he delivered the key before being sure of having the mission accomplished.Diane commits suicide because of the guilt.Camille and Betty discovering Diane, Camille's ex-lover's body in her apartment, while Camille has not regained memory yet, she only knows that girl, Diane, is someone she used to know.However, she will recover her memory during the following night.I identified only one single passage as a dream passage – the part when the house-swap neighbour comes, and Diane is seemingly resurrected. I also have some loose ends – the guy and the face at Winkie's, and the ""cowboy"". One day I will probably watch the film again with these two loose ends in mind.By the way, the fact that the first thing that Camille remembers is her ex-girlfriend's name, and that she even thinks that might be herself means that the two women must have had a strong and significant relationship. Also the fact that her ex-girlfriend is ready to kill Camille for leaving her attests to this.I wrote longer and in more detail about this on my personal blog http://traschy.blogspot.nl/2013/09/mulholland-drive.html",Mulholland Drive
1497,grobins-800-541865,don't understand or like the storyline/plot. I enjoyed the filming aspect.,3,24 September 2013,"As I sat on my couch to watch this movie, I honestly had no clue what to think. When this movie came out, I was 5. It wasn't like I was going to watch it because all of my friends suggested it, in fact none of my friends have even heard of it. It was just myself in my big house, dark outside, and the TV screen playing. I was ready well as ready as I could be. I was confused from minute one to minute one forty-seven. To me, the story made no sense. There were a variety of different characters, with different stories and problems throughout the film. What made it worse about understanding the different characters conflicts is that, each scene would basically cut off and not have an ending. It never felt like each scene was final. It go to a scene of Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Harring) then just transfer to Justin (Adam Kesher) talking to a group of people around a table. I honestly wish I could tell you the story line, but I, myself don't even quite understand. Before watching this movie, I read a summary that one line stuck with me. ""In a twisting venture beyond dreams and reality."" Thinking of that one line throughout the film really made me wonder was this all reality or dreams? Then it started to remind of the movie Memento. I took the idea of Memento and the review this being reality or a dream and decided that since I was so confused that it had to be a mix of both. Meaning that not everything was chronological and instead of it being a dream, it was all a nightmare. The nightmare is from the dark type of film and the actual darkness in the film.The lighting, was very unique. It always had a darkness to it, like it was comparing itself to the ""darkness"" of the movie. It would always get dark when it was either leading up to something or when something 'bad' was occurring. Which made it predictable after awhile that you knew something was going to happen. Maybe not exactly what every time but what it could be. The only time it was actually light, was when the characters were outside on the streets. Otherwise there was some type of darkness to each scene.With that being said, the sound was quite interesting in this movie. Most of the time it was silent of everything else except the background noise. This means cars on the street, the sound of people going by, which can be natural but they made it occur very loudly and having no other type of sound during that time period. It would either be that, a character talking, or mysterious music leading up to something. Every time it got really dark, that typical creepy/mysterious music played I knew something was bound to happen. I am not one to watch creepy movies, I actually get scared very easily but after awhile due to it happening a lot it just got annoying. When a movie gets predictable it really isn't fun to watch.For sure, not everything was predictable. Since this movie like I said multiple times was, confusing to me, I felt like I was totally missing something. It caused me to pay attention more and really only try to focus on the movie. Basically to see if I could get 'context clues' or just realize what I wasn't getting at first. As you may guess, it didn't really help. The storyline of the movie, not my favorite because I really couldn't comprehend it. Maybe if I understood it better and really got the concept I would enjoy it. I want to suggest watching it a second time, right after the end might help, but I didn't do that. After it was over, I felt relieved.BUT...I really liked the way it was filmed. They would change shots, angles, and perspectives a lot. Now you probably wouldn't notice, unless you were looking for it which is great. That means it was done well. They would switch to what the character would see in their perspective to the characters reaction. It gave me more information, and it was less guessing I had to do!I really believe they did a great job of filming, sounds, and editing the movie. With that being said, that really only shows to people who are looking for it, like me. Did I like the movie? No. Did I hate the movie? No. It was more grasping the underlying problem. I wouldn't go suggest everyone to watch it, but if someone wanted to I wouldn't tell them absolutely not! Everyone thinks different and may understand it in a totally different than I did. Who knows, maybe the director, David Lynch made it like that on purpose. The point was to leave you confused trying to understand it in your own way. It just wasn't a movie that got my attention (except when I was trying to focus EXTRA hard), and I would never pick this movie out of a choice. That is also something to consider. If I was given movies to watch, this type of mysterious/drama movie is not my type of genre so it would be a last choice of mine. Also watching this at the age of sixteen, is different than watching it at the age of sixty. So many different things play a role in the understanding and opinion of the movie.No matter what, I still really enjoyed the shot, and angles of this movie. To me, that was the best part of it, which made it semi bearable to watch. Meaning that I was focusing more on how it was filmed, then what was being filmed.",Mulholland Drive

1502,JohnKrll,A film that challenges its viewer,8,22 August 2008,"David Lynch's Mulholland Drive is a film that finds its place among Lynch's other experimental expositions such as Eraserhead and Blue Velvet. While the film has been labeled, at times, as mere intellectual snobbery and experimentation, in truth, Mulholland Drive is a movie that challenges it's watcher's need for logical coherence and, to a degree, closure. What this means is, Mulholland Drive is an open-ended film that invites a bevy of radically different interpretations, all, perhaps, only half-truths.Mulholland Drive's method is one of free-dream-associations  similar to the literary works of James Joyce. Characters and events flow illogically and with disregard to continuity, while the films major tone and mood are maintained. Events are both deflated and blown-up, out of proportion, because this is how the mind works during dreams. What is key is not whether events make rational sense, but how they fit into the structure and mood of the film.It is beneficial to break-up the film into two separate parts  each with their own distinct story lines  but with important connections to each other. The first part is one of wildly fantastic, interrelated vignettes (or mini-stories) that are simultaneously farcical and disturbing in nature. There are bumbling hit-men, mysterious mobsters, and, unexplainably, a cowboy with important information. The main characters of this section  Betty and Rita  sneak around like detectives trying to restore Rita's mysterious identity, while stumbling onto dead-bodies, creepy neighbors, and haunting night-clubs.The second major part of the film has been called a reality check, or wake up from the first section. In many ways it is. Betty (who is now called Diane) is very clearly woken up from her slumber, and the pathos of the film assumes a gritty feel. Yet again, as in the first section, logical coherence is disregarded and the various situations of the film remain grossly exaggerated to fit the character's changing moods. The second section ends on a down-note, an act of destruction and violence, in contradistinction to the first, which ended on a note of culmination, of creation and love.On the whole, Mulholland Drive is a film that disregards its watcher. It exists objectively as a film, by itself, and then invites the watcher into its experience, without leading one by the hand and fulfilling the watcher's every need.",Mulholland Drive
1503,james098,perfect film to infect your mates,10,21 November 2005,"I cannot recommend this film enough, harks back to the first series of twin peaks but with much more quality in all aspects especially in reference to plot resolution. This film is a multi-viewing pleasure and i hope his next reaches such quality. The film starts as you would expect in an unsettling manner in a car driving down the notorious mulholland drive stretch, the lady inside the car carries a strange, obviously important artifact or object. An accident occurs and then a gang of gun wielding thugs in two cars appear, one swerves(the other hitting). After the initial haze the non-identifiable lady of the original journey exits the car with minor injuries with a deep red blood appearing from a head. She observes the landscape down onto the glaring lights of stardom then wanders down.After this a malaise of distinctive plot lines are thrown at you in probably one of the greatest films of the nineties",Mulholland Drive
1504,Hwbond55,A crappy movie. Shouldn't be watched.,1,17 January 2014,I'm going to be completely blunt and say this movie SUCKED! I keep an open mind when watching movies and try to give credit where it is due and the only good thing I can say about this movie is that a few of the singers were good. That's about it. EVERY review I read on this movie was raving about how wonderful it was. I honestly couldn't even give a summary for this movie. I am so lost as to what even happened. I attempted to read someone's theory as to what this movie meant... Still NOTHING! I thoroughly enjoy movies that make me think such as Inception. This movie was just stupid. It was meaningless. I literally wasted almost 2 1/2 hours watching this crap. The acting sucked and the movie again made absolutely no sense. Do NOT waste your time.,Mulholland Drive
1505,Lordundead,probably the only directly solvable Lynch Film,10,15 May 2005,"Mulholland Dr. is a perfect film in all aspects. the directing is definitely Lynch's Abstract misdirection. All the elements of the usual Lynch Film are there... Unnamed horror (man behind Winkies), A beginning of ""not human"" or ""not real"" characters, symbolic spoilers, uncovering a secret that only gets darker, and the confusion of all until the very end (SPOILER... which is the only part of reality, It's all a dream until Diane wakes up after the dream flickers away with the second look of the cowboy, you can tell it's a dream just by looking at the beginning before the title even comes up... the jitterbug surrealism, contest winner(Diane), and then you come to a fuzzy shot of the bed and pillow of diane's room, you know because of the lamp and bed/pillow covers . all of the beginning is connected to parts of said figure out why we've been shown this and from who's perspective, you realize that this is the only way lynch could have shown it... a dream of a dreamer and i love the line ""now it's like i'm in this dream place"" -Betty(abstract wanton vision of Diane) I'd say Lynch's theory's from as far back as Eraserhead all the way to Lost Highway came together for this one. probably the only directly solvable lynch film (excluding the purely symbolic Blue Velvet and Eraserhead) this mystery you just keep watching and learning new things. great original story and direction with cool guest stars. powerful emotional consideration with Mr.Lynch, every scene a reason, every feeling a connection, and every character shown masked first. don't forget... the curtains always go up until after it's over. well worth watching if you want something intelligent and original.",Mulholland Drive
1506,gbuck159,"Love, Jealousy, Revenge, Hate, Coffee",9,29 March 2005,"OK, what is there to be said about mulholland drive that hasn't already been said.this film is a tricky one to review, because for many people, after one viewing, they wont watch again, the volition just isn't there, because it makes no sense (i don't care what people say, anyone says they got this film first time is a liar). But watch it again and you'll start noticing things. Yeah, the time line is screwy, yeah, its more confusing than anything you will ever have seen (probably), bu trust me, work through it and it becomes more than a film, it becomes a small part of your life.the acting is first rate, as you would expect from such a cast, but its more than first rate, its more than acting in fact, its as if the lead roles are scribing eternal tales of love and hate directly onto your soul. Its hard to explain, but this film is so unlike any film ever, that the atmosphere and mood really are unique.once you start to realise what this film is about (and some people have said they expected it to be more profound, and were let down, but what is more profound than ending the woman you loves life because you are so wildly passionate you cant stand to see her with anyone else), it will just stay with you forever a truly magnificent film, and i haven't even touched on the directing (A*, what else would you expect from Lynch), the cinematography and script (again A*) and overall just the beauty of some of the scenes (if your not affected your dead) please, give this film more than one go, it will change your life",Mulholland Drive

1508,davidmalana,Mulholland Drive- the puzzler of puzzlers,8,6 May 2005,"It is not often that films are both confusing and pleasing. Confusion is often reconciled throughout films in ways that leave viewers with a sense of finality and comfort with whatever theme that the filmmakers wish to convey. However, there are certain films that use irreconcilable plot incongruencies as a device that leaves an audience intentionally puzzled. The effectiveness and entertainment value of the movie is then even more dependent on the production and quality of the portions of the film that are coherent. David Lynch's film entitled Mulholland Drive is this sort of movie. Through it's ambiguous, disjointed plot yet superbly executed production, Mulholland Drive is a highly puzzling yet entertaining film. This critique intends to outline and analyze the aspects of the film that make it work.Without a coherent plot to depend on, Mulholland Drive places the onus of its quality on the value of each aspect of production. Through the usage of music, transitions, angling, and other film techniques, the movie manages to convey a message that stays consistent with the themes of the film that are discernible. The music manages to convey a sense of looming mystery and ominous foreshadowing in the low, constant tones. Even in the scenes where the characters are in broad daylight, like when the men are behind the restaurant or when the women are at Diane's apartment, the music compels the viewer to maintain a sense of tension and suspense. Another part of the film that enhances this feeling is the camera work. There is a strong presence of first person camera, which is another indication of the limited level of knowledge that the viewer is allowed. The blind corners and dark areas that are shown in this mode bring about an even greater sense of tension and even fear. Atop this camera effect technique is the hazy and disoriented transitions. This is consistent with the vagueness of the story as well as the memory of Rita (Camilla) that was largely lost after her accident. The combination of the music, camera perspective, and transitions translates into a riveting look inside the intense mystery that is centered around Mulholland Drive. With these tools, the viewer is drawn into a series of events that are disjointed and indiscernible yet enrapturing and highly entertaining.The plot is one of dizzying twists and curves that leave the viewer rather speculative. There are numerous possibilities as to what actually happened in the film that depend largely on the chronological order one sees the events in. It is possible that there are the three characters of Camilla/ Rita, Betty, and Diane that take on interchangeable aesthetic identities throughout the film by the main actresses Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harding. It seems that there is also the possibility that Rita and Betty took on the alter identities of Camilla and Diane as time progressed after the accident. Another plausible plot involves Diane arranging the murder of Camilla then rekindling her love affair with ""Rita"" after the accident. Of course there are more possibilities that all seem possible, yet ultimately irreconcilable in any explicit way. This versatility is part of what makes this film worth watching again and again, and it is also one of the reasons that it was nominated for an Academy Award.The themes of this film are represented well through the symbolism of specific parts of the film. There is the dancing scene in the beginning with the multiple layers and reducing characters, which is symbolic of the cryptic nature of the plots and the dwindling memories of the film. There is also Silencio, the name of the place where the intriguing Spanish performance occurred. The oft spoken quote ""no hay banda,"" or ""there is no band,"" is another suggestion perhaps that reality is arbitrary and existence is not at all absolute or easy to discern. Certainly there are numerous ways to interpret the film, and this appears to be no accident on the part of the filmmakers' intentions. But the disorientation that the characters experience is transferred masterfully onto the viewer throughout the film. As far as puzzling movies go, this is extremely puzzling. However, this seeming disarray of events and themes is consistent in a way that is as confusing as it is riveting and ultimately entertaining.",Mulholland Drive

This represents the woman ""Betty Elms / Diane Selwyn"" committing suicide with a gun. This happens off camera and off scene.The suicide is portrayed by the car crash in the opening scene. (The gunshot is heard during the crash scene.)We are then shown Betty / Diane basically review the personalities and choices of her life.As the neurons in her consciousness fire their last blips, her visions (which we see) get really weird. (i.e. her parents become tiny incomprehensible demon-like creatures.)The movie ends with the memory of the suicide. Betty / Diane shoots herself. Clouds of oblivion takes all...movie ends.That's the movie.It's a contemporary ""Carnival of Souls"".THERE! Now you understand ""Mulholland Drive"".Ronald Santos - David Lynch fan.",Mulholland Drive

1511,katzkillz,"Oh my, God!!! What a waste of film!!!! (Possible spoiler)",1,26 May 2005,"I gave this one star because you can't go any lower than that here. I am reeling at the fact that I have wasted two and a half hours of my life watching this movie! It was chosen by my girlfriend, as a recommendation by her sister (who obviously needs to be beaten over the head with a bag of hammers and then shown some REAL cinematography). Needless to say, my girlfriend is NEVER allowed to pick out another movie. I have never felt so strongly about a movie as to write about it. However, this one warrants some warning to readers here who may not yet have seen this movie and are contemplating it. In two and a half hours, there are about 45 minutes of actual dialog. The movie moves at the pace of a pregnant snail with arthritis and a broken shell. Uphill. It is a great movie if you are suffering from serious emotional problems, or, are a suicidal lesbian, Hell-bent and glory bound to let you get the best of yourself. It could be said for anyone with a broken heart, not just suicidal lesbians. But, if you are unfortunate enough to encounter this trite little foray in to the disturbed workings of, what I can only presume is, a novice director, you'll understand what I mean. The cinematography was horrible. The shaking tends to lead one to run off for the nearest bottle of Dramamine. The characters are simplistic, predictable (though the plot is not...I'm sorry, did I say plot?) and, rather shallow. I have read better story lines from those exercises in 7th grade English class where one student starts a story, and passes the page to the next student, until it gets around the room. Imagine having 50 people get together. You tell one person something that is about 5 lines long. They repeat it to the next, and so on down the line. What you come out with, when compared to the original message is pure gibberish. Now...imagine applying the same concept to film. If you can do that, then, you have a better understanding of what this movie is going to be like for you. I think the safest thing to do, is take everyone who had anything to do with this movie actually being made (minus the actors, I realize that Hollywood is a tough business and sometimes, work is hard to find) were thrown in to a pit of rattle snakes, then, sent to a wading pool of hydrochloric acid, and then, sent skydiving over a feeding frenzy of great white sharks. Put it all on Pay Per View, and, you will be able to cover the expense of the viewers who are going to need therapy to figure out why they actually sat through more than about the first half an hour. Someone...PLEASE...get this message to the producer: STOP THE INSANITY!!!! I can't believe that a movie actually drove me to seek out a place to warn other people not to watch it. I thought Open Water was the worst movie ever made. Now...I know I was wrong. Oh, so wrong.",Mulholland Drive
1512,elaine-white,Dream on film,10,23 December 2008,"Lynch is the only director I've had the pleasure of viewing who - literally - can place the dreamscape onto film for others to view. We all get bored by those people who insist on sharing their intricate dreams with us, because they are long and dull for those who aren't involved. But also because dream logic is unstable, irrational, confusing - once you wake up. In Mulholland Dr., we care for the person dreaming, and care for her dreams.Mulholland Dr. is, like Twin Peaks in parts, a dream laid out on film. It is obscene for that reason - it is a private, unconscious moment made public and available. We share this film as voyeurs. This is a personal dream that makes me blush to watch - because we are not supposed to have this kind of insight into other people's psyche. But when you stop watching, like waking in those few moments from a dream, it all makes sense. When reality floods back, it still haunts.What a genius is Lynch - and what a master of dreams and nightmares.",Mulholland Drive
1513,ravingponies,Great Movie,10,29 May 2005,"Mulholland Drive is one of Lynch's best films by far. It is filled with everything you can ask for: action, horror, suspense, lesbian love scenes....Lynch is able to the viewer into this strange and bizarre world where we are never sure what is real and what is not. First time Lynch viewers should not expect something that makes complete sense, otherwise expect a major headache at the end. This movie forces the viewers to observe and develop their own conclusions about the story. Whether you love it or hate it, Mulholland Drive is an unforgettable, haunting movie. After seeing it for the first time, I could not get it out of my mind for the next week. When a movie has that much of a hold on you, you know it has effected you in some way. This movie is guaranteed to thrill you in some way, whether it be Lynch's unique storytelling, the great visuals, or mesmerizing soundtrack. This is a definite must for all Lynch fans as well as anyone else who is into surreal films. Those unfamiliar with Lynch's work might have a difficult time with this movie, but sometimes the best thing to do with this movie is just to roll with it. And make you watch it more than once, it's gets better the second time around since you can pick up on the the subtleties you missed the first time. Go see this movie!",Mulholland Drive

1516,pepjelowitsch,Vague attempt to explain,9,30 August 2005,"I had just seen it yesterday while paying attention to ""David Lynch's 10 clues to unlock this thriller"". It was my 3rd attempt. I will try to explain how the movie works for me. I think the first part of the movie is Diane Selwyn's dream (and some wishful thinking): Diane Selwyn played by Naomi Watts. Before the credits you can notice somebody facing his red cushion and sinking down. She (?) falls into sleep. Before Club Silencio, all the things going on seem to be a wonderful dream for her. Her goddess had an accident just as she was threatened by two cruel guys. Thus ""Rita"" (a dreamed character of Diane's female affair: Camilla Rhodes - played by Laura Harring) suffers a total loss of memory. The following story shows the wonderful life of Betty - Diane's alter ego. All you can see is remix of Diane's memory. The unusual story of lovely Betty and amnesiac Rita heightens straight up to its climax in the end of part 1. There is no aftershow in Club Silencio. Diane is waking up confronted with her present life... She is suffering the probable death of Camilla Rhodes - the woman she loves. Diane payed for the assassin. In the second part of the the movie you can notice details of Diane's life which are reflected in her dream. The plot jumps before and after her wakening up.Incidentally, while Betty and Rita are visiting Diane Selwyn in no.17, Diane dreams visiting her own burial together with a person who should regret.",Mulholland Drive

I'm not going to reveal the story, but there are many, many questions that are not answered. If you have the choice, watch another film. Mulholland Drive is complete waist of time!Lynch can do better, he had proved it several times before, but with this ""turkey"", it would not surprise me if he's career is to it's end. The actors, though, are good. Thats the thing I enjoyed with the film. in fact, i would say that the acting overall is very good! So, is it really that bad? Well, don't take my word for it!

In the end, it is Betty that supplies her the key, aka, is that which lies at the center of her lost memories. Figuratively speaking, unlocking the blue box is Diane's way of pinching herself in order to wake herself up. And just as pinching one's self in a dream does not actually awaken one's self but is rather just a the part of the dream representing awakening, unlocking the box of course does not actually somehow restore Diane's memory, but merely represents in her dreaming mind the moment of her memory's restoration upon recovering neurologically from the accident.

What did the director mean? I really don't care. This was a mishmash of subplots that made no sense whatsoever. There must be ten different explanations of the movie. I don't enjoy sharing idiotic interpretations of this waste of a movie. Apparently, there are a lot of people in this world that like to search for the symbolism and special meaning of the director. To me, this movie is a perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood. As if you don't already know, the plot jumps back and forth between different scenarios and different time periods. I guess the coolest thing was the guy that played The Cowboy. I love the way he was dressed. It made no sense as he was totally out of place.

Like when the cowboy told the director that he would see him once if he did good and twice if he did bad and we see the cowboy 2 more times. This movie is a rambling of a dream or nightmare laid out like a jigsaw puzzle except each person may see a different picture when they're done.

1524,davidclappphotography,An Eroded Fractured Art School Wreck,1,27 December 2015,"This film is a dissociative. It's as though David Lynch magically captured the crumbling, unhinged conscious world on film as you descend into illness with influenza. You can smell the dry rot and with stale curtains. It's far from Lynch hitting the bullseye; it doesn't hit the dartboard or even the dartboard wall but hits the mat with precision. Forget gushy exhalations about cinematography masterpiece, this is a K-Hole of a film. Now in 2015 it has now eroded to leave a fractured art school wreck.1. It labours every camera angle leaving the viewer separated from the story, trapped in the mechanics of indulgent camera-work. It's worth remind yourself that the second you feel like this with any movie, a film is a failure.2. It is littered with bad production decisions. You can literally see the storyboards, the dressing of wardrobe mannequins as you are watching it, which become magnified by the cartoon character lead roles.3. The story's 'turning point' drowns the plot instead of unveiling it. 4. The lead girls magnetic looks eclipse the film entirely - I can imagine this was great for Lynch's pre-release meetings / investors / publicity office, but they are so visually intriguing to watch that the whole film spins off axis. You spend the film in a bubble of teenage sexual anxiety, as you plot wade, floating above the soup thick cinemaphotography on a raft of personal fantasy.5. Supporting actors and actresses are weak and uncharismatic, like the film production management meetings, the pathetic Woody-Harleson-a-like 'Cowboy' and let's not comprehend how the hell Billy Ray Cyrus ended up here other than a Lynch fulfilling a burbon addled Hollywood party promiseIt's not genius, it's indulgent, laborious, dated, eroded, film school rubbish.",Mulholland Drive
1525,DustyBrott,MullHolland Dr. is only understood by understanding the play scene,10,7 August 2005,"I haven't read all the comments so if someone has already pointed this out I apologize.In short, Lynch movies are designed to only be understood after a second, or a series of, re-watchings. First time I saw it I was confused. The second time, my mind was blown.Watts character killed the brunette out of professional jealousy. The amnesia in the beginning is really Watts' character remembering the brunette, but Watts is in a moment of shock and doesn't believe it just yet. The turn-around. Watts realizes what she's done at the theatre. If you notice the brunette woman singing on stage at one point falls dead but her voice continues. Just like the host says in the play. You hear a trumpet, yet there is no trumpet (notice how he seems to be looking at Watts character). Lightning begins to strike, Watts character begins to shake. She's remembering the truth. She's hearing and seeing what's not there......the brunette woman with amnesia.Now we see the brunette at the beginning in the car, going to a fancy party. The fact is, is that Watts character desperately wanted to make it in the movie business but is growing more and more jealous of her brunette counterpart. She hires the hit-man, that Lynch cleverly throws in at odd points early on to throw us a curveball, and has the brunette woman murdered (we even see the dead body early on when the two women are searching the mysterious house). The blue box and the key........Remember at the end how it is opened by the mysterious man behind the dumpster. The horrible truth is unleashed on Watts. Remember early on the story of the two guys at the diner who we never see again? The one guy with big eyebrows is talking about a dream he had of his friend and that there's a man behind the dumpster that's controlling everything. Well, when he finds the man behind the dumpster, that just indicates that the big-eyebrowed man has killed his friend that he saw in the dream. This of course parallels the whole theme of what happened in Mullholland Dr. Lynch movies are very intelligent actually. He's even said on an interview on the Blue Velvet DVD that he wants to make movies that REQUIRE repeated viewings. Quite clever of him. Now, if you want to see a Lynch movie that'll really twist your brain check out Lost Highway.",Mulholland Drive

1527,ImAVeronica,The Perfect Representation of a Dream,10,18 April 2020,"Mulholland Drive is arguably David Lynch's most well-known, recognized film. And this is for good reason: it's one of his few stories that makes complete sense. The widely held theory that the first four fifths of the movie is a dream that the character in the last fifth of the movie is having is the one that I subscribe to. It makes the entire story have a united plot, and ultimately, it makes rewatching it all the more tragic.A derelict, washed out actress named Diane Selwyn lusts for Camilla Rhodes, another actress who was thrust into fame by narrowly getting the lead role that Diane auditioned for. The two are friends, but Camilla is getting married to the director of her film, Adam Kesher. Diane, in a moment of anger, hires an assassin to kill Camilla. The night after Camilla has been killed, Diane has a dream of guilt in an attempt to rewrite the relationship between herself and Camilla. In her dream, she's a bright-eyed, ambitious newcomer to LA named Betty, and Camilla is an amnesiac, dubbed Rita, who's helpless and must stay under Betty's care. Adam Kesher is also in the dream, having what appears to be the single worst day of his life as he goes through misfortune after misfortune. Diane even attempts to rectify Camilla's assassination by portraying the hitman she hired as a bumbling, terrible killer - perhaps to convince herself that Camilla somehow got away safe.The masterful thing about this film isn't just how Lynch captures the tone and surreality of dreams, but how he makes everything seem so natural and unquestioned (just like while you're in the middle of a dream). When Betty moves into her aunt's apartment in LA, the landlord notes that another tenant used to have a ""prize-fighting kangaroo"" in his room. It's a one-off line, but no one questions a thing, and it's delivered in such a way that even the audience doesn't recognize the absurdity of the statement. Little things are off - people laugh for a moment more than they should, phrases are repeated like chants, and a triviality like espresso being bad can cause a catastrophe for the entire city. Every scene has you on the edge of your seat because you genuinely don't know what will happen next in this almost-normal, but slightly off world. It's a film that you can watch over and over again because the ride is just so entertaining.Mulholland Drive is the best David Lynch film, in my opinion. He creates a tragic mystery of projection and rejection, of love and hatred, with enough subtle clues to keep things grounded and provide excellent fodder for rewatch.",Mulholland Drive

Yes, David Lynch is a renowned, very experienced and versatile artist. Does that make up for the horrible dialogue, mediocre acting, very average cinematography and very inadequate length of this film? I don't think so...The Elephant Man was great and I understood the use of Surrealism in Eraserhead, but this is confusing for the sake of being confusing. No symbology, no threads to hold onto... a complete mess accompanied by a completely outdated soundtrack, which might as well have been written for Apocalypse Now. After reading some reviews, I am glad to say that there were no elements that were just too profound for me to grasp - everyone seems to be as lost (in what concerns to search for meaning) as I am. There is a natural tendency to assume something is genius when you simply don't get it, especially when it comes from such a great artist such as Lynch. I disagree!

But Rita is also staying in the apartment, a victim of amnesia. Rita has tens of thousands of dollars in cash and a strange key.

I believe that he was aiming for a confusing movie that people would be talking about for a long time, like it or not. I think he has succeeded brilliantly. I'm not posting this for argumentative purposes but am just explaining how I believe this film has done exactly what Lynch wanted it to do. What he wanted it to do was confuse people who enjoy being confused, make people think who enjoy thinking, and tick people off who don't like either of the previous two.

1541,juanosix,Dimensional Persona Exchange=Hollywood,9,20 November 2005,"Mulholland Drive, Lynch's 2001 nightmare/mystery, is almost flawless in constitution. A most enthralling account and study on how Hollywood gobbles up and recycles its temporary thespian contributors. Using themes he first introduced in 'Lost Highway', Lynch manages to make concrete the almost ghost-like energy and remnants of the old Hollywood studio system. Blending a roster of old and new actors, he also masterfully weaves a miasma of interchangeable plot lines that almost too perfectly capture the climates now found in modern day LA. Originally meant to be a Television pilot for an ABC series, the foolish broadcasters chose to decline and passed on the series, already in development, in the last round. Lynch took it to French investors, added another 45 minutes of footage, and released it as his next film. Brilliant!!!",Mulholland Drive
1542,dalibor-10,Mulholland Drive is a film with a key,10,4 January 2006,". That means you need to find the key to open it (its meanings), to read it. At the very beginning we see dancing couple multiplied over one another using so called ""blue key"", special effect used by TV to place a figure (shot in studio) inside an environment, usually exterior (street, nature etc.). If we take this as a key then we realize that two female characters (Rita and Betty) are actually one and the same woman (a box appears later in the film again with a blue key). Rita/Betty is dying after a car accident and in her last moments she sees her life  her coming to Hollywood as a young aspiring actress and her ending as a hooker. Death keeps appearing in different occasions and shapes. The Silenzio club is a place where Rita/Betty meet death on a stage. The singer is introduced by the announcer saying that the performance will be a""play-back"". That means not being ""live"". That's why Rita/Betty cries. At the end of the movie there is also a very impressive appearance of deathetc. Mulholland Drive is a way to the other world, the world of death (in short).",Mulholland Drive

Many great moments and unforgettable characters. For a ""thinking"" movie, I think that it works because interpretations are possible given all information within the movie rather than having to draw upon outside literary references.It also works within Lynch's body of work. In many ways, he tells the same type of story in several of his movies. I would compare MD with Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, and Erasehead. As a more mature work, the story is told with more confidence, and with more daring (such as liberal use of time sequencing).",Mulholland Drive
1544,ryderpomerleau,"A meticulously crafted, mind-bending masterpiece",10,28 December 2019,"Mulholland Drive is an incredibly divisive movie; everyone seems to view it either as a masterpiece or an abomination, and this is understandable, as it is extremely confusing and subtle. Most confusing movies give enough clues and clear plot points to formulate a theory, although it still takes a lot of thought to piece together these clues. Mulholland Drive still gives these clues, but they're very subtle; it's hard to tell what's important, what isn't and how all these seemingly unconnected occurrences all connect. The narrative is far from conventional too, and this only adds to the mystery.This makes it quite clear why this movie is so divisive, because on first appearance, it can seem severely disjointed, incoherent and simply a mess, if you try to view it as a straightforward narrative. Nothing is made clear to the viewer, and so much is kept a mystery for so long, that it is completely understandable as to why it is such a frustrating and pointless movie to some, however I felt myself intrigued throughout. The constant mystery and subtle hints made me very interested and entertained for the whole movie; it always gave enough information to keep the viewer interested, but not a single bit more. The final 15-20 minutes gives many answers, but creates even more questions, the answers to which are all alluded to within the movie. Many criticise David Lynch of having no idea of what he was doing, and view this movie as only being liked because people think they are finding meaning in what is merely an incomprehensible mess, and I understand how people would think this given the subtlety of the clues and plot, and if you approach the movie thinking it's going to have a straightforward narrative then you will come out disappointed and confused. However, the clues are there, and David Lynch has crafted this movie so carefully and precisely that if you put a lot of thought into it afterwards, you will be able to put together your own theory and ideas.As for the other aspects of the movie, the cinematography is spectacular, particularly in one standout scene early in the movie, in which the camera is used effectively to create maximum tension. I was apprehensive about the acting at first, mainly due to Naomi Watts' character, as it felt a little forced and unnatural, but soon I realised that it was just the character's personality and she displayed some great acting throughout the movie. The musical score was great too, and overall everything was incredibly well done, I didn't feel that anything dragged down the quality,But of course, the standout feature was the plot, which was masterfully crafted with intense precision to elicit intrigue, and remain in the minds of the viewers for a long time afterwards. It truly is a masterful, if often misunderstood movie, which I believe fully deserves its praise.",Mulholland Drive

1546,nben_nett,Creativity does not have to make sense...,1,14 December 2005,"This film is unique! It is creative! It is the most overrated piece of crap I've ever watched! This movie is cruel; only in the sense that it draws you in by being very interesting only to disappoint in the end. Like a great film, Mulholland Dr. feels like it is gradually building up to some grand finale where everything becomes crystal clear and you wonder why you didn't figure it out sooner. Unfortunately, the end result is no grand finale! In fact, within a matter of minutes you suddenly feel as though you're watching a completely different film that just happens to have the same characters. It is as if the writer/director had two completely different ideas for this film, couldn't pick one and just decided to combine the two. As the film climaxed/became unwatchable, I couldn't help but think that I somehow missed something along the way and maybe this was just my fault. Luckily, as I watched it for a second time(a couple MORE hours I'll never get back) I realized that it was not me that missed some key detail or moment in the film. It was the film itself that was flawed. Seriously, I have no idea why this movie was even made. Maybe the studio just wanted to watch Naomi Watts get naughty with another woman. If you're looking for entertainment you would be better off watching another movie. All that you will find here is frustration!",Mulholland Drive

It's as though Lynch filmed three different movies, accidentally set fire to each of the reels, spliced the remnants of the inferno together, found a producer, and stuck the piece of crap on a DVD for all to hate. I would rather rub raw meat on my eyes have rats chew off my eyelids and hot wax poured into my eyeballs than ever watch this filth again. The first thing i thought of when the movie was finished was that i wasted 2.5 hours of my life that i will never ever be able to redeem. David Lynch missed the memo on what constitutes a good film.

1548,tpcasey,Tom Casey Reviews Mulholland Drive,10,20 December 2005,"David Lynch is difficult because he makes demands on his audience. He takes meticulous care to fabricate an atmosphere that is, culturally speaking, a collation. The clothes, music, and behavioral idiom is out of pace, yet we see ourselves. Stranger than anything we could have imagined, his world is finally recognizable as our own. If genius is the ability to make connections, David Lynch is a genius of film who connects inner experience to the objects and individuals from without that mold and influence it. MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a film preoccupied with identity. On its surface, it is the story of a young woman who won a dance contest and a chance to have a Hollywood audition. Though by no means clear until much later in the film, she has mediocre talent and falls prey to destructive seductions that turn her dream into a nightmare and destroy her. But what Lynch has done with this Hollywood cliché is magical. It's all in the telling: his trick is to hide his story by cryptically putting it right in front of you. Time after time, the viewer's conventional expectations lead to wrong conclusions, raising the level of confusion and suspense. Like BLUE VELVET, MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a mystery, told from an emotional rather than a rational language of meaning. This is important to realize; it's why Lynch is unintelligible to so many. Without Freudian understanding, the depth of his insight and the richness of his art cannot be comprehended consciously. The meticulous clues that he puts before yousometimes literally in your facewill be misread or overlooked. BLUE VELVET, an Oedipal allegory, takes a tour through the mindscapes of sex and guilt in a young man processing the shock of his father's heart attack. MULHOLLAND DRIVE similarly works from the inside out, but its canvass is much larger, challenging the validity of American optimism. By using the metaphor of dreams, he explores the conflict between the ideal of Hollywood as a dream machine, and the corrosive realities of life. Dreams can be beautiful and turn terrifying. Dreams always express a wish, often reversing facts of the waking world. More importantly, as Freud insisted, the dream is the dreamer. Hollywood creates the dreams of our culture, projecting the sex and violence of our collective Id. Id is very much the springboard for David Lynch. For most of the entire film, MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a dream being dreamt by a young aspiring actress named Betty. This is not explicit, though in typical fashion Lynch has put it subtly in front of us: in the opening scene the camera plays on a pillow and we hear the sound of a person sleeping out of range. In a subsequent scene Betty says, ""This is the place of dreams."" Then the camera follows a limousine traveling at night on Mulholland Drive. It soon becomes a hearse of sorts, and that subliminal impression, once planted, remains. Throughout the film/Betty's dream, the characters and their actions must often be inverted to understand their interplay as continuous to the fabric of the story. By this calculus it is Betty, not Rita, who is searching for her identity, and the story of Betty's triumphant audition is her wish that she had not, in reality, failed. When Adam, the director, meets her eyes and seems to fall in love with her, we should suspect the truth is his indifference. When Rita begins to sense that she is responsible for a murder, Freud's delineation of dreamwork points to Betty. In dreams, manifest content masks latent meaning; there are layers and layers. Dreams are constructed from images of waking life: we later discover the sources of Betty's dream material: the dark angular man in the diner, the waitress's name tag, a blue key, are reproduced in Betty's dream with a significance they did not have when she casually encountered them. But we don't know that to begin with. We do know that walls, doors, windows, boxes, and bed are the symbols of Betty's entrapment, culminating in a vision of Silencio, the place of truth and ""crying"" where Death is the keeper of dreams. Cartoon gangsters shorn of their menace through slapstick, should be viewed with foreboding, for everything is its opposite. Here too, the Cowboy's mythic strength is denatured, stripped of his status as icon; he is not a benign protector, rather he seems more a genderless demon who awakens Betty/Diane to what we shortly learn is Diane's horrible reality. The lesbian affair between Betty and Rita is in fact a destructive union riven with ungovernable passions. In one of the last scenes Diane masturbates furiously, missing her orgasm repeatedly as a final frustration before the barrier to guilt gives way and parental homunculi creep under the doorway, exploding into the room as an Id-fueled horror of accusation. Proust wrote that there is no access to something original because, by virtue of its originality, it defies analysis, it can only stand apart with a life of its own as a reference to subsequent works that may evolve under its influence. ""In short, this art which is so complicated is in fact the only living art. It alone expresses for others and renders visible to ourselves that life of ours that cannot effectually observe itself and of which the observable manifestations need to be translated and, often, to be read backwards and laboriously deciphered."" David Lynch is such an artist, and MULHOLLAND DRIVE is such a film. Any attempt to force his meaning will fail; he will not be understood too quickly, and perhaps never in the same way by different viewers. To paraphrase T.S. Eliot on Shakespeare, all we can hope for in time is to be wrong about him in a new way.",Mulholland Drive

It's a movie as an expressive substation between the real world and the dream.",10,22 December 2005,"I highly agree with this comment and it helped me interpreting the movie much more better. But I really liked to expend the comment by sharing my ideas in a more constructive base. Since I have been watching the films of David lynch, I've become interested in the construction of narratives. Like in Lost Highway (which has been criticized to be to disturbed and chaotic) the director wants to make a film where we can forget the Conservative Hollywood-story lines. To really enjoy a film as an aesthetic expressing we need to watch these movies with a more abstract perspective (why do a lot of Picasso's paintings become so famous?; most books write about the participative in the discussions of ""what is the real?"" and ""How does art react on it?"")As David lynch has been arguing: we need to see his film in a way we can watch a Picasso painting, were perspectives and context change. Also his films are constructed with a collection of paintings (24 or more per second) and in between there are abstract connections. When we let part of the importance of narrative go, and watch his movies more on a artistic way, we could understand his participation in the film art-discussion. There is no band, It's all on tape, it's just a movie, a dream in which we can participate and escape. It's a movie as an expressive substation between the real world and the dream. It is the link between the concrete things and objects with their arbitrary meanings, and the possibility of complete abstract feelings and psychological ideas.When we dream, we mix all the persons we know. These person do other thing. We see them from other perspectives and other contexts.Where a lot of criticism on Vertov's film ""the man with the movie camera"" is based on the discussion of the myth of photographic reality, and the function of film. We like to ignore the idea that this film could also be an expression on the October revolution during the upcoming communism, where women been asked to ""stand up"" and participate in the social- and working practices. It the reversed way of looking at Lynch's movies and hold on to the demand for comprehensible normal structured narrative and ignore the contribution to the discussion on film art in the wide world artistic forum of movie makers and criticism.",Mulholland Drive

To be fair, it actually starts out with some interesting aspects, but nothing ever plays out to anything in the end making the movie a concoction of several random events, several of which don't even fit in with any explanation fans of this movie will try to provide.The movie doesn't even present a valid event on the part of director David Lynch. Lynch has used the same plot twist/technique in this movie that he's used at least two or three times in the past. ""Lost Highway"" is a prime example of a past Lynch movie that has used this technique. This is what seems to pass for creativity today: recycling past ideas and calling it something new. I wouldn't complain AS much if the movie actually made any coherent sense in the end. But one of the major problems of this movie is that it doesn't. Fans will try to claim that the movie does make sense, but it is not understandable without the help of online explanations. Even with these explanations, the explanation still isn't clear and discernible from the movie itself.This movie would not receive nearly the following that it does if it were not made by David Lynch. Because Lynch has gotten away with this type of thing in the past, he's allowed to get away with it again. Lynch appears to be above the law as far as movie making goes. If any other director had attempted to make this movie, they wouldn't get away with it. If it were any director's debut movie, the director would likely be shunned and never direct again.This movie is officially on the number one spot of the worst movies I have ever seen.

The dream (shown without clarification) suddenly ends. With the ending of the dream, the audience is shown the real life of the main character, which is much worse than the dream (which also shows the main character's need for daydreaming-dreaming).

1557,jhelmbold,L.A. at Night - A submersion into dark desperation and hopeless solitude,10,19 February 2006,"Mulholland Drive is one of the top films created in the last 10 years, and it makes my top-10 list of all-time.Now, this is not what I would call a great movie - but rather, this is a fantastic film - and give me a great film over a great movie any day of the week. Great movies make you feel something while you are inside the theater, but great films go home with you and consume your soul for months and years to come. Great films are also: well written, offer thorough character development, well-acted, smartly shot, and treat their audiences in an intelligent manner. There is nothing worse than seeing a movie and / or film which insults the audience's intelligence.Now, let's make this simple -(Mulholland Drive ""simple""? yeah right....)Here's what I love about the film: Naomi Watts is both effortless and flawless in her delivery - what an actress.....; Robert Forster's role (Detective McKnight)- albeit limited, was so very well-timed and properly placed within the film; Lynch's spicy color schemes are as simultaneously vibrant, disturbing, stunning, bizarre, uneasy and awkward which is a direct reflection of his characters. And the soundtrack? - oh me oh my..... the soundtrack.....it's as chilling and dark as my hallway at 3:00 am.Laura Harring is a rare and precious gem constantly reminding us of the great Rita Hayworth and her all-encompassing and extraordinary embodiment of beauty; Justin Theroux accomplishes so much in his role that I wouldn't know where to begin; and just the idea of casting Ann Miller (Louise Bonner) for her role as ""Coco"" brings those words ""Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer"" back to life for the audience - as well as a longing for a resurgence of the great movie musical.I fall in love with L.A. (especially L.A. at night) all over again every time I view this film. When I think of L.A. I think of all the people and things I have lost in my life. But I also think about what could possibly happen 5 minutes from now and how my life could change entirely. Then I begin to look around and think of all that garbage and evil such as despair, loneliness, cruelty, greed, lust, crime and poverty. But, maybe this sick cycle simply feeds my love for L.A. There is a haunting beauty that is associated with all of these elements; perhaps it is the idea that although we are constantly reminded of the evil in the world, there is always hope - hope that, one day, things will right themselves, and for each of us - our dreams of the perfect life and the perfect world will be realized.David Lynch has always been a favorite of mine as far as Directors go, and Mulholland Drive is just another disturbing, but ravishing piece of work generated from the mind of this genius. Mulholland Drive is an extremely abstract film that is wide-open for individual interpretation - and, for myself and for fans of this film, that truly is the fun part. If you choose to show this film to friends or family, choose your audience wisely. Invite your film lovers to your next showing, but lock the door if the ""movie-lovers"" want to join-in. Still, no matter who your audience is, expect some frustration, tons of questions, and confusion beyond belief. But, most of all, while Mulholland Drive is showing, expect a great deal of silence (silencio).Thanks for reading - and enjoy!",Mulholland Drive
1558,jamsodonnellsor,Don't bother,3,22 April 2021,Self important drivel. When I watched it I thought it was like Twin Peaks. Didnt know it was David Lynch. So dated. Was an interesting story but soon petered out with very confused forced 'surrealist' last half hour or so. Dont bother.,Mulholland Drive
1559,xxxxxx-61086,Love it,10,8 November 2018,I loved it so much. It's not only a thriller movie but also an invitation to the realm of psychology. It aroused my interest in learning more about psychology.,Mulholland Drive
1560,pasciutoale,"Approximate, superficial and improvised",1,4 January 2019,"Among the worst movie ever seen: the plot is frequently interrupted and changes direction, peculiar situations aren't clarified. And this is not the result of a project, but just the result of approximation and improvvisation. Things belonging to a scene are no more there (and no one care of this), the blue key changes its shape from one scene to the next one (and no one care of this), camera operators are seen reflected in mirrors and other facts like these. The Director can't hid himself behind his fame justifying every mistake with this fact: the film is superficial and improvised and the public certified this fact by not attending the cinemas stating the movie as a real flop.",Mulholland Drive
1561,r-soyack,Should be rated FTD.,1,4 September 2021,For The Director (FTD) should be this movies rating. It is a self indulgent movie and should have an audience warning!,Mulholland Drive
1562,billiesuave,"That Silencio Scene, Oh!",10,3 May 2006,"The Silencio scene is a microcosm for the more general force of the movie, its dream-like quality, dream in the double sense, the one sense being as opposed to wakefulness and the other sense being as a deep wish, fantasy, or longing------------that beautiful song being artificial, and then just the virtuosic job of presenting the dream-like quality, the fact that certain actors were cast to look like Naomi Watts, and how iconic some of the characters and places are, as far as characters go I will refer you especially to Mimi I think her name is, the women that manages the apartment complex Naomi is living in. And then the end, that last shot with the faces of the two women staggered and the music and Naomi smiling, glowing, that incandescent smile.",Mulholland Drive
