0,claudio_carvalho,Brutal and Disturbing Story of Insanity with a Deceptive Open End,6,26 July 2011,"The teenager Lucie Jurin (Mylène Jampanoï) escapes from the industrial site Chamfors brutally, but not sexually, abused. The disturbed Lucie is sent to a school for abused children and she becomes the best friend of the girl Anna Assaoui (Morjana Alaoui)that protects her. Fifteen years later, the deranged Lucie comes with a shotgun to the house of the Belfond family and executes Gabrielle, her husband and the siblings Marie (Juliette Gosselin) and Antoine (Xavier Dolan-Tadros). Then she calls Anna and tells her that the Belfond were the responsible for her suffering. Anna drives to the address and finds the family murdered. Lucie is frequently wounded by a creature, actually a dead girl, who haunts her. Anna buries the bodies of the family to leave the place with Lucie but out of the blue, Lucie cuts her own neck and dies. Anna snoops the house and finds an underground facility with a tortured teenager. Sooner she learns that the place is the base of an organization led by Mademoiselle (Catherine Bégin) that researches the afterlife martyring young girls.""Martyrs"" is a brutal and disturbing story of insanity with a deceptive open end. The French horror cinema is among the most brutal in the present days, and ""Martyrs"" is certainly one of the most violent and gruesome horror films ever made.Unfortunately the inconclusive conclusion has many discussions in IMDb Board but none of them provides a satisfactory explanation to the ending. Therefore, the director Pascal Laugier has failed in his film since it the viewers are unable to understand it. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Martyrs
1,nogodnomasters,So easy to create a victim,6,15 January 2018,"Lucie and Anna grew up together in a shelter form abused kids. Lucie had undergone and ordeal and is not crazy and she sees demons. Years later, she still sees demons and is out for revenge.I wanted to turn the film off in the first 10 minutes. I didn't really like the overall plot, I thought it was a bit silly. What makes this film stand out from other slashers is the realism. You can almost feel the pain inflicted on the victim.Give me fake blood and gore with girls who take showers.",Martyrs
2,kosmasp,More than you might imagine,8,30 November 2008,"Going into this movie, which was (and still is) called many things, I wasn't sure what to expect. By choice! I refuse to read many things about the movies I watch, which also is apparent by my comments on the movies themselves.So going into the movie, I was kinda afraid what would come. They made a big deal about the past of a girl that is found at the beginning of the movie. So I was constantly on the edge of my seat, expecting a flashback with gruesome stuff ... Let's just say, I was in for a surprise.Especially because the movie itself (despite all the violence), has a philosophical touch to it. I can't put my finger on it, but you can't compare it to ""Inside"" or ""Frontiers"" (one being a fun slasher, the other a bizarre slasher that is kinda funny, but both without anything to say really).There are a few things that I didn't like (one concerning one of the main characters), but that didn't affect my overall feeling for this movie. It's not fun to watch, but it might get you thinking about a few things ...",Martyrs
3,BA_Harrison,A powerful shocker.,9,21 May 2009,"It's a rare horror film that lingers in my mind for days after viewing, gnawing at my subconscious, but Martyrs, from French director Pascal Laugier, achieves just that thanks to its continuously evolving storyline and sheer, unrelenting brutality that is guaranteed to disturb.A shocker form the word go, Martyrs opens as a young girl, Lucie, escapes from a dilapidated building where she has been held captive and subjected to torture by persons unknown. Fifteen years later, a now fully grown but mentally disturbed Lucie (the lovely Mylène Jampanoï) eventually manages to track down those responsible for her abuse and, accompanied by best friend Anna (Morjana Alaoui), proceeds to exact revenge.Justice is swift, with a shotgun toting Lucie coldly despatching her targets (and their innocent children for good measure), but even though Lucie's nightmare seems as though it is finally over, Anna's is just about to begin.Martyrs might not be perfect, with a final act that is a little too drawn out (and arguably unnecessary altogether), but there's no denying the power of this film as a whole: it's the cinematic equivalent of a flurry of punches to the gut which leaves one feeling both queasy and breathless.Laugier displays incredible control of his material, delivering tense horror and nerve shredding terror whilst also splashing bright red gore across every frame. By the closing credits, even the most bloodthirsty of gore-hounds will have had their fill of shotgun wounds, lump-hammer attacks, cutthroat razor slashing and skin removal, and although there are points at which I feel it might have been wiser to end the film, Martyrs' ultimately ambiguous ending does at least invite conjecture and debate about such lofty subjects as religion and the afterlife.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",Martyrs
4,paul_haakonsen,"Violent, brutal, yet oddly beautiful and cinematic at the same time...",6,26 July 2013,"For some reason I have had this movie in my DVD collection for well over a year, if not nearing two, and haven't gotten around to watching it before a colleague brought up the movie in a dialogue about movies.So finally getting around to watching the movie, I can understand what his excitement was about, because this movie was brutal and visual in so many aspects.Before you read on, be warned that this review contains a spoiler that will give away a great deal of the movie.Don't let the French language spook you away, because the visual treat and the mayhem you are in for in this movie far outshines any visual barriers you might have with this being a non-English movie.The story is about Lucie (played superbly by Mylène Jampanoï) who is haunted by something sinister that forces her to do unspeakable acts. And along with her is Anna (played equally well by Morjana Alaoui). The young girls end up at a bloodbath in a house, but things take a turn for the worse as the past comes knocking on the door.""Martyrs"" might not be suitable just for anyone, because the violence and the mutilation in the movie is very graphic and in your face. There is nothing here to cushion the things that happen in the movie. And that raw, graphic visualization of the events is what thrilled me. It was brutal, yet very nicely orchestrated and choreographed at the same time. There is beauty in this vile brutality.The story told in the movie is very interesting and captivating. The story reveals bits and pieces of what is really going on, right up until springing it all wide open. And it was nicely told and nicely edited. However, the movie takes a turn for a whole other direction when Anna ends up being held captive in the basement and you come to realize what is really going on in the house. Personally, I found that twist and direction of the story to be a turn for the worse, as the movie went from suspense and thrilling to something utopian and a bit too much.But all in all, then ""Martyrs"" is a great horror movie, with some amazing visual treats, albeit violent and gruesome ones, but they all worked out well to help the movie progress nicely.I would have rated the movie a 7 out of 10, were it not for the twist of storyline once the story started revolving around Anna's captivity in the basement and the reason for the events that were taking place in the house. As such, ""Martyrs"" settles in on a firm 6 out 10 rating. The movie is great entertainment.",Martyrs
5,Coventry,Experience the Pain!,10,5 May 2009,"I often wonder how much further the horror genre can and will evolve in terms of sadism and the portrayal of ultra-explicit violence. Especially the youngest generation of French directors appear to be involved in some sort of sport competition where each one aspires to surpass the other when it comes to showing sheer brutality and stomach-churning sickness. ""High Tension"", released in 2003, was quite extreme already, but since then there came ""Them"", ""Frontier(s)"" and ""Inside"" and each separate film raised the bar every time. Now, after experiencing the nearly indescribable intensity level of ""Martyrs"", I sincerely hope that no other movie will ever go beyond the standards set in this film. ""Martyrs"" genuinely is an astonishing and jaw-dropping ordeal that is guaranteed to leave even the most hardened and trained horror buffs speechless. From what I gathered reading reviews and listening to opinions left and right, I already knew this wasn't going to be picnic, but the truth is that absolutely nothing can prepare you for what you are about to see in ""Martyrs"". It may sound a little fantastic, but the infamous and supposedly nauseating torture porn titles such as ""Saw"", ""Hostel"" and ""Murder-Set-Pieces"" look like sophomoric episodes of Sesame Street in comparison with the recent stream of French shock-features and in particular with ""Martyrs"".Okay, I realize I've been going on and on about the shocking impact and extreme violence of ""Martyrs"", but still I haven't even mentioned the most remarkable and praiseworthy aspect about the entire film. The gore, barbarity and mayhem aren't at all gratuitous or exploitative but actually serve a purpose! There were other and far more mundane ""extreme"" horror movies simply showcase a long series of torture sequences, ""Martyrs"" practically causes you to experience the pain AND simultaneously raises a handful of socially engaging debates. For once, the title of a horror movie can be taken 100% literally By watching ""Martyrs"", you expose yourself to martyrdom. You voluntarily watch the film and you're free to look away or step out of the theater at any given moment, but most likely you won't because subconsciously you are in readiness to endure a whole lot of visual suffering in order to know how the movie will end. Yes, it all does sound very philosophical and pseudo-intellectual (especially for a horror movie), but honestly not a single word is exaggerated. This movie honestly is the genre landmark of a new generation The synopsis on the back of the DVD appears to give away the content of the entire film, but in fact it only covers the first ten minutes. The short summary describes how a 12-year-old girl narrowly escapes from an abandoned factory site where she was held captive and subjected to extreme torture. She ends up in a psychiatric clinic and befriends another girl who slowly helps her processing the trauma. 15 years later, the girl appears on the doorstep of a seemingly happy family of four with a shotgun in her hands and raging fury in her eyes. Lucie is convinced she found her tormentors. Apart perhaps from the domestic household element, this sounds like the plot of nearly every ""revengesploitation"" movie ever made. But these are only the opening minutes What follows next is a literally perplexing and excruciating visual nightmare that is unpredictable and even unimaginable. At first you'll wonder where writer/director Pascal Laugier can possibly be heading for with his screenplay, and then you'll probably wish you never asked. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, so let me just re-establish that you will be unprepared and stupefied. Do you dare?",Martyrs
6,hitchcockthelegend,Martyrs: Greek for Witness.,10,17 March 2014,"Martyrs is written and directed by Pascal Laugier. It stars Morjana Alaoui and Mylene Jampanoi.The New French Extremity Movement had its bar raised considerably by Pascal Laugier's brutal but thought provoking horror. It's a film as uncompromising as it is confrontational, a picture guaranteed to get a response for better or worse. Once viewed it simply will not be forgotten, the images, the twisty narrative thematics and the bloodshed that flows consistently throughout the story, Laugier and his two brilliant lead actresses assault the senses, magnificently so.Story is unfurled as a three tiered structure, each one devastating, but it's with the final third where the picture goes up through the stratosphere, stopping briefly at the café weird just to further tickle our craniums. Some of the violence here is tough to watch, and it's no surprise to find it was met with the inevitable charges of misogyny. Yet the culmination of it all puts some perspective on the violence witnessed, leading to a strangely profound and moving climax.The less you know about it going in for the first time the better. A strong stomach is required, as is an open mind, if you have these things then awaiting you is a visceral masterwork, one of the finest horror film's to have ever come out of France. Yes, it's that astonishing. 10/10",Martyrs
7,Theo Robertson,The Cult Of The Pretentious,2,19 February 2014,"Suggestive Spoilers It'd be all too easy to say that once you've seen one torture porn movie you've seen them all . While THE PASSION OF THE Christ made a lot of money other ones did not . A film like WOLF CREEK is genuinely disturbing not because of what we see but down to the cast acting with absolute conviction . Compared to that Aussie horror movie something like HOSTEL with its fake make up effects is rather campy in comparison . . The only connection between these movies apart from the violence is that they all sacrificed narrative for brutality . Feeling humiliated that the Anglo-Saxon race has outdone them in some aspect of the cinema market the French launched a massive counter attack and in the process ended up with MARTYRS which no doubt French critics would have described as an unsurpassed achievement . An unsurpassed achievement in much the same way as the Battle of Dien Bien Phu was a complete success - for the Vietnamese I'll give Pascal Laugier some credit and say this is possibly the most violent film I have ever seen in my life . It's amazing to think that when I was a teenager several dozen films were banned and yet I saw MARTYRS on a satellite channel . This doesn't so much push the boat out where violence is concerned but more accurately launches a fleet of battleships with all guns blazing . Soon however you very quickly stop following the plot because there is no plot and just seems to be one long sequence of mutilations , maimings and murders There has to be a reason why this is taking place and so in the final third of the film Laugier doesn't give us a clever plot turn but gives us a massive info dump . Something about an existentialist cult of some such which is never adequately explained . They harp on about religion having martyrs but now they want to own martyrs of their own . . Right so they want to prove God is dead so anything is permitted ? Hmmm . Interesting thought but not one that is followed through in any logical manner especially when it's heavily suggested in the end that that this cult do believe in an after life . I think I might have to brush up on some Dostoyevsky , Nietzsche and Sartre but I'm fairly certain existentialists don't believe in an afterlife so Laugier might have thrown a massive spanner in the works . He also throws another one when a character mentions the phone is off the hook . Right so the anti-heroine had access to a phone and could have called the police if she bothered to think instead of getting involved all sorts of violent depravity ? She could have also walked out of the location at any time when you stop to think about it , but if she had then there wouldn't have been much of a film . That said there's not much of a film here anyway unless you're interested in gore and graphic violence",Martyrs
8,Scarecrow-88,Martyrs,5,1 May 2009,"I'm pretty sure a film like MARTYRS is sure to polarize a large majority who finds the actions of this secret society desiring to know without doubt that there's an afterlife to an extent that a chosen victim will serve as a martyr to prove so, rather appalling and disturbing. I have read many find the ending(..what the martyr ""sees"" and the actions of the mastermind behind the project who is told ""the answer"" so sought after)rather disappointing, certainly there's a negative vibe I have derived from what ultimately transpires, but I found it so sick and daring that all I could do was laugh. Quite an odd reaction after watching some poor girl tortured for 30 long minutes, just so that elderly wealthy types could learn of the truth behind what lies ""on the other side"", but I just couldn't help but bury my face in my hands and laugh. The film is just brutal almost from start to finish without little time to breathe or sigh, just violence heaped upon violence. Director Pascal Laugier(House of Voices)establishes right from the get-go that the film would feature victims abused, and the results of such horrors.Mylène Jampanoï, in an astonishing, heartbreaking performance is Lucie, a young woman who massacres an entire family with a shot gun. At first, you believe she's bonkers, but we soon realize that the parents killed weren't whom they appear..far, far worse. But, Lucie hallucinates, believing that a mistreated victim she didn't rescue as a child after escaping from a place of torture is always coming for her. Along with Lucie is her friend from an orphanage, Anna(Morjana Alaoui, also delivered a terrific, haunting performance)who witnesses the aftermath of the slaughter, attempting to clean up the mess, while mortified at such a grisly crime scene. Later, though, after Lucie makes a tragic decision due to a complete psychological breakdown, Anna discovers a secret area hidden, containing a torture chamber with a chained and badly ravaged victim, bound by shackles, her eyes covered by a steel plate hammered into her skull! Anna removes the poor woman from the prison. attempting to help her. But, the woman finds a large knife, tearing away at her wrist until shot through the forehead. This is when Anna meets those responsible for what has traumatized her friend Lucie. An organization, ran by a woman referred to as Mademoiselle(Catherine Bégin), wishes to uncover the age-old mystery desired down through the ages by those with religious doubt..is there an afterlife and is there a way at discovering such a truth. Using an unwilling participant as their martyr, Anna could be their link to the truth. So she's brutalized for the remainder of the movie, nearly practically dead when she does experience something(..we are led to believe)..could she provide an answer they so desperately covet? I warn those who take the leap and rent this film because it's incredibly violent. Lucie blows crater-sized holes into the bodies of an entire family obviously leaving you breathless before the thing she sees even enters the picture. That created being is scary as hell and you can understand why poor Lucie is so tormented. Then, you are shown a horrifying discovery and witness a person whose been kept in the dark, her skin cut throughout the body, knees practically broken, little sanity left remaining. Then, after all that, you have to sit through what these cretins do to Anna. Each chapter goes one step further. The one who got away. The one almost dead. And, Anna, the one they may finally have to provide the answer they seek. This is NOT for the faint of heart. What ultimately happens to Anna left me rather unnerved, I must admit, and the experience we witness through ""her eyes"" couldn't impact me because I was so shaken by the damage she had suffered. I can't say I was entertained by this one, and, truth be told, I felt very little after it was over. To be honest, I was glad once it was over because I just grew tired of seeing Anna pummeled and left to rot before the final despicable act was completed towards her person.",Martyrs
9,poolandrews,Relentless & brutal FRench horror that will stay with you.,7,4 September 2011,"Martyrs starts as an abused girl named Lucie is taken into an orphanage in France where she befriends another girl named Anna despite the horrors that she has suffered throughout her short life. Jump forward 'Fifteen Years Later' & in a secluded house the French countryside a family are enjoying breakfast when they hear a knock at the door, the father (Robert Toupin) answers & is faced with Lucie (Mylène Jampanoï) who promptly shoots him with a shotgun & then continues the slaughter the rest of the family before calling her friend Anna (Morjana Alaoui) & claiming that the family were the ones who tortured her when she was a young girl all those years ago. Anna drives to the house & finds Lucie & the bodies & decides to try to help her friend but there appears to be someone else in the house, a dirty naked woman who attacks Lucie & while Anna didn't believe Lucie at first the horrors that she discovers there soon change her mind as she becomes the next victim & a sick & sadistic greater plan...This French & Canadian co-production was written & directed by Pascal Laugier & while there's been a recent spate of French horror that has been well received with the likes of High Tension (2003), Them (2006) & Frontier(s) (2007) although personally I am not a huge fan of any of them so wasn't expecting a great deal from Martyrs but I have to say it's definitely both the best French horror film I've seen & one of the best films I've seen in a while. The script is as relentless & brutal as anything I have seen in recently with one nasty endurance testing sequence after another all knitted together with a truly compelling & to me fascinating script that throws in twist after twist as the story goes in all sorts of different directions, the opening twenty minutes is fantastic with a seemingly normal family blown away by Lucie in a real attention grabbing scene before the twists & turns kick in with hallucinations, filthy tortured chained up women & secret evil organisations. Martyrs takes itself extremely seriously & there's no let up in the grimness or brutality of the events happening, forget about any humour or uplifting sentiment or feel good moments because there aren't any. There's a real relentless ferocity to Martyrs, all the violence & gore is extreme with some really unpleasant moments to cherish along with the plot that really does move along like a rocket with constant twists & turns that take you deeper into the torture & sadism on show. Everything that happens has meaning & a purpose I suppose but having said that the twenty odd minute, almost silent torture of Anna at the end maybe lasts a little too long but it certainly has impact & leaves an impression before yet another nasty sequence in which Anna is skinned while still alive. Martyrs is not for the squeamish or faint of heart, it's a tough watch & not all the answers are spoon fed to the audience (we never find out who are behind all this or who they work for & the purpose of the Martyr experiments are rather vague) but if your prepared for an intense 90 minutes of brutal horror & torture that features a clever & original script then Martyrs is highly recommended.Dealing with the issues of faith & suffering & psychological torture the final revelation & twist is a little unsatisfying, did that woman really accept the dying words of a badly tortured & skinned person as fact? I wouldn't want to put so much faith in her dying testimony as to kill myself, you know what I mean? Anyway, Martyrs is still a pretty powerful film with some nasty imagery, some surprising twists & a film most people won't forget in a hurry. As mentioned Martyrs doesn't disappoint when it comes to the gore, available in both 'R' rated & 'Unrated' versions in the US I am basing my review on the Unrated cut. There's plenty of blood splatter, nasty slit throats, pins being pulled out of skin, someone slicing the skin of their own arm, someone slicing their arms with a straight razor, various brutalized torture victims covered in bruises & scars, someone is seen skinned in a very icky scene, people are gorily shot & sliced open & stabbed in one of the goriest & brutal films I've seen in quite a while.Apparently filmed in Québec in Canada this is well made & looks very slick, I am not sure about the James Bond style underground lair but I suppose it could happen. I am not sure who produced the subtitles but on the version I saw there were some really bad spelling & grammatical errors, couldn't they have been checked by someone with a decent grasp of the English language? The acting is good from the cast some of whom were really put through it.Martyrs is one of the best films I've seen in a while, it's relentlessly brutal & goes against expectation with some strange twists in a ferocious script that has no mercy for it's character's or it's audience. Don't be put off by the subtitles, find the uncut version & watch it now for an unforgettable experience. A Hollywood remake is listed on the IMDb as currently being in production but I can't see it being anywhere near as good as this, the original.",Martyrs
10,dbborroughs,"A brutal meditation on revenge and other things, this a more horrifying film because there is a brain behind its cruelty",10,18 May 2009,"A young girl escapes from someone who was abusing her. While in the hospital she meets a girl who will become her friend. Years later the two girls track down the people responsible for the abuse and well that's the movie. What starts off as a simple revenge tale quickly becomes something else, something different, something more disturbing.I had heard a good number of stories about how twisted, horrible and horrifying this French film was. I was prepared for something that fell into the category of torture porn but I wasn't prepared for what I actually got (This lived up to its billing where say the equally praised High Tension did not). This is a slowly building tale that is unnerving from the get go and only gets worse. It starts of as one thing then changes and changes again. It then plays out each new twist for as far as it can go before changing again. It's a pattern that's repeated several times over the course of the film. It keeps you on your toes and makes it impossible to steel yourself for the next thing.What makes Martyrs difficult to dismiss as just another torture porn film, and trust me this is as close to one as one can get, is that the film has more on its mind than just torture. This is not just the cruelty of Saw or Hostel or any of the other films that is essentially a mad man carving some one up (Laid to Rest anyone?) there is a weird rationale to it. (You may argue that I'm splitting hairs, but trust me I've seen enough to know what is what and where to draw the line between frivolous violence and violence for the plot.) I really want to say more, I'd love to discuss this film in greater detail but to do so might take the edge off the film. Not knowing where its going is what makes the film so powerful. Having your expectations confounded and destroyed is what disturbs the hell out of you. We in the audience are left shaking and stunned and wondering what the hell we saw.The film works because of how its filmed. The cinematography is polished. As are the locations these are not run down depraved places.The story construction is clever. It's a series of ever expanding boxes that take us as far as we can go with out things collapsing on themselves.The performances are real. These are real people. They are not just figures behaving according to movie laws rather they are behaving in ways that people might (Certainly the blind rage that fuels the revenge is palpable). The behavior for all of its cruelty is understandable. We have the girl who wants revenge and was pushed to the point of animistic violence. And the people who are looking for answers are the sort of academic Nimrods who don't think and don't feel that scientific niceties apply to them (Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan anyone?). I'm not condoning the violence I'm just explaining it in context that it does work. Strangely other than the gashes and the final bit of nastiness much of the gore is fleeting with the level of blood relatively low. Its our minds that inflict the pain and suffering way beyond the levels of what we see.I'm almost 24 hour on and I can't shake the film. It's frightening and disturbing. More so in that the film actually seems to be about something. Its not some nut job running about like Texas Chainsaw or Friday the 13th or Halloween. There is something there. I really do feel that way. I don't think the film would be as disturbing as it is if it was just a shape killing cattle. There is some kernel of truth in there that will not let me let the film go, nor will it let me even consider dismissing the film.Certainly I can't dismiss this any more than I could the work of Gaspar Noe, whose films like Irreversible or I Stand Alone are equally brutal, but less fantastical. I don't know what the director might think of my take on the film, he seems to want to distance himself from the film, nor do I know if he meant anything beyond a calling card or horror film, but even if he didn't I think he's fashioned a film that does have something more than violence and uncomfortableness. I do think this film has a reason to exist beyond the profit motive.You will probably be repulsed by the film. I am on many levels and yet at the same time I'm fascinated by it. This is a film that is a trip on the dark side that is more than just torture porn. It is not just a catalog of pain and suffering. There is a twisted reasoning behind it (and in a weird way a historical precedent which makes it even more bothersome). Speaking in a video introduction the director admits to not being comfortable for having made the film and invites the audience to hate him for doing it. I'm not comfortable admiring the film.Not for the squeamish, this is a head trip for those who think they can take it. I thought I could and yet it still messed me up. (Most amazingly one of the final images, one of the least graphic, is one of the things that disturbed me the most.) A bloody, blood soaked masterpiece only for those who want to stare into the abyss. Reluctantly it maybe one of the best films I've seen this year.",Martyrs

A twisty turn tumble down the rabbit hole of torture porn in this disturbing and visceral tale of two young women attempting vengeance against years of torment ends up a tables turn into a grim, and bleak change of events.

12,view_and_review,The Depravity of People,7,30 October 2021,"Freaky, depraved, grotesque. That's just a few words I'd use to describe this movie. I'll also say that I couldn't tear my eyes away.A young girl named Lucie was kidnapped and abused for a period of time before she escaped. She was housed in an orphanage where she befriended a girl named Anna. 15 years later Lucie (Mylene Jampanoi) went to a seemingly normal home and killed everyone there. What we would eventually find out is that that was no ordinary home. It was a house of sadistic depravity.I'd be lying if I said I was pleased with the ending of this movie, but the movie as a whole kept you hooked if only to see what the ending would be. I doubt I could ever watch this movie a second time. One time was enough.",Martyrs
13,The_Void,Some good ideas; but unfortunately not carried off well,6,6 April 2009,"Martyrs is the latest in a long line of gory French horror films that have included the likes of Switchblade Romance, Sheitan and Inside. Martyrs certainly aims high and tries its best at getting there; but unfortunately the film fails in spite of the heavy gore and several attempts to shock the viewer. The central theme is retribution and the film goes about this in the most violent way possible. I really have no problem with this in theory; but unlike the violence in, say, Inside; the violence here constantly feels like it's over the top just for sake of cashing in on the new French wave of horror. The plot focuses on Lucie; a woman who, as a child, disappeared for over a year and was later found traumatised and with numerous injuries. Over time, Lucie began to recover and formed a strong bond with a girl named Anna during her rehabilitation; although she is still haunted by a strange female figure. Fifteen years later, Lucie has resolved to get revenge on her abusers; and sets out with Anna to do just that...The film feels very cold throughout and this extends to the characters; ensuring that the audience has no real reason to care for any of them; which is not good when you consider that the plight of the characters is often the main focus of the film. It's obvious that director Pascal Laugier wanted the film to make an impact; and the violence is carried off with a pumping pace from almost the word go. However, a lot of it is done with flashy photography and quick edits, which lessens the effect; as well as the fact that many things (such as the idea of the lead's tormentor) are just thrown in there, seemingly at random. Martyrs really is a film of two halves; and the two are joined together by a twist halfway through the film. This is intriguing at first and left me wanting to find out where the film would go...but unfortunately the film soon sinks back into the cold atmosphere that carried it up to the twist, and I found it hard to care about anything that happened in the second half of the film. Which is a shame really as the twist is actually quite inventive and original. Overall, I have to say that I'm highly disappointed by this effort; especially considering the great horror films to come out of France in the last few years.",Martyrs
14,zetes,"The first 2/3 are a masterpiece, the final third is junk",7,17 May 2009,"A huge disappointment, not because I was expecting one of the best movies ever or anything, but because the first two-thirds of it promise that. At least in the horror genre, I've almost never been more frightened. Definitely the kind of film you watch between your fingers. The story involves two 20-something girls, one of whom, Lucie (Mylène Jampanoï) was kidnapped and tortured when she was a child. Now she believes she has found her torturers and plans her revenge. Anna (Morjana Alaoui) goes along with it because she is secretly in love with her friend, but she's not quite sure Lucie is entirely sane. This movie creates a tense situation, and then solves it surprisingly quick. It seems like the story's ending, but then there's a shocking twist. This happens two or three times during the movie, and it keeps upping its game. That is, unfortunately, until it reaches its final twist. It's slightly ridiculous, and wholly pretentious. The worst thing is that the tension is gone at this point. It turns from a cracking horror film to cheap torture porn. Hell, even for that nasty sub-genre, it's extremely unimaginative. The torture consists of a very large man punching the victim over and over again. The pretension comes when the film thinks it's saying something. It never really does. I think Laugier might consider this the 2001: A Space Odyssey of torture porn. It's so depressing, considering just how damn good it was earlier. I was absolutely sure this was worthy of my top 10 list at the end of the year. Still worth watching for that first 2/3. Not for the faint of heart, though.",Martyrs
15,trashgang,atrocity galore,8,2 April 2009,"Freaks, creeps and geeks out out there. This is for me one of the best horrors in years. It has so much to offer. There was a time when France only delivered cheese, wine and Jean Paul Belmondo or other crap. Movies coming from that country were always boring. But sometimes there was one film that people were talking about, first came Baise Moi. Not a real horror but a kind of Natural Born Killers but more exploitation. Years went by and then came Haute Tension, a real gory slasher in a more explicit way. Then came Irreversible with the sickening rape scene and the fire-extinguisher. Then France was beaten by the Hollywoodflicks Saw and Hostel, a new era, the torture porn. Everybody was talking what would come next out of France, could they do better, yes they could, suddenly there was Frontiere(s). Banned in the states at Horrorfest, can you believe it? I thought that they couldn't make it worser, it was a bit of torture porn. Soon after the word Martyr felt, Well, this is surely not for the squeamish, it got all elements in it, it starts of as a nice movie, first you see a child running covered in blood, okay, seen it before. And then we watch a happy family, nothing wrong, Sunday morning breakfast, fun and a laugh, until the doorbell rings. What we got then is 90 minutes of explicit gore, changing from revenge to humiliation to enigma's to chimera to sudden plots unexpected. And the only question is, is there live after death. But I can tell you, you have to watch the hardest film I ever seen until today and I've seen a lot, the performances are great, the children unbelievable acting. Lucie and Anna, two names you will never forget. The effects are extremely realistic, and if you couldn't stand the fire-extinguisher in Irreversible well don't watch the hammer scene. Even the score in the last part of this gem gives you the creeps. Shivers ran through my spine, 'cause here in Belgium and last in another country it happened in some certain way. This one sure makes Saw and Hostel a big comedy. Watch it if you dare, and again, not for the weak at heart. A masterpiece.",Martyrs
16,HumanoidOfFlesh,Martyrdom through extreme suffering.,10,26 April 2009,"""Martyrs"" has to be one of the most brutal and mind-shattering horror films I have ever seen.It is awashed with extreme cruelty,human suffering and despair.Lucie is found running half-naked down a country road after having been missing for over a year.During this time she had been held captive and subjected to mental and physical torture before she was able to make her escape.She was imprisoned in the abandoned slaughterhouse,but the building had been evacuated and her abusers were never apprehended.Lucie is placed in an orphanage where she eventually forms a bond with another young girl named Anna,who resides there.The first half deals mostly with Lucie,Anna and the events that lead up to finding the people Lucie feels are her past abusers.The film pulls no punches when it comes to delivering extreme violence and cruelty.It leaves the lasting impression on the viewer when it's over.The acting by both young ladies is exceptional and their bond is believable.Pascal Laugier seems to seek the meaning in the human pain through repetitive acts of violence and transgression.Despite being vile and misanthropic there is philosophical meaning in all this suffering galore.""Martyrs"" is the film that makes the viewer uncomfortable and I applaud it for that.An opus magnum of extreme horror.10 out of 10.",Martyrs
17,christopher-underwood,we enter a world we are really not happy about viewing at all.,9,10 February 2010,"There is no denying that this is a difficult film to watch. If you fancy a night in with the lads and a six pack, this is most certainly not the film to watch. A very powerful and uncompromising film in two parts and an epilogue. At first the tale is a bloody and violent romp, which remains uncomfortable because of the evident appalling abuse in the background, although while this appears simply a revenge movie, it is watchable. In the second phase we enter a world we are really not happy about viewing at all. The violence becomes brutal, seemingly without purpose and sickeningly repetitive and unrelenting. just watching the lower half of a tormentor retreating with such a swagger after inflicting such violence is truly awful to behold. It is, however, worth staying with this one for the final section and the subtle but devastating attack upon all religions to some extent but the Catholic church in particular. For those not bound to any strict religious belief, the ending is uplifting and to others, well maybe some food for thought. Quite devastating.",Martyrs
18,Smells_Like_Cheese,"One of the best horror movies a fan could ask for, Martyrs is a true masterpiece that I can't get out of my head",10,2 June 2012,"I've seen a lot of horror movies, one's that are real, one's that are supernatural. Old, new, gory, intelligent, but usually you can't get that mix in a horror film and have it come out as a masterpiece. Martyrs broke the mold and took all my doubts away. No film since The Exorcist and Jaws has had such intelligence, style, great script, relatable characters and shock value that had all that and worked. We've had a few that come close but nothing as to what I just witnessed with Martyrs. I heard a little bit about this film in 2010 and read about it in an article. The plot seemed kind of confusing from the way the author wrote about it, so I decided to wait on seeing it. I have never been so disappointed with myself when it came to deciding to wait on a film. I saw this film 4 days ago and still, I'm shaking and can't get it out of my head. Not to say that everyone will have this experience, but Martyrs is a masterpiece of horror cinema that I've been waiting for.A young girl, Lucie, escapes from a factory where she has been imprisoned and physically abused for a lengthy period of time. Lucie is placed in an orphanage, where she is befriended by a young girl named Anna. Anna soon discovers that Lucie believes that she is constantly being terrorized by a ghoulish creature; a horrible, disfigured, emaciated woman. Fifteen years later, Lucie bursts into a seemingly normal family's home and kills them all with a shotgun. Lucie calls Anna to tell her that she has finally found and killed the people responsible for her childhood abuse. Upon arriving, Anna is horrified at the carnage, and worries that Lucie may have murdered the wrong people. But after a vicious attack on Lucie from her ""ghost"", who turns out was a victim who she left before she escaped the factory when she was a child, Anna finds out that maybe Lucie wasn't wrong and things take a turn from worse to the ultimate Hell.When the films Saw and Hostel were released, they were dubbed as ""too hard to handle"" and given the new genre of ""torture porn"", I hate that term by way. Those films are a walk in the park compared to a lot of movies that I've seen to be honest. A lot of people are categorizing Martyrs in the torture porn genre and it's ticking me off. Saw and Hostel use the gore and violence as the plot devices, Martyrs doesn't use the violence as a way to just make the audience squirm, but instead you're taken into this dark world that you don't want to ever be apart of. The performances are just magnificent, especially to Mylène Jampanoï who plays Lucie. Morjana Alaoui plays Anna and pulls in a heart wrenching performance. The direction, the lighting, the sets, the script, I couldn't find any flaws that are not nitpicking.I literally feel like I've been strangled with this film, it actually made me cry. It was so much deeper than what I was expecting. I'm about to give away the ending, so please don't read on because no one should know what is going to happen if they haven't seen this film yet. First off when Anna is tortured, it's unbearable to watch her go through this for days, she's force fed some weird unknown food that looks like gruel. Then some giant man comes in and just beats her nearly to death. When she's ""reached the final stage"", which is surprising to the people who are doing this to her, they skin her alive. She ""lets go"" and comes back and you find out that the people who did this to her and the others do this because they want to know what happens after death. So Anna dies, but comes back and tells the leader, Mademoiselle what she saw, but in a whisper so the audience can't hear. The society comes to the house excited to hear what is beyond death and when asked by a member outside Mademoiselle's locked door she simply replies ""keep doubting"" and shoots herself. Couldn't have been a more perfect ending, because what happens after death should remain a mystery as everyone has their own interpretation. Martyrs is much deeper than I expected, I underestimated this film and now it's one of the best horror movies I have ever seen in my life. As to the remake that is now supposedly in the green light now, please see this movie first, because I give a lot of remakes a chance, but this one already is looking really bad since it was bought by the producers of Twilight. Martyrs should be respected and is a true masterpiece.10/10",Martyrs
19,KineticSeoul,Gruesome and gut wrenching horror flick with torture and has mental and emotional aspects to it,6,21 February 2011,"This is a sick horror movie that is also shocking and revolting. It isn't the most revolting and sickest movie when it comes to this type of horror flicks but it's still pretty messed up stuff. The movie starts out with a girl who escaped from a place that was torturing her and she sees a vicious female monster that attacks her. The victim also has a sister and the movie takes place 15 yrs later. But the monster girl viciously attacks her to the point you wonder how she managed to survive for 15 yrs. And things start to get really shocking from there with gut wrenching scenarios. And some of the disturbing parts don't always come from pain inflicted on the victims but what is done to themselves. Although the pain inflicted on the victims is painful to watch as well though. The twist of what is going on about a hour into the movie isn't all that original but still sort of shocking to watch and isn't for audiences that has a weak stomach to violence. Just when I thought it's going to be a typical revenge flick. The shock value is pretty high in this horror flick and so I can see how some horror buffs that love violent horror flicks would like this and find it amusing. And some horror buffs that enjoy torture flicks will find this movie to be uplifting as well. Some even claim this movie is a explicit torture porn and to some degree I agree, in fact this movie reminded me of of ""Hostel"" with more mental and emotional aspects to it. The man topic in this is how just like how so many people in the past and even now are interested in death, this movie is about how far would some deluded people would go with insane efforts to find something out. So if your looking for a gut wrenching horror flick that is depressing and also sad to watch than see this movie, for others who start this movie will mostly finish it anyways though.7.2/10",Martyrs
20,bowmanblue,Most disgusting film ever (and I still watch it),8,18 April 2017,"I like to think I've pretty much seen most types of horror film throughout the course of my life, so I'll never forget the first time I sat down to watch French horror film 'Martyrs' for the first time. It starts with a young girl escaping a horrific ordeal at the hands of some unseen captors, before she's placed in care of the state. There, she befriends another girl and the two become close. However, if the first girl's torture wasn't bad enough, she's haunted by some sort of supernatural presence equally hell-bent on harming her.So, that's how it begins and my initial reaction was, 'Oh, sort of like The Grudge.' The being tormenting the girl kind of looks like every creepy dishevelled little long-haired kid from most recent Japanese horror films (think The Grudge, The Ring or Dark Water) so I was pretty underwhelmed when it came to originality. How wrong I was.I feel that I should now state as to how and why I was proved so wrong with my early expectations, however, that would pretty much take us into 'spoiler territory.' All I can really say is that all is not what it seems. This film has many moments where you think you know where it's going, only to have everything you thought you knew pulled away from you and replaced with something even more horrific. The two main girls both give excellent performances, but the character that steals the show comes into the story a little later. I won't go into too much detail about her, but she's known as only the 'Mademoiselle' and she isn't easily forgotten.I suppose if you had to label this film within the horror genre, you could loosely call it 'torture p*rn.' However, that's probably over-simplifying it a bit as that kind of branding conjures up images of the 'Hostel' franchise. 'Martyrs' is a lot worse than that simply because the whole premise is slowly revealed over the course of the film. Although, due to its graphic content, a strong stomach is advised to possess before you contemplate sitting through this, plus – as you've probably guessed – it is pretty dark, but not just dark – bleak is the word I'd use, so don't expect anything even vaguely uplifting here. I guess the target audience are people who can stomach a film like this. I suppose I must be one of them as this is the third time I've sat through this. I just find it difficult to believe that after nearly four decades of watching horror films there's still one that really does disturb me. Obviously you'll have to put up with French subtitles all the way through, but, if you do and you have a really strong stomach for nastiness, then this film really will leave a lasting impression on you. It still gives me goose-bumps just thinking about it!",Martyrs
21,CuriosityKilledShawn,No need to die for this.,6,17 March 2012,"There are few horror films that provoke such outcry and controversy these days. Even more so horrors that are remotely tasteful, or non-exploitative (The Human Centipede or A Serbian Film being the worst culprits) Martyrs completely missed my attention upon it's release. Little horrifies or offends me now, so I was hoping this movie might be memorable, though I worried it might go for a terrible twist and deliberate nihilism for the sake of being edgy. My worries were justified.The film begins in 1971 with Lucie, a distraught, panicking girl escaping from a derelict industrial area. She is put into care, where she meets Anna, a younger girl who ends up taking care of her. Flash forward 15 years to 1986 (not sure why, perhaps to get around the 'cell phone/easy solution' rule) and a rural household where mom and dad are enjoying breakfast with their two teenage children. There's lots of smile and play. Then there is a knock at the door. Dad puts down his paper and goes to answer.It's Lucie, now 26, scarred, half-mad, and she's armed with a double-barreled shotgun. She massacres everyone in the house. Anna catches up with her, but before she arrives Lucie is haunted by a demonic creature.A sense of dread, of something terrible about to be revealed, permeates every frame of the first hour of Martyrs. This 99-minute film follows a near-perfect 3-act structure. But once the second act finishes it all falls apart. Writer/Director Pascal Laugier chucks in a ludicrous explanation which has more in common with Hellraiser than something that logically follows the established story of Martyrs.It should have had a better ending, something that left no gaps in logic or plot holes. Still, it's effective for the first hour, getting maximum use out of a single location and delivering strong characters that you feel for.A curiosity, but not the shocking splatterfest I hoped it might be.",Martyrs

25,sol-,Not your average revenge thriller,7,13 July 2017,"Agreeing to help a childhood friend exact revenge on those who she suspects abused her as a child has severe consequences for a young Québécoise woman in this unusual thriller. The film has been described as everything from a horror movie to torture porn and to say too much of the plot may ruin a fresh experience, but suffice it to say that the story features a raft of plot twists and turns designed to challenge one's perceptions. The project runs a little too long with several of the gorier scenes towards the end growing repetitive (hence the 'torture porn' label), however, the way writer-director Pascal Laugier deliberately drags out the proceedings makes it all the more intriguing with exposition only delivered in very small doses before a quite startling revelation in the final ten to fifteen minutes. The film is furthermore topped off with a haunting (and deliciously ambiguous) ending, and perhaps most remarkably, the film avoids ending on a depressing note despite it refreshingly defying genre expectations with regards to revenge thrillers. Certainly, the way the film concludes is hard to imagine based on its initial stretch. By all means, 'Martyrs' is a difficult film to watch, but it brings to mind some potent notions while managing to elucidate some of the desperation that could lead to human beings doing unspeakable things to one another.",Martyrs
26,tomgillespie2002,"Trilling, scary and often disturbing film",9,15 October 2012,"By the start of the 21st century, horror cinema had exhausted the post- modernist referencing of films such as the Scream trilogy (1996 - 2000), or simply settled on a variety of remakes of the ghostly, modernist narratives from Japan (Ringu (1998) for example). After a the last decade of the 20th century, which was signified with largely bland cinema, and a political climate focused on the perpetration of sexual deviance. The financial boom of the '90's was still to be revealed as a fallacy, but this extension of capital greed would create an event that would change everything. The attack on the twin towers in New York in 2001, led to a political and media climate of fear. From this fear, the machinations of our political elite were exposed (it was also the first significant decade that unregulated Internet discussion became widespread), with the manufacture of torture on the island prison of Guantanamo Bay. The climate of fear, and the perpetration of US foreign policy on suspected terrorists would inevitably be reflected in cinema - specifically the horror genre.This trend, set by films such as Saw (2004) and particularly Eli Roth's Hostel (2005) and their sequels, the sub-genre was defined by the journalistic term ""torture porn"" (or gorenography), and was focused on physical mutilation, torment and bodily endurance. French filmmaker and screenwriter Pascal Laugier took this very conceited concept and managed to create a disturbing, and potentially politically motivated, and gender specific narrative of institutional abuse. After a prologue involving a young girl being manipulated and abused by an unidentified institution, the film portrays an appealing family breakfast, which is quickly intruded upon. A young woman, Lucie (Mylene Jampanoi), bursts into the family property gunning down the 2 point 4 unit. Once she is joined by Anna (Morjana Alaoui), the significance of the murders becomes apparent. This seemingly idyllic family unit hides a dark secret, and these two young women had escaped from their tortuous captors 15 years previously.Whilst the first part of the film focuses on the revenge of the abused girls, the film alters both thematically and changes the protagonist/spectator relationship. A trick used by Hitchcock in Psycho (1960) when the leading lady, Janet Leigh, is killed off, the audience's identity is with the unstable Lucie. Anna's apparent devotion to Lucie extends to the clean up in the slaughter house. If the first half of the film could be read as a simplistic revenge narrative, with hints of almost delusional character hysteria, then the second part, focused on Anna, forms an incredibly moving and disturbing descent into human suffering and endurance. The secrets that the house hold is tantamount to serious, institutional experimentation.Before Lucie leaves the film, she is haunted by a twisted and deformed person, the apparition of a girl who attacked her when she was young. But as the house is explored further, the extent of the experiment is revealed. Whilst the perpetrators have moved from their original location, their activities as torturers have moved with them. A basement is set up for the purposes of systematic violence. What becomes apparent is that the experiments perpetrated on young girls is formed by an elite society, looking for answers to fundamental philosophical questions about existence. It is this secretive elite that is reflective of the elitist society that rules the global masses. This society (or global institutions) pursue these transcendental answers with disregard of the masses that they torture. Anna's endurance and levels of abuse, can be transcended if strong enough, but why would we sacrifice our personal narrative to offer information to our institutions? Like the suspected terrorist held at Guantanamo, can any extracted information be effectively useful.As Hostel portrayed the ""other"" (that is the foreigner of America) as twisted, and not civilised like the predominant culture, Martyrs portrays the dominant politics of American foreign policy (and the axis of evil simplification of terrorism), as damaging and personally tragic. It is certainly the most interesting of the ""torture porn"" films that I have seen, but could easily be interpreted as incredibly misogynist. The elitist ""society"" group within the film focuses its attentions on women only - the gender whose susceptibility to the experiment is historically ""easier"", but then, the middle-eastern terrorist would be portrayed in the media as women haters. The male interpretation of their religion places the female as second class, and many of the well publicised ""suicide bombers"" were women.A damning indictment of the 21st century's fearsome political climate, but also a thrilling, scary, and often disturbing film. It offers interesting twists, and some gory asides of violence and mutilation, with breathless verisimilitude. The last twenty minutes or so shift in tone, and the audience is witness the full extent of the torture experiment. With the climactic allusions towards Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and references to Hellraiser (1987), it is more rewarding than the average gore film of its ilk. As of November 2010, an American ""remake"" was announced, but here's hoping that by the time the undoubtedly false starts in production of an English language project, will be completely abandoned. Basically, here's hoping that this torture trend will dissipate, and completely disappear. But than again, will the political and social extremities of our current political milieu be changed before the horror genre trend?www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Martyrs
27,Tweetienator,Whole Premise Dumb Beyond Belief,5,19 March 2016,"Well lots of reviews so I don't write too much about the story. Imo the best part of Martyrs is the first half but after revealing of the ""truth"" behind all the torturing this movie got in my eyes some kind of comical. I mean the whole purpose/premise of torturing someone to transcendent him... Any neurologist or doctor could tell u what will happen after someone has to endure too much physically/psychological pain/trauma, and it certainly has nothing to do with the afterlife or other dimensions or what-ever, (you get a good shot of endorphines and maybe some dissociation etc.) So watching the beatings etc. I was the whole time asking myself in the 2nd part of that movie how so many people (a cult or whatever, looked like rich old ppl afraid of death and their servants or whatever) can be so dumb to believe they could get a insight of the life after death by torturing someone. The ""solution"" of this movie really sucks. So whats left!? A good slasher in the first half with some drama, after that we see something like Mel Gibsons The Passion of Christ. If I compare the torture scenes I got to say that The Passion of Christ is far far better - it got me far more emotionally involved (the pain of the mother watching her son being whipped etc). The torture scenes of Martyrs are in the given context some kind of a miss-kick - the motivation behind it is so unbelievable that I didn't get in any kind of sense emotionally involved. What I also don't understand is why the girl didn't try to strangle one of the captors with the chains - long enough they are. So what's left!? The actors did well (ofc a minus for me is all the French emotional tantrum), the camera works also fine. Verdict: not really bad but in no way a cinematic triumph or must-see.",Martyrs
28,insomniac_rod,Extraordinary display of the misery of humanity.,10,22 May 2011,"""Martyrs"" is one of the most difficult recent Horror movies to watch. Seriously, this one makes look the so-called ""torture porn"" movies such as ""Saw"", ""Hostel"", ""Murder-Set Pieces"", etc. as a walk in the park! This is the real thing. The torture shows no mercy this time and the lead female character is submitted to brutal beatings, psychological violence, gets her skin ripped, plus she's humiliated and in consequence, she loses her mind.These kind of events are supported by an evil plot which demonstrates that society is corrupted and filled with dirty elements such as a double moral, corrupt politicians, ignorant religious freaks, and more The Direction is top level and the plot is really honest and brutal. The first 48 minutes could be considered as an orgy between ""Haute Tension"" and ""Black Swan"".The gore is also beautiful. Nasty gunshots, beatings, and more. I don't want to spoil the good stuff.This one should be considered as a ground breaking film as it defies the standards of violence in cinema. Sure, it can't be considered as an art film nor a 100% horror effort, but it flirts with the thin line between both of them. Not sure where to label this one in some years... But I'm sure it ranks high amongst the most brutal and nihilistic movies made in recent history.Morjana Alaoui delivers one of the bravest performances in Horror cinema history.

30,jzappa,Witness and Participant,9,20 October 2010,"As any follower of the genre by now knows, the most original and audacious horror films of the past decade have been receiving a hasty theatrical release in America, at best, before finding their audiences on DVD. Whether this is because of the outpouring of the amount of subtitled horror endeavors, the effect that the flood of PG-13 rated wide-release horror movies have had, or the, um, emerging awareness that horror fans are a lucrative, although rather decisively distinct niche, the truths of the marketplace have guaranteed that people who are just seeing mainstream horror films are missing opportunities for the genre's most electrifying recent harvests. It may be no shock then that Pascal Lugier's Martyrs, which is almost certainly the most ferocious, unwavering horror film of the decade, has found itself premiering on DVD in America.What most singles out Martyrs from other recent horror films is its degree of determination. To talk about its plot is to deprive the film of its huge gut blow. Maybe it's best simply to observe that it's keen to delve totally into its themes, chancing audience infidelity as it incessantly redefines what breed of movie it's seeking to be. As this warped excursion into shame, vengeance and evil unfurls, we find ourselves aligned with two institutionalized girls one after another, an ordinary nuclear family, a woman assailed by some sort of demon, her besieged friend (and unreciprocated lover), and the members of an underground organization. As intentions become clearer, audience pities are made to modify, coercing us to suspect our function as viewers. Once the complete intensity of Lugier's depravity is unraveled, the film divulges itself as a contemplation of being prey.Martyrs tells a story that is not only gashed into distinct acts, but also is prepared to transfer into altogether separate subgenres of the horror film to realize its purpose, which unquestionably concerns nurturing audience awareness about their bond with the pandemonium it depicts. It's alternatively a psychological thriller, a slasher movie, a monster movie, and a torture porn endurance trial. While the story is intended to keep viewers guessing, it's also resolved to defy our notions about what altitudes of on-screen torment and agony we can find tolerable. In both length and concept, the brutality continually tests us. Throughout the sequence of the film, gore is used to traumatize, repulse, gratify visually, make us writhe, and make us feel for the victim.When a third-act development begins to portray such cruelty as something cyclical and numbing, Martyrs ends up rising above any audience bloodlust, posing the query of whether radical delineations of screen violence can take audiences any closer to common realities about our nature. In its numerous contortions, it appears to suspect why we treat ourselves to watching horror movies at all. Martyrs' editing follows a number of frames, centered on the animal temperament of time, cutting to the next shot despite what is occurring within the image, so our most primitive and emotional responses play a part in the lack of being able to predict what could possibly come next. But cutting rooted in time, using the visual structure of the shots, along with the varying momentum of the cadenced cuts, persuades more difficult connotations than that.It upsets exactly because it sabotages expectations of the torture film genre and gives a motive beyond sheer sadism, at the same time giving some insight into Lugier's own posturing. The unmitigated final sequence is monotonous, deliberately, but it summarizes the same despair that the rest of the movie seeks. As Martyrs moves toward its end, it gets tantalizingly close to gusting the subtextual reverberations of the horror genre into the open, compelling us to tackle some revolting realities. It closes with an ultimate, absolute substantiation of despair; a vital loss of hope that sends viewers out of its diagetic world with a jolt harder than any show of blood and guts could administer. Possibly more than any other horror film, Martyrs displays the scope of the genre's resources to come across ways to stimulate, goad and alarm us. It attempts, and achieves, so much that it makes most contemporary movies, despite genre, look complacent.",Martyrs

Martyrs is pretty heavy, even for me, one moment actually had me wincing. As I sat alone with one other guy in Cinema 3 of The Trak in Adelaide, which only consists of four small rows the 97 minute flick, seems to last much longer. Sitting at the front, no more than ten feet from the screen, I must say I was wowed by the story, if cinematic appeal especially in the last half hour. Kojo Productions which is an Adelaide company was partially responsible for this foreign shocker which sees two sisters, who when younger girls were snatched, after their parents were brutally killed, but manage to eventually escape their captors. Now grown up, they return forth a bloody vengeance that has us cheering inside. Again they are reliving the hell of the past, when they are snatched again, only this time, there's really no escape, and it's here where the story really gets weird, as though the story is talking over your head. You really have to wrack your brain, but if you do it on this one, I guarantee, it won't be long before your head will hurt. Believe me, this film is shockingly bloody, one scene involving a full skinning, which almost took the cake. This is still one of the most shocking, unnerving hard to stomach flicks I've seen, which still haunts me visually at the memory of a few scenes. It's horror on a very heavy scale, be warned before viewing this one. An intriguing horror I must say, one of the most intriguing years, drawing some creepy parallels if faintly comparing it to Audition.",Martyrs
33,jtindahouse,Brutal and yet somehow thoughtful,10,21 March 2017,"There have been a lot of torture based films in the past 15 years, some more thoughtful than others. There are the ones like 'Hostel' which really want to do nothing more than shock you at how violent, gruesome and cruel they can be. Then there are the ones like 'Saw' which are a step up in the intelligence ranks. The 'Saw' series put some real time and effort into their stories and plots and their masterful twist endings. Of all the torture films I've ever seen though (and that is quite a few admittedly) I think I would have to say 'Martyrs' is the most intelligent of them all. Trust the French. I love French films and I loved 'Martyrs'. What I thought was just another 'Hostel' type film, attempting nothing more than to shock the audience as much as possible, turned out to be something quite brilliant.It goes without saying that this film will not be for everyone. Make no mistake, some of the imagery is truly brutal and I suspect will stay with me for a long time (and I've seen a lot horrible imagery over the years). In a way it's a little sad that a lot of people won't be able to stomach the film, because they will miss out on what ended up being a very interesting and intriguing ending. This is a wonderful film, and if you're up to it make sure you check it out.",Martyrs

Lucie describes a scarred, ghostly, thin woman terrorizing her. Fifteen years later, Lucie breaks into a home and kills the family with a shotgun. She calls Anna, telling her that she has found and done away with the people she believes held her captive earlier. Lucie asks for help in disposing the bodies but Anna finds the mother still alive and tries to help her get out of the house but Lucie beats her to death and argues with an hallucination of the ghost figure. She finally finishes her talk and proceeds to slit her own throat. As Anna cleans up the house, she uncovers a secret basement and a malnourished woman, cut up and with a strange metal device on her head. The woman is shot down by a group of strangers and Anna meets an older lady who explains that they are creating martyrs in order to understand the afterlife. Most of us growing up in a religious tradition, in my case Catholic, heard of the great martyrs who later became saints. Suffering is believed to uncover deep insights. Well, Anna is about to find out what the meaning of the word pain is. The last half hour or so is brutal beyond description. The writer-director has some very dark thoughts which put up on the screen. Martyrs is a very good but disturbing film.",Martyrs

Too many creators of horror films think that the more ""sophisticated"" the script the better. Martyrs, consisting of two different intertwined parts, was generally well watchable: the scenes were intense, with many twists and unpredictable solutions, leading actresses - Morjana Alaoui as Anna Assaoui and Mylène Jampanoï as Lucie Jurin - were catchy and credible, camera-work was skillful; the evildoers, however, could have obtained more attention and clarification. The reason behind those atrocities and the amount of people involved was not really satisfactory, and the pre-ending and ending could have been wittier as well, more in the Hitchcock style when you really feel horrified while the subtitles roll.Nevertheless, a film far above average, recommended to all those fond of related topics and films.",Martyrs
36,dfranzen70,"Sometimes, they have nothing to do with religion....",3,16 November 2017,"The synopsis for Martyrs on Netflix (where it is not yet available, even on DVD) indicates that the movie's about a young woman who enlists the aid of her longtime friend to exact revenge on the couple who imprisoned and tortured her when she was a kid. But that covers only about the first twenty minutes of this gory thriller. Then stuff gets weird.First, a disclaimer. As I was watching this movie, I realized I really didn't like it. I just didn't get it. Didn't know why the plot was moving forward. Wasn't the revenge over? And then the third act finally arrived. And when I went to bed, I still didn't like it, but I was wavering. When I woke up the next morning, I had to admit to myself that it was a pretty good movie after all.In a sense, the plot isn't quite linear. We first see the women getting the revenge. But then the focus shifts from the original victim, Lucie (Mylene Jampanoi), to her friend Anna (Morjana Alaoui), who herself becomes a victim of immeasurable suffering. It's like watching the events that probably happened to Lucie play out with Anna. I started to wonder what the point or the endgame was. Was this just for the sake of bloodletting? The answer lies in the title. I certainly can't tell you why, as that would spoil the surprise. But if you do take the time to watch this movie – and beware, it's in French, and the version I saw was dubbed, not subtitled – try to stick with it. It'll give you something to think about, if nothing else.",Martyrs
37,dee.reid,"The ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" movies have nothing on ""Martyrs""",10,14 May 2009,"""Martyr"" - witness.In an era of horror films in which graphic violence and depravity and the highest levels of human evil are dominated by the likes of the ""Saw"" movies and the ""Hostel"" movies, French director Pascal Laugier's ""Martyrs"" has proved itself to be a two-fold juggernaut: on the one hand, it's the most artistically depraved and frightening new piece of ""torture porn"" I've ever seen, and on the other hand ""Martyrs"" is not just a film - it's an experience. This is where many of the new ""Splat Pack"" filmmakers - the new era of horror movies that are notorious for their extreme levels of violence and gore - such as James Wan, Eli Roth, Darren Lynn Bousman and Rob Zombie, have failed.I must admit I am guilty of having a fondness for the ""Saw"" movies, even though the extreme levels of violence and gore in those films in my opinion is there for shock value, not to actually enhance the films or draw you in any deeper. American filmmaker James Cameron once said that with gore you create disgust, rather than fear, and with disgust there's a completely different set of emotional investments. ""Martyrs"" is both disgusting and horrifying, but in ways that are unimaginably repulsive and beneficial to the film's entertainment and artistic merits.The film opens in 1971, when a young girl has managed to escape a dungeon where she had been beaten, starved, dehydrated, and tortured almost to the point of death. However, there is no sign of sexual abuse. The girl is traumatized, nearly catatonic, and is then taken into an orphanage, where she befriends another girl who is also a victim of child abuse. 15 years later, both girls are young women in their early 20s, and the victimized girl, Lucie (Mylene Jampanoi), walks into a house and slaughters the family living there. Lucie believes that these were the people responsible for torturing her 15 years earlier.The other girl, Anna (Morjana Alaoui), soon arrives, and the two try to clean up the scene of the crime before the police arrive. Lucie is haunted by visions of another young victim that she had shared her experiences with 15 years later, and this victim is prone to committing unspeakable acts of violence and mutilation against her. However, after a while, it soon becomes clear that Anna and Lucie have just stumbled upon something far worse than either one of them could have imagined, as they find themselves doomed to endure the vary fate that so many others have gone through, and did not live to tell about.I had heard recently that this film was banned in France and it's not hard to see why. This is clearly not a film for children, nor is it wise to watch it on a full stomach because I guarantee you that some of the grotesque sights and sounds you see and hear here will not soon be forgotten. I have no idea what possessed Pascal Laugier to write and direct this feature, and I'm not sure I want to know. All I'm sure of, is that whatever possessed him, he created a film that is not to be messed with, and cannot in any way be compared to the juvenile gore-fests we're becoming so accustomed to here in the United States. He has said that ""Martyrs"" is a film that he loathes himself for making, but at the same time is happy he made it due to the level of creative freedom given to him in making it.I like gore as much as the next person - I already admitted to being guilty of liking the ""Saw"" movies - but ""Martyrs"" pushes the envelope in sheer extreme film-making. Most horror filmmakers are interested in making their movies as realistic as possible - certainly more-so than their predecessors this time 20 years ago - but Pascal Laugier has succeeded in creating a film experience that transcends much of what I've seen in recent years in the horror genre. He's created a real horror movie experience that's actually an experience, something that is seen, heard and felt, something lacking from most horror movies coming out of the United States now that are more interested in grossing-out the audience, rather than actually scaring them. ""Martyrs,"" is in essence, a horror film for mature horror movie fans, the ones not yet accustomed to ""Saw"" or ""Hostel.""Both Morjana Alaoui and Mylene Jampanoi turn in career-making performances. They were both extremely brave for going into this picture and becoming the willing ""martyrs"" of the torture porn era. I don't want to know what these two talented young actresses went through in the making of this film, but their suffering shows in their daring acting performances. Whatever awards they receive for their work here, they will surely deserve them.""Martyrs"" is not a film I walked away from feeling good about; I'm actually quite positive that is not its intention. I felt drained after it, and somewhat unhappy, but nonetheless I felt satisfied with what I'd seen: a horror movie that went beyond what the genre has typically offered us in recent years. It is a truly terrifying experience. American author Stephen King once called Sam Raimi's 1982 gore-fest ""The Evil Dead,"" ""the ultimate experience in grueling horror.""He'd never seen ""Martyrs.""10/10",Martyrs

39,parry_na,Watch it once.,9,12 July 2015,"There was a time when France was not particularly praised for its horror film output. This, despite the outpourings of Jean Rollin's personal voyage of vampirism, zombies and the like; this, despite the supreme 'Eyes without a Face/Les Yeux Sans Visage', the film/television series 'The Returned/Les Revenants' and films like 'The Pack' and 'Martyrs'.There is a famous photograph sometimes known as 'Napalm Girl', featuring a nine year-old Vietnamese girl running naked and terrified, away from the carnage caused by an aerial napalm attack in 1972. As effective as any anti-war poster, this picture might have inspired one of the opening scenes of this truly disturbing film. Brutally attacked and imprisoned, half-dressed Lucie Jurin escapes her prison and runs down the street, making her escape.The next time we see her, she has met Anna in the orphanage where she has been placed. She is terrorized by the image of a decaying woman, possibly a ghost.Anna and Lucie become lovers and vow to get even with the torturers; years later they burst in on a happy, respectable family and brutally murder them. Surely these law abiding people can't have been responsible? This film succeeds in wrong-footing the audience and providing twist after twist. Not only ARE these people (partially) responsible for Lucie's degradation, but moments later Lucie is killed, and it is Anna that becomes the centre of attention in a narrative that then assumes the moniker 'torture porn'. Rarely have I seen filmed abuse presented so uncompromisingly. Anna is ritually beaten, fed the bare minimum gruel and if she resists, is beaten yet more. Her broken face and body is heart-breaking to see, extremely uncomfortable – her captors' only comment is that they are amazed she is still alive. She therefore has one, final, appalling punishment to go.Despite spoiler warnings, the reasons for this abuse will not be mentioned here, other than to say, it is 'respectable' establishment figures that are behind it all, and everything then comes to a very final (and satisfying – if that is the right word to use) end. This is an incredible, profound, horrifying film - not one I'm sure I'll ever see again, but if you can stomach it, I'd recommend watching once.",Martyrs

41,drownnnsoda,As abhorrent as it is adept,9,20 March 2015,"Oh France, I can't quit you. Between this, ""High Tension,"" ""Irreversible,"" and ""Inside,"" I think le français take the cake for producing some of the most twisted horror films of the twenty-first century. With ""Martyrs,"" we have what begins as an inexplicable home invasion scenario— an apparently wealthy family is interrupted during Sunday breakfast by a hooded woman with a shotgun; things don't end prettily. But if you thought that was bad, you've got another thing coming.Pascal Laugier penned and directed this film, which turned heads in 2008 and is now legendary; before, he was known for his divisive supernatural drama ""House of Voices,"" which didn't receive the fraction of praise he's gotten for this, but ""Martyrs"" is indisputably the better film. The script here is adept and tight— it starts off running, and defies our expectations from stage one. It begins on one foot but funnels into something far darker and demoralizing. The central theme is a spiritual one, which is perhaps part of what makes the film as compelling and as disturbing as it is; here, violence and degradation are a means of uncovering a spiritual and existential truth; humankind's ultimate riddle that we cannot seem to unravel.While the film does become a bit tedious as it propels our heroine (or martyr) toward her fate, the repetitiousness and grating on the audience's limits of endurance are a necessary part of the package here. Both Morjana Alaoui and Mylène Jampanoï turn in vulnerable and terrifying performances, while Catherine Bégin is just the right tinge of detached evil. The film's conclusion is perhaps more rattling than the on screen violence that precedes it, and that's another beauty here— that the response is not just impulse toward gore, but also an emotional entrapment. Psychologically and aesthetically, ""Martyrs"" has a death grip on its audience, and for that, I commend it.",Martyrs
42,EVOL666,Would've Made A Fantastic Revenge Film-But...,7,8 February 2010,"Much like several films that I'll be putting my opinion on-MARTYRS is a film that I watched a while back (through a bootlegged copy prior to it's DVD release) that I didn't review because I had other things going on that made reviewing films a small priority to me. Now that I've had time to reflect and have a bit more spare time on my hands-I'll share what I thought about this film-which many said was to be the 'goriest' and most 'harrowing' film since INSIDE (a film I personally happen to love...)...MARTYRS revolves around a young lady who was basically tortured when she was younger; and as she grow older-she decides to find those that f!cked with her-and deal out a healthy serving of revenge...Sounds great as the premise of a relatively straight-forward 'revenge' film, right? Well...yeah-it would-if it didn't get f!cked up by the last 1/3 of the film. I understand that MARTYRS is the type of film that tends to divide audiences-so I'll explain why I think it COULD have been a great film-but wasn't. ****spoilers from here on out****The basic idea of a young woman going after those that wronged her is a classic idea that never gets old if handled properly. Problem is-the writers/director of this film decided to try to take MARTYRS in a totally different direction in the last third of the film and turn what could otherwise have been a near-perfect 'revenge' film-into some left-field theological discussion. Now-I have no problem with a bit of 'smart' in my horror/sleaze viewing-but at least try to make it make sense if you're going to force it down my throat the way this film did. First off-the idea of 'forced transcendence' is nothing new to me. I've seen it portrayed much more effectively (and gruesomely...) in Monica O'Rourke novella 'Suffer the Flesh'. Secondly-even though I treasure misogynistic violence in my horror/sleaze viewing-I'd be hard-pressed to find anyone that didn't find the 'abuse' of the lead actress not only tedious-but frankly boring as it went on,and on,and on, ad nauseum-at what seemed to be a way to fill up time to lead up to an otherwise unfulfilling conclusion. And as to the conclusion-let me ask you this: the whole point of the film ended up revolving around the idea that you could torture the 'right' people into telling you what happens in the afterlife, right (far-fetched in it's own right...)? Well for all of you that felt this was such a novel 'twist' do you really think that the old lady that was one of the 'masterminds' behind these experiments would have been so quick to kill herself-regardless of the answer???Sorry kids-but MARTYRS is a seriously flawed film in my book. Onto the good points-it starts of extremely well. The idea that it makes you think is happening is interesting (until the 'truth' is known...)-and there are some pretty strong scenes that will have every hardcore horror-lover cheering. The brutal shotgunning of an entire family (including children) will alone have most of us raising our glasses. The performances are solid from all of the actors/actresses-so no gripes there. But what could have been one of the modern classick 'revenge films' gets mired in a bunch of nonsense that anyone that pays attention to the actual storyline couldn't possibly fall into. A generous rating for a decent film with some major flaws-the next INSIDE it surely isn't...7/10",Martyrs

The editing was great, so was the music and action scenes felt strong. When the 2nd half started all the questions were answered and the rest of the film was only torture. That's it. The whole second half of film is a girl being tortured just for the sake to supposedly find the meaning of afterlife or whatever... The ending was abysmal, so supposedly the tortured girl found what the afterlife is and before dying told it to one woman of the organisation which was torturing her.

46,TdSmth5,"Brutal, chilling, effective. Perfect.",10,17 October 2010,"Martyrs is a remarkable horror film that goes beyond the standard fare. The film is clearly structured, with 3 parts. The prologue tells of a girl, Lucie, in her early teens beaten and bloody who escapes from some hospital. She is taken into a care facility and is befriended by Anna who takes care of her. But Lucie also suffers from nightmares and is haunted by creatures. The second part takes us several years later to a regular and seemingly innocent family who is having Sunday breakfast. All members of the family, parents and 2 kids, are suddenly and mercilessly shot. The killer is Lucie, who tells Anna that the dead ones are those ""who are responsible"". Lucie continues to be haunted by some creature, a naked bloody woman. She terrorizes, beats, and cuts Lucie. But as Anna soon discovers, there is no creature, it is Lucie who hurts herself. In a flashback we are told who this woman is. She was another victim in the hospital, one who Lucie couldn't save when she escaped. But Lucie can't take it anymore and slits her throat. Anna then discovers a hidden passage in the family's house. It leads to a high-tech dungeon with posters of dead/dying people. There she discovers and rescues another naked woman wearing a chastity belt and a some skullcap nailed into her skull. In the third and final part, Anna is made captive by the group behind the kidnap-torture scheme. First an old woman discloses what this group is all about. The posters in the hall are of those who despite extreme suffering found bliss. Their eyes reflect it. They are alive yet their bodies are almost in decay. They have transmuted pain and found something else. The point of all the torture is to provoke that state beyond suffering. And now it's Anna's turn. In a series if fade-in/fade-outs we are see all that Anna has to go through. And it's not pretty. She is shackled, shaved, force-fed, and most stunningly, freed from the shackles only when it's time to get brutally beaten. In the final step, she is skinned alive, except for her now-unrecognizable face. And then she reaches the next stage. The group now claims success and in a meeting plans to reveal it all to the members. But that revelation doesn't take place, as the old woman shoots herself after hearing what Anna has to say.It is not easy to critique a movie like Martyrs because it is perfect. The story, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, could not be better. This movie will captivate you, and you will either love it or hate it, but you cannot remain indifferent- it is that effective. Whether you love it or hate it will depend on whether you stay with the ugliness of what happens to the girls or are able to transcend that and find meaning, as the movie itself guides you to it. No doubt terrible things happen, but this movie doesn't stop there, it goes beyond the horror to the sublime. Martyrs is one of the best movies ever made.",Martyrs
47,fertilecelluloid,A flawed treasure,8,19 October 2008,"""Martyrs"" meets the purest definition of Horror and left me a little numb. Two young girls exact revenge on the people who abused them, but their plan doesn't succeed entirely. The first two-thirds are brutal, cruel, bloody and grotesque as violent retribution shares the screen with disturbing, hallucinogenic imagery. The last third is an attempt at meaning that falls dramatically short, but it is courageous, nonetheless. Borrowing elements from ""Saw"", ""Hostel"", ""Irreversible"", ""Hellraiser"" and ""Salo"", this is a film deserving of attention. Unfortunately, it does outstay its welcome with its torrent of torture becoming endless and boring. Director Pascal Laugier uses a deft hand to provide background for the characters, but his clinical approach to the material robs it of any contrast -- the film is all crucifixion and no resurrection. Certainly I found it engaging for most of the time, and I felt sympathy for the abused, centerpiece female (who wouldn't?), but her ordeal felt distant, too, and nothing was engaged but my sympathy. The final revelation feels right, and explains most of what we've just seen, but it has little dramatic impact. The film's special make-up effects are brilliant, as is the sound design and harrowing score. A flawed treasure.",Martyrs
48,Jonny_Numb,Martyrdom,7,25 May 2009,"Those crazy French have done it again! Not contented to leave well enough alone after plumbing the gritty, dirt-strewn depths of bloody, sadistic romance (Alexandre Aja's ""High Tension""), the metaphoric and actual traumas of pregnancy (Julien Maury and Alexander Bustillo's ""Inside""), and the shamelessness of gory homage (Xavier Gens' ""Frontier(s)""), along comes Pascal Laugier (who is slated to helm the upcoming ""Hellraiser"" redux) with ""Martyrs,"" a film that takes a relentless, deadly-serious approach to child abuse, vengeance, and the psychological scar tissue that remains years later. As with the aforementioned films, this is a heavily stylized and deliberately structured tale (and, as pervasively discomforting as these films are, they are bringing a socially conscious coat of legitimacy to the horror genre as a whole) that never quite settles on a consistent tone, always keeping the viewer disconcerted and on edge. The plot follows a young girl, committed to a hospital after suffering horrific abuse (seen mostly in dimly-lit quick cuts); 15 years later, she hunts down those she thinks are responsible with the help of an uncertain accomplice. Bloodshed gives way to the manifestation of irrepressible memories and the introduction of a mysterious sect masking a sinister purpose. Laugier's tone remains slightly surreal throughout--indeed, a film about such damaged/deranged characters calls into question whether the world we see is solely informed by their own (not to mention the director's) distorted subjectivity. And the performances are appropriately contradictory: we sympathize with the plight of our anti-heroes (even in the midst of cold-blooded murder and jaw-loosening abuse), but their beyond-repair psychosis keeps us from truly condoning their actions. From this, an interesting complication emerges: as with Pasolini's ""Salo,"" ""Martyrs"" has no real moral compass to keep us grounded in a sense of security and normalcy; as a result, we transpose our own ethical and emotional sensibilities on the tormented. By its close, ""Martyrs"" has almost gone too far, indulging over-the-top violence that threatens to undo what has gone on before...yet with an ending that delivers something contrary to the nihilism we have just experienced, I can't help but applaud its audacity.",Martyrs
49,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Extremely Powerful and Disturbing French Extreme Film,10,22 August 2019,"This is another film that I had heard a lot about from horror film podcasts I listen to, but it took quite awhile before finally seeing. This film is quite brutal, but if you can handle it, it is well worth it. This is now my third time seeing with the second being at the Gateway Film Center for their Horror 101 as well as another rewatch for the People's Council for the Summer Challenge Series. The synopsis is a young woman's quest for revenge against the people who kidnapped and tormented her as a child leads her and a friend, who is also a victim of child abuse, on a terrifying journey into a living hell of depravity.I tried to come in knowing as little as possible about the film. I really like that we got to see the Lucie (Jessie Pham) as she escaped from her captors. This is given to us in a few different scenes, but it gets right in to her fleeing from a warehouse style building. Then we're given more through a documentary of sorts recapping it. Early on we just get a taste of the torture she had to endure. At the time, we aren't given why it is happening though. Something that is chilling is a chair that she was strapped to and a hole in the seat to go to the bathroom, just showing a taste of what she endured. Lucie grows to be Mylène Jampanoï in our present as well.She has befriended Anna (Morjana Alaoui), who we end up learning is a runaway. They were both at an orphanage as children. Lucie decides to get revenge on the people that hurt her when she finds their picture in a newspaper. What I really liked about the story early on is this seems like a normal family. It made me question if Lucie has just lost it or is this really the people that hurt her. Anna seems to think that the latter is the case though and wants to rationally decide what to do.To add this, there's a creature that Lucie sees that she thinks is chasing her. It looks like a woman that is cut up and has been tortured to the point where her humanity is gone. This looked creepy and had me wondering from the first time seeing her if she was real or not. What it ends up being I thought was great.This film has a few reveals that I really liked. Around the time that Lucie gets her revenge was where I was starting to wonder what was going on. The film then takes it even farther and I thought it was great as well. To fully delve into the story, I would need to spoil the film, which I really don't want to do here. I will say I like how the film ends as it ties science and religion together. What Anna goes through is horrible and made me cringe. The ending though was great.Going from there, I need to talk about the effects. They look to be practical and looked to be very real. The gun shots to the knife cuts all look like they really happened, which is very well done on the effects department. Seeing the torture as well looked quite vivid and a lot of it had me cringing at the brutal realism. What makes it even more interesting for me is the fact that, as a viewer I feel we become desensitized to it as our character is. That is terrifying to me. Even the after effects look so real on the characters. I could definitely see what they went through on their bodies. I was very impressed in a morbid way. I also want to include here how the film looks grainy. This was a good touch as it makes what we are seeing even more realistic.The film was very interesting in how it was edited as well. We do follow a very linear story, but there are intercuts of things that happened to Lucie in the past. These are shown when she is sleeping or when Anna is cleaning early on. I like how they use these to fill us in on the back-story. It works as well because we get to see what Lucie went through later, but it is done to Anna. It just doesn't tell us and it makes it that much more horrific. The film does build tension and the climax was the payoff I needed. I thought the conclusion makes sense as well.Something else that was very good for the film was the acting. I thought Alaoui and Jampanoï did great. What their characters go through is amazing and they portrayed the effects of this very well. It seemed very believable that they dealt with everything that they did. The rest of the cast round out the film well. What I really find interesting about the supporting cast is that they seem like normal people who are doing completely horrible things. It really brings the moral of the story that we don't know what those people around us are doing when the doors close, which is very scary. It makes you wonder if someone you know is doing something like this to people.Now with that said, I would recommend this film if you can stomach French Extreme films. This one I had heard great things about and was satisfied after seeing it. The film has some depraved aspects that happen, but it also makes you question if Lucie is crazy or not. Early on you learn that she is mentally scarred by what happened to her which I found to be believable. The acting was good and this is coupled with the realistic effects that happen to them. It definitely made me cringe. I felt dirty after watching it and I also wanted them to get their revenge. It is interesting as to why this is happening to them and I like how it ties religion with science. This has become my new favorite from this genre. As stated, it is very realistic and made me cringe, so if you can stomach it, I definitely recommend viewing this.",Martyrs

I was pretty much skeptical, I said to them something like ""I bet it is not disturbing at all, and anyways I'm never disturbed by a film"". So we watched it and within few minutes my cousin was like ""I told you so"". If you have towards Pascal Laugier's second feature film MARTYRS the sort of punk rocker attitude that I had towards IRREVERSIBLE you will...this ain't a HOSTEL, this is disturbing, this ain't a TOKYO GORE POLICE, this is a film with real young women as characters then you will not have a really fun time. But like TOKYO GORE POLICE, this is nothing but a must-see yet, certainly, is not for everybody. I had yet to see the film À L'INTÉRIEUR (also known as INSIDE) but basically how my cousin describe it to me in terms of being disturbing and a film that you would not want to watch again and again is how I described to him MARTYRS, well after all both are considered part of the ""New wave of French horror"" yet Pascal Laugier is not quite agreed with that: ""It's still a hell to find the money, a hell to convince people that we are legitimate to make this kind of movie in France. So I know from an American point of view and probably an English one too, there is a kind of new wave of modern horror film, but it's not true. It's still hell. My country produces almost 200 films a year and there are like 2 or 3 horror films. It's not even an industry, French horror cinema is very low budget, it's kinda prototype. I think that a genre really exists when it's industrially produced like the Italians did 600 spaghetti westerns. So we can't really say that there is a wave of horror in French Cinema, I don't believe it"".Anyway, MARTYRS is about two female friends, Anna (Morjana Alaoui) and Lucie (Mylène Jampanoï), who met each other in an orphanage after one of them, Lucie, could escape from a hell on earth. What begins in the orphanage is a real friendship as this girl, Anna, is the only one who tries to talk and stuff with Lucie. There is going to be revenge but this is not really your usual revenge film, Pascal Laugier doesn't go for that but the actual revenge is truly disturbing, hard to watch: after the stuff in the orphanage (where we also learn that something is ""visiting"" Lucie) we travel 15 years and we focus on a family (father and mother and their son and daughter), a pretty normal family having breakfast and having a normal chat, is just a pretty normal Sunday. Is quite disturbing as any revenge should be, ""they deserved to die"" because they basically destroyed Lucie's life but their kids? And boy, is not only that, is not only those scenes with Lucie shooting the kids but all of what happens with the character Anna. To be clear, these two girls stayed together and when Lucie saw on the paper those that destroyed her life she decided to have her revenge. We will have Anna at the scene of the revenge and of course at one point we have from Lucie the ""they deserved to die"". The main issue deals with how can you say that to Anna in hopes that she gets a little less disturbed when she is in a house with four dead persons knowing that her best friend (who is basically the only person that she loves and that has in the world) was the one who killed them, knowing that the police or anybody else will be there in any minute. The main actresses really deserve a big BRAVO, but especially Morjana Alaoui. Her character suffers of a complete transformation but before Anna becomes an ""official"" martyr she pretty much was already one. She tries to help the moribund mother (certainly we understand this completely and is the most normal action but Lucie will not be very satisfied), she hides the corpses, she sees her best friend killing herself (the why of that stuff is just great) and she also discovers part of the why which is only more and more horrors (Anna finds a girl who is just another example of the horrors, and she help her very much but the girl was already lost). And she is so brave, and this is so hard to watch and so interesting (while the torture part is only remarkable because of Morjana Alaoui, it could have been a bit shorter without any problems, the very last part, once Anna reaches the ""last stage"", is as interesting as the whole part before Anna meets the Mademoiselle) and in the end so great. See it before the American remake hits the theaters.",Martyrs
51,p-stepien,French horror renaissance?,5,10 September 2012,"Years ago Lucie (Mylène Jampanoï) escaped nameless captives, who forced her to withstand torture, denigration and mutilation. Through time Lucie was unable to cope with the stress, constantly haunted by a ruthless revenant who causes her bodily harm. Finally Lucie stumbles upon the family responsible and decides to avenge herself, hopefully getting rid of the apparition in the progress. After dispatching a family of four (including 2 kids) the hysterical Lucie calls on her only friend Anna (Morjana Alaoui) to assist her with dealing with the aftermath...The new French horror wave seems to be easily characterised as deeply nihilistic, unabashedly graphic and visceral with atmospherics to kill for (literally). Unfortunately also devoid of logic, charm and sensible characters, instead supplanting them with excruciatingly exercised clichés taken from American movies. The underlying message seems to be - whatever the Americans can do, we can do worse - not only is their brutality more graphic than that in America, but also their plot holes are greater both in size and in volume than their American counterparts.Thankfully ""Martyrs"" can be approached without much fright of being logically decapitated and if you don't poke about too incessantly with a yardstick you will find the story relatively sturdy, if straightforward and necessitating a leap of faith. Naturally after some bona fide idiocies churned out in ""High Tension"", ""Frontier(s)"" or ""Inside"" I expected much of the same, so despite heightened awareness Pascal Laugier's script escaped relatively intact.""Martyrs"" is exactly what is aims to be - a gory hack-fest with prolonged scenes of torture, dismemberment, disfuguration with the welcome additive of lack of horror guidelines (no one is innocent and on one is safe) and inexplicable terror. Nonetheless such nihilistic exploitation is streamlined for specific audiences, to which I do not belong, much more lovingly admiring the honest tension and subsequent atmosphere of horror, than the in-your-face audacity of gorno. Nonetheless I'm pretty sure fans of the genre will satisfy blood-lust, whilst positively charmed by the natural feistiness of our two leads.No holds barred guts galore frantic movie aimed for a select crowd. Otherwise avoid for your stomach's sake.",Martyrs
52,Matt_Layden,"Emotionally Draining, I Felt Dirty Afterwards",6,26 May 2010,"A young girl is abused, force fed slop and chained up. She escapes, but is haunted by a ghastly looking demon girl who continue to inflict harm on her. She is sent to an orphanage, where she makes friends with another girl. 15 years later, she seeks revenge on the people that did this to her. What she and her friend end up going through, is more haunting than they imagined.I don't really know where to start with this review. Let me say that I consider myself desensitized to violence and horrors. I can sit through the Hollywood films of Saw and Hostel and laugh at the screen in the violent terror. I can sit through the shock and horror of Cannibal Holocaust and I Spit On Your Grave. I was not expecting anything from this film, and yet it hit me the hardest. No other film has really made me feel as emotionally drained as this. The images, the sounds and the emotions in this film are very disturbing and hard to watch. Martyrs is not something I would recommend people watching, simply because of it's subject matter. I won't go into details but the second half of the film is some of the most heart wrenching images to watch, from a fictional film standpoint. The film almost has a grindhouse feel to it, as if you are watching two different films. The first half is a revenge tale with a bit of psychological horror thrown in, then the second half hits you and you don't know what to do.The film has no hope for it's characters. I usually hate films like this because it makes the point of watching it almost mute. Why should I care about these characters when I know the journey they are going on will end in a horrible mess. For some odd reason though, this film felt a little different. I suppose this is why I don't throw it into the same torture porn horror field as the Hostels and Saw films in this world. The film is in French and it plays out with a sense of professionalism. It knows the point it wants to get across and it does so. I can completely understand that people can feel the total opposite though. This film walks a very fine line.I felt dirty after the film, I felt horrible and helpless. I wanted the characters to do so many things to get them out of their situations, but it never happened and I knew it never would. The explanation at the end of it all is a bit out there in terms of believability. But the ending is left to the viewers imagination. My take on it is that the human mind cannot fathom the truth of what they seek. Which is why it ends the way it does. Martyrs is a very tough film to sit through and I commend anyone who does so.",Martyrs

It looked like it might be pretty good but sadly it fails.The follows 2 women, who were once victims as children, go on a bloody rampage but find themselves as victims in a living hell of depravity.I found the film to be confusing. The plot wasn't clear and the story telling was all over the place. The gore and violence were good and there was a little bit of eye candy, but aside from that, the film wasn't great at all. The ending itself didn't clear anything up and you were still left feeling confused and lost.Overall, not great! 4/10.",Martyrs
54,Analog_Devotee,Potentially peak extreme horror in cinema.,9,12 July 2021,"Easily the most depraved film I've ever seen, but what sets this apart from your typical extreme horror affair is that its depravity is equally matched by its innovative and thought-provoking storytelling. This isn't pulp horror. There are no cheap laughs to be had. It's also not a film you'll be wanting to revisit, even if you do find it to be a near (or firm) masterpiece. Whether you like it or not, this is horror in its most pure form.Going to rate this at a 9/10 for the time being, but I could definitely see myself bumping this to a 10 once I've had more time to dwell on it.",Martyrs
55,oneguyrambling,Thank Martyrs for Human Centipede and all similar rubbish that comes.,4,27 October 2010,"This started promisingly enough, in the first five minutes I was reminded of some Japanese horror flicks, all this changed after the initial (brief) credits, where mood made way for blood n guts and attempts to throw the audience off the trail.In fact this movie changed so much at about the half way point that it almost was like Three Extremes or Grindhouse, where multiple directors contribute to make a collective ""work"". If cinemas still had an interval they could have marketed this as a double bill, because if the lead actress wasn't the same you could be forgiven for thinking that you were watching another movie.So I'll review the film twice.Martyrs – First 45 minutes.A bit similar to Hard Candy, you can't tell what is real and what is imagined, who is sane and who is nutso. You know something bad is happening, that is painfully obvious from the first shotgun blast to the gut, but you don't really know why the victims are being victimised, nor if the perpetrator is an avenging angel or a skitzo bitch, and really you're not meant to.I actually thought the first half was leading somewhere good, the pre-credits sequence shows why the two lead actresses are so close, and sort of justifies each of their actions, and why Lucie (the aggressor) does what she does, with Anna as the protector. It appears that Lucie's actions are designed as payback for both a personal wronging and to avenge another victim that Lucie met only fleetingly, and who appears as a personal reminder to Lucie in high stress situations, something the first half has a lot of.I liked the first half, was confused by it until near the end but was willing to go with the flow until it unfolded, only the director had other plans. Go grab some popcorn and an $8 watered down drink. We'll be back in a moment.Martyrs – The second 45 minutes.Don't worry if you missed the last 45 minutes, it doesn't really matter but the front end of our double bill was a nice little example of misdirection with some brutal violence and pretty reasonable acting.The only carryover from that is the lead actress Anna, who finds herself in a position where she must endure what no-one should, for reasons that simply don't provide anything resembling justification for both the punishment and arguably the making of this film.One reason that movie lovers look overseas for alternatives is to experience something new and different, Asian horror until recently showed better imagination for where horror can be found, I am now positive that in general Europe has a willingness to go further, more ""extreme"" if you will, for longer and basically carry situations far beyond what America might find as a logical conclusion.There is a 25 minute period in Martyrs – Part 2 where dialogue is minimal and the experience is so unrelenting and linear that they lost me, I gave up. I knew what they were doing and where they were going but I really didn't care anymore.I have no doubt that if the film was in English it would be held up as the poster child for pushing the boundaries of taste, (putting the subtitles at the bottom of the screen automatically ensures you get some slack as a film maker, as critics fear the reprisals of a bad review as not ""getting it"").I can't explain what happens as even a basic outline gives the plot away because it really is that simple, that one note. The director tries to explain and justify the sequence through a 2 minute scene, but the explanation is that flimsy that I found the ensuing action only worthy of contempt, rather than the wide eyed revulsion and shock that I guess the director intended.There was no twist, nothing to lighten proceedings or even to break up the periods of tension, and although what happens to the victim is indeed shocking and the actions deplorable, once you no longer are emotionally involved in what is happening it is simply going through the motions. Which is exactly what I did until the credits rolled.Final Rating – 4.5 / 10. Yeah it's extreme (whatever that means anymore), but with a lightweight plot conceived only to justify what follows only gore lovers will find solace, (and there isn't really much gore).If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com",Martyrs

As me it is very disturbing movie. First part is only killing and full of blood scenes We are disappointed after seeing such killing drama and hope next part would be lesser horrible and we would get a relief but unfortunately more horrible drama is waiting for you in second half. That is limitless torture to a single helpless young lady. Believe me I could not see movie further and only can forward DVD to ending portion to finish it. End is even hopeless and meaningless. I felt deep nervousness till 4-5 hours after saw the movie and experienced that no meaning in our life.Such movies never be for watchable for common viewers.Movies should have entertainer and not for punishment to see torture drama.I don't understand why do such filmmakers make these horrible torture movies?IT IS NOT MOVIE.

57,ElijahCSkuggs,Cenobite openings. Martyrs welcome.,8,18 April 2009,"Yeah, it's got some spoilers.Gotta give it up to the Frogs for making some nice horror lately. And with Martyrs, they keep the ball rolling. Well, this ball is again like some recent other Frog Horror in that it bounces high in brutality, bloodshed and violence. It's all reality-based horror (humans being the monsters), which I'm kinda getting bored with, but this was a pretty nice surprise.The story itself is where it's biggest problems lie, but at the same time it brings a fresh take on the torture sub-genre. I had no clue how long Martyrs was, but during the movie there was a point where I thought the movie was going to end. Then it seemed a whole new horror story started. And then another. The first was some revenge/horror flick, then there was a little mystery/horror theme going on, then torture and supernatural ideas came into play. While watching it I didn't really like how they kept introducing these new paths. But thinking back, it's not that bad and for the most part it worked. I especially enjoyed the idea of reaching Martyrdom. Made me think of doing the hard-work to becoming a Cenobite.One of my biggest gripes with horror these days is having characters that I don't care about. And with a torture movie, the whole point of the horror is to feel for the victim. Again, I didn't care at all for these characters. They were just dumb characters. Maybe you were persuaded into caring for them from all the tears they were shedding, but that wasn't enough for this guy. Uph, I'm tough aren't I? Actually, a couple instances, from stupid decision making, I was hoping for them to kick the bucket.Martyrs is a bright spot in the oh-so-weak and played out sub-genre of torture flicks. The flick suffered from predictability and lack of good writing (hence the carefree characters), but it also looked fantastic, the actors were gung-ho, the violence excessive and the concluding idea was interesting. 7.5 outta 10....rounded up!",Martyrs

It starts as a somewhat run of the mill - if extremely bloody - example of the torture porn film genre - a seemingly deranged woman enters a home and kills all the members of its seemingly nice family. But as the movie progresses, it turns into something else - the woman was kept by this family when she was a child in a dungeon - and it has a stunning and very original twist in the final and brutal last half hour - not going to reveal too much here, but this family was part of a sect seemingly trying to decipher some of life's existential mysteries. Overall, one of the best horror films released in the last few years.",Martyrs
59,MrGKB,The real martyrs would appear to be the audience...,5,29 September 2012,"...and what we're ultimately allowed to witness is, at its core, some pretty empty-headed, although visceral, existentially sadistic nonsense. Nonetheless, I can't deny that ""Martyrs"" packs a punch (several of them, in fact, to the face and gut, repeatedly, to its protagonist, after fooling us about who the real protagonist is). It's ultra-violence that Alex and his droogies would lap up like synthemesc milk-plus; presumably the audience is meant to as well. Aha, but auteur Pascal ""The Tall Man"" Laugier isn't through with us yet! After rubbing our collective noses in viscous pools of vengeance and hallucinatory blood guilt, he dials up the sadism a few more notches with a tiresome third act that trucks in absurdist fantasies of an elite cabal searching for proof of an afterlife through the inducement of a tortured martyr's vision of what can only be feebly represented by a coruscating white light.What tripe.Neither the acting chops of the two leads, which are considerable, nor the overall production values, including some very convincing Grand Guignol splatter and grue, can conceal the vacuous conceit of the film's plot nor the soul-less nihilism of its theme. ""Martyrs"" leaves its audience numbed by its brutality, but with precious little else, and ultimately comes off as mere torture-porn with a glib pretension of meaning. I won't say it's not worth watching, but be prepared to be unsatisfied. Mayhaps that was Laugier's intent; if so, his intentions were shallow and venal.",Martyrs
60,gregsrants,Wow factor,8,14 April 2009,"Wow!   It takes a lot to provoke the 'Wow Factor' from me. I can go years  between seeing a movie and sitting glued to me seat long after the  lights have come back on where I am still in absolute astonishment of  what I have just witnessed.  Having just sat through Martyrs, I have a Wow!  Martyrs is a French horror film that will remind North American  audiences of all the great gore-porn-torture films that have graced our  screens in the past decade. It starts off with a bang. Literally.  Lucie, is a young girl who was abducted and savagely abused. She  escapes and fifteen years later, she shows up at the door of an  unsuspecting family and blows them away with a shotgun. It was the  first of many 'wow' moments during the viewing. The shotgun blasts as  they penetrate through the sub-woofer were chair rattling and as the  blood gushes from each of the victims, you will find yourself sitting  with your jaw on the floor wondering what is yet to come.  Enter Annie. Lucie's friend whom she met at the institution 15 years  ago. Annie arrives and tries to help Lucie clean up the mess (by mess,  I mean blood and guts). Annie is a good friend and she has long been  compassionate to what Lucie experienced at the hands of her captors and  to Lucie's skin ripping nightmares that she has had since her escape.   We soon learn that the gunned down family may be those that were  responsible for Lucie's incarceration. The actions from this point  forward in the lives of Lucie and Annie bring dire consequences and a  few twists that I didn't anticipate coming.   No. Change that. The dire consequences and few twists I REALLY didn't  see coming. In fact, the story goes down a path that was engrossing  gross and had surprises for me at every turn.  When it comes to gore-porn there have been too many movies that would  have us gasp or look away from the screen without actually providing us  with any story or relevance (Hills Have Eyes, anyone). Martyrs  separates itself from the pack and provides the viewer with a wicked  story that is backed up with enough violence and gore to do two films.   Oh. And it's scary too. A couple of scenes that include the girl that  haunts Lucie were downright frightening. A bathroom scene with the two  got my legs off the floor and onto the seat to which I was sitting.  By the time a group of aristocrats types show their interest in a  martyred Annie, you will be exhausted. I was. But in a good way. A  bloody good way. It will be no surprise to anyone that watches this  film what director Pascal Laugier has been given the keys to the remake  of the Clive Barker classic, Hellraiser.  So there you have it. Martyrs has all the great elements of good horror  film. It is gory, scary, at times terrifying and and disturbing. Every  year there is one great horror film that stands out from the rest.

61,mario_c,"In the end it was not shocking, just absurd and stupid!",3,12 April 2013,"After watch his most recent movie, THE TALL MAN (which I appreciated, by the way), I felt some curiosity to watch MARTYS, Pascal Laugier's most acclaimed work to date, and told by many, to be an excellent and unique horror movie. Some years ago I had also watched another film from this director called SAINT ANGE (something like a ghost story) and, at this moment, I can say I have watched all the (full length) movies Pascal Laugier did as a director. Guess what? MARTYRS is by far the worst, and I mean THEWORST! I never was a person to judge films by ratings, so I can't even say I was disappointed about this movie, because in fact I wasn't, I just felt surprised that a junk like this could be so acclaimed! I just ask: Was all the hype about MARTYRS for this? Is that what you people call a masterpiece or an innovative and unique horror film? Is its final massage that good? For me it has just one of the most ridiculous final disclosures, and plot's final message I've ever seen! (SPOILER) I mean can you think of a more idiotic idea than torture and martyrize a person just to, in the end (her final instants), she tells how the ""other world"" is Are you joking?? It's not cruel, or sadistic or fanatic or anything else It's just stupid!!! (END SPOILER) And to make this absurdity even more ridiculous and funny there's a comment here on the IMDb (one of the most well rated, by the way) that comparing this film to FUNNY GAMES (by Michael Haneke) says something like this: ""Martys is in a whole different league and is everything a film like Funny Games should have been"". One more time I do ask: Are you joking?? Compare this ""empty"" message from MARTYRS to a movie like FUNNY GAMES that (at least for me) has a really good message and it is, unlike MARTYRS, a really unique and remarkable movie?? I think these movies are not even comparable at all, in any sense!! A Comparison to movies like HOSTEL, which was also done, is more acceptable, but even here MARTYRS loses, in my opinion I found it really empty of a meaning and absolutely senseless in each one of its arguments So, in the end, was not the brutality or the torture present in the movie that shocked me, but mostly its final disclosure and the pointless plot it has! Besides, the gratuitous torture we see here is nothing new, there is a good count of movies that have similar scenes of free sadism Some call it ""torture porn"". I really don't feel shocked by the gore itself (I have seen some brutal and shocking movies like A Serbian FILM), I mean I can stand the blood and the torture scenes if in the end the final message/meaning of the movie is good, but that was not the case of MARTYRS!",Martyrs

63,Superunknovvn,"Disturbing, alright",8,13 April 2009,"This current French wave of horror is a real treat. I find it much, much more intriguing than the Japanese ghost movies from the late 90's. Movies like ""Haute tension"", ""Ils"", ""Frontiére(s)"" and especially ""À l'intérieur"" manage to do what almost no horror movie can anymore: They disturb me, and I find myself thinking about these gruesome stories for days afterwards. It's not just the explicit violence, but the way it is depicted, and the fact that these movies go where as a watcher you instinctively wish they wouldn't. And that is probably the essence of the horror genre. What little borders there still are, those French movie makers tear them down. Pascal Laugier is no exception.When I sat down to watch his movie ""Martyrs"", I was in a really bad mood. I had just missed a train. I was looking for something to take my mind off my anger about the fact that I had to wait another day until I could finally get back home to my family. ""Martyrs"" did a pretty good job at taking my mind off that problem. It starts off with a blast. So many things happen within the first 30 minutes, they suck you right into the movie.Then things slow down, and this is where some flaws become apparent. Firstly, ""Martyrs"" relies too much on violence. I'm not offended by it or anything, but in the middle of the movie, all we get is people hurting themselves or others while the story doesn't move forward at all. This is also where the movie loses its focus. What are we supposed to worry about the most here? The mystery around the main character's abduction or the weird monstrous woman that is haunting her? Then near the end of the movie, all of a sudden, a whole new spiritual angle is introduced to the story. You could say that ""Martyrs"" starts off at one point and ends in a completely different place. The end credits draw the bow back to our main characters' childhood, but at that point their individual fates aren't really what concern us anymore.It's weird and difficult to put into words, but the way ""Martyrs"" unfolds makes you dizzy... and that's part of what makes the movie so intriguing. When at some point you start to think that this isn't more than a variation of ""Hostel"", then the mind-boggling U-Turn at the end will disabuse you.In its worst moments ""Martyrs"" is predictable and too violent for its own good. However, the whole experience of watching this is so disturbing and creepy that it's hard to call Laugier's movie anything but exceptional and thoroughly recommendable to any horror fan.",Martyrs
64,MattyGibbs,A deeply disturbing modern horror classic.,9,16 May 2013,"This film is not like any other I have seen and I wanted to wait to watch it a second time to make up my mind about it. Mind you I had to wait a good 18 months before I could find the nerve to re-watch it. Martyrs is really a film of two parts, the first part is plain and bloody horror and the second part more psychological and brutal horror. Both parts of the film work equally well and are full of surprises though I found the second half to be very grueling to watch. I had a constant feeling of anxiety throughout something I don't recall having watching any other film. It is extremely well filmed with high production values and actually has a plot which makes you think, which is not often said of this genre. The two young leads are both excellent especially Morjana Alaoui as Anna who excels in what must have been a very difficult role to play. The ending of many horror films are notoriously poor but for me the ending really turns this from a good horror film to a truly great horror film.Without doubt this is the scariest and most disturbing film I have yet seen but also one of the classiest. Due to the subject matter some people will understandably hate it, my wife did, but if you have the stomach for it then this film is a surprisingly rewarding if harrowing experience.

67,asda-man,One of the greatest,10,20 March 2011,"Martyrs is another French film that is one of the most effective and incredible films I have ever seen. It's a rare thing now to get a horror film that truly shocks you, but Martyrs is one of these rarities. A film that you can't un-see, and possibly one you wouldn't want to either. Now, it would be easy to dismiss Martyrs as 'torture-porn' like Hostel, but Martyrs is so much deeper than that. The explicit and hugely upsetting torture sequences serve a very fine purpose to the mind-boggling narrative, and carefully constructed characters. You could also dismiss Martyrs as being exploitative, using gore for gore's sake. However, Martyrs uses some of the most cringe-inducing gore I've ever seen, which dares you not to look away. Never has violence looked more nasty or pointless. You could even say that it's a comment on how films glamorise violence. Martyrs shows violence for what it really is.What makes Martyrs so extraordinary is its unpredictability and the way it plays on your expectations, in a similar way to The Cabin in the Woods, only not humorous in the slightest. The film changes direction at least four times, and two of these occasions are in the opening 10 minutes! The first time I saw Martyrs, I was in shock at the first plot twist, as it delivers the nasty surprise thick and fast like a Michael Haneke film. It defies all conventions, without ever feeling schizophrenic in tone. Even though Martyrs has so many plot twists, it never feels messy and it's always focused on true narrative it's trying to express. I've seen the film about six times now and it still manages to hit me hard with its visceral shocks.Another great thing about Martyrs is its characters. The main protagonists feature on the front cover, both of them have a touching relationship as we see them through childhood. One of them, Lucie, is terribly haunted and a really tragic character who I felt immeasurably sympathetic towards. Her friend, is also almost like her carer who looks after Lucie, and also probably has feelings for her too. They're both very deep characters who we can care for. Martyrs also features a memorable villain, who's not in for long but offers a lasting and chilling presence, almost like Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs. However, I don't want to spoil too much, because that would be such a shame.The turning point for people will be just over half-way when Martyrs takes a seriously surprising and gut-punching turn that no one could see coming. There's a really heart-wrenching scene when Anna makes a discovery which should be strictly kept under wraps. This scene is one of the hardest scenes to watch in the film, and is outrageously disturbing. I always say that films become masterpieces when they turn into more of an experience, such as Black Swan, but Martyrs transcends from being an experience to being a challenge. It's a real challenge to make it through the final half hour of Martyrs, as things only become more disturbing.The final half hour will be the decider about whether you liked Martyrs or not. You can say what you like about the last half hour but whatever you say, it will be the thing that you remember the most about it. I shall not spoil it, but it's one of the saddest moments, actually no, it is the saddest moment I've seen on film. Every time I see it I almost cry which is something I don't do on many occasions. It packs such a huge emotional punch, and also has this chills-inducing music that escalates your feelings. Every time I see it I just want to collapse into a ball and weep an ocean of tears. But I'm yet to try that. It really is what takes Martyrs from being already one of the best horror films ever to being legendary. If you feel no emotion in this final third then you're either a robot or a psychopath.I can understand why people hate these final moments, because I remember when I saw it a second time, I thought that it would be much better to have a Frontiers-type finale. However, then I realised that this is what Pascal Laugier would want us to have, and is probably what other film-makers would give us. It's these final moments that are the biggest shock of the film and also are very relevant to the narrative as it allows us to go deeper into the characters. Suddenly the mystery is revealed and it's a chilling one. Martyrs turns unbelievably deep and philosophical which will make you provoke more thought than you could imagine. The ending will make your jaw drop, as it's a lot to take in. You could even say that the film takes another surprising turn. The final two shots are just the final nails in the coffin of your psyche. They're the last visceral shocks, and the last shot is sure to haunt your dreams.So it's easy to call Martyrs 'torture-porn' but it seriously is anything but. Since when has 'torture-porn' made you think or feel as much emotion as Martyrs does. It's hugely depressing, and leaves such an emotional impact. The directing alone makes Martyrs more than just an exploitation film! He's created a moving masterpiece. It's not easy to watch but the pay-off is immense. Martyrs is possibly the boldest and most powerful films I've ever seen. It's truly unforgettable, and I could write a list of superlatives like I did with The Dark Knight, but not one of them would justify just how mesmerising this film is. It's a true horror masterpiece. Martyrs is a difficult film to recommend, because it's the opposite end of entertainment, but the pay-off is truly unlike any other. Witness it for yourself. It's one of the best horror films ever made. Maybe even THE best.",Martyrs
68,doctorsmoothlove,A controversy withheld.,5,30 October 2009,"Preface: Since I began reviewing films, I've undergone a significant transition from casual movie goer to film critic. Several of my earlier reviews are written with an inexperience unbefitting of the films I discussed. I was hostile in my condemnation of certain films, particularly Captivity, because I found them distasteful. I will not be so absolute with current reviews. I may still find something inappropriate within a film, but I will try to critique it for less obvious reasons, assuming such is possible.Assuming you read the preface to this review (if not go back and read it), then let me abstain from any virulent condemnation of the brutal film I'm about to discuss. I was first exposed to Martyrs in the March 2009 issue of Rue Morgue. It is part of the French New Wave of horror that developed this decade. Perhaps it is the most challenging to finish of any of the films I've seen this year.The movie is incredibly violent and uncompromisingly sorrowful. This isn't even like Inside folks. Director Pascal Laugier makes no attempt to amuse us. He had a story for this film, and decided that the horror genre would be best to display it. Imagine your first viewing of Cannibal Holocaust. Mine resulted in an emotional vacancy that lasted several days before dissipating into appreciation. Martyrs may inspire a similar reaction in some viewers, but like its predecessor, will cause revulsion in most. For that reason, I warn you not to read the following plot summary. It will spoil the film's thesis and nullify the director's intent. Basic plot events will be revealed, though specific details are withheld.The film is split into three unequal parts. The first plays like any North American slasher film. A family is eating breakfast, discussing pointless things. A crazy young woman bursts in and shoots everyone at point blank range, including the adolescent son and tween daughter. The woman, Lucie, calls her friend Anna to help her dispose of the bodies. Anna comes and asks Lucie about the ""thing"" that has been chasing her. This creature is like Gollum's maniacal relative and inflicts all kinds of pain on Lucie.After many skillful scenes of terror that would please any Japanese horror director, the thing kills Lucie, though Anna is unhurt. Left alone, she explores the house and discovers an underground chamber where people appear to have been imprisoned and beaten. One victim is still alive and Anna releases her. Before they can escape, some people arrive and kill the victim.The leader of these people, called only Mademoiselle decides Anna would be a suitable candidate for her experiment. This process involves the enslavement and physical and psychological torture of young women in an effort to see beyond death. Kind of like Samsara, after a level of incredible suffering, young women (she mentions that this sub-group has been the only one found to reach this state) will lose the ability to fear death. In many years of experimentation, only a few candidates have actually reached ""martyrdom"" Many like Lucie, see visions of what isn't there and never reach it. Anna's skin is entirely removed and presumably she becomes a martyr, and she whispers to Mademoiselle what she sees. We never find out, though.I've read epithets from Holocaust survivors about Nazi scientific experiments involving live victims. I can't imagine how someone, whom I feel has knowledge of this tragedy, could recreate it on film. Director Pascal Laugier tells us in the DVD special features that he feels uneasy for directing Martyrs. He isn't sure if it is a good film or not. He also encourages people to hate him for this project.At the end of this summary, I am left with one question to answer. Is Martyrs a good film or not? Should you see it? Well, I'll defer to you on this topic. I'm sorry. There is no way I can answer this without compromising myself. Yes, his story has meaning but left me empty. After surviving this film, I wanted to know what Anna saw. Even if it was a sentence, a passage, or even a single word. Something would have at least allowed me some happiness in having watched it. Maybe Laugier intentionally left this out to maintain his universally somber tone, but I didn't like it. It feels like a cop-out to me.Do you want more details on why the film is so controversial? I'll describe some from the third part of the movie. When Anna is captured, we endure 30 minutes of silent beatings, humiliation, and eventual torture. Is it misogynistic? Yes, unlike even the virginal emphasis in slasher pics or the wretched on screen violence most ""torture-porn"" flicks. It's also not misogynistic. Laugier uses the violence to tell his story and not titillate a male audience. The silent beatings leave a feeling of sadness. It couldn't be further from ""torture-porn"". Still, seeing a bouncer-like bald burly man abusing a young woman (never sexually) presents such a stereotypical image that I can't recommend Martyrs to anyone save those who really want to see it.",Martyrs
69,lareval,Disturbing and unforgettable,8,28 August 2021,"This is one of those movies that stay with you long after watching it. Dark, gory, complex and disturbing. It's a twisted entertainment with guts and bravura.",Martyrs
70,t_atzmueller,"It wishes to be more than the sum of its parts but, in the end, remains only over-rated and pretentious.",5,3 May 2015,"I was not particularly fond of this film. Or perhaps I should say, wasn't all too impressed. Don't get me wrong. Occasionally I do enjoy watching the harder, if not hardest, variations of Horror-flicks. In other words, I don't mind blood and gore, have seen the most extreme of films that the market has to offer and if it comes to the subject of Torture-Porn, well, as long as they are only movies, I have no problems with the genre. My complaint about ""Martyrs"" comes from another corner.First of all, the director and his film isn't able to built any tension up whatsoever. How could he, when the story is so utterly predictable? I'm not going to detail the whole storyline, this has been done already by many another writer, but let's view the structure of the story as such. The first half is pretty much a variation of the Home-Invasion-sub genre, made so popular by the Exploitation-films of the 70's. Lucie, having been abducted and tortured by some cult during her childhood, later identifies her former tormentors and wipes them (and their innocent children) out with a shotgun. This is done bloody, but rather quickly, if not to say routine-style. Her best friend (and, this being filmed after ""Haute Tension), supposed lesbian lover Anna, a young Arab girl, aids Lucie at disposing the bodies. But Lucie is still tormented by her memories and inner demons, which come to her in the form of a ghostly corpse, that seems to have climbed straight out of a ""Ring""-movie. Much time is spent in the families home-turned-slaughterhouse, where Lucie battles her inner demons and the corpses of the slain family are endlessly dragged from one spot to another. Lucie succumbs to her demon, killing herself by slitting her throat. Anna discovers, the Lucie was not mad at all and that the house is indeed the dwelling of a torture-cult. Of course Anna becomes the next victim of said cult, but one objective: to create a ""martyr"" (literally somebody who ""witnesses"") by torturing her to death.Let's compare ""Martyrs"" to the other notable films of this genre: ""Saw"" (whether you like the series or not), with it's intricate twists and torture-devices, ""Hostel"", working as an extension of the 80's slasher-flicks, albeit more gruesome in it's execution or ""A Serbian Film"", perhaps so far the toughest to watch, yet having a distinct message regarding Yugoslavia and what people went through during the civil-war. ""Martyrs"" wishes to go another direction. Here the director would like to have us believe, that there's a deeper philosophical meaning behind the mayhem. Pseudo-intellectuals will be quick to pull out names like Georges Bataille from a certain orifice (or shall we say ""L'Anus Solaire""?) or quote some other syphilitic coffeehouse philosopher that they value. It's an old ailment all too common in highly stylized French cinema. The French intellectual elite is often accused of enjoying to hear themselves talk a lot, all the while actually saying very little. In regard to horror-flicks, this is nowhere as true as in ""Martyrs"".As to what differentiates a ""torture-porn""-flick from your common horror-, gore- or splatter.flick? Primarily the unrelenting, harrowing and realistic violence. Here too ""Martyrs"" lacks behind above mentioned films. Sure, the slaying of a family including kids is violent and messy, but nothing that we haven't already seen in 70's exploitation-films. Sure, the skinning of the protagonist at the end of the film is pretty graphic (although the act itself takes place off-screen), but that too has already been seen elsewhere, at times even more graphic. The rest of the torture of Anna consists of her being chained to a chair, being slapped around until her face becomes a living haematoma and being forced, again and again, to eat some sort of Quakers oats from a tin plate (sure a matter of taste, but if I'd be given the option, I'd opt for the skinning instead). Definitely tough on the average viewer, but again we're talking about the confines of a genre.The final scene raises an interesting question, which has opened debates among the viewers, but that can't turn a mediocre film into a masterpiece either. Essentially, that is what ""Martyrs"" remains in the end: an average torture-porn-flick, handsomely filmed but filled to the brim with its own hype. One further word of warning: The film is best watched in it's original form (French) with subtitles if need be. The English dubbing, as is often the case, is atrocious (and probably the reason why most of these films, be it ""Ring"" or ""Martyrs"" are often enough copied and rebooted as American films, which generally should be avoided likewise).5/10",Martyrs
71,frankblack-79961,French people are quite disturbing.,3,7 August 2019,I agree with the other reviews that rate this movie as little more than torture. Very similar to High Tension but less story.

72,TheExpatriate700,"Intelligent, If Grotesque, Horror Film",7,16 March 2010,"Martyrs is a brutal, compelling film with gruesome violence and a thought provoking story. The film revolves around a survivor of brutal child abuse who seeks revenge against those who tormented her, only to find out that she faces far greater enemies...The film goes far deeper than most horror movies, and not just in terms of its violence. It gives far greater consideration to the traumatic psychological impact of violence, while also looking at the religious and intellectual implications of suffering. It will have you thinking about the ideas contained in its script for as long, if not longer, than you think about its brutality.Furthermore, the script takes care not to fall into a predictable genre plot, shifting its focus at several points in order to throw the viewer off guard.This is not a film for everyone. Many will find the brutality and make up effects grotesque, if not downright vomit-inducing. Even hardcore horror fans will find something that will make them want to turn their eyes. However, the intelligence and quality of this film raises it above the traditional torture porn gross-out scenario, making it a worthwhile view.",Martyrs

74,rooee,Hardly worth witnessing,3,20 February 2013,"Martyrs starts from the perspective of Lucie (Mylene Jampanoi), a child escaping torturous captivity. We next see her in young adulthood, butchering a wealthy middle-class family. Stalked by an embodied figment of her early trauma, Lucie calls upon her girlfriend Anna (Morjana Alaoui) to protect her and help clean up her mess. The focus then shifts to Anna, who will unveil dark secrets hidden within the house. It crashes along on one of those screenplays that seems made up as it goes - not in terms of tone, which is consistently visceral and humourless, but in terms of characters and events.This is one of my few forays into the so-called ""New French Extremity"" movement, which has been pushing boundaries of what it's possible for an audience to endure for some years now. In the same way that a certain section of cineastes will test their patience against Bela Tarr, and then emerge with a weird pride but with no apparent insight, I'm sure there are those who would argue that the relentless cruelty, amateurish filmmaking, and dismal absence of moral argument on show in Pascal Laugier's film belies some deeper meaning that I just ""don't get"". But shouldn't it at least be shocking, disturbing, haunting, or harrowing? Surely it shouldn't be this boring.The problem with torture porn is that it has all the hallmarks of horror whilst breaking the cardinal rule: tell don't show (itself a reversal of one of the oldest assumptions in the history of the visual medium). If we're given money shot after money shot then there's no need for the building of tension (Hitchcock's favourite masochistic act), or for tickling the audience's primal fears through the power of suggestion, or for manipulating the expectations of the breathless observer. It's not simply that we become numbed to the violence (an area ripe for exploration, albeit not in this film), but that the images themselves turn bland. The suspension of disbelief becomes impossible under such conditions because there's nothing left for us to do with our imagination. So we disengage.In terms of positives, I would argue that the film is marginally less tedious than The Human Centipede, and more competently made than the eye-bleedingly shoddy Baise Moi (also attributed to the ""Extremity"" movement). And there is an epilogue which almost provides some semblance of a context for what has occurred - more of this may have redeemed the film. Perhaps Laugier might have explored the psychological motivations for Mademoiselle's (Catherine Begin) predilection with the life-death transition: Is it an overwhelming death anxiety that means she needs to see what life looks like on the cusp? Does the need stem from an envious compulsion to ruin youth and beauty? The possibilities come too late and too sketchily to register. If only the film had spent as much time telling as it did showing.",Martyrs
75,cat_ranchero,Very gory and quite controversial...,7,4 June 2012,"A film that starts out as a revenge thriller soon turns into something very much darker. It's well made though with some nice touches, particularly (I found) with the use of music.Now some have dismissed this film as 'torture porn', but I felt it was much better than that. Yes, there are scenes of torture, both physical and psychological and don't think for one minute I condone this behaviour, but an explanation is given for it and this is all brought together nicely by the rather interesting ending. I feel it's a film that will stay with me for some time. The plot does seem to be two stories patched together using the character of Lucie as the link, and yes, there are problems with that. However, I did find the film quite compelling although there is an awful lot of gore and some extreme violence on screen. For those that can take it then I can definitely recommend this one Otherwise, give it a wide berth.My score: 6.7/10IMDb Score: 7.0/10 (based on 25,123 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: NO DATA: (Based on 0 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 52/100 (based on 27 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 70/100 'Liked it' (based on 9,443 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Martyrs
76,jhpstrydom,"Good horror movie, not sure if I can recommend it though.",7,14 September 2009,"First off, I'm a horror fan and I enjoy a good horror film when it comes my way, but to tell you the truth, when I saw MARTYRS for the first time I wasn't sure what to think, the film had all the makings of a good horror film, gore, violence and the kind of cinematography that I've only seen in french horror films so far, but the first question that rolled through my head after seeing this thing was, what kind of drugs was the writer doing when he came up with this film? He either needs to stop or share his stash with other aspiring horror filmmakers and writers.This was a good horror film nonetheless, it is one of the few films where every twist to the story is unbelievable and shocking at the same time, although unlike previous french films like HIGH TENSION, FRONTIER(S) and INSIDE, this film stays more true to the dramatic aspect and the character story making it appear almost less violent than the other films I mentioned.Even though I am a horror fan, I'm not even sure if I can recommend this film to other horror fans, sure there's a healthy supply of gore, violence and torture but the overall film is so strange and yet disturbing, I'm not sure how horror fans that are used to films like SAW & HOSTEL and of course the other french films I mentioned will react to this, because this film is neither, and you'd be wasting time running comparisons because like I said this film is neither, the best way for someone to know if they will like this film is for everyone to go see it for themselves.",Martyrs

Martyrs, the torture porn defining the subgenre severely with a discharge of gore, sadism and nudity, expressed almost always in scenes of torture and mutilation.How much pain can a person endure? And what lies after the touch of death? French extreme film in all its glory, Martyrs offers us a psychological nightmare like no other. The movie starts out relatively customary but halfway throughout the film it turns into more than just entertainment violence. It makes the viewer think about the meaninglessness in violence and about the underlying causes of man's evil actions.

However, where Martyrs succeeds in its original horror take, it falls a bit flat in the filler portions of the film. But, it bounces back to full throttle in the final 10 minutes giving you an image you will never forget. Just don't go into this film with your kids or thinking it's going to be a blood splatter fest, it's far too clever to give off cheap thrills like that. Whilst Martyrs is by no means perfect, it is original, disturbing and a good film to watch. Hard to watch at times, both due to boring filled I time and it's intense disturbing factor, Martyrs will no doubt keep you thinking about it for a long time after the film.",Martyrs
80,Jacques98,How can we still get home?,10,1 May 2009,"Lore: Two scared little girls, desperate, trying to find their way back home after being lost. Literature: The concept of catharsis; the emotional scarring of the observer. Artistry: Expression, according to aesthetic principles, of what is beautiful. Then, somehow . . .Reality: Genuine emotion. Realistic events. Something so far removed from a fictional environment, it strikes you on a level beyond something happening on a screen, and feels as if it's a memory. An experience.Of all the qualities of perfection in storytelling that Martyrs has, it's that last quality that sets it apart from the crowd. While hundreds, maybe thousands, of films before it reached a level of art house perfection in both storytelling and aesthetic, I can count the films that achieve both those AND are still a genuine portrayal of reality on one hand.The story of Martyrs, point blank, is the most original horror stories in decades. In the second opening sequence alone, you're hit over the head with so much original plotting, it will throw you into a state of disbelief. I won't ruin the opening twist, but I will say this. I'm someone who sits in a movie and literally counts the number of clichés, because I'm so bored of the predictable story. I watch over 800 movies a year, read over 250 books a year, write negative reviews on nearly everything I just mentioned, and simply put: I have never once in my life seen the unpredictable directions the Martyrs plot takes. Things that would be major plot twists in any other movie are just scene transitions here, because the story is so unpredictable and original.Taking that last paragraph further, I'd like to also add this. The reason the Martyrs story is as original as it is, is because it's fully grounded in reality. It doesn't play off literary clichés (also called literary ""rules""). The story follows the same narrative that real life would. The characters do the same things real people would. There is no beginning, middle, and an end. There is no defended good-bad conflict. There is no foreshadowing, no doomsday atmosphere, no perfectly contrasted shock value. Martyrs is too real and too honest to form-fit to the clichéd storytelling methods they teach in middle school. And that is why it's so emotionally powerful.But as pretentious as all this may sound, it's not. Martyrs is one of the few movies where they could literally not cut out of a minute of runtime without affecting the story. The pacing is fast, and something interesting happens every minute of that pace. I'm personally sick of the recent outbreak of slow-burn ""boring = good"" horror movies, because, while they sometimes are good, they seem to be the only thing anyone makes anymore. With the exception of Saw and Inside, I can't remember a recent horror movie's pacing being this satisfyingly relentless. While I'd be hard pressed to call this movie ""entertaining"" in the traditional sense, it never once lost my interest, even for a few seconds, yet it retained more intelligence and quality than any slow-burn film I've ever seen.The on-screen gore, contrary to anything you've heard, is minimal. If you're a squeamish middle-aged woman with a background in a violent home, then, yes, this will be unbearable to watch. But if you're just an average seasoned horror fan, I doubt you'll even notice the gore level. I'm shocked to see so many horror sites being so squeamish as to say this is actually a gory film. It isn't. The on-screen gore never once reaches the level of the average Saw film, not even close. And, honestly, the brutality isn't anything to brag to your friends about, either. I see reviews saying this is harder to watch than Inside, and that's purely ludicrous. Inside has to be one of the absolute bloodiest movies of all time; Martyrs just has a couple spurts of it here and there. But that isn't criticism in any way. Martyrs doesn't need to be gory to have the emotional impact that it does. It shows true black-and-white desperation to a degree no film before it has ever accomplished, and I find that more significant than bloodshed when telling this story.Some people complain about the second half of the film, and I can somewhat understand why. When I first finished Martyrs, at 3am two days ago, I couldn't contemplate what I had just seen. My initial reaction was the entire movie was absolute stupid, because the ending went in a direction I wasn't expecting. As you can see by my positive score, 48 hours and a second viewing later, I've given enough thought into the ending to fully grasp the intelligence behind it.*SPOILERS* The film is not saying that humans can see the ""other world"" through extensive pain. It's simply saying that there are a group of people, the cult portrayed in the film, that believe that. The last line of dialogue—""keep doubting""—heavily implies that Anna saw nothing on the ""other side"", and that her suffering, and the cult's purpose, was utterly meaningless. *END SPOILERS* When viewing the ending this way, it's far from cheesy or pseudo-intellectual.Martyrs redefines what the horror genre, and cinema in general, can accomplish. It goes beyond literary rules and shows honest reality at its most menacing. It's a far cry from the unrealistic ""persevere, try your best, and you'll reach your goals"" message that we all tell our kids, but never really believe ourselves. It shows strong people who, despite their absolute greatest efforts, became victims. And then goes even further, with a truly original story. What all of this amounts to is an emotional journey that some people, such as myself, and hopefully you, will never forget. What more is there to ask for from cinema?10/10",Martyrs
81,Darkjak007,Transcendence,7,24 October 2021,"A young girl named Lucie Jurin, escapes from group of people who had imprisoned and tortured her more then a year.

While it's very brutal and unnerving it also has a very serious depiction psychological trauma and mental health. While Anna herself you really don't know all that much about her. Lucie is the real drive of the movie, you feel the trauma that she's suffer. It made perfectly clear that this is not a stable women, she so driven by her fear and revenge you don't know what she might do so it's suspenseful. The other things that occur in the film it does someone adds sort of a real world feeling to it as if you can somewhat believe this can happen. Though with these good things some of these decisions made in the film are rather questionable like after they find the ones responsible, they don't choose to leave they stay in this house with these bodies for like two days. They try to give a reason why but it still makes no sense whatsoever. And later on in the movie another supplier is introduced to some I may not really make much sense I feel that they could've just went for what they were probably had originally going but it does offer something else possibly bigger.",Martyrs
82,dschmeding,Whats wrong with the French??,7,15 August 2008,"It seems like every year you get a new french movie that the horror community talks anxious about mainly because of its boundary breaking shocks. After last years direct hit to the head ""A l'interior"" and the to me rather weak ""Frontieres"" this year its ""Martyrs"" which is supposed to raise the bar another bit and i start to wonder what makes the french go that berserk and over the top lately.Forsure ""Martyrs"" is different and delivers some memorable scenes punched in your memory, so it sure is another sign of Euro-Horror taking the top. The movie starts of with a child fleeing its prison and running frightened from years of abuse into freedom. Lucie is picked up, her prison is found but she doesn't talk about what happened and her torturers are never found. This is where the first part of the movie starts which is kind of divided into sub-plots. Lucie is shown growing up in a foster home, making friends with Anna, another foster child. Lucie doesn't talk to anyone about what happened, she is haunted by fears, sees demons and only seems to connect to Anna. The second part is a harsh time jump to 15 Years later. A seemingly happy family is having a Saturday breakfast the door rings and Lucie takes them out with a shotgun. She has identified her torturers from a newspaper photo and came for revenge and closure, When cleaning up the mess with Anna Lucie sees a demon like girl following her through the house and cutting her with a knife. After some creepy ghost scares it turns out its just her imagination of girl she left behind when fleeing as a child. Anna doesn't seem to believe all the story Lucie told her because we soon see the cuttings are self inflicted and only Lucie sees the girl as a manifestation of her schizophrenia which ends in her finally slicing her own throat. Part Three begins where Anna is left alone in the house with her dead friend not sure what happened and how to handle the situation. By a pretty stupid turn of events she finds a secret door to an underground dungeon and it soon becomes evident that Lucies depictions of her torture were true. Anna searches through the dungeons and soon finds the girl Lucie left behind shackled and blindfolded. She tries to help her and remove the blindfold which is bolted to her head but the girl like Lucie soon tries to kill herself. Part Four and the finale begins, so there is some majors spoilers ahead... The girl runs wild through the house and is suddenly shot by a group of strangers who reveal the story: Asick religious group believes that a suffering person can see beyond death in their final stage of martyrdom and reveal the secrets to life and death. Now Anna relives what Lucie suffered and is brought to the dungeon. From here on a seemingly endless part shows her being fed, being beaten, having her hair shaved and all this in an endless repetition until she breaks apart. This is not gory, rather unpleasant in its repetitive inhumanity. To make a long story short... Anna falls apart, talking to her dead friend Julie who tells her to give herself up to stop the suffering and when she does the final stage awaits in which Anna is skinned until she finally enters Martyrdom depicted as a trip hallucinogenic ""light at the end of the tunnel"" sequence. She whispers her experience into the old lady's ear and the sick cult soon gathers to witness its Martyr and the old ladies testimony. Unfortunately we never hear it, but can rather imagine when the old lady puts a gun in her mouth. The End.I am very ambivalent with this movie... It is a nice mixture of a drama (especially the childhood part and Lucies suicide) with classic horror/ghost scare and shock elements and big load of ""torture porn"" thrown in at the end blended in with some religious and metaphysical hints. Anna becomes a kind of Jesus Christ and the image of a skinned girl looking to heaven sure is a logical step in depicting a person in total suffering equal to the crucifixion and to my understanding equally sick just visually more direct. The four parts are all told in a very different style ... its like drama, ghost-horror, a little dungeon exploring and darkness, some superficial explaining, torture and some more drama. Martyrs sure is an interesting movie but it has some pretty stretched passage. If people leave the cinema its because they can't take another five minutes of seeing a girl beaten either because its unsettling or just plain idiotic and voyeuristic. I sure get the meaning in showing Anna fall apart but I think this and the skinning which is not even shown is what people are shocked about. The interweaving of the movie parts was kind of forced which put me off. Why the hell do they stay in the house, how could the children of the family not know about a high tech torture dungeon under their living room (or did they?), why does Anna find the dungeon and go in there on her own and if the cult is so eager to find the answer why is there just one girl although the dungeon looks like an industrial complex and what about that cult anyway?!Its hard to compare the movie to anything else. Most comparisons are about the movies being all french, seeking for new boundaries and the main characters being girls. But they are all different and where ""A l'interior"" mixes Thriller- and Splatter-Elements ""Martyrs"" rather mixes Horror- and Drama-Elements... maybe the tear squeezing mixing with horror scares is what shocks people. Strange thing is... to me the scenes of Lucie fleeing as a child was one of the most shocking and I even knew them from the trailer.",Martyrs
83,Mr_Censored,"Love it or hate it, you won't soon forget it.",7,21 September 2009,"If the past few years have taught us anything, it's that you can never underestimate the French when it comes to delivering top-notch horror movies. Like ""High Tension"" and ""Inside"" before it, ""Martyrs"" is the latest film to be subjected to a wealth of internet hype and to gain significant notoriety in the states, especially for a foreign film. But as director Pascal Laugier states in his introduction on the DVD, the film was merely an experiment in cinema and subsequently will evoke a reaction in any viewer, whether it's a positive or a negative one.That's pretty much the story of ""Martyrs,"" a tricky film that is part revenge, part cerebral thriller. While it lacks the visceral punch of other films it's been compared to, the film is perhaps one of the most ambitious in recent years. In his film, Laugier shows many influences ranging from the works of Stanley Kubrick to even ""Hellraiser"" (a film which the director was briefly attached to remake recently), but integrates them all into a film that is unmistakably his own. Blatantly going out of his way to avoid typical film clichés and over-done visual-effects, Laugier's film presents itself as bluntly and realistically as possible. The way the film is shot is very matter-of-fact, showing the extreme violence exactly as it is. The lack of stylization is a style all its own, giving the film its own unmistakable and dreadful atmosphere. All of this is driven home with intense performances from its two leads – Morjana Alaoui and Mylene Jampanoi -- who go a long way to invoke sympathy in the audience and establish a very human factor that is important to the film's credibility, especially when it reaches ridiculous heights in the third act.Where ""Martyrs"" is heavy on the violence and dread, its problems stem from its severe lack of focus. The film shifts gears very sharply in its final act, and the build-up that precedes it is nearly destroyed. The very visceral first two-thirds of the film seem to have been forsaken for an ending that will leave many scratching their heads, wondering what kind of film they just saw. The ending itself is bold and will incite conversation long after the credits have rolled, but doesn't really fit with the tone of the rest of the movie. To put it simply, ""Martyrs"" is two movies in one, and unfortunately, its final act doesn't do the film justice. Having said that, however, ""Martyrs"" is still a bold and very unique experience in film, one that any horror fan (or anyone in general) should see for themselves in order to develop their own opinion. This is truly one film that will be interpreted differently by everyone, and in spite of its obvious flaws, won't soon be forgotten.",Martyrs
84,RockPortReview,"The pinnacle of perverse, bloody fun!",9,27 January 2011,"Martyrs 6/28/2010""Martyrs"" is the final film in my reviews of the new French horror wave. All four of these films were extremely thoughtful and well made. Nothing exemplifies this more than ""Martyrs"". This film could be accurately described as art house existential horror. Written and directed by Pascual Laugier, his film goes the distance when it comes to creativity and graphic brutality. Dealing mostly with the psychological effects of torture and what lies beyond human suffering.The film opens with a disheveled young girl running from a warehouse. This is Lucie she has endured quite a lot while being held captive by a group of unknown people. She is sent to an orphanage and obviously has some severe psychological and physical trauma. She eventually becomes friends with Anna, a girl her age. The film flash forwards 15 years to your basic family of four having breakfast and conversation when there is a knock at the door. The father goes to answer it and finds and hooded stranger with a shotgun. This person coldly and brutally massacres the whole family. The stranger is Lucie, she feels that the parents of this family were responsible for the torture she endured as a child. She calls Anna who comes right over to deal with the mess. Anna has always taken care of and felt sorry for what happen to Lucie and little by little has gotten in over her head in helping her. Lucie has been fighting her inner demons for years and this get kind of confusing as Laugier actually creates a woman like creature that continues to attack her. Upon first viewing it's hard to tell what the hell to make of her. Despite Anna's efforts Lucie commits suicide. Anna further investigates the house and finds a hidden passage way to an underground facility that is the headquarters to a secret society whose mission it is to contact the other side, to find out what lies beyond death. Certain people, mainly young women are chosen to be martyrs. These people are systematically tortured and psychologically broken till they reach a certain point where they transcend the pain and suffering to enter into a new consciousness.Anna is captured whiles snooping around the place and is subjected to the same torture that Lucie endured. After Anna has been broken it is time for the next stage. Are you ready for this? She is taken into another room and skinned alive, except for her face. She doesn't scream or seem to feel any pain, she has transcended. She survives this procedure and whispers into the ear of the older women who seems to head this society. The Madam calls a meeting to share the news of what she has heard. If you want to know the rest watch the movie, sucka!This film definitely ""transcends"" your basic horror movie and goes places we have rarely been. This secret society is composed of rich elderly white people. I guess they want to know what to expect. Sadly, there is an American remake in the works and no matter what they do; it could never come close to matching the stunning effect of this film.",Martyrs

I actually stopped it because it lost my interest half way, and then started it again the next day. This movie is brutal and gross and attempts to have some sort of substance and meaning to it but to me it seems stupid and like it is really just a flimsy cover up for what the film really is, which is just a torture film. Very poorly done and it is only getting such good reviews because there are tons of people who are fans of gore and gore alone and don't even need a good story surrounding it.

Some parts of the movie, however, were a little boring and could have been replaced by making the plot more complicated by adding more characters or more options for the woman, who was held hostage, really the whole time it seemed like she is hopeless and there is no way she can escape. People who love gore/abuse will enjoy this, especially the ending. I would not advise people who are sensitive to violence watching this, since this movie took it to an extreme level.",Martyrs
88,lagriff05,"This is truly horrible, terrible and atrocious beyond words. The worst.",1,27 June 2009,"This is probably the worst thing I've ever seen. I meanreally? OK, fine, you put out a movie that is gratuitously violent and highly disturbing, but that's really all it is; not much real horror at all, besides the slight horror I felt when I looked at the time of the movie and saw that I still had a half hour left.Half the time this isn't even really gross so much as just impossibly annoying and unpleasant. So what, we get an hour of crap with this psychotic lesbian named Lucie tormenting her caring, nurturing friend, who is quite visibly torn between her loyalty and the fact that, I don't know, Lucie just murdered a whole house of people (!!!!...how stupid do you have to be to even think about this, seriously; DITCH HER NOW AND RUN FOR YOUR LIFE), then another half hour of the poor innocent best friend girl locked in a basement being beaten, force-fed and finally f*cking skinned alive, before an uninspired and uncreative ending that left me feeling empty and impartial to any of the characters or meanings that were attempted to be conveyed here. I guess the best part of the movie is the first part, because it is genuinely pretty suspenseful and tense, but it drags on for waaaay too long and loses whatever suspense it was building up to, replacing it instead withwell, annoyance at the Lucie character, really.The rest is just dung. Can anyone explain how that family went so long without the kids finding out about the huge underground torture chamber their parents had in the basement? Surely there must have been at least one day where one of them was home sick from school and must have gotten the gist that something was awry. That's a plot hole that needs tending to immediately.The religious and Nazi implications here, as vague and off-kilter as they may be, are disturbing and highly objectionable, and bring down any enjoyment one could ever derive from this mediocre piece of crap. Not only do they shave the girl's head in the third act during her torture, they also bury the bodies of the dead unceremoniously in a giant hole...gee, does that sound familiar at all to you?...It's really one thing to watch a movie about a teenage girl holding a rapist and pedophile hostage and threatening to castrate him, and it's one thing to watch a movie where a psychotic, rejected lesbian wreaks havoc on her unsuspecting lover's family with a chainsaw, but a movie like thisit goes too far, to the point where it doesn't matter. It's like this movie had to have a neon light over its head flashing LOOK AT ME, I'M SICK AND TWISTED. You know, as if the director didn't have any ideas of his own, so he had to resort to the most stock and clichéd offensive things in the book. The other stuff is there for a reason, for some purpose that is general and unbiased, but this doesn't work. It inspires nothing in the viewer but the question of whether or not he or she should really be watching the movie, thus depriving and desensitizing said viewer of the ultimate ""horror"" at the ending - not a very good ploy.And let's talk about meanings, here, too, why not? This movie is supposedly deep and meaningful, but really it's just retarded. The ending sucks, completely contrived and hollow. Ooh, let's be all philosophical and spiritual, that justifies the hour and a half of ridiculous torture pornography, terrible directing and The Unborn-rejected ghost scenes we stuck in there before! I also really love how they call this movie Martyrs, because a martyr was always a poor, screaming, skinny French girl who was forced to be where she was, rather than choosing it, right?God, this sucks; just forget this trash ever existed. It isn't scary, it isn't meaningful and it isn't compelling even one bit. No disgust, no horror, just a quiet, disapproving shake of the head and a move of the hand towards the remote to turn it off. It doesn't inspire horror or disgust, it just inspires anger and annoyance, and if that's what this director wanted to do (offend), then he succeeded: I hate this movie, I hate the director, I hate the studio that produced it, I hate anyone who would find pleasure in watching it.

92,quinimdb,Martyrs,8,17 October 2016,"The reason I watched ""Martyrs"" was because I saw it described as an ""existential nightmare"" on Reddit. I wish I could take credit for that description because that just about perfectly sums up this film.This film begins with someone literally escaping their torture and ends with someone metaphorically escaping their torture. The film revolves around Lucie, a victim of torture dealing with depression and guilt since she didn't save one person as she was escaping, and Anna, Lucie's caretaker of sorts and a caring, selfless mother figure for pretty much everyone she sees that is suffering, probably since she was never given that motherly care that she gives to others. After brief introductions to these characters, we are shown a happy family on a regular morning, but we don't yet know what they're significance is to this story.Suddenly, they are murdered. Yeah. It's shocking and truly horrifying, especially after we have just gotten to know this family. Even the kids are killed. Then the murderer is unveiled to be Lucie. The parents of the family are apparently her torturers, yet Lucie seems to feel genuine guilt about what she'd done. She is pursued by her symbolic demons, which she expected to go away after her revenge. The jumpscares during these scenes are one of my only major flaws with the film because they are completely ineffective. Regardless, it serves as gruesome and terrifying symbolic imagery. Anna arrives at the house, and she attempts to save one almost dead victim of Lucie, but Lucie hears her, and this sets her off. She kills the barely surviving woman for good, then nearly kills Anna, then kills herself. This alone is an absolute nightmare for Anna since she wasn't able to help her in the end, no matter what she did, but she is confronted with this nightmare once again when she discovers an underground laboratory of sorts that contains a woman whose skin is scratched and falling off, but still alive. Anna realizes she can't save this woman no matter what she does since her problem is internal, but tries anyway. But to no avail.A bullet wound is suddenly placed in that woman's skull. People that seem to be some sort of government task force come and trap Anna in a torture chamber like the one she found the woman in, and she is tortured. But why? Well, this organization wants to create martyrs; they want to subject human beings to unimaginable, seemingly unsurvivable physical torture until they transcend what was once physical and human and go somewhere different entirely. The torture scenes are brutally realistic and hard to watch, and with every passing minute, she seems more and more helpless. No one can help her and she can't help herself. The two possible results are that the torture becomes a part of Anna, driven by fear and a need to die, or she lets go of herself entirely, to where torture doesn't bother her because she is no longer attached to her body. Still, the only thing she can do is let the torture be inflicted upon her. Eventually, Anna let's go of herself, which was her only escape. She goes into a state of martyrdom, she becomes a witness to what is beyond life. She whispers this to the head of the organization, and they plan to hold a meeting to reveal her description of what is after death.The end is incredibly ambiguous, and I'm still trying to figure out what it means. The woman who heard this description, the head of the company, has a conversation with another large figure holding the meeting. She asks if he has ever tried to imagine what is after death. He says no. She says ""Keep doubting"", and shoots herself. What this probably means is that the afterlife is unbelievably horrible, and she doesn't want anyone to know the truth, because then the rest of life will seem as meaningless as it is to her now. She wants them to keep doubting that there is another world because nothingness would be better than what it is. Therefore, Anne's torture was pointless, and life only ever results in pain, with no one to help and nowhere to go. The ending could also mean that the afterlife was so amazing that she wanted to get there now, and she didn't want anyone else to know because she was selfish and careless about others. This means that no matter how much pain and torture humans are put through, even if there is one completely selfless soul, due to the inherent selfishness of the rest of mankind, her suffering is for nothing, and we will never know about the afterlife. I think the former sounds a bit more plausible, but either way this is a pure existential nightmare.",Martyrs

She has to leave behind another girl and becomes haunted by the vision of that girl. Fifteen years later, Lucie sees a newspaper photo of the couple who tortured her. She goes to their house and kills the entire family. She calls her best friend Anna to come and help her. Anna gets there and has doubts as to whether this was the right family. Lucie kills herself.After Lucie dies, Anna discovers a hidden section of the house. And she discovers the girl Lucie left behind all those years ago. And the girl is still alive, but so badly tortured, she is beyond real help.Cult members arrive and kill the tortured girl. They take Anna and then subject her to the same tortures that Lucie and the other girl suffered from. Mostly, it's scenes of this man beating her very badly. And she's chained up a lot. It gets really nasty. There is no fun watching this. It's very much like torture scenes from Hostel.Finally, they skin Anna alive and she has what they think is a divine vision, which is what they were after. She tells the head of the cult the vision. We never hear what Anna says. The head of the cult commits suicide. End of movie.It sucked. First of all, this is not a real horror film. It's a whole other genre. It is torture porn no matter what fanboyz keep claiming. There's a big difference between a horror film that has scary monsters and such that we have fun with, and something like this which just goes to extremes and shows violence just to really show a lot of violence.I really don't like this new trend in films. And the French seem to be running with it now. If you like regular horror movies, I don't think you will like this movie.

98,imagiking,Martyrs: Inspires Intelligent Thought,9,23 January 2010,"Owing primarily to the contemporary Hollywood paradigm, any film which demonstrates a particularly large quantity of bloodshed is automatically branded with that most unsavoury of appellations: ""torture porn"". Martyrs, Pascal Laugier's 2008 French horror film, is no stranger to this label, its brutality immediately motivating its critics to set it among the ranks of these films largely dismissed as tasteless, tactless, and tawdry satiations of modern audiences' violent voyeurism. Martyrs opens on a young girl frantically fleeing a large, apparently disused, industrial complex. Her body is bruised and scarred, her face swollen and beaten, her clothes—what little she is wearing—streaked with blood. She looks around her, seemingly as ignorant of what is going on as we are. It is precisely this ignorance that much of Martyrs' effect relies so heavily upon, the disarming feeling of insecurity and unease engendered by its unprecedented narrative progression the result of our utter confusion at the events unfolding before us.Many have condemned the substantially graphic violence which populates Martyrs as an indulgence in the aforementioned subgenre, suggesting the violence and bloodshed therein to be employed simply in an effort to shock, horrify, and encourage a visceral reaction. Whilst it is inarguably valid that these scenes present gore and body horror in an astoundingly frank, upfront, and forthwith manner, it is important to note that these are not the sources of the film's horror. Are they scary? Certainly, but as is a sudden noise in your ear. To scare someone is a remarkably easy task, but to truly terrify, haunt, harrow, and horrify: that is an achievement, and one which Martyrs manages with a disquieting regularity. The images may be frightening, especially to those of particularly weak stomachs, but what remains in the mind is not the violence, rather the ideas behind it; the film's themes are what commit it to memory and regularly return it to the forefront of one's attentions. Our extraordinary capability for cruelty as a race; the desperate and despicable lengths to which we go in our search for answers, for purpose, and for meaning; the effects of suffering upon the human psyche: these are the concepts behind the carnage, the meaning behind the mayhem. What sets Martyrs apart from, and indeed above, the so-called ""torture porn"" is that it is, inherently, about something. Rather than pandering to the bloodthirsty voyeurs who have made the Saw and Hostel franchises so commercially successful, it inspires intelligent thought on the subjects of pain, fear, and horror itself. It is said that true horror cinema transcends, and by Martyrs' conclusion it is difficult not to be moved in a perplexing manner. That such hideous violence can create something emotional and beautiful is almost contradictory, and yet there is a thematic effulgence to the film, a lingering sensation of elation and enlightenment achieved through this astonishing depravity.Martyrs may employ body horror and bloody gore to elicit minor scares, but the lasting harrowing effect the film purveys is down to the themes and ideas which back it up. While ""torture porn"" is exactly what that phrase implies—cheap and crass exploitation intended to create a reaction; surface scares masking the vacuous nothing beneath—Martyrs is so much more—intelligent and interesting filmmaking intended to create thought, emotion, and achieve the feeling of transcendence which seems so rare in modern horror cinema.",Martyrs

100,MattBirk,One of the Most Intense Horror Movies out There!,9,17 March 2016,"One of the most extreme and controversial horror movies out there, Martyrs is extremely graphic, but also extremely unique and not without a purpose. The first half of the film is very different from the second half of the film, but both of them together create a vivid experience. The first half of the movie shoves gore and violence down our mouths without a solid reason, it may seem extremely excessive, but once we learn of the true natural of the film, everything seems justifiable. The violence shown in the first half of the movie is more bloody and in your face at the beginning of the movie, but the violence in the second half is more harrowing and raw, which leaves a greater impact. It's subtle changes like this from the first half of the movie to the second half that makes the movie brilliant. The whole time watching the brutality of the events unfolding in the beginning forces you to wonder what the hell happened to her as a child. What possible reason could force someone to cause this sort of rampage?That's the brilliance of Martyrs, it keeps you wondering the entire run time, just when one door closes, a new door opens (literally). Even though the movie is very extreme and brutal, you can never take your eyes off the screen because the story unfolds in a very unpredictable manner that you never know what is going to happen next. And as for the notorious ending, it's one of the best aspects of the movie, the final minutes leaves you with a powerful, thought provoking conclusion. Sure to keep horror fans talking for ages, Martyrs ends on a very cryptic, yet satisfying note. Probably not most people's taste, this is a movie that warps the horror genre and pushes the envelope.",Martyrs
101,sinnerofcinema,"almost banned in France due to it's haunting brutality, This is the kind of film nightmares are made of",10,19 October 2008,"Making its Stateside debut, Pascal Laugier's ""Martyrs"" was the grand finale to a spectacular constellation of fine horror films. ""Martyrs"" however, is not like a ""SAW"" or ""HOSTEL"" in which there are creative forms of torture served for your viewing pleasure, this film has an art house feel to it that leads into the bowels of depravity. It's demonstrates how evil man can be for the share pleasure of scientific research. It reminded me of a brochure that I received depicting the horrors of how animals are slaughtered for human consumption. If that is a brochure you'd rather not digest before dinner, ""Martyrs"" is the type of film you may not want to view on a full stomach. Brilliantly executed in ways better described only as experimental, Pascal Laugier takes us to the end of the tunnel, the last stop, to a place where there is no longer any separation between humans and animals, predators or prey, it' a place so dark, you will no longer have to imagine for now it has been recorded on celluloid. All the ""SAW"" or ""HOSTEL"" or any other torture porn created to date has nothing on ""Martyrs"". Why? Because they French know their cinema business like no other. They leave nothing up to the imagination and nothing is too taboo for them whereas here in America, filmmakers tend to like to draw certain lines when it comes to making horror films for shock value. ""Martyrs"" is one of the few crossover films that could play at a horror film festival, as well as a intellectually artsy festival or a gay & lesbian festival alike. It covers the gamut in storytelling and that is what makes this film so powerful and so inherently haunting ,it will carve many putrid memories in your phsyque long after viewing. I would not recommend this film to folks with weak stomachs.",Martyrs

Why can't it be like the dubbed version of ""Cold Fish"" and have English spaghetti voiceovers? This will be double duty reading and reviewing this at the same time.Listening to too much Queen, some cry baby runs from a factory singing, ""I want to break Free"" in French.Okay you got my attention now, movie. We're at the back of the Silver Shamrock factory given a walk through tour of where Marge Guttman was taken.Not making much sense, an escapee of the mask factory named Lucile, is in an orphanage and takes a bloodbath in superficial self-inflicted wounds.So far, not so good.It's just another Ring, or Curse of Ring Asian child demon tormenting twits story.I spoke too soon - BOOM YER! ""Thriller: They Call Her One Eye"" shows up at a family's front door and greets the father with a good morning buckshot. Did this family subscribe to murder? Talk about rent a killer. 2 down and reloading. Is that Justin Bieber? Well he just copped it. Sister to go. This chick sure knows how to handle a 12-Gauge. That's 4-nil without explanation.Movies turned silly again - there's some mysterious ""Lord of the Rings"" Gollum creature running around with a cutthroat doing a number on One Eye.I'm not gonna pretend I'm following this movie as it lost me when they discontinued with the kid's in the orphanage storyline.Movie's trying to be too sophisticated and stylish. It's complicating itself and confusing the viewer. And is it too much to ask to hold the camera still?I'm fast forwarding all this self mutilation ""Fight Club"" Gollum business as it's stupid and over the top as was the mallet attack on the half dead mother.What did Slipknot say, ""Cut your own throat and keep walking?""
What now - Marylin Manson in his ""Mechanical Animals"" phase is found in an underground maze and pulled out into the light and takes a blood bath. Or is it the nun from ""The Conjuring?"" Does this movie make any sense?How much more of this?Manson's blown to bits by secret frog men. The old lady from Poltergeist shows up excited about lessons in torture. (She later blows her brains out for no reason.) Another girl's kept in a basement and tortured worse than Buffalo Bills punishment.Is there any point to this?Why make a movie like this - it'll plant ideas in the minds of the disturbed and twisted, if it hasn't already.Just hurry up and end already.Well that's just pointless and stupid, and a waste of time.If your idea was to offend, movie, then you succeeded.This is like a 3-in-1 movie. There's abduction and torture then revenge. The silly Asian inspired Gollum creature. Then the dark path twist at the end with the torture and Hellraiser business. I think they tried to be too clever for their own good and somehow tried to intertwine the Manson character as being the Gollum character but confused themselves in the process.I'll give it 1 point for the shotgun scene at the start.This movie's unhealthy.

107,manicman84,a cleverly provocative horror movie that only strengthens the position of France in this field,8,25 March 2010,"At first glance, Pascal Laugier's movie seems to be a revenge story dealing with a woman attempting at killing the people who kidnapped and tormented her as a child in order to get rid of an imaginary demon that is chasing her till that time. However, the movie alters as quickly as it is starting to focus on her female friend who experiences all the atrocities her best friend commits in the name of peace and quiet. The second half of the movie is twisted in the sickest way possible when... (no I won't reveal the main turn) Martyrs is one of the sickest and most disturbing movies I have seen, but its numbing violence is not used only to shock, but also to provide a fascinating insight into the people's voyeuristic nature. Moreover, it tries to explain the tragic events taking place in the film in a painfully rational manner. Given this, Martyrs is a slickly executed, effective movie with amazingly intense gory first half (containing some amazing scenes) and slow, devastating second one. It is certainly not for the squeamish, but I guarantee that those who dare to try it out will not regret. This is a cleverly provocative horror movie that only strengthens the position of France in this field.",Martyrs
108,eonbluedan-1,Intense and provocative,9,1 January 2011,"In the period of American rehashes of foreign cinema, and what is now referred to as ""torture-porn"", ala 'Hostel' and the like, you'd be forgiven for missing some of the genuine efforts out there; films that make a real attempt to truly leave a lasting impression, and cause reaction. 'Martyrs', second film by Pascal Laugier, runs alongside 'Irreversible' as part of this ""new wave horror"" that seems to be spearheaded by France. I can honestly say this one is hard to review in any way other than the abstract, as it is one whose impact on the audience relies pretty heavily on the fact they are going in cold, knowing little to nothing about what to expect. As a basic synopsis - a young girl escapes what is clearly some awful ordeal and goes into a non-descript young girls' home. We move quickly to fifteen years later, where we find her visiting vengeance upon the people she believes responsible for what she was put through. Vague, tedious and predictable? Perhaps....but to say any more would be starting to destroy the experience of this film. Predictable this film is not; just as you think you have ""Martyrs' categorised, it will defy your expectations and shift conventions. It is a genre piece, but one of the most erratic you are likely to put yourself through. This film wrings you pretty dry, its unconventional style making sure you're never settled into too comfortable a groove, its extremity of violence being some of the most fierce you could witness.What I found most note-worthy about this film, though, was the clear intention of Laugier; he knows exactly what he wants to do, where he wants to take you, and what he wants to say, and it shows with each passing scene. Believe me, if you find the likes of 'Hostel' and 'Saw' to be works of extreme revulsion, do NOT watch this! The irony is, you might not notice. Unlike the aforementioned American works, ""Martyrs"" is about something; the extremity resonates on what becomes a genuinely emotional level as the film moves forward, the intense violence neither being lingered on, nor skipped over, simply being used as a device and part of the film's architecture, and to achieve something greater than the likes of this ""torture-porn"" we have come to know would dare try This isn't a film you watch with your buddies over pizza, this film hurts!This is aided hugely by the performances of the leads, they are superb! It is easy to overlook how tough it could be for an actor to get to an emotional place, and hold it there for an extended period of time, and it's only on reflection you realise how real these women made this experience. It's impressive, if horrible!Is it a perfect film? No, I think it has its small flaws; its revelation and the title's relevance will bring about just as many moans of dissatisfaction as gasps of realised brilliance. But I applaud it for going to the extreme and being courageous in its motive. It will cause conversation, each person will walk away from it feeling differently, but never unaffected, and that's why I recommend this filmA film that doesn't just aim to churn your stomach, but is ultimately more concerned with churning your mind and emotions.....and one that is actually ABOUT something....even if you don't end up appreciating its point.",Martyrs
109,SpannersGerm669,Journey into the dark world of pain and suffering.,10,8 July 2012,"Lucy and Ana, who grew up together in an orphanage, are on a path of vengeance. When Lucy was little, she was kidnapped and tortured for unknown reasons and since then hasn't been the same person. She suffers from severe psychological problems and because the police never caught the culprits, she has never been able to have closure on the matter. Many years pass and Lucy is convinced that she has found the people responsible, and in a terrifying act of violence, sets off a chain of events that neither Lucy or Ana will ever forget.As part of the French fab four, Martyrs is the most notorious as the hardest to watch. I can totally agree with this statement. While it isn't as good a film as Inside, I believe this one had much more impact, because its tale of violence which is heartbreaking but at the same time, serves a strong purpose. Many people have dismissed this as torture porn, but I believe its missing the point. This film is both very psychological and graphically discomforting. Just when you think you know which direction the movie is headed, it turns a 180 degree turn and throws the viewer completely off guard. It is about the levels of pain a human can take. Its about someones limits of how much they can sustain before breaking down. Its a tale of will power, the desire to keep struggling through. So many subtle layers, that are constantly overlooked, due to the High Impact violence and sheer cruelty. It is a work of genius, but be very very careful.

You're not supposed to have a good time watching this movie and i know that's the point but the whole thing just felt so shallow and pointless to me.
The second half of the movie is pretty much a woman being beaten to within an inch of her life and tortured. No story, interesting dialogue or characters just a girl being punched, kicked and mutilated over and over again.
All of this torture is for zero payoff, the ending is one of the dumbest things i've ever seen and it actually made me mad watching it.

113,jery-tillotson-1,Never again!,1,23 May 2010,"SPOILERS ALERT AHEAD! I'm an addict of scary movies although I did have to avert my eyes through much of the Hostel gore films.With Martyrs, it was like watching what a ""snuff"" film must look like: a relentless flow of images where a young girl is sadistically tortured over every part of her body.Why they used a human being for the victim is baffling, since the actress often looked like a bag of bones. She lay still as the bald headed sadist kicked her viciously from her head to her feet, then he used his fists to punch her endlessly.And then, with the end near, the sadist unlocks her manacles and carries her to the operating room where he moves around briskly, putting on surgical attire, and then he proceeds to skin her alive. You see all this in glistening detail. From a young girl, she resembles a slab of raw beef you'd find in a butcher's shop. But the sadist still hasn't finished. Putting her carved up body on a hospital bed, he and other members of the sadistic cult demand to know what she sees in her fast approaching death. When she fails to answer right away, she's slapped and tortured more until she croaks out her words. Could Nazi Death Camp masters have conjured up a more thrilling entertainment? At the end, all the sadists involved in the demise of the victim go along on their merry way--hopefully to find another victim.Writer-director Pascal Laughier created this extreme exercise in sadistic torture and in interviews seems quite proud of what he created. His movie is so intense that the chief make-up man, Benoit Lestang, slashed his throat and died a week after the film was finished.",Martyrs

115,Mike Astill,Hideous and compelling,8,30 September 2010,"While not afraid of subtitles, I rarely dip into French cinema for the simple reason that people speaking French tends to lull me off to sleep. No such worries here, I think I even started to forget to blink as this hideously compelling film unfolded.A young girl named Lucie (Jampanoi) escapes from unspeakable imprisonment and torture. Traumatised beyond measure, she's brought up in an orphanage, where she is taken under the wing of Anna (Alaoui), who cares for her with simple and heart-wrenching humanity. Fifteen years later, a helpless Anna cannot control the tragic and brutal events as Lucie takes her revenge on the couple who may or may not have been her tormentors so long ago.A few years back, I really enjoyed Hostel. It was a lurid ride of bible-black comedy horror. It did, however, let loose a torrent of lookey-likeys that have become both tedious and sinister. Martyrs director (Laugier) considers this an 'anti-hostel', and by the film's end you can see what he means.If you survive the squirmy gore and horror of the seemingly conventional (but technically excellent) first act, you find the film drags you deeper and deeper into the grotesque, but ultimately for a purpose. Whether that purpose justifies the movie or not depends on your resistance to high concept pretension, or the level of empathy you share with Anna, a character who surely belongs in any list of cinema's most tragic heroines.",Martyrs

In fact, this film fits nicely into the category of films that has been emerging in past decades called ""body horror."" IN truth, it's one of the best. A movie that visits pain or disfigurement on its characters and makes you think, ""I hope that never happens to me,"" qualifies as body horror. You can feel, in a sense, what is happening to the protagonist as if it were happening to you.Yes, we definitely can categorize this as body horror. Through a good part of the beginning in fact, I began to think it was just that but I was so mistaken. There are ""people vs. the establishment"" themes going on here. There is an empathetic look at suffering, especially of women. There is a supernatural aspect that for me was never really ""fleshed out"" but certainly got me thinking. I have a word to the wise if you haven't yet seen this film and plan to: Go in knowing there is a story but let all your expectations fall away. This film attacks victimization and vengeance in an all new way I can guarantee exists nowhere else in horror.Something should be said about this original film: it's following remake is nothing like it and should only be seen after the original.

117,pcsarkar,Forced Martyrs?,1,17 February 2012,"*** Warning.. May contain spoilers*** I will admit there that many-a-time, high-brow French films (and French cuisine) go over the top of my head. So I won't pretend that I fully understood this work of 'art'. But still, I found very many premises quite unclear. Here goes.. So a girl escapes from (an orphanage?) somewhere, and runs screaming down the streets. There is an investigation, but the girl never tells anything (why?), so the perpetrators are never brought to justice. The girl grows up in the company of another girl (similarly abused? Not clear).. having frequent nightmares. (And a lesbian relationship? Not clear).Fast-forward fifteen years to the present. The first girl, Lucie, now grown-up, but still quite hysterical, breaks into the home of a family and shoots everyone dead. Apparently this family (including the kids? Not clear), had been torturing her so many years ago. The second girl, Anna, helps the first girl in getting rid of the bodies (why? Not clear).. but something grotesque appears (was it a vision? Not clear), and there is mayhem all around. Instead of running for their lives, both girls choose to stick around in the house of horror, and even sleep there. Hmmm..Apparently, there is a group (Govt-funded? Not clear), which believes that extreme torture can result in near-death experience. (Extreme pain can make a person delirious.. can his hallucinations be called near-death experiences? Not clear). So this group has a facility to torture girls (why girls only? Not clear). Lucie commits suicide and Anna is captured by the coven.. and taken through the same steps of torture and humiliation. Apparently, she has a near-death experience.. murmurs something and goes into coma. The group is elated.. till the ring leader 'Madam' commits suicide. Hmmm..So this paper-thin plot is an excuse for prolonged torture sequences, murders, bloodshed, nudity and mayhem. Since the law-enforcing agencies are nowhere in the picture, it may be assumed that it was a Govt-funded exercise. But for what? To hear the rantings of a person under extreme stress, torture, starvation and humiliation? Surely then, the WW-II Nazi camps inmates would have had much better near-death experiences, than these two poor creatures, forced to become 'martyrs' for no good reason.

Not exactly ground breaking, for instance the objects of our gaze are scantily clad nubile young women having bad things done to them(there is an attempted justification for this later on - it is like much else of the plot infantile). The film has a strange structure - the first part is Haute Tension without the tension; this is done reasonably well but is full of clichés (do bodies really fly yards through the air when being hit by bullets? The law of conservation of momentum holds the answer and it ain't whats on view here), still it will appeal to fans of the colour red who don't mind watching killers cry endlessly (interminably is much the more accurate word here), rather than laugh demoniacally or eat their victims. At half way there is a sudden change of pace and tone, all of a sudden the maker is attempting to make Hellraiser as it would have been made by the great Danish filmmaker Dreyer. Of course it lacks the kinky fun of Hellraiser to say nothing of the spiritual charge of the great Dane. In fact the second part comes out much closer to Hostel than any of it's lofty aims; Hostel, that is, without the cheap laughs or bad acting, which all means it is a lot less fun than Hostel but takes itself so seriously that the immature will think it a work of art. BTW the level of gore in this movie was not as high as Inside - still the best of recent French horror.",Martyrs

And for sheer pointless and stupid brutality, 'Funny Games' (though that was even stupider and more pointless). That's where the positives end though.A warning. This is half blood and cutting, half unrelenting repetitive brutality (so repetitive it stops being shocking and, like anything else, degenerates to tedium) always against women and for the most unconvincing of reasons. For most of the film no reason at all is given for what is happening and when the explanation finally does come, the logic offered could only convince the seriously disturbed. A lot of people get off on sadism. It's hard to avoid the suspicion that this may have been part of someone's motivation in making this.If it had made sense, if there'd been just one idea in there, then just maybe - it certainly isn't badly made or acted and it gets 3 for that. But it makes no sense at all, there are no ideas, and it's full of utter nonsense. 'Look at the EYES!' says the crazy-woman over and over. (It seems this is the only measure that their lunatic scheme is 'working'.) But her hired thug then promptly beats those eyes closed with his fists - do they really not know of a torture method other than hitting someone in the face? A point comes when the great revelation is apparently achieved (about what I won't say for fear of spoilers). Will this be something momentous or at least clever or original? Of course not, and just think for a minute about how crazy-woman reacts to this and the whole stupid illogic of this mess is brought into perfect focus.If you're a sadist and/or enjoy watching women being cut or beaten, you may enjoy parts of this.

123,Aditya_Gokhale,A pointless exercise in gore..,4,1 September 2009,"I began watching director Pascal Laugier's ""Martyrs"" with much anticipation after what I'd read about it so far. Lots was said about how this film belonged to a ""new era"" of French horror films. The film began on an extremely promising note with a scene of a physically abused and tortured little girl escaping to freedom. The next few minutes that followed sort of spoke about the dark shape of things to come. I continued watching, spellbound as the movie unfolded. I watched in shock and amazement as the blood spilled, the flesh ripped, bodies piled up, and surprises were delivered at breakneck speed. Add to that a claustrophobic atmosphere and some brilliant acting from the two lead performers Mylène Jampanoï and Morjana Alaoui. Nothing much is said or explained during this time...and there is almost no explanation or meaning to the bizarre, gory drama that unfolds. This, IMHO was an added advantage that made this one hell of a movie-watching experience.The run-time ticked to about 58 minutes and then something happened....The proceedings were turned over their head and a full-fledged explanation was finally given about the why, what, how, etc.! ..And I must confess that I was extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with this sudden change of events. It all seemed so lame and absurd to me that I almost thought that this wasn't really it! There'd got to be more!The entire last half hour then endlessly rambled on..and believe it or not, I was still waiting for a satisfying, convincing finish to the film..hoping for more. I wasn't particularly expecting a happy ending or all-neatly-wrapped-up-package...but at least something that wouldn't be entirely futile! But I never experienced that satisfaction as the ending credits rolled!The whole thing turned out to be just a pointless exercise in gore; ""torture porn"" if you must, with an absolutely weak central plot! A huge let-down!I am not averse to watching excessive gore on screen. I have enjoyed other movies in the genre earlier, but most of them had plots with lots of ""meat"" to go along with all the bloodbath.Watch ""Martyrs"" for a well-directed, brilliant first hour and for the terrific performances of the two lead performers. But do not expect an equally great story, and perhaps you won't be as disappointed.Rating: 4/10",Martyrs

If you are looking for a horror/thriller violent unpredictable movie , you should give it a try.I am giving this movie a 9/10 for its intensity.....

127,brentn,This is psychological horror!,8,15 February 2021,Martyrs seems like a daunting and well paced creep fest but it is so much more once the credits role. I was utterly shocked by what this movie ended up being and to go in depth would actually ruin it. There are several jump scares that push the movie along but it's the way the violence is presented. This movie is meant to torment the audience as much as the films lead characters. the story is well written and nothing is held back. It is refreshing and disturbing because it's so genuinely original and never sugar coated. If you're finally tired of the cliched slasher or sinister ghost stories then watch this.,Martyrs
128,valbrazon,Not as good as they told,4,17 August 2012,"""Martyrs"" is probably not what i expected as a horror film, i think the first hour was good but what about the second hour? We only see someone being tortured up to her death. It's about an organization who want to know what do you see before die. I really don't understand why so many peoples liked this film. For bloody movies fans, you doesn't will be sad, there are much. I liked the first hour because of it's concept of vengeance. But the scene where Lucie is attacked by a kind of monster is a bit stupid. I think the director wanted to make us think about the human violence but i didn't understand the film like that. For me it was just a bloody movie without story.",Martyrs

The scenes of torture sit in my head and replay themselves over and over again. But the movie sits in my head which in itself is an accomplishment. Most movies would be completely forgotten 10 minutes after leaving the cinema. This is one of those movies that is hard to forget. So on a personal level I would give it a five out of 10, did not enjoy but was able to watch to the end. Looking at the movie from a distance I can see a well defined plot, a good twist and as said before a memorable movie. So on these technicalities I would give it a 7 out of 10. I'm going to have to compromise and give it a 6, Or maybe a 7, Or a 6.ARRG",Martyrs

132,Onderhond,More like Noé and Grandrieux,9,11 November 2008,"French horror has been pushing the boundaries for some time now. First there was Haute Tension, then A l'Intérieur and newest in line is Martyrs, hyped up to take it all a little further. And it did, it definitely did. It's just that it doesn't belong in the same list as the films mentioned before. Martyrs goes way beyond.Those expecting another fun, bloody, gory, insane horror flick can just up and leave, because Martyrs isn't like that. While it borrows the horror from films like A l'Intérieur and Haute Tension, the tone and effect of the film is much closer to Irréversible or better yet, Grandrieux's La Vie Nouvelle.All these films belong to the French Extreme wave, a rather broad line of films of different backgrounds and themes, but all bearing an unrelentless level of extremity. And Martyrs stands proudly at the top of that list, even though Laugier himself seems a little hesitant to claim all credits for his film.Martyrs starts off like you'd expect a bleak, raw and pitch black horror flick to start off. Only minutes into the film, bodies start flying and guts is spilled royally. Strangely though, there's no joy, limbs are flying enjoyment to be found. The presentation is cold, the characters are emotionally wrangled, the tension is harsh. Lucie, the main characters and victim of a year long torture plan, evokes the sympathy of the viewer and plays it out incredibly well.The first half of the film keeps balancing on borderline horror, keeping its crude and dark exterior, but never crossing any boundaries. A Grudge-like ghost in added to the film, but Laugier stays close to the drama and never allows the film to become a mere horror flick. Things take a turn for the worse around halfway through, where the torture theme of the film is given even more power as Anna, Lucie's guardian, discovers the truth about the torture/kidnap story of the past.From that moment on, the film becomes really uncomfortable to watch and crosses over to the realm of Noé and Grandrieux. We are witness of cold and painful torture scenes, driven to very unpleasant extremes nearing the end. The film follows the methods of the people who torture, which are based on repetition and endurance, making it all the harder to sit through.In a rather surprising move, this film was released in theaters in Belgium by one of the most prestigious labels here, the reason for that is laid bare in the second half of the film. Rather that simply serve a story of horror and torture, Laugier digs deeper into the human mind. The idea behind Martyrs is not futile nor easily forgotten. There's a whole point to the film, elevating is above all its reference points (Saw and Hostel - sadly enough).Martyrs is in a whole different league and is everything a film like Funny Games should have been. A definite assault to the gut, extremely graphic and to the point, without ever flinching or resolving to silly tricks to get a point across. It's a film only a director with love for the genre could make (remember that Mr Haneke, after two pointless attempts) and Laugier doesn't let down.Visually, the film is well shot, though nothing out of the ordinary. The make-up on the other hand deserves some praise, same as the leading ladies who play their parts with conviction and depth (at one point Anna even shows a creepy resemblance to Falconetti in Jeanne d'Arc) . Essential to the film and certainly not an easy task.Don't watch Martyrs to get a little horror kick, or to indulge in silly gorefests. This film will not deliver the fun thrills of regular horror movies, on the contrary. It's a bleak, depressive but all the more impressive look in the darker depths of the human condition, it will leave you cringing in your seat and it will make you want to look away. And it does so without ever numbing you down.One of the most impressive films I've seen this year, a definite favorite and one that'll receive my further support through a DVD purchase, though I have no idea when or if I'll watch it again. Laugier uses every bit of skill he has to make Martyrs as painful as possible, and reaches further than any other has. A very solid 4.5*/5.0*, though no recommendation from my side. Definitely not a film for everyone.",Martyrs
133,varun_120,Very tough movie to watch,8,8 November 2014,"This has to be the most disturbing film I've seen. It's disturbing, difficult to watch, mind you, but not disgusting as some movies that are disguised as scary films. The very idea, the gist & treatment of the film scares you. The film starts with a girl named Lucie being tortured, and then she manages to escape the house where she was kept. Then we are shown a family that seems normal and likable. But Lucie returns with her childhood friend Anna. And we come to know that the couple was the one who help Lucie captive & tortured her. Lucie takes her revenge, but her delusions become stronger. But we come to know there's much more than that.The film is more about Anna though. than Lucie. You'll know it when you see the film. The violence seems very much real, and is unlike the lame Hollywood flicks. This is why I like French films, they're raw and seem genuine unlike Hollywood films.This film is definitely not for everyone. People who are averse to watching violent films, stay away from the film. The rest enjoy this french masterpiece. Ending is superb, its like nothing you've ever seen.",Martyrs

I think to say it made me despise the director is an understatement. Also, I read that he dismissed Haneke's Funny Games as ""sh*t"", which makes me even more certain that he's an idiot. Worthless, futile, punishing and sadistic. I guess the only thing this film IS good for is providing an example of how to make a sadistic, punishing, worthless, etc, etc film which rides on graphic and emotionally disturbing imagery and dressing it up as something profound, which it isn't.

136,afrodome,The Most Disheartening Movie of All Time.,9,17 July 2017,"Martyrs is undoubtedly a well-made film. The acting is poignant, honest, and grounded and sucks you right into the screen. The practical effects and use of sound are visceral and nail- biting. Through the lens we see a world that is very refined, elegant, affluent, modern, enriched in the most modern luxuries. The best way I would describe this world is an ice cold chandelier. That's not to say that it's an emotionally nihilistic world similar to what we see in The Shining, because the film is shown through the eyes of the 2 female leads Anna and Lucie: highly sensitive, emotional human beings that you invest in from the beginning, and that is what makes this film so challenging to sit through.Every act of violence is displayed and shown is horrendously ugly. If you are looking for a campy trip to the splatterhouse like Peter Jackson's Dead Alive, then turn away from Martyrs and run in the other direction. It hurts to watch, and it's sad to watch, it makes you sick. If The Exorcist is the scariest movie of all time, then this is the most disheartening movie of all time. I do know that Pascal is not a sadist because he would not be filming from this approach, which I had to learn over time. A sadist's version of the same film would not emotionally involve you, but because it is seen mostly through the eyes of Anna, a very caring and selfless young woman, every moment of battery is seen as it should be: cruel, ugly and terrible. Like Funny Games, It's not a film I would dare watch again; I would honestly rather get a hard elbow jab in the stomach as it would be more palatable. I don't recommend anybody to see it as I would advise anyone else to do. Even planting the idea of talking about it to people that are unaware of Martyrs is kind of irresponsible in my opinion. The one plus side is that if you were saddened, revolted, etc. then you have a heart, and that's a terrific quality.",Martyrs
137,loogenhausen,"Flay that chick and watch her pray, baby...",8,30 November 2011,"This is the best horror film I've seen since ""Inside"". Coincidentally, they're both French which proves my now long-standing point that the French have handily surpassed Hollywood and are even eclipsing Asia in making effective and shocking horror films. Frontiers, Them, Calvaire, Sheitan and everything but the ending of High Tension have all been infinitely better than most other offerings from around the world. I'd even put Irreversible in there. Can you think of one horror film made in America that truly shocked you that wasn't a remake or adaptation? The only truly great American horror film from last year was Midnight Meat Train and that was buried immediately upon release. That shows you just how much studio executives care about giving you good horror. Nowadays, Americans have a choice between the latest Saw rehash and a god awful Asian horror remake. Don't get me wrong, I love Hollywood as much as the next knucklehead, but they are clearly giving up on trumpeting original and/or daring horror films. That brings me to Martyrs. I can understand why some (probably most) people who see this film will predictably lump it in with torture porn/gorno flicks with a dismissive meh. Their entitled to their opinion (wrong as it is) nonetheless. What Martyrs does is force you to endure 90-odd minutes of sheer brutality in order to hammer home a philosophical point. Now some might scoff at that notion, but I was so knocked back by the effectiveness of this ""point"" that I couldn't believe that I saw what I just saw. I've heard there's a deal already in the works for an American remake. There's no way on earth that this film could ever exist in Hollywood and you owe it to yourself to see this jaw-dropping sucker punch of a shocker. If the last line of dialogue doesn't smack you right in the face, then you're not someone I'd want to hang out with...",Martyrs
138,montferrato,"Suffering, Healing and Transcendence",7,15 February 2021,"This is a good movie. It does display, however, a significant level of explicit violence. Therefore, viewers not familiar with this type of movie should be cautious.
This movie tells the dark and sad emotional journey of a couple of dysfunctional, depressed, abused, neurotic girls.
Both of them are subjected to extreme violence and torture.
It turns out that the torturers were a cult of old and wealthy researchers, interested in knowing if there is life after death.
They hoped to inflict "" martyrdom"" on the girls by the systemic use of torture. Here, the meaning of martyrdom is quite limited.
Through this torture, they hope that some of the girls can actually attain an ecstasy experience, a near death experience that can be reliable, able to shed light about the ultimate mysteries of life.
One of the girls achieves this ecstasy state, and tells her experience to the cult leader before finally dying.
Shortly after that, the cult leader shots herself and avoids revealing the content of the conversation.
Many people out there have completely misunderstood the movie.
As i see it, it is just about life. Life is suffering till you let go. When you accept suffering and pain as it is, it stops. Nothing can hurt you when you live in full acceptance. This is the meaning of "" letting go"". So, the film is a metaphor about suffering. It also touches important topics such as fear, abuse, depression, obsession, and the nature of reality. The movie also touches the topic of transcendence, and the need for it that everybody has. The ending is ambiguous, and it is open for interpretation. In my view, the girl actually tells the cult leader that there is something in the afterlife. She is so affected and emotional about this that she commits suicide, as she is now not fearful of what might be "" in the other side"". However, it can also be interpreted in a more nihilistic way: "" There is nothing, life is unworthy, i kill myself"". You must see and decide.
The thing about the simplified meaning of martyr that the movie proposes is however not of my liking. It is a bit empty.
Anyway, you must see this movie, and have your own opinion. Hope i helped. Thanks.",Martyrs
139,AnusPresley,"Almost great, spoiled by too much gloss",6,1 May 2011,"I have to confess, after reading the reviews here I was looking forward to seeing this and being taken somewhere I haven't been before. My overall satisfaction is partial. I love my exploitation cinema, but I go real sour real quick when that cinema tries to masquerade as art. I'm not accusing Laugier of doing this deliberately, but it certainly seems to be interpreted that way by the bulk of the reviewers here, which is unfortunate. The greatest enemy of this kind of film is high production standards. It loses punch by being impeccably made, and why vintage Italian and Japanese exploitation will always have a far longer shelf life. These movies need to look and feel cheap - the viewer needs to feel soiled, to feel a sense of guilt that this is not the type of flick they want to be caught watching. These flicks pay off when they are more like those in coin operated pornography booths - viewed in cinemas that reek of detergent and have sticky carpets. This is why movies like _Hostel_ and _Saw_ fail. Nasty and cheap are like bread and butter. The Hollywood gloss ruins everything.As noted already, this is largely a film in two parts. This first is superb, crap-your-pants terrifying and masterfully executed. The second is more in the realm of true horror - it doesn't rely on jolting you out of your seat, but more on the slow burn revulsion of the type perfected by D'Amato in _Buio Omega_ and Craven in _Last House of the Left_, and it does reach those heights. My major gripes script-wise are why did the girls hang around at the scene of such an excessively violent crime? Why was the wife digging around in a hole of industrial plumbing only to find a mouse? Why was it more important to dump the corpses into that hole rather than do something about all of the more obvious evidence? These are minor issues though - these types of films never place high priority on logic or consistency. They're not _Citizen Kane_ and their target audience is different. But the biggest gripe of all is the conclusion - a total anticlimax, like they ran out of film, ideas or both. Very disappointing.Overall it is a well made film. But it is not what I would call a ""keeper"". I very much doubt I will ever go to the trouble of seeing it again, unlike the D'Amato and Craven flicks. But it is very definitely worth seeing once. I am of the growing opinion that video killed the video nasty - the real cheap, nasty and unapologetic grit, with no redeeming features or convoluted justifications, just simply is no longer made (outside of the occasional Japanese contribution). Which is sad. I miss '70s and '80s gutter cinema. Hollywood has a lot to answer for.",Martyrs
140,Patriotlad@aol.com,Revolting And Anti-human And A Crime Against Humanity,2,2 September 2009,"Practically speaking, ""Martyrs"" has no redeeming qualities, other than the intensity which the two principal actresses invest in their agonies as they are emotionally and physically violated. Again and again.Frankly speaking, I am not one to support censorship of the cinema in any real way. However one has to ask, why was this movie ever made ?? Whatever it cost to make was wasted money, as there is not one shred of redemption packed into this horrible horror movie. The mean, bad and evil ""witch"" character kills herself at the ( almost ) end of what can only be described as the most loathsome and venal film ever lensed. If this is the epitome of French cinema because the cinematography is so good, which it is, then it is time for the French to examine themselves and seek the corruption in their own souls. It is a revolting fiction.It is anti-human in the most explicit of ways. It is without merits other than the aforementioned cinematography. It is pornography with blood and much suffering and meaningless violence. One supposes that the crew was simply happy to get their paychecks, but this disgusting film will likely leave a stain on their bank accounts forever and ever.This is a horror movie. It is a horrible movie. It is depraved with a near total indifference to any of the values that civilized people hold dear. The director, the staff, the company are all guilty of crimes against humanity and deserve the opprobrium of any and all film buffs who have even one shred of decency left in themselves.

141,suicidea,You should know what you're in for.,8,24 October 2021,"Horror fans can be categorized in two groups. The first group is the usual ""That was great, man! Like, did you see how his explodes, man! Like, cool, man!"" type of teenagers, who try to outdo each other by naming the goriest scariest whatever movie. You can safely ignore them.The second group takes horror movies as serious entertainment, and don't praise (or bash) a movie about how gory, scary or disturbing it was. I consider myself one of them.Martyrs is a perfect example of the kind of movie praised by both groups: for the wrong reasons by the first group, of course. It's a really disturbing movie, with scary imagery, but it's also a serious movie with nice structuring, not resorting to silly jump scares, and keeps its story and characters above the special effects.The movie opens with a little girl running for her life from her captors. We learn that she was tortured for years, and the people who did it are never caught. Flash forward to 15 years later, she breaks into a house and murders who appear to be a very domestic family of four.The obvious question for the first half of the movie is, were these really the people who tortured her for years? Or did she make a terrible mistake?Even if you're watching a dubbed version, anyone with half an eye can easily notice that this isn't a Hollywood movie: it doesn't hammer you with explanation after explanation with endless dialogue and monologue, there's lots of blood and gore but it's in the background: you don't get close-ups or defining shots of ""look how we did it!"" special effects.The real horror element in a Hollywood movie would be the shootings, the tortures, gore and guts. In this film, they pale behind the truly horrific thing: how casual the torturers are, how they reason and justify what they do, and go on with their daily lives.It's a well-made, nicely produced film. I'd say not for the squeamish, but like I said, the psychological horror really is the driving force here.

142,LBarlane24,I watched it (again),4,6 September 2019,"Written and directed by Pascal Laugier, Martyrs is a French (horror) film that tells the story about a young woman who was held captive and brutally tortured as a child. Her mental instability from this leads her take revenge on the people (or the person, specifically) who put her in the position she's in. Upon arriving at the house, the victim's friend, Anna, is in shock to find out that said victim has executed, not just the person responsible, but her family as well; that being her husband and two children. Anna tries talking some sense into her, but soon realizes that Lucie (the victim) is far too unstable to ease, even to herself.Having watched it a second time, this film did not piss me off as much as it did the first. But that does not mean that my opinion on it has changed either. The first act was pretty good, the second act wasn't half-bad either, the third act though ... yeah. The main problem that I had was that the whole thing felt like two (short) films spliced into one; one of them was a psychological revenge thriller, and then the other one was ... well ... let's just say it was a virtual snuff film.The tone is mildly inconstant, and the acting is, there I say, questionable at times, but the last 30-40 minutes are, in all honesty, incredibly depressing. From what I've read, Pascal Laugier ""didn't want to make the film rely on suffering, but more so on pain."" Well I'll give him this, the climax was a real pain to sit through (again).I'm making this review as fair as I possibly can.

145,druss44121-1,"Modern day ""Psycho""",6,3 May 2009,"**Some spoilers ahead**This film seems to be getting a very divided reaction. Some call it ""torture porn"" (an overused term, but do remember that porn doesn't necessarily have to relate to sex or sexual acts... a movie of people solely getting their heads chopped off would be pornographic, just it would be of violence instead of sex.) Others call it a deep masterpiece of blah blah blah. In reality, for me the film doesn't really hit either extreme. It's got some story problems and arguable ""plot holes,"" the direction is at times uneven, and it tries to break clichés while falling into others. It's also just a bit too dullingly depressing which hurts the re-watchability factor for me.One of the bigger problems I had was that the film tries to explain why the victims always have to be young women (and by young women I mean young *pretty* women), but it's not a very good explanation and modern day horror films of women being beat up by strong burly men are getting a little tiresome. Hostel, though that movie sucked beyond all belief, at least was equal opportunity in its victims. Not that political correctness matters to a film like this, but when it uses such a tired cliché like that, it, for me, takes me out of the film just a bit. It's like, oh look, I can imagine the casting session for this.However, with all this said, I think this film is still in a lot of ways a good example of a modern day ""Psycho,"" in the sense that it does a pretty good job of horrifying and shocking - which is a much harder feat today than it was in 1960.Now here's where some of the real spoilers come in.To me, the reason this movie works on a basic ""horror"" level (i.e. trying to horrify its audience through an idea rather than just pure blood and guts) is because we see someone go through intense suffering just because of someone's personal ideology - a person who, of course, is at a safe distance from the suffering (i.e. not torturing themselves physically and mentally but rather another person for an answer they seek.) It's a play on an audience's fears dealing with abusive religious or cult leaders. Look at what corrupt religious leaders have done in the past, i.e. burning people alive to send them to Jesus, crucifying ""heathens"" to save them, etc. etc.Or look at something like Jonestown, with groups of people dying for a ""cause."" Or look at the suicide bombers in the Middle-east, convinced by people standing safe and sound that they need to kill themselves to become martyrs for their cause (if bin Laden really believed in that cause why hasn't he blown himself up for martyrdom? Exactly... it's an abuse.) I see this film as one about the fear of horrible things being done for reasons that are based on faith alone - specifically religious or cult-based faith.Faith, when abused, does awful things to people. And humans sometimes justify horrible things being done to others because it satisfies their belief system...Now, why some fans of this film seem so adamant about defending the fake, evil actions of a fictional character is beyond me. A bunch of good points have been made from various sources that pretty much put big holes into Mademoiselle's idea of expecting ""martyrdom"" (i.e. witnessing the afterlife because of immense suffering) to actually reveal anything of use. God help us if anyone here thinks that what the cult does in this movie actually would be a good thing to do in real life. Of course, there's a lot of bad people out there and I'm sure they use the internet just like everyone else.So, yes, to me in a lot of ways this seemed like a 21st century ""Psycho"" in the way it built up tension, took false turns to make us think it was about one thing and not another, and ultimately ended with the face of one, tortured individual. Reaction is even similar, Psycho in its day was called both ""sensational"" and ""deep"" by different people. It was hated and loved. Not that I'm saying this film is on the level of Psycho, but it hits the same kinda nerve that Psycho did back then.Also, even though I'm so tired of terrible horror remakes and I'm sure this has a crappy one already in the works, if you were to give it to a good director like a Scorsese (he has done horror, look at Cape Fear, also a remake) you probably could have a future horror classic like Psycho. The parts that work, work very well, especially the set-up and the last 10 or 15 minutes.But at other times, this film does wallow a bit too much in the hate, and like many films - i.e. The Passion - when you have some realistic violence, it needs to all be realistic, or else it borders on becoming gratuitous and, yes, pornographic. As an example, look at the massacre on the house in the first act - people don't get blown back from shotgun blasts. I know Death Becomes Her did it to a great effect in 1992, but unless the bullets have something to grip onto they'll just tear through you. You can't have silly violence like that and then have a woman skinned alive to chilling accuracy without a little bit of the ol' WTF. Imagine watching Kill Bill's House of Blue Leaves scene followed by Saving Private Ryan's D-Day.So, I guess I'd give this a 5/10. As a horror film it does just that, it horrifies - and on a psychological level too - and that's worth something. But in my estimation it also has a lot of problems that keep it from being a true classic.",Martyrs
146,starving_college_student,Is this the direction of modern horror?,1,15 November 2010,"This is a tough one. Because this was made extremely well, and underneath it all, there is an interesting story revealed in a very interesting way. But as the story is, this is actually a 20 minute short film, filling the other 80 minutes in with torture and human suffering that doesn't push along the story. Out of principle I can't recommend this film (and gets 1 stars). This one could have been a stellar movie. But the creators have somehow misunderstood the meaning of horror. When did Horror Cinema become Horrible Cinema? Horror is about exploring the dark side of human nature, the things that scare us. Through entertainment these stories define what is good and evil, not forcing the viewer to go through every little gruesome detail that would happen if the event were really to occur, but just enough to frighten us and gross us out, so that we know that this is evil, something to be frightened of. But in films like this, there is no distinction between the good and evil, there is no statement about reality. There is only mimicking of the worst parts of reality (things like this remind me of experimentation Nazi's did) thinking its cool. IN WHAT WAY IS HUMAN SUFFERING COOL? No one should actually have to endure such a horrible experience in real life. So then why would I want to see it and all its minute details as a form of pleasure? Baffling...",Martyrs

It lives up to the hype as far as brutal torture is concerned but I seriously thought all this mean freak show had at least some sort of plot. This is not true for Martyrs, as it is a continuous and mean-spirited assault on the senses with only purpose to shock. To tell the truth I got past this kind of cinema (if we could call it that) more than 20 years ago so the shocks are not so shocking for me anymore. What's truly shocking is the high rating this got on IMDb, which unfortunately is not surprising given what is considered as ""horror"" nowadays. Martyrs is clearly not horror, just an offensive freak show labeled as horror while it is just porn with the torture and brutal gore replacing the sex.",Martyrs
148,onlythusfar,Empty,3,13 March 2013,"I watched this movie, because I enjoyed the director's ""Tall Man"". Someone reviewing that film mentioned this one, saying, that it contained social comment, as did ""Tall Man"". The first part of this movie seemed gritty and quite realistic, and I could empathize with the characters, who were abused children. The second part of the movie (it has three distinct parts) begins with a shocking scene, which I felt totally morally bankrupted the film, as the abused girl kills children, the children of her abusers. Maybe it's just me, but I have a hard time believing someone tortured as a child and still in great pain from it, would coldly murder other children. In any case, this second section is more standard ""horror movie"" fare, and I lost my empathy for the main character, as an abused child. The second main character alone survives until the third section. Here she is accosted and tortured graphically for a long period of time. At this point, as I did with ""Funny Games"", I'm asking myself, ""Why are the film-makers showing me this?"" I am not entertained by watching people suffer, unless there is some redeeming, meaningful reason for showing this. Unfortunately, I could not find one here. A gang of insane, old, rich, white people babbling some quasi-metaphysical nonsense AIN'T a reason. Crazy people will commit any manner of atrocity, but it won't make any sense and I don't need to watch it. Thank God, this director got a little more realistic for his next feature. If you want to show children being tortured, you better have a hell of a good reason for it. The last two thirds of this film just left me empty. Amazingly, I didn't even feel for the girl, who gets tortured in the last third. That's how meaningless this scene was. I saw a reason why Hanaeke was showing me pain in ""Funny Games"" (that I, as an audience member was a voyeur) and Noe's ""Irreversible"", showed me the truly sickening nature of real, out-of-control violence. I felt the violence in those films was justified. Here, I could find no justification.",Martyrs
149,eucalyptus9,The effects of stressful extremes on the right side of the brain,8,2 October 2009,"Wow. This is a full-on movie. I needed to turn it off for 10 minutes about midway and take a rest.Which is more than poor Anna could expect. I'm not a fan of gorefests - ""Feast"" was watchable because it was funny, whereas ""Feast II"" was remarkably unfunny and repulsive, while films like ""Captivity"" don't usually last more than about 20 minutes before the STOP button gets pushed.But ""Martyrs"" is a good film, with good actors and a good story. The thesis is that if a person can survive extremes of pain and deprivation, new vistas may be opened to them. It's been long-held that the right side of the brain, the imaginative, creative side, receives its flashes of insight or inspiration under extremes of stress. It's why the Jains, whose senior members live in a permanently deprived state, close to starvation, are renowned for performing significant deeds (e.g. bringing people back from the dead).It may be that there's some truth in the theory. Whatever the case, it's a topic worth exploring, and ""Martyrs"" does a pretty good job of it. While the brutality was hard to watch, the underlying theme rendered it all fascinating, unlike so many pointless torture pics that probably do untold harm to impressionable minds.An 8/10.",Martyrs

Synopsis: Two girls become affected by a cult that is obsessed with torching people until they become martyrs.
The premise of the movie is actually quite compelling and does play out in interesting ways. Though how the film makers portray the violence is what makes this movie so disturbing. Almost none of the horrific scenes are cut away from. All practical and shot in camera including: beating, shooting, stabbing, cutting, dismembering, and skinning. That last one in particular occurs at the end of the film and it is honestly worth just to see how it is shown in regards to the premise.This movie is worth a watch if you can stomach the violence. The acting is top notch. The intrigue is constant. The turns in the plot are compelling. Watch this if you consider yourself a horror fan.",Martyrs

Its pretty well made for a film in that specific genre, but thats not saying much when its competing with movies like ""The Human Centipede"" and ""Saw 3D"".Just by writing this review I'm getting another headache, the movie itself is pretty nauseating. Its not fun to watch, as a matter a fact its actually one of the hardest movies to watch, any scene in it can be painful to keep your eyes on. The acting was pretty good and all (specially french actress Mylene Jampanoi), but after a while I kept on asking myself ""What was the point in making such an awfully disturbing film?"", or maybe that was the point. If it was they've succeeded, but I have no satisfaction in watching films like these.Overall ""Martyrs"" is a disgusting film. How could anyone recommend this?

And it's about 4 years since I watched it.Just noticed that if you view reviews in chronological order another Irish contributor put in a carefully reasoned review recently.My case is simple. Until Martyrs I didn't realize there was an internal psychological line to be drawn.Because everyone's seen them, let's class Hostel / Hostel II as just below that line.You're horrified, but have a sneaking feeling that there just might be such places. Such circumstances could exist. With difficulty you move on.Martyrs, with it's revelation of the motivation for such grueling horror strikes well above that line. There are historical truths (not real, you understand, just that some people believed them in the past) in martyrdom that were considered sufficient for the elevation to sainthood. There are neurological studies that suggest similar unexpected results in extremes (IMDB doesn't recognize the word I used, swap is for the last two letters es) - mostly drug induced. You do not want to believe that such an experiment could be contrived, and worse still watched over generations for ""positive"" results.

156,BloedEnMelk,"Gut wrenching nightmare, disturbing, sad, haunting, and very impressive!",10,18 February 2011,"I am not easily shocked. I've seen a good deal of horror movies, ranging from psychological horror to slasher to torture porn. Often I watch movies which are reviewed as disturbing, but seldomly do they really disturb me. Well, Martyrs did. Totally.Martyrs gets often compared with movies like Saw and Hostel, but I would say that this is wrong. OK, they do have certain things in common, people get tortured. The difference is, although some people might not agree with me, that movies like Saw and Hostel are made for 'amusement'. They are like that heavy roller-coaster ride which, how gruesome it may be, you still somewhat enjoy.Martyrs is far from enjoyable. It's horror in a much more pure form. It bites you in the neck with cruel sharp teeth, drags you in, and it's not going to be a fun ride. Someone mentioned that this is stuff nightmares are made from. I very much agree. What makes Martyrs so different, is that it feels so very real. The movie starts out as what looks like is going to be a pure revenge movie. Young girl Lucie escapes something horrible and though you don't know what exactly happened, it is clear that she is traumatized for life. 15 years later she is back, for revenge. Her best friend Anna backs her up, even though she has her doubts about what's true and what's not. So far, so reasonably typical horror-movie plot. Though it is all already pretty intense, and focused on the emotional pain Lucie is suffering, aside from that nothing is really new there. But then, halfway the movie, everything changes. Anna is about to find out what actually happened to Lucie. And it's not really the storyline that is so original, it's more the way how it is brought to us.*MAYOR SPOILERS COMING*The torture scenes are truly gut wrenching. The torturers don't make use of all kinds of instruments, it's kept much more simple, but that for sure doesn't make it less gruesome. Over and over again we see our protagonist get beaten up. Force fed. Her hair cut off. Humiliated. Beaten up again. And again. It seems like it's going on for ever. It's heart breaking to say the least. And all this time you hope for a miracle to happen, for her to stand sane and to escape. But, that miracle stays far away, it's just not happening. And just when you think that nothing can be more cruel, she enters the 'final stage', which is so incredibly horrible that your earlier gut wrench seems like an almost pleasurable memory. *END OF SPOILERS*I will not say what happens at the end, what happens with Anna and when we get to see who are behind the 'experiment' and why. But to me, it made this movie so much more then just torture porn. It lifts it above movies like Hostel and gives you something to think about. And it makes sure that this movie will haunt you even further. This movie itself is at times pure torture to watch, But it is also, in a strange way, beautiful in all it's deep tragic sadness. It's almost darkly poetic, I would say. I was really asking myself why I kept on watching. But I just had to. And thankfully the plot makes up for the difficulties I had while sitting through the movie's second part. All in all, I was very much impressed by Martyrs. It's not a movie that I would recommend to many, if you want to have a pleasurable night with your new girlfriend (or boyfriend) on the couch with some popcorn and you hope that after the movie she/he will be in 'the mood', forget about that. But if you are in for an impressive, gut wrenching (but also still beautiful) total nightmare, then you have a true dark gem of a film.",Martyrs
157,ryshpr,Overrated.,5,28 April 2010,"Martyrs is a French horror movie that follows a woman's quest for revenge against people who kidnapped and tortured her as a child. But Martyrs isn't necessarily a revenge movie, only a small part of it in fact. Anna and Lucie, the two main characters of the movie play off each other extremely effectively. The chemistry between the two actresses can't really be disputed. The enjoyment factor of the movie, however, is questionable.Although I tend to like my movies, violent and bloody, I do like a good story to sink my teeth into alongside all the gore. Martyrs certainly delivers on this, but in my opinion it delivers far too much. Although the plot is an interesting and quite original one it isn't carried out quite as well as it could be. At times it even gets boring and plods on at a slow pace. As a guidance, I would probably say the first and last 15 minutes of the movie are by far the best, with the spaces in between filled with random body dumping, or downright strange and confusing scenes.Approach Martyrs with caution. It has a good message, but it takes a while to get there.http://ukmore.tk/",Martyrs

I have to come clean and say this before I go into detail with my review: I am immensely conflicted about if I actually enjoyed this film or not. But there is one thing I cannot deny: how memorable it truly is. There are several scenes that have just been embedded into my brain for the past week. I just can't seem to shake off how jarring it was. To call it a hard watch is an understatement. I was legitimately freaked out to the point of where I had to pause the movie, leave, and then come back. The biggest problem I have has to do with the reason behind the final scene. I understand the way the plot was trying to go and what the director was trying to portray, but I still find it hardly justifiable. Overall, I think the ending is just over-the-top. As for the rest, the acting is solid, the directing is very reputable, but the writing is very shoddy.

Definitely not for the faint hearted. Will never watch it again as this film leave's you feeling traumatised and makes you wish that you did not just see that. This movie stays with you for while after watching it. If you are a die hard horror fan, this film is creepy, disturbing and horrific.
The first half of the feel has a very creepy feeling far more than any American horror. Then the second half. HORRIFIC, it gets nasty amd I mean real nasty.

160,amazing_sincodek,"Over-hyped, but worth watching. Makes one realize the futility of film criticism.",6,22 March 2009,"I didn't think there was anything special about Martyrs. I also felt certain, while watching it, that a lot of people would love it. In my review, I will try to communicate both sides.Short version: martyrs has some great scenes and takes some unusual turns. Despite what other reviewers have said, you should go in expecting entertainment (of the darkest sort!) rather than realism/art. Regarding ""art,"" the film tries to tackle too much at once and falls on its face. Not the holy grail of horror, but it's still worth seeing.Long version: Another reviewer, in a haste to discount any similarities to Hostel, compared Martyrs to Gaspar Noe's ""Irreversible."" I think Hostel would be an acceptable comparison, actually, but Irreversible is truly more similar in a deep sense. Irreversible and Martyrs are both very stylish, brutal, and captivating. They each alternate between scenes of shocking violence and philosophical contemplation. And in the end, both films are quite a ride but a bit of an ideological mess.I will add another, idiosyncratic, comparison: Audition. Like Audition, I went into Martyrs expecting the most upsetting 90 minutes of my life, and came out wondering if I had seen the wrong film.Martyrs starts out with a very realistic tone. A really mucked-up-looking young girl escapes from some sort of terrible abuse. It is quite painful to watch her run--there's something really helpless about her. There is not entertainment in this scene; only pain. Following are a few clips from a faux-documentary about her escape, increasing the realism. Only a few minutes more, however, and the film totally turns around.At the first kill scene, the film takes a ""leap"" (pun!) from realism to romanticism. Someone gets shot, and flies through the air ~15 feet a la ""The Matrix."" Pretty cool! Concurrently with this, there's a little monster thing running around. Spooky, and symbolic! About 45 minutes in, the plot takes such a leap into the fantastic realm that I wondered if I was watching a dream sequence. I wasn't. The final act includes some hardcore torture to the tune of some sentimental indie music soundtrack--acoustic guitar and whatnot. I believe it was supposed to be sad.In summary, I didn't like the film because it was too romanticized. Where it strayed from the torture-film template, it really just kind of stumbled around. For many people, this won't be a problem. For others, a problem will simply be that the film took itself too seriously about some absurd situations.Regarding gore: Pretty gooey, I suppose, but not really. Some people get shot (in a big way, but no exploding heads). Some self-mutilation with a razor (unpleasant to watch, but the effect was pretty weak). There was one creative death which I won't spoil--worth seeing, but too ambitious for its own good and not very convincing. The most captivating makeup/effects were the aftermath of torture.

But unlike so many other movies it is not there for chock value, but rather to show the awful journey of the protagonist, from bad to worse. As strange as it may sound, it brings depth to the story and even more so to the characters. Yes, it is slightly depressing, but in all its dark cruelty there is beauty, which balances the horror. When watching it the first time, it came to a point where it was almost too much cruelty, but then the end came, and made it all worth it. So if you've got a strong stomach, and want to see a movie that will remain with you for a long time, then watch this masterpiece. And watch it through. It'll be worth it.",Martyrs
162,0maro0,Yet another pretentious horror that leaves you completely frustrated,1,23 January 2020,"It started good, it ended as disaster. First half of the movie was, in fact, quite interesting and pretty good. We start with a girl we know nothing about, with shady circumstances we know very little about. Is she heavily traumatized and mentally ill? Is she seeing ghosts? Maybe both are true? What is this story about and how it will unravel? No matter if it would be misticism or more realistic path, there was potential to this film. Everyone thinks Lucy is mentally ill and accidentally made things up? Plot twist, she did not, and also her scary hallucinations are very real! Or, better, nobody believes Lucy except her gf, they decide to investigate, but Lucy loses it and kills everyone. Oh nevermind, she was right all along, here's the torture bunker. What to do from here? POC lesbian girlfriends on their way to escape law enforcements, investigate this story and commit some more revenge. Feel free to insert your variations here, I'm sure it will be better than original.
But of course not, it goes the way it goes, with some pretentious attempt to sell itself as an art house movie. As always these films do, ugh, even with some kind of Wikipedia-like screen at the very end. Well thank you very much, martyr means witness in ancient greek? And have you maybe included, I don't know, some actual pieces of Ancient Greek culture in the film itself? Like, for this to make at least some sense? No? Ok then, maybe some Christian motives, as the notion is very important there? Or any other big narrative to connect this madness with? Also no? Well, too bad.
What was it about? Why it exists? I have no clue. I'm not completely mad at the authors for making me watch this only because it gave me some confidence about my own creative path.

163,standardbearer,Striking? Yes. Overrated? Also.,7,19 April 2009,"Contemporary french horror seems to work like this: let's rip off some already overused American horror-cliché, add some twist, some surreal, and interesting details, and make the whole this violent as hell.The story basically about a girl who accidentally gets captured by a secret society, which tortures people. Pretty much like Hostel, yes.So what about the twists? There are some, indeed. This secret society has a strict reason behind it's activity, and it's not about just feeding the perverted senses of the sadist members. I wont tell you that reason, but is shakes up the plot a bit, which is unfortunately still paper-thin. The characters are flat (though the casting is great. The child actors really resemble the adults who they supposed to grow up to be), the story insists, that there is some kind of character-development (and spirituality), but i really don't feel it. the whole ""endgame"", if i may call it that way, is a bit rushed, i just doesn't seem very believable. And since this film is not a B-movie (it is indeed very well made), and we're not in the 80's anymore, I'd like to see a bit more over-thought details in the story also. The whole movie is VERY serious from beginning to end, and this requires a more coherent, and immersing plot.What's with the original details? All the little things that makes this movie worthwhile. I like the look of the torture chamber. It's not dirty, rusty, or even old (the stereotypical look you got familiar with from all the classic horror movies or even music videos). It's high-tech, and clean. It's makes much more sense. If anyone would decide to build one, i assume he'd take time and effort to make it convenient to use. I already mentioned the casting, it's just great. Most of the effects are very well executed, so you can see everything in their gory details (there are some anatomic errors, but i guess most people wouldn't even realize them).And the violence? Whew... This movie is brutal. Over the top brutal. As in most french horrors nowadays, the violence comes from the realistic and serious approach. The gore never gets cartoony, or comic. Even when there's not that much blood, it's just so mean spirited... Others pointed out, that the movie suffers from something which i'd like to call a ""Passion of the Christ - symptom"" it is just so insanely violent, it makes you numb after awhile. Maybe, but i didn't feel that. I think the movie makers were smarter in this one, and they always managed to top each scene with an even more repulsive one. The earlier mentioned endgame is a strange exclusion, that part (though not very long), makes the movie sit down a little. All in all, Martyrs a good horror movie, even in the classic horror way, it's very tense and it often made me jump. The gore is very strong also, so gore-hounds should also be pleased by it. Just keep in mind, that it's not that kind of film you'd like to see in the middle of a fun, horror marathon. It's dark, it's serious, and very sad. Thanks for reading.",Martyrs

166,znegative,An Ecstatic Assault On My Eyes,8,18 June 2016,"Lately I've been watching a lot of foreign horror films as I've run out of American ones that are any good. I must admit I spend hours sometimes looking through online lists with names like 'Best Horror Films in the Last 10 years', and any list that contains 'Sinister' or 'The Purge', is immediately disqualified.It's unfortunate that my favorite genre mostly produces crap. For every great horror movie I've seen, there are at least 25 bad ones that I'll have to suffer through before getting to another gem. Martyrs' was a gem, although that term seems a little inappropriate some how in a film that is so ugly, and left me feeling so terrible.I have to admit, about 45-60 minutes into 'Martyrs', I was about to turn it off. I thought it was stupid, unnecessarily violent, and the plot seemed like it was going no where fast. In fact I was shocked to see there was more then fifteen minutes of the film left, which is probably why I continued on. I simply could not see where the story could go with another hour or so left and all but one of the characters dead.I am glad I stuck with it though, because that first hour or so is really just a set up for the real horror to come. The director disorients the audience into thinking this is a movie about psychotic delusions and then, you come to find out, there's some truth behind these imagined delusions, involving an incredibly off-the-wall conspiracy twist that somehow works if you just don't question it too much, because that's really not the 'point' of 'Martyrs'.The last half of the film is almost unbearable to watch. It manages to make movies like 'Hostel', 'Trouble Every Day', and the 'Saw' series, look like light heart-ed comedies. I mean really, I have a strong stomach for gore, not just in movies, but I've seen some terrible things in real life too, so believe me when I say, this movie is literally like an assault on the viewers eyes. Unlike 'Hostel', or 'Saw' though, the torture and violence is almost 'tasteful' (for lack of a better word. This movie achieved what I imagine Mel Gibson wanted to create in 'The Passion'; the viewer becomes incredibly sympathetic and moved by the protagonists struggle. And at the end, after the final insult to her body, it almost becomes beautiful. I'll admit, I even shed a tear after our hero becomes flayed, and there's that magnificent close up shot of her eye as she enters a state of ecstasy.This is a really quality film. I can't say that I enjoyed it, but if you appreciate film as an art form, and also appreciate horror films, then I definitely recommend it. It definitely goes above and beyond anything I've ever seen before in the 'torture-porn' genre-and what I mean by that, is it's actually a good movie, not just a splatter-fest.",Martyrs
167,FightOwensFight,Brutal Masterpiece,10,12 June 2009,"If you aren't aware of the brutal high art horror films that have been pumped out left and right from the genius minds of the French then you must have been living in a cave for the past two decades, especially this last one... 'Martyrs' is yet another vicious, dementedly violent masterpiece that the French can call their own, and possibly the most brutal one yet! The highly original premise starts with 2 women, one of which who has never quite recovered from being chained and tortured in a dark room for most of her childhood, who set out for revenge to the people who were responsible. Don't fret, this is not your average torture porn type movie... unlike the American films who touch similar subjects, 'Martyrs' enlightens us with a what, how, and why as the plot moves forward. After brutally murdering an entire family in their home, the girls find that the family is not the only ones responsible for the unspeakable acts forced upon Lucie as a child. Again, just to clarify... 'Martyrs' goes far beyond the violence of a typical horror film and transcends the very idea of the horror genre. Fans of horror and high art cannot go to the grave without seeing this film... those who have a weak stomach or who do not like high art cinema need to stay very far away form the film. Those in the middle need to proceed with caution, 'Martyrs' will change the way you look at life and death.",Martyrs
168,El-Kapitoshka,A beautiful death - the ultimate oxymoron of cinema,8,25 April 2016,"The start is incredible, the middle - edge of seat and the ending groundbreaking and boundary stretching.I love movies with a 'make your own mind up' kind of attitude and this film delivers on that immensely. It's about revenge, but also- just as much about other peoples beliefs. Not only is this film violent, but also clever and shouldn't be classed as an overly gratuitously violent type film either, it has meaning within a real story that makes you care and fear for the characters. I know I'm more into describing the feelings I have rather than the story line, but the feelings are just as important. We will all have our own interpretations of films like these and this was one hell of a journey.",Martyrs
169,starcraftbw88,Garbage,2,20 April 2012,"I'm a huge horror fan and while I enjoy seeing women get the living daylights beat out of them and families blown away with a shotgun, this movie was complete garbage. It gets progressively worse and it's amazing how a movie with such gore and brutality could be so boring and meaningless right up until the end. Hostel and Saw may have been more gory, but the pace of those movies were as not mind-numbingly slow and lingering. Saw was also a much more clever movie. Martyr is overly pretentious and filled with cheap rhetoric to mask its weak, shallow plot and terrible editing. Guys, just because it's a foreign film does not mean it's a good movie.",Martyrs
170,K-nightt,Normal is an ideal fiction,9,17 November 2009,"There are certainly twists in this film I did not expect to see (then again, I don't think anything could have prepared me for the 2nd half). It is brutal, cruel, sadistic, and yet very real. We hear about these kinds of things happening, yet rarely have 1st-hand experience (thank goodness for that). I guess it goes to show that, in the lack of a soundly edified social structure keeping a close eye on one's actions (or better yet, when micro-societies possess the power to recreate their own set of rules), the ideal excuse for releasing the primitive beast inside is rendered. Could we all be seeking silently for that one instance in which all repercussions are lost, and sadistic impulses redefine our very course of action? Within the context of a very well encapsulated delusion envisioned by an obviously deranged person, the breath of existence is reduced to satisfying the whims of ignorance. Now, the most important thing to resonate, no matter how utterly humiliated and physically/psychologically fragmented one becomes, the absurdity of reality will obviously take care of everyone, but one can still muster up the power to have the last laugh, as is evident in this film (without giving anything away, especially since this conclusion is highly subjective). Anyway, it is a very difficult film to endure, and I think that it allows one to see beyond their own taboos.. but then again, isn't that the primordial objective of watching movies in the first place?",Martyrs
171,maxineedwards-78784,Unforgettable,8,27 December 2019,"Say all you want about Martyrs, but it's not a movie you can wash away and write off with a cocktail and a walk afterwards. This movie lives in your bones after you've experienced it.What starts off as an above average revenge film involving a young woman who escaped a torture chamber, lived in a children's home, and decides to track down and kill the people responsible for her trauma 15 years later, turns into something totally different midway through. It's an admirable Hitchcockian twist of perspective and ends up changing everything we saw before.At it's heart, it's a film about friendship and the lengths we would go for certain friends - even those who we believe might be unhinged.If Martyrs has flaws, it's that there's a nearly 20 minute chunk of the film where it's just a time lapse montage of a character being beaten, fed nasty food, having their head shaved, and beaten again. It goes on and on and feels endless. Maybe that was the point - to make us feel as bored, hopeless, and pained as the character, but it seems like it could have been achieved in a 5 minute montage instead. It becomes tedious after awhile.",Martyrs
172,ennieday09,So creepy and disturbing that I didn't like it that much,6,8 October 2009,"I thought Martyrs had a great concept but I guess the timing of me watching this disturbing film made me not like it as much as I should have. I was expecting a normal horror film with gory scenes but did not expect what I witnessed. First of all I took a random movie off the shelf of the horror section and said, ""Oh this looks creepy lets watch it."" I didn't even know the film was in French so you already know my little knowledge of this movie. During each scene of child abuse and vicious bloodbaths, I had mixed feelings of shock and uneasiness. The intensity of this film is off the radar and there are many instances that catch you off guard. For example one scene in particular I recall is when they cut to a scene where they show a normal family having a conversation at the kitchen table and all of a sudden the doorbell rings. As the father goes to open the door, unexpectedly a young teenage girl with a shotgun blows him to bits. This was just one of many scenes that left me with my mouth hanging open and left my skin crawling.Martyrs is a VERY disturbing film psychologically because the premise of the films subject about people being tortured in order to achieve a ""Martyr"" type level, leaves the viewer dismayed. I myself can say I haven't seen a movie in a long time that deals with violence and torture in the sense that Martyrs did. I thought this was a unique film with an eerie concept but the shock level of the film was too high for my liking. If have no problem with extreme violence and torture and looking for a movie based on something you haven't seen before, check this one out. Certainly not for the faint of heart",Martyrs
173,Sandoz,Sadistic romp with tacked-on pretentious ending,3,14 February 2010,"It seems the French (like they have so many times before) have appropriated the American vogue of ""torture porn"" for horror films. Previous to Martyrs, I have seen High Tension, which I thought was manipulative, mundane crap, and Inside, which I thought was quite effective--its gore actually integral to its story rather than an embellishment. (I also happened to see Sheitan, which is so lame-brained and moronic it's not even worth considering). So, having a split of opinion with two French horror films (one I thought quite good, the other terrible), I happen across Martyrs for my deciding judgment on the current state of the French thriller...If you've noticed my rating at the top of this review, you'll already see I gave this film a "" 3 "" rating. The film is unrelentingly sadistic. And I don't just mean brutal, or extreme, because those would be euphemisms for a level of intensity that evidence professionalism, but sadistic because it seems the sole intention of the makers of this film appears to be how much brutality and sadism they can cram onto the screen and still hoodwink enough viewers to believe they are watching a story that really has a BIG message behind all this depravity so they can feel like they're exempt from complicity at actually being sadistic voyeurs.Wow, the BIG MESSAGE that excuses all this torture and brutality and sadism is that if someone experiences enough suffering, eventually they will have an epiphany and see another World or Afterlife or God or Whatever-fuzzy-ethereal-higher-state-exists-after-death is waiting for them as soon as they kick the bucket. All because of the strange ""look"" in a victim's eyes after he or she has experienced unremitting and seemingly unendurable pain. Hey, guess what, pervert-philosophers?--that beatific ""look"" is called SHOCK. I'd be staring at God too if you tortured me every day constantly for two months.It IS a valid idea, if it had just been developed further than just the tacked-on ending and Martyrs, for all it's nihilism without plausibility, IS well-crafted, so for those reasons I give it a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1/10, but maybe I'm just being rational...and MERCIFUL, which is a helluva lot more than the makers of this film are being to their audience.",Martyrs
174,imdb3-3,"Badly acted, laughable script, excuse for torture porn",1,26 March 2016,"The opening of the movie presents a very compelling promise for the film within. A girl escapes what seems to be an empty building that held her captive. The little girl Lucy is being helped at a nunnery and befriended by another girl Anna. She has a secret that she won't share except that she screams out that monsters are coming for her that only she seems to be able to see. Sounds good. But after the first scene which takes you 10 years later, the movies goes downhill from there in a big way and becomes a bad excuse for torture porn with a wicked silly reason.SPOILER AHEADSo you want to know why the Lucy shoots this family dead whom she claims to be her captors? In short, the entire town is a cult that believes that if they torture people who have a will to live that is higher than most, they will hang on to the end and share the secrets of what lies beyond death in their final moments, whispering it to the preacher. And by brutalizing people to within an inch of their lives, they are able to see ""through the cracks"" the angels and demons and afterlife details that we cannot. Martyrs on the cross have died this way, tortured to the extent that pain will allow them to stay alive and, in that state, they see the beyond. That's it.So you can guess what follows. Girl calls 911 to help her friend. But the entire town is in on this torture show so they capture her, drag her to their dungeon to commit atrocities for the pleasure of the torture porn audience repeatedly. Lucy is tortured to the point where she is about to die. Anna sticks around to be tortured and told all of what is happening because if she wasn't, the audience would think that this is just badly acted torture porn with bad dialogue straight out of bad B-movies.Anna hangs on enough to get a gun and try to save Lucy during the ceremony before her death, crucified on the cross. She tells the priests of the cult to cut Lucy down. They refuse. Lucy tries to speak something and Anna and a priest hears. The head woman of the cult demands Anna tell her what was spoken. The priest said he heard and he takes a gun and kills himself. Anna shoots the head woman, everyone runs. And in her wounded state, Anna lies down with the ""martyr"" Lucy and we assume they die together. That's it. I'm guessing what Lucy says is ""what a bunch of suckers you are for watching this whole movie."" The dialogue is pretty bad and the adult girl who plays Lucy is not convincing at all. Part of this has to be the wooden dialogue, which is at it's worst during the ""meet the cult"" part of the movie. Watch this if you must. Be prepared to fast forward to the end and be surprised when you see how poorly this is acted. Don't say you weren't warned.",Martyrs

I had a nightmare haunted by that ghost in the Martyr, and you know I don't remember the last time a movie give me any nightmare (I thought only my ex gives me nightmare). I know I shouldn't have watched this movie before going to sleep, and I watched the unrated version -.-"".there is no way I am gonna get to sleep for at least another 30 minutes, I have to push the dead girl outside of my brain with some music before I do.while I am recovering I guess I will just write this review.This movie is so disturbing. The first half of the movie made me feel really anxious. I even had to take a break watching the first half of the movie.it is disturbing not only because the gore is so realistic, but the story telling at the first half is well done. You will be wondering what is going on? did she murder innocent family? is that real? It's that kind of storytelling that made you on edge but you can't stop because you are so curious.The sound, OMG... I took break after the first girl died and the other girl heard a sound in empty house, I was like if the dead woman gonna hurt the other girl, I can't take it anymore, I need a break.and the ending, it is unpredictable. There are two key moment in the movie before the real ending that could be an ending, the first one is disturbing ending, but hey the story is still go on and you got an OK happy ending, but the story still go on... just watch yourself for the real ending.The flaw in this movie is that the 1/3 part at the end is kinda predictable, it just felt too long. But since the first half is really good i still give it 8I have watched a lot of horror movies, and most of them don't scare me at all, but this one made me feel so anxious and give me fuk**g nightmare.This is the most disturbing horror movie I ever saw, I can't recommend it enough just go watch it if you love horror movie.",Martyrs
176,Bioweapon,Worst SNUFF-horror movie ever... several flaws,1,9 December 2009,"This is, if not the worst, one of the ugliest horror movies ever made.There are several reasons to say this.First, in any suspense/horror movie tension is suppose to escalate through the film or at least be kept at a constant level. Here they show you the best during the first 30 minutes of the movie and then they go down in flames. The torture scenes from the friend of the main character didn't meant a thing to me, almost fell asleep.Second, the plot is ridiculous. Some idiot-people cult is trying to find God by torturing people and watching their faces. So, it doesn't matter whether you were Hitler in your life, if tortured painfully enough you may see God and become a martyr. Stupid concept filled with fallacies.Third, the ending is P-A-T-H-E-T-I-C. It doesn't add up to the movie, neither represents an open ending (which is they were trying to make, I guess).I guess that, after watching this one, Frontiere(s) and Eden Lake (a French-English production), french people suck fat dicks when making horror movies...",Martyrs

178,bardy9,"Not too disgusting, but brilliant nonetheless",10,24 February 2021,"They could have made this a lot more gruesome, but thankfully they didn't (Did people really throw up at this?). Instead, the concept, acting, sense of dread, cinematography etc. are allowed a space to shine.It's seriously one of the most interesting concepts ever committed to film in my opinion and the way they handle it, reveal it and writhe in the suffering of it is nothing short of masterful.",Martyrs
179,Munin75,"As gruesome as a movie can get, but not fulfilling",7,27 July 2011,"First off, Martyrs is one of these rare horror movies which truly do inspire horror and disgust, as opposed to most horror movies I've seen which mainly provide cheap scares and (funny) gore.Many reviews here seem to complain calling Martyrs ""horror porn"", and the reviewers are so annoyed about it that they (unfairly) rate it 1/10, reflecting in my opinion their initial distaste although very objectively the movie is well filmed and fairly entertaining. Hence I can't understand how one can mercilessly degrade it to a mere 1/10. Give it a damn 3 or 4 if you dislike it, don't make it some talentless bore-fest which it's obviously not.Martyrs is indeed a sadistic movie, the likes of Hostel plot-wise, but much, much more unsettling and with a less commercial pace. Where I feel the bad reviews are unfair, is that they blame a simplistic plot which supposedly puts the entire horror genre to shame. I personally fail to see how horror classics like Halloween or even Alien (which incidentally is my favorite movie) have a stronger plot. Horror classics are in general extremely simple, often focusing on one antagonist whose origins are hardly explained, who massacres people easily and predictably.Martyrs isn't that simple, and can be divided into two acts. The first 50 minutes can be considered quite canonical for a 2000s horror film (action, mystery and scary creature...), although the initial massacre at the beginning comes to quite a surprise, and is thus pleasantly original. The second act is the most disturbing and controversial, and what makes the movie the monster that it is. I understand why some may dislike it, and I'm not trying to be condescending. I guess it's the kind of movie you either like or hate. I wouldn't consider it to be exploitation and think the plot is very solid and well thought.My main criticism is the acting. As a native French speaker, I thought the casual conversations in the first half of the movie were appalling. The main female actresses are good at screaming and looking terrified, but their casual acting sounds so fake that it's painful. Same for all the actors in the first half of the movie, including the happy family talking like they're in a commercial. I'm not going to spoil anything, but another criticism is the very ending, which I thought was kind of cheap and disappointing, although the intention was greater.Anyway, if you're looking to watch a seriously disturbing horror film, the likes which certainly won't liven up a movie-night with friends, Martyrs is what you need to watch. And you won't forget it. It will stay as a reference in how gruesome a movie can get whether you like it or not.",Martyrs
180,acromegalix,This is not Pretty Woman,7,13 September 2008,"Martyrs is probably the most extreme movie ever made in France, and cannot be compared with any other flick I have seen before.It was a unique and traumatic experiment to watch it in a theater where half of the audience left before the end, while the other half was feeling very uncomfortable. It is NOT for everybody, and you can really be upset at times, even if you are a basic horror fan as I am.This movie is not made to please the audience, especially the second part, except if you are seriously disturbed. I couldn't help thinking about The Screwfly Solution that Joe Dante made in reaction of all the gratuitous violence made to women in horror movies.Fortunately, the end of the movie gives enough meaning to what you have been through, watch the whole thing if you can.I gave a 7 because it's not a movie that you can really like or recommend to your friends, but I think it's a real milestone in horror, like Texas Chainsaw Massacre was in his time.",Martyrs

OK, let's compare this to ""high tension""... yes, we get realism. but then? There are too many movies recently that do nothing but hide their lack of spirit and story... in the end the audience is left alone without a believable motivation for what happened...""Martyrs"" is different. It's scary and disturbing. It's painful to watch and still there is some kind of relief. You may separate that movie into three segments... and the first two would make a whole movie on their own. What happens then takes the story to whole new level and the audience to a whole new perspective. With a cynical bang in the end.I liked it.",Martyrs

183,sandiglendinning,"Horror, how it should be.",9,9 June 2013,"Martyrs is a film of two halves, first we encounter Lucy and Anna, childhood friends since both were institutionalised in their youth. It becomes clear that Lucy has suffered abuse and that Anna is her carer and protector. As they grow older this relationship becomes complicated, co-dependent and a power struggle. Anna loves Lucy, however Lucy does not seem to return these feelings and is torn apart by her post traumatic demons. When Lucy embarks on a rampage of revenge against her captors Anna follows and attempts to help her friend. In the second half of the movie, a shift occurs away from this revenge plot and we begin to ask the question 'why?'. The second half of Martyrs is probably one of the most violent hours of cinema that you will ever witness. As a viewer I found myself feeling mentally and emotionally fatigued for the character and hoping for an end to her suffering. Martyrs is also a very misunderstood film, those who argue that it's misogynistic are simply wrong,most of the violence perpetuated in this movie is violence perpetuated by women on women, the arch antagonist in this film is a woman as are both female protagonists- it is a movie driven by female energy. Men play a much lesser role, and seem to only be added as physical tools of torture no different or human than chains or weapons. This is a movie about women and it is a movie about big questions. It is also overwhelmingly a movie about violence, in fact I would go as far to say as the violence in this movie is almost like a third leading character. It would be very difficult to make Martyrs without the violence. Torture porn this is most certainly NOT however. There is absolutely nothing titillating or erotic about the matter of fact banality of evil that this film conveys so well. Bodies are punished, blood is shed, bones break and so do people.The two female leads offer outstanding performances in roles that are both emotionally and physically demanding. They convey a mind boggling range between visceral and vulnerable and every conceivable emotion between. The antagonists are faceless, cold, detached and above all else- indifferent.The result is something stunning, powerful and unforgettable. In addition to this, Martyrs is genuinely suspenseful, well-paced and will make your mind work very hard to contemplate what the conclusion will be. I will not say that Martyrs is easy viewing because it is visually gruelling, and I will not say that it is for everybody because it isn't. If you are a free thinker and you love horror you are going to love this movie. It will stay with you for many years after you have seen it. Viewer beware and be fore warned: This is true horror with the potential to upset and disgust, not for the purpose of titillation, thrills or spills- but in order to illustrate human evil. Martyrs then, invites us to examine human nature and contemplate the true origin of terror and evil within ourselves, which is the most terrifying place of all.It ends in a quiet simple definition of the word 'Martyr' as deriving from Greek for 'One who bears witness' leaving the viewer wondering whether the experience of watching the film defines them also to be a martyr.",Martyrs

The movie itself starts off normal, it goes normal but then all of a sudden it gets a turn you would never expect leading to stories you wouldn't ever expect. If you ever want to disturb your friends with a REAL horror movie, I strongly suggest this one.The violence is so well made and recorded that it just doesn't give blood and slash but also the feeling. The amazing thing is that it is not just stupid horror that most horror movies are but the twist that the movie gives, gives an amazing explanation to why everything happens as it does and it actually gives of an amazing explanation that makes you wonder for more then a couple of minutes.

Obviously from the rating i hated it.I must admit that it kept me from the begging till the end, just to let me down so much by its end. This movie starts good, keeps going really good, and after 60 minutes it goes way out of logic and sense.Some rich people torture young females just to find out ""what exactly"" is on the other world? They beat the hell out of them & even put their skin out in order to make the young female see the other side. I mean, come on! And when a woman learns it at the end of the movie, she kills herself without informing the others. I mean what??? She says ""keep wondering"". Yeah, right. You kill people for the last 20 years, you finally know whats going on the other side, and your best decision is suicide. Well, that makes sense! Not to mention where the girls kill a whole family, but yet they sleep on their beds like nothing happened.

190,GoregirlsDungeon,Bloody Brilliant!,10,24 September 2009,"Although this is definitely a balls out horror film it is also an excellent multi-layered story. There is just so much here to think about and digest. I went to bed thinking about it and woke up to the same. I had a hell of a time writing this review. I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to say about Martyrs. More accurately, I wasn't sure what I didn't want to say about it. There will be people who will absolutely hate the twist it takes and the grim final scenes. For me, the film comes full circle by the time the credits role. It all becomes one horrifying and tragic tale about love and friendship, trauma and revenge and power and religion. First and foremost, it is a horror film. It has wrapped it's messages up in a very gory, relentlessly bloody package. Make no mistake about it, this film's graphic images will be difficult to look at. Once again the French pull off another horror extravaganza that kicked my ass.We start out with Lucie, physically beaten, emotionally distraught and running from an unseen predator. Lucie meets Anna in the hospital after the event. The two girls form a bond and a lifelong friendship. Most of the film takes place fifteen years later when the girls are adults. I had a ton of empathy for both of these characters. The emotionally destroyed Lucie is beyond aid. She is scarred, mind and body, and is tormented to the point of self destruction. No matter what Lucie does to herself, or others, Anna is there to tend to her wounds. Anna, for all intensive purposes is Lucie's guardian angel. Their bond is unbreakable and Anna never gives the impression that Lucie is a burden to her in any way. You might say that Anna is somewhat of a Martyr?! The performances by both these women are outstanding. The film twists and turns but the hard right it takes mid-way completely blindsided me. It starts out as a revenge picture and transforms into something very different. There were more than a few shocks and surprises. The ending is complete and utter insanity! The violence is extreme and graphic. The gore is through the roof. The effects are outstanding.

193,sean73267326,An uneasy combination.,4,7 July 2014,"Talk about shooting yourself in the foot. Martyrs is a film with a massive identity crisis. For every interesting idea it has, and believe me it has many, it cancels it out with a lame horror movie cliché or torture-porn segment. Why on earth did the director take such clearly interesting material and try to shoehorn it into the horror/gore genre? Did he not believe in the material enough? Clearly he didn't because the film feels like two directors of completely different styles worked on this instead of one with one coherent vision. Quick run down (spoilers); two girls break into a house, and we aren't given any clue as to why. We soon find out that one of the girls has escaped from an organization that martyrs women in order to prove the existence of heaven. Soon after the other one endures this same procedure, and, well, sees heaven... we think. It's never properly reveal but it's heavily implied. The ending, which I won't ruin, is interesting, if a bit abrupt and obtuse.Anyway, more on this identity crisis. The film is split between two modes; a pretty dire horror movie type thing, and an excellent art house film with a lot to say about human suffering, heaven and faith. The fact that the latter is so good is beyond disheartening; they feel cheapened by the director's over reliance on cheap gore and shock-violence and effects. As a film, it's in need of a good editor, and maybe some extra scenes to pad out the time lost by cutting out the horror sections, but that's about it. The final few scenes are actually extremely affecting, and are an achievement simply in how profound they feel. They're terribly depressing of course... but still.It probably speaks volumes about how bad the horror parts are that I'm giving it a 4 even as I'm raving about the good points. Bottom line; rent it out and see. You may be able to ignore its bad points. I simply wasn't.",Martyrs

195,fahadkashmiri7,'Martyrs' will be remembered for decades to come....,9,4 February 2012,"Well there are very few movies where you want the end credits to roll as soon as they can... Not because the movie's bad but because of the eerie feeling you get when it starts getting under your skin. Martyrs is one of them. It will twist your mind, numb your senses and flay your skin as it does to the main protagonist of the movie. Some scenes are so mind screwing that you wont be able to take it. The climax was one of the best i've ever seen. Its a mind trip that should not be missed. Kudos to the director for making such a complicated film with equally complicated premises. 'Martyrs' will be remembered for decades to come. You have to 'Witness' this or you'll always 'Keep doubting'.",Martyrs
196,Lord_Frog,Not just a great horror movie... an excellent film!,10,7 March 2009,"After all the hype and months of waiting for the French DVD release, I got to watch this masterpiece last night. As a French guy based in London, I could not wait 2 more months until the UK DVD release, so forgetting the credit crunch I bought it from France with next day delivery and I'm glad I did! First of all, while the movie is indeed very violent and quite disturbing, I was expecting MUCH worse after reading so many crazy reactions. For one, it's not that gory, compared to Inside/A l'Interieur for instance - that one really went over the top. I would say that Haute Tension/Switchblade Romance was just a bit more suspenseful too.BUT Martyrs is the sum of all its many parts and turns. In retrospect, I'm GLAD that Martyrs didn't turn up to be as gory as Inside on top of being as suspenseful and violent as it is. Each element is there and will be turned up or down during the whole movie, but never to maximum effect were it would become unbearable to watch - just walking a very fine line. However, while the physical violence is tough to watch, its ideas hit you even deeper, which makes it quite unique. I never felt that while watching the above-mentioned flicks or any recent horror film.My reaction at the end was that it was a great film, not just a horror movie. It's actually a bit restrictive to label it this way - and I love the genre- as it is much more in my opinion. I keep thinking about the ending which is really open to interpretation but at the same time it was the perfect way to end the film. I would describe the film as a gory metaphysic revenge drama ;-). Darker than your worst nightmares...I really don't want to spoil it for anyone - I wish I had gone into it without reading anything about the plot, so I won't add any spoilers here.Still hesitating? My advice: don't be put off by the warnings. This movie delivers and then some. Just see it and go through this very special and intense experience. It's unlike anything you've ever seen, and you're unlikely to forget it anytime soon.",Martyrs
197,mikelepost,Interesting concept - flawed execution,6,5 May 2009,"I think the best way to watch Martyrs is to go into the movie cold. I purposely avoided any reviews that appeared to contain spoilers and read very little about the film before viewing it. Say what you will about the movie, but it takes several truly wild plot turns and part of what I enjoyed about the film is the unpredictability. In the end though, I felt like the narrative was disjointed, the themes weren't fully fleshed out, and ultimately the ideas behind Martyrs struck me as the armature on which to support several scenes of cartoon horror violence followed by sadistic torture.On the plus side, the movie is extremely stylish and I thought the gore effects were very good. There are several familiar elements in the film but they're combined in such a disjointed way that it never becomes stale. Martyrs is certainly one of the more original horror films I've seen in recent years. The direction and acting were excellent for this kind of movie. Even though I felt manipulated at the end of the movie I couldn't help but find the last 15 minutes or so to be strangely moving. I'll never want to watch this movie again but I haven't stopped thinking about it since viewing it last week.Now, the bad part: Martyrs really does feel like two different films that both go on for too long and don't mesh together tonally. The first half of the film at first seems to have a supernatural element and the violence is cartoonish and somewhat over-the-top. After the initial shooting though, I thought the film stopped dead in its tracks for a good 10-15 minutes while we watch Marie wailing around and cutting herself. This got a bit dull.The second half of the film is potentially more interesting but far less entertaining. The cult shows up and Anna is imprisoned and tortured. Watching a seemingly typical nuclear family get blasted across the room by a shotgun is fun. Watching a woman forced to sit in her own waste, take periodic beatings to the face, and have her skin surgically removed, isn't ""fun."" The torture scenes went on for too long and way too grim and distasteful to be enjoyable.I'm not a prude. I loved (and own) High Tension, Sheitan, Frontier(s), Inside, The Ordeal, etc. I've seen and enjoyed a lot of movies with some seriously rough content. I just personally think a horror film either needs to be harmless escapism OR, if the idea is to strike a realistic tone, the ideas supporting the film need to somewhat justify the graphic violence on-screen.For this viewer, Martyrs missed the mark. Maybe it's because the Madmoiselle only appears on screen for a few brief scenes, but the cult aspects of the film didn't come across to me at all, so I had a hard time reading this movie as a critique on religious cultism. Martyrs actually seemed to justify their world-view, since the film clearly implies that Anna DID have a vision and one of her tormentors treats her with compassion near the end, which suggests to me that they're not pure evil and somewhat justified what they were doing to the poor girl.Really, it just seemed to me that Martyrs was banking on scenes of young, attractive women in agony and all the religious mumbo-jumbo was an after-the-fact attempt at ""depth"" to let the audience off the hook. I found this insulting, just like the flimsy philosophical ideas in Irreversible (""Time destroys everything"" -- ooh! That's deep!).I also think Martyrs opened itself wide open to charges of sexism. At least Hostel had the good sense to have both male and female victims. Martyrs makes the weakest attempt to justify the fact that all its victims are young (and suspiciously good-looking) women. I could practically hear the screenwriter arguing, ""See? Just because Martyrs consists of about 90 minutes of female self-mutilation, degradation and torture, that doesn't mean it's sexist!"" Sorry folks, but I'm just not buying it. I expect garden variety misogyny in Friday the Thirteen but those movies don't ask me to take them seriously. If you want to make a deep philosophical point, you're going to have to ditch the cartoon violence and other horror tropes.Overall, Martyrs is well-made and intriguing but the ideology is a total mess and it's not a movie I ever want to see again. That said, I know horror geeks are going to love this one so I'd recommend it to the extreme movie crowd without reservation. Just don't expect a ""masterpiece"" - Martyrs is far from it.",Martyrs

I wanted to like it because it was a very well made movie, but at some points, the plot made absolutely no sense. It definitely kept me entertained through the whole movie, but at some points I felt like they were trying too hard. I genuinely liked it at first, but then it just turned into torture p*rn. There wasn't much of a plot and I feel like it was just made for the shock value. I appreciate this movie for being the only movie to disturb me this much.

I think it tackles alot of issues like mental health/traumatization and religion possibly? The film pulls NO punches whatsoever and there are now images burned in my mind I'll probably never forget. The actors of Lucie and Anna are extremely great talented. Little fun fact, the actor of Anna broke three bones on set and was instructed to cry for 10+ hours on most days. It was such a hellish experience filming and they were put through so much stress during shooting of the movie they said they would never work with the director again. The gore is on another level and honestly gotta admire the effects team. Everything looked so real. If you do dare to watch, make sure you watch the original French version with subtitles.

201,dcoke25,"The ""Justification"" DESTROYS THIS MOVIE",3,30 November 2020,"There's this term that I thought I came up with to describe fake deep things like ""YOLO"", and other vapid sentiments, as ""Fauxlosophy"" apparently I came to it on my own, but others had already arrived a that portmanteau as well. THIS IS THIS MOVIE.It starts out great, and then gets gory, and it's creepy, and that's where it should have stopped. IF it left itself unexplained and unjustified, it would have been amazing. The effects were beautifully disgusting and realistic, which added to the atmosphere. And to leave a movie without a conclusion, would implicate you the viewer in on its crimes. BUT, instead, it decided to come up with some high school pothead excuse as to why the movie was happening, destroying the whole movie with its pretentious and shallow logic. Which is sad, since that's like the last act of the movie, meaning the majority of it which I thought was great, got destroyed by the last third.What makes this frustrating is, this is why I was seeking out foreign horror films. I LOVE HORROR, and US horror isn't great. Last good one I saw was Hereditary. And I'm not usually a gore-freak when it comes to horror, more into the Gothic horror and atmospheric stuff. I like my ghost stories too. But, I'm flexible. The gore didn't bother me, that was my favorite part of this, since the set up was voyeuristic and made you feel complicit. Now, it's been a LONG time since I've seen this movie and doing a lot of this from memory, since I don't remember the vehicle that starts the torture off, I think the girl sets up the other girl, can't remember if a friend, or damsel in distress. It was a betrayal of trust, that's all I know. That terrible ending is what stuck with me, and the feeling of me really enjoying the movie up to that point.I think it's over-rated and it's a very ""American"" friendly foreign horror flick, to a fault.",Martyrs
202,benjones-11,Total filth,1,5 January 2012,"First of all, let me say - I am a grown up, experienced person, who is able to enjoy a good horror, and can appreciate violence if it serves a purpose for the sake of the film. However, this film is not horror. It represents a classic example of the type of film that is beginning to be labelled ""torture porn"". So called because it is difficult for any ""reasonable"" human being to understand how anyone could gain enjoymment from it unless they are of the Jeffrey Dahmer ilk who actually get off on such subjects - films whose sole purpose is to gorge on graphic and deranged pain and suffering.There is a thin plot to the film, which pretends to have some sort of deeper meaning. However, don't be fooled by this, or try to use it as an excuse to say ""I enjoyed it for its depth and the way it brings spiritual meaning to the ...."". No. It's filth. Simple as. The type of filth that exists for the sole purpose of being filthy.What upsets me the most is that horrors of old used to have victims of both sexes, who may have died in gruesome ways, but the deaths were normally short and left a fair degree to the imagination, or alternatively the special effects were so over the top that it actually sanitised the film by removing all reality, such that you could enjoy the ""horror"" aspect, but were not left feeling like you'd watched some sort of snuff movie. However, Martyrs is of the style of recent voyeuristic dirt which involves slow, tortuous, realistic bloody scenes - all of women, all with no reprieve, all involving long, slow close ups and whimpering and wailing that goes on for ever ... and ever. The scenes that Martyrs decides to specialise in here are either involving knives being pulled deeply through flesh, or - even worse, involve long, agonising beating of a girl. One section of the film showed nothing but the methodical physical demolition of a girl. It went on for about fifteen minutes. During this time there was no dialogue. No changes to scenery. Just a large, emotionless man who throws endless punches into the face/stomach of a young girl. Even picking her up when she is unconscious, only to throw ravaging punches into her as she flops down to the ground. Occasional bit of slow mo. Occasional long gaze at her face in between each set of beatings in order to show that this is in fact quarter of an hour of montage, and to make sure we see the effect it has on her will and sanity as it all unfolds ... then back for some more savage beatings. This is a young girl. In fact all of the victims are young girls. They have done nothing to deserve their torture. They are just young, innocent girls.What the f**k is good about this? I mean, for God's sake people!!! There is no humour, no horror, no intrigue, no mystery, no nothing of any kind other than the sort of sick filth that makes me worry about anyone who can watch this and say that they enjoyed it. One can only imagine that the title and the excuse for a reason for this torture were thought up later on in the development process, since the reasonning makes no sense, and at the one point where you think ""perhaps there may be something imaginative about to happen"", the hope is destroyed by a simple ""You'll never know"" style ending.Not that this matters, but my reason for watching it was due to the film arriving as part of a film club package, and I did no research before sticking it into the DVD player. I fast-forwarded through most of the torture scenes, but was still left with a nasty feeling, even a long time after having watched it.If films like this can make it past film boards and not get banned, or at least severely edited, then what the hell are those associations there for in the first place? If you have read this and still think that it sounds like a good film, then I pity you, and I pity society for having people like you who call this sort of voyeurism ""entertainment""",Martyrs
203,Chiyonosake23,Requiem for the death of art,1,26 December 2013,"The farthest from me is to bloat about my education, but here it is relevant. I indeed was a student at a Hungarian ART college. The farthest from me to bloat about this is also because actually an art degree is worthless in today's society, i should have learned economics or law or something,which is actually respected somewhere and are not the butt of jokes :)And this movie and its kind is part of the reason why saying in a social environment: ""I graduated from art"" is something that will only be followed up by raised eyebrows or laughter and jokes.This is garbage. The worst kind. The kind that is the creation of a sick mind who just wanted to see his sick fetish realized without going to jail, and had the smarts to opt to faintly disguise it as art...And the flock gathered and applauded, because its oooh so dark and edgy, and meaningful. Newsflash: Its not...The subject matter of dealing with torture and abuse, the questions about afterlife, and how far people are willing to go to fill the void of uncertainty in their heart was observed and expanded upon in many-many movies before...And much more intelligently. Even if I agree, that this movie had some themes and thoughts, it was 10 minutes out of almost 100.If 90% of your film is nothing but torture and gross out stuff (which also in this day and age is pointless after sooo many torture porn flicks...) you can NOT use the Joker card of it being art anymore. Anybody with a brain gets the point after 2 minutes, than it gets repetitive and you realize you see what i described, someone's sick fantasy. 2 minutes. Its enough. After that you are NOT deep, and profound and whatever fans of this garbage think this is...You are empty and meaningless, and repetitive and boring.To put it in contrast: Imagine a cooking show, where out of 10 minutes 9 is devoted to showing you washing the ingredients, one after another, and 1 minute showing the actual process of making the food...Is it a good cooking show? Anyone can wash a tomato just as anyone can show violence. Show the meaning for 90% and the torture for 10% than I will agree, it is meaningful...This is NOTHING but a glorified and even more over the top Hostel and has two type of fans: gore hounds (which group i can understand), and pseudo-intellectuals who will say to everybody, who doesn't like this movie, that they just don't get it, and should watch Michel Bay movies instead...Ironically Michael Bay and this director has a lot in common...they are both good at shooting excessive and meaningless violence, although even the Island has more meaning and human emotion than this...Most likely half of the above mentioned pseudo-intellectuals condemn Hostel for being a mindless Hollywood piece of trash...Funny thing this movie even has the same antagonists: rich white people hunting innocents for their means, since this is sooo original......I am really sad i can not give 0 starsAnd the saddest part is: this movie is available at the most known video sharing site in full length, the uncut version, without age restriction...I hope no 5-10 year old will stumble upon it because from that point on, the director will be not better from his antagonists one tiny bit. Because for a young mind this is REALLY torture and dangerous, and i extremely rarely say this...And don't anybody dare to say to this ""its the responsibility of parents"", and all that...we are on the internet...we know how it works...and we know most kids know more about the net than their parents...",Martyrs
204,leereddy,Revenge film gone bad,7,23 August 2012,"Martyrs is a hell of a shock to the system. Starting off as what appears to be a straight forward revenge film, it morphs into a nihilistic nightmare that leaves the viewer - this viewer, at least - feeling utterly drained. Seriously, after watching Martyrs I literally couldn't speak for about half an hour. This French Canadian production has been linked to what has been described as New French Extremity, and after seeing it you'll be left with no questions as to why. Apparently an American rework is in the pipes and Lord knows they'll have to tone down some of the films themes, if not necessarily the violence, for it to do well at the box office. And that's the interesting thing about Martyrs, it's not really the violence that is so alarming but the overall theme and tone of the piece - IE: the motives for the violence that is perpetrated through the latter portion of the film. The earlier sequences are much easier to empathise with - a girl subjecting who she believes to be responsible for the abhorrent treatment she underwent as a child in an abandoned abattoir to a dish of best served cold. It's when the film takes a bizarre turn midway through that the audience is made to suffer some truly bizarre and corrupt concepts. And suffering is what Martyrs is really all about, that and some eccentric and clandestine organisation whose motives are very difficult for us sane folk to wrap our heads around. Aside from all the torrid carnage and mind bending subject matter there are some terribly poignant scenes between the films lead actors. Lucie played by Mylene Jampanoi turns in a breath taking performance, as does her co star Morjana Alaoui, who portrays her childhood friend Anna.I'm still unclear as to what the films overall message is, I've got some theories but divulging them would be tantamount to ""spoiling"". You'll have to surmise for yourself as to what message this film is attempting to convey. And although I did not enjoy this film, in terms of deriving pleasure from seeing it, I have to tip my cap to the films director (Pascal Laugier) for creating something that left me reeling and actually altered my physical state of being. It certainly stays with you, for good or ill, and it's with that caveat I suggest that you consider whether you wish to view something akin to the Hostel torture porn genre, or something that is far more disturbing mentally. Because this film, as superbly acted, directed and produced as it is, will blow your mind. You have been warned.",Martyrs

And quite frankly, it is a very shocking movie. It is not for people who are not accustomed to watching gory movies(read Hostel, Saw, etc...). It is also not a movie for people who dislike movies with an OPEN ENDING. Also, some people do not understand the point of this movie, but isn't all fiction inherently pointless?According to me the gore is not as appalling (sorry for not having a better word) as the 2 movies I just mentioned. So it's not violent to the point of being unwatchable. But the movie is actually thought provoking and VERY TRAGIC!!! Contrary to some people's thinking, most of the film's violence is in the first half. The second half is a little less on violence and more on what Anna is going through. Though that does not mean that there is no violence in the second half at all, but it did not make me cringe as much as similar scenes from Hostel did. The acting by the 2 leading ladies is surprisingly great and makes you feel for them. !!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! ALERT! SPOILERS BELOW !!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!! The plot has some really good twists and turns which at times are very touching and tragic, apart from being shocking. a)The revelation of who that woman haunting Lucie was (as shown in her memories) b)That Anna tries to save the Blond wife in the family c)Anna feels guilty about not believing her friend and saying ""sorry"" and d)The end credits are my favorite among the twists. But the hopelessly-shocking-to-the-core moment in the movie, which actually impressed(and shocked) me a lot, was when Anna finds out the other ""Martyr"" in the house. And talking about the open ending, I think there can be at least 2-3 different interpretations that I can make on my own.1)Anna told Mademoiselle something like she will be facing consequences of whatever she has done in her life, good or bad, in her afterlife which made her feel fear which led her to her end.2)Anna told Mademoiselle that the afterlife is so beautiful that she killed herself to experience it though the chances of that are quite low but not impossible.3)Anna told there is no afterlife, which made Mademoiselle think that all the wrong she did is all pointless and thus she felt all the guilt leading her to kill herself. !!!!!

But it turns out that hostel has more plot then this one. First of all the movie is really boring and dull for the second half. Ladder Down. Door opens. Someone enter. Beat chained girl. Close door. Door opens, woman enter, feed chained girl. Door close. And so on for half an hour. Are you kidding me, son? Let's watch a Simon Thauer porn movie, it's better; it's more honest and less repetitive. Plus, midway during the first half, it is easy to understand that she sees things that exist only inside her mind; thanks, not exactly a new idea (sixth sense docet). Plus I could not really relate with the characters, as they are quite monodimensional. As for the premises or, as the director puts it, the actual presence of justifications for the violence in the story, wheel, they are thinner than the air on the Himalaya! Really. No one could believe them. Beside the term ""martyr"" has different meaning: martyrs are those who sacrifice themselves for something they believe in (e.g. all the victims of totalitarian regimes), not for something others believe in, as in the movie. Here they are merelyt victims of perverted and depraved persons and its shows. Luckily we are only victims of a pompous director.",Martyrs
210,feguiza,PLEASE! do not watch this movie,1,7 October 2009,"I can't remember the last time I wrote here but man, this is something I just NEED to say.This movie is beyond ridiculous, is way past the line of being stupid just for the sake of it, I mean, and I'm trying to be polite here, this is the epitome of suckiness, this is a lousy story directed by the most unexperienced person ever.The movie starts nicely, you've got a Japanese-like ghost there, a frightened child and a couple of blood stains in the title...""OK, you got me there I'm paying attention"" then it builds up into something quite decent, you know, with a teen (wearing a hoodie) that's blowing people off with a shotgun...promising really...then everything breaks into little pieces of stupidity.Yes, the spoilers are ahead. I respect French Cinema, I actually love French Horror, but to see a woman (after being skinned alive) talking to an old lady about how the afterlife is bliss or something that mildly passes as ""awery"", and to watch a bunch of really old people throwing a mid-afternoon party all dressed in black waiting for the aforementioned old lady to give a deep speech about how torturing people is cool because they end up looking like the characters of the latest Tool video...man, that's just blatantly plain and makes me feel like going out there to plant a tree or something.This movie is ridiculous, just like my last paragraph, it's not horror, it's not torture-porn, it's not terror or any of those genres...it's just a movie about how a girl can be dumb enough to stick around after her girlfriend (who just committed suicide BTW) blew the hell out of two adults and two young children...I mean, if you stick around to watch the corpses decompose I promise something weird will happen to you, why don't you just run the bleep away girl!

211,Anyoneatnowhere,The images in this movie will stay with you for a while,6,29 October 2009,"This is a movie that you may not have heard about if it weren't for all the buzz that it's gotten on horror forums during the past year. It's like a specialised slice of cinema (giallo torture horror?) that is being touted as art because of its unflinching attempts to shock you. But this felt a little empty to me. It's one of those ""cool"" movies that you mention to show how edgy you are but soon realise, in a few years (when you're 19) that it doesn't have much substance. I think this movie could have been more effective if it had been reduced to an hour in length. The storyline is great. The movie starts with a young girl (Lucie) who escapes a torture chamber and later finds refuge in an orphanage. There she befriends another girl (Anna) who cares for her and helps her deal with the psychological trauma she's endured. We also learn that Lucie is regularly attacked by some sort of creature. The story quickly shifts forward 15 years and we are shown a family having breakfast. I won't go into what follows because the first half of this movie will get your blood pumping. However, by the halfway mark I was, quite honestly, a little bored. You are inundated with imagery that is intended to shock and it actually desensitizes you to a degree (or maybe I've seen too many horror films). Then there's a twist. The plot takes a turn and you don't quite know where it's taking you but it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, you're forced to watch another 45 minutes of similarly shocking scenes just to get to the end. Whether or not it's worth it is a matter of personal taste. I wanted to like this film. It's bold, the storyline is good and the plot twist works really well. I've also seen exploitation films more violent than this, so it's not that I couldn't stomach the gore. I just felt that the relentless graphic scenes (particularly towards the end) did little to further the story. This is a film that, in a way, works backwards: we see the effects of torture and then are made to ""symbolically"" endure it for another 45 minutes. The ending is good because it ties everything together and is ambiguous enough to get you thinking, but I can't help but think that we could have gotten there earlier and with a little less pain.",Martyrs
212,thismango,Incoherent and pointlessly disturbing,5,29 March 2014,"Is this a good film? It's not a good thing, in the sense that a good poison is not a good thing. It's quite effective at making you feel very bad, but not for a good enough reason.On reflection, I have to agree with those reviewers who found the philosophical premise flimsy. This is an ambitious film that attempts to transcend its genre in a way that even the most disturbing Japanese horror films do not. Setting its aim so high means that it stands or falls on the theoretical premise, and I don't think it does stand. It's just not worth it.I was spellbound during the experience, shocked into receptivity by the sheer nastiness of the events, but the ending did not quite do the trick. The victim's final vision was clichéd, and having her whisper something incomprehensible was a cop-out. In the end, I felt that I had gone through a painful experience for no good reason. I would not repeat that experience and I do not recommend it.There is a macho attitude among certain directors who value cynicism, inhumanity and transgression for its own sake. Actually, those values are quite easy to attain and rather immature. Most of us get it out of our system in our early 20s. This affectedly cold attitude betrays a kind of spiritual impotence, emotional smallness and misapprehension of life in those who express it: the existential analogue of a porn-induced hard-on, for an adolescent culture.",Martyrs

214,Creepy-Suzie,Enjoy the discussion that will ensue from this modern classic.,10,28 April 2015,"""High Tension"" ""Hard Candy"" ""Baise-Moi"" lesbian rage Well, there are lesbians in Martyrs, but its revenge and madness that fuel this plot. Years of abuse and mistreatment left Lucie hallucinating and self- mutilating with the single goal of laying waste to her captors.It was an experiment gone awry, pseudo scientists without ethics, and their methods were anything but sound. I was reminded of ""Men Behind the Sun"" or even Auschwitz. Whether this was mutilation for its own sake, or a determination of the constraints of sanity when subjected to the outer limits of brutality remains to be justified. Here the end product was evidence of martyrdom or perhaps simply a coping mechanism of the nervous system resulting from excruciating infliction of pain.Anna was an apt replacement for the now defunct Lucie, and she would undergo procedures and horrors that Lucie's most tainted nightmares could not have encapsulated. Anna's swollen plum face with sliver slit eyes has a ragged porcelain doll quality. When she mutters ""I miss you"" to her imaginary Lucie, her soul screams audibly although her voice is no longer capable. I was overwhelmed with the beauty of the somber scene. At that moment, Pascual Langier grabbed through the lens and simply crushed my heart in his palm. I cried.In the end, we see inside Anna, not just anatomically, but also regarding her multifaceted intricacies. Had Mademoiselle planned on this frail waif being something more than a victim? She certainly banked on some inevitable transformation. Ultimately was Anna Mademoiselle's killer with a forked tongue of deceit, or was Mademoiselle forced to face her own demons, or perhaps nothingness in the end? Alas the elderly crowd eagerly anticipating evidence of experimental proof may die none the wiser.",Martyrs
215,tonymo1977,"Bobby Flay has nothing on Martyr's ""Martyr's""",8,3 March 2010,"Let's start with a checklist of Horror/Shocking film elements and rate them on a scale of 1-5, (1) being Disney's Up and (5) being High Tension or Ishi the Killer and everything in between. Let's begin!1. Violence- Martytr's definitely serves up heaps of violence. My favored scene(besides the shocker noted in #4) would be the random acts(slicing) inflicted upon Lucie( Myl'ene Jampanoi) by her ""Haunting female creature"" or the shotgunning down of an entire family (a few had it coming). It was no Halloween II but it was quite violent. BruceVain Rating on Violence- (5) Ishi all the way2. Gore- Even films that have a decent budget can have over the top gore, or scenes that just don't look real or even worse CGI gore. Martyr's displays a minimal measure of gore, but when they do, they really take it to the next level and make it work. There is a scene where a women that has been held captive for who knows how long has a metal blindfold on. Fence staples are used to keep it in place and when they remove them, they can bleed a lot!! It appears that the skin has grown around the blindfold and when it is finally removed, the slime like puss from infection really screams quality GORE! Another example of the effects is a scene where Lucie is fighting with her ""Haunting Female Creature"" and the creature uses a straight razor and cuts into Lucie's arm lengthwise, from behind the elbow to the wrist, reminded me of ""Fatal Attraction"". I watch a lot of horror and this scene actually gave me chills. BruceVain Rating on Gore- (5) High Tension Style3. Abuse- Apparently the M.O. of the film, trying to induce enough of it to promote transcendence in order to see the afterlife. In fact, the victims are not victims at all they are put through this process to make them into Martyr's( Greek for Witness). Hoping that they can see what lies after death. BruceVain Rating on Abuse-(5) Ishi all the way4. Flaying a Human Alive- To reach that final stage of transcendence this type of systematic abuse must be inflicted, and it is portrayed right before your eyes. This scene in particular is a testament to the acting and Direction, the pain in Anna's(Morjana Alaoui) eyes is characterized exponentially for the viewer to experience. BruceVain Rating on Flaying a Human Alive-(5) shoot that's gotta hurt!There were a few elements that I was not a fan of, for instance the film grain effect used in the opening and closing scenes. I was hoping that this would not continue for the remainder of the film....it didn't. If I failed to mention this film is in French and is subtitled, for the first 5 min, the subtitles are on the top of the screen rather than the normal bottom( I was peeved by this).The Director Pascal Laugier deserves credit for the performances, how did he get those girls to cry non-stop? I felt the pacing was a little slow and a bit out of place. It seemed like a long 1:37 min because of it. Overall the film is a must see for an admirer of the genre and if you want shocking depiction of violence and abuse, Martyr's is for you.If a horror/shock film were a Tachometer in a race car, Martyr's would be a blown engine.Bruce Vain",Martyrs

219,gregory-joulin,"Not that bad, considering...",7,27 January 2011,"--- Spoilers ---Needless to say, the french movie industry has never been too good in producing bis/exploitation/extreme films. Who's to blame ?Shy producers who won't bet their shirt to finance movies that are most likely devoted to crash at the box-office ? French censorship that will surely tattoo some nasty ""18+"" sign on the movie poster, instantly killing it commercially ? Cultural differences that make us all think here that some genres like gore, survival (or else...) suit better in English-speaking countries ? Lack of courage, lack of talent, lack of someone like Roger Corman ?Well, a bit of all that, maybe....But many mid-twenties/mid-thirties french filmmakers had a blast when building their cinema references by watching movies like ""Halloween"", ""Evil Dead"", ""The Thing"".... even ""Blair Witch Project"" and they wanna be a part of it, take a bite. Why not, after all ?Pascal Laugier is no stranger to that, I guess, and after a first draft (a ghost story called ""Saint-Ange"", didn't see it) launched his rocket to try to make a statement : a french extreme gore picture, hunting on the land of ""Hostel"" or ""Saw""....The first 10 minutes are a collection of everything that punches french movies down to the knock-out : cheesy pieces of dialog, heavy story-telling, bad cinematography, the guy wants so much to let us know he's getting to the point (that is, something horrible happened to a little girl, something so frightening she just wouldn't tell anyone, even to her closest friend in an orphanage).Starting bad, eh ?Then the movie took me completely off-guard ! There is a scary night sequence involving the two little girls that gave me goose bumps, really. And from that on, the movie will dive into speed, violence/blood, stress, despair... and even time, for we'll be led to jump 15 years in the future.I think it's more a drama or a twisted love story than a torture film like ""Hostel"", and that's making it even more scary and unsettling.I can't even tell if I liked it or not, I wanted to know scene by scene what would go on next, and I felt ashamed of it... Kinda mixed and confusing feelings, I guess. Maybe that's what good horror movies can do to you.",Martyrs

I absolutely loved Haute Tension and so I expected big things from Martyrs, this movie did not disappoint.There are some very disturbing scenes but for those that can stomach the Saw movies will have no problems here. It's not as gruesome as the Saw movies but the twisted plot leaves you speechless.This is fantastically acted and the director has nailed the ability to keep the tension throughout.I'll be honest, I really did think that this film was going to fall flat on his face after what was an excellent opening 45 minutes. But I was pleasantly surprised with the ending twist which left me thinking, 'that was a great movie'.I think what makes this movie so good is it's originality, I cannot think of a film which has taken this path before and this is easily one of the best horror movies I've seen.9/10",Martyrs

It had me guessing where the plot was heading, as well as, the characters motivation. Once the main characters return to the scene of the crime, they tend to needlessly linger, which causes the bulk of the movie that follows. Ultra-violence fans will love this movie, however it is not an action movie. A longish sequence of brutal depravity ensues. Just when I thought to myself, ""This movie better not leave me hanging"" (without answers or a dumb ending), It sucker punched me in the gut! Wow, the ending was very revealing and makes this movie what it is. Martyrs is not for everyone, due to the violence, gore, and religious views it suggests.

223,Monoxstride,The worst movie I've ever seen,1,23 March 2011,"This movie is really bad, in fact it's the worst I've ever seen.I guess I'll start with the only positive aspect I can find about it. The directing isn't THAT bad. It's all downhill from there.The acting is absolutely deplorable. I honestly can't believe it.The script is mind-blowing, I mean it. Is this even about anything? It's like they were making some kind of college experiment, and then decided to make it into a movie, so 3/4 through they decided to give it a point. I would believe that explanation if someone told me it was true, because I honestly believe a creative 12 year old could write a more coherent story. Here's the timeline: We have The beginning of the movie where there's a short back-story, and the girl busts in and kills that whole family.Next, is just filler, literally. They talk about leaving, but instead they stay there for no explainable reason for days. The original girl starts being chased by some monster. Of course it's just a hallucination. The movie teases you with this possibility before it's revealed, as if it's some kind of original idea (*cough* fight club and every other movie after it *cough*). Naturally, this has nothing to do with the plot. We find out one of the family members is still alive, and the girls disagree on whether or not they should kill her. Does this have a purpose? Of course not, it's just more time wasting. It doesn't develop character, it doesn't develop the plot. It's just filler until the ""big torture scene!"".After that, One of the girls dies, which is good because I don't think I could take that acting anymore. Now her friend stays there even longer. Some other filler stuff happens and then she gets tortured by a group who's trying to understand what happens after you die. Now the movie rips off EVERY other torture-porn movie you've ever seen. There's this one original part where they feed the girl some kind of slop. I guess that's the disturbing moment.She does reach the afterlife (I guess), and then the woman in charge of the organization kills herself. What happened? I guess the afterlife must be good right? Well I have a better theory, it's called who cares. Obviously a movie like this isn't gonna have a coherent ending, so just be happy the credits are rolling.",Martyrs
224,brooke53,Impossible scenario at ending,1,22 November 2016,"Perhaps someone should have informed the filmmakers that it is not possible for a person to live for very long after having all their skin removed (except the face, as in this movie). The movie was very unpleasant to watch but became ridiculous when she is alive and perfectly calm floating in water with no skin! I assume I watched the censored version because I was surprised we weren't treated to watching someone be skinned alive, and, of course, not screaming or struggling, but being perfectly complacent (which, I guess, was the point - that she became a willing victim). I get what the filmmakers were attempting to convey but when they want to include conditions that are impossible, they should make it a sci-fi flick where it might be possible due to medical advancements/science fiction gizmos, etc. for someone to be kept alive and healthy after removing their skin. But the part of the movie that ticked me off the most was another implausible scenario. Who the heck hunts down their tormentors and doesn't even confront them, and/or torture them back to get them to fess up? She just shoots them without saying a word. Since the filmmakers wanted to include as much gore as possible, why not have a scene where the victim gets even with her tormentors. At least we would have that satisfaction! Was their point that she wasn't going to stoop to their level and commit torture herself? Well, she shoots them and cruelly shoots innocent children too after forcing them to watch their parents murdered. That was another awful aspect of this wretched movie. At least it would have made more sense to force the parents watch their children be killed. Another ridiculous scene: the mother suddenly coming to life, talking coherently, after several hours and with a huge whole in her abdomen.",Martyrs

The second half is a repetitive exercise in torture and degradation, which can only serve to make you sick and depressed. This can be justified if there is a strong message/motive behind, and addressing for example a social problem, but in this case there is no such motive, obviously only the filmmakers urge to wallow in his twisted human degradation fantasies. The fact that it is extremely well made only accentuates the revolting effect. One can argue that the the filmmaker in this has achieved his goal and therefore should be rewarded. However,in that respect Dr Mengele also achieved a lot of his goals.

Just surfing on the web to find a good horror movie and then i saw this.In the first part i thought, this is just a sick slasher kind of movie, but in moments i knew that wasn't what this movie was. I don't know what to call it. Some kind of psychological torture horror movie or something like that. The second part of the movie is mostly about torture and that's when it become's psychological. That last part is one of the reasons that it's one of the best movies i've ever seen.I like this movie because it has such a great background story and of course because it also has a lot of gore. They don't say all that much but images say more than words. The movie is constantly messing with your head, even when it's over. Even now, months after i saw the movie, i still sometimes think about it. And then i realized it's more than a movie, because something like this is even possible in real life.

227,jez-47,Be prepared - go in cold,10,13 June 2009,"Early critics advised that you are best placed knowing as little about Martyrs as possible before viewing. Unfortunately, all the surrounding buzz focused on the unprecedented level of physical and emotional violence in this movie, prompting many (like me) to read as much about the film in order to determine if they could stomach it.Know this - Martyrs is a phenomenal horror film, but is not the gruelling ordeal many would have you believe. It's hard to understand reports of people fainting, throwing up or even leaving the theatre before the end of the first half. Yes, the movie is violent, but not to the point where all you focus on is a series of stomach-turning set-pieces (which is where the ""Saw"" franchise fell foul).So why all the fuss? Two reasons. Firstly, a lot of ""horror lovers"" have never been exposed to some of the most cutting-edge genre pics out there - ""Audition"", ""Old Boy"", ""Switchblade Romance"" and even the much-maligned ""Funny Games"". Most horror films have a satisfying closure at the end, enabling the viewer to emerge in one piece as they follow the main protagonist who usually survives. The afore-mentioned films are either devastatingly brutal or punishingly tragic. Secondly, Martyrs hits hard because of its emotional resonance. This is NOT the most graphically violent film ever made - not by a long shot. Nor is it 95 minutes of wall-to-wall torture. It does, however, deliver a series of tragic blows that leave you feeling hollow and haunted as you follow two thoroughly engaging lead characters on their path to devastation.To me, a truly great horror film should leave you just that - horrified. Dazed, a little shaky and unsettled. Movies that succeed in this way show that we are sensitised to violence, not desensitised. In conclusion, watch Martyrs cold and be amazed at what you see. Uncomfortable, uncompromising and a mighty addition to the Horror Hall of Fame.",Martyrs
228,konporer,"The groundbreaking, absolutely best and most genius of its genre",9,12 November 2018,"The ones calling this movie cheap or pretentious are like the dumb ones trying to find literature and poetry in Nobel prize winning scientific papers just to show off how well educated themselves are. This is a horror film for god's sake and horror is the thing this does so masterfully well that imo it can be considered representative of this whole genre, which is also thes reason I've no hesitation giving this movie a rating of 9.As far as any man made story or entertainment in general, the best ones are that elicit the most emotions in you, which this movie so cleverly does, patiently drags you in while playing with your sympathy with heart striking suspense and intrigue, then with orbital velocity suddenly bashes your whole existence on an iron wall that you're left with nothing but wonder and awe.Nearing the end of the movie, like in the plot, the director literally ""transcended"" all the audiences into such a height that even the most mundane motion of any characters, every little bit of extra audio or irregularities are all so suspenseful and at the same time frightening, this is literally horror at its best, something I almost ever experienced in any other horror movie.On a more meta analyzing and commenting side, the most innovative part of this film is the perfect mix of seemingly supernatural mystery and in reality torture porn, too much of the former the torture part became pointless as they're not even set in reality (E.g. an arm cut of an immortal self repairing super entity is no longer frightening, with talking heads and self moving hands every where), while too much latter, the audiences became numb as in their heart they know in the end its all fake with tomato juices. With the perfect amount of supernatural mystery the audience have the anticipation and anxiety that literally anything is possible, while at the same time with a reality setting carefully maintained, everything in the story can have the maximum impact and weight on the audience's psychology.
Anyway, in the end, the filming, actresses, special effects all did their job perfectly in this movie, together they make this imo one of the best if not the most frightening horror film human ever produced.",Martyrs

Technically, this film is quite a surprise, from the plot to the acting are all rather distinguish (as all other French films like). Although it does come up some hints that related to spiritual practice such as the victim's fully acceptance and non-resistance of the present moment (Zen or Tao), the way it conveys that spirit, like all those efforts of making through the other world, just twisted. Although it is very original to make a film like this, but I personally cannot see any intrinsic beauty or value from it, unless the purpose of the film is to get the audience go through the blood and pain suffered by the characters. This defines the film just another Saw movie. Although we all laugh at Hollywood movies' commercialness/superficialness and praise French movies being distinguish and original, I doubt if French movie can ever make up their own way to achieve the greatness in terms of spirituality such as the Last Samurai, like the American did.7/10",Martyrs
231,jk90us,WOW! What a lousy ending! Here's how it SHOULD have ended...(SPOILER),2,26 May 2009,"First off, the DVD cover kept promising this was some new genre of horror. Wrong! It's just more of the same torture porn we got from Saw and Hostel. Even the weak ""twist"" ending didn't change that fact. Even the Saw films had better twists than this one.That said, here's how Martyrs should have ended: When the old woman leaned in to listen to Anna after she saw the other world, I expected Anna to kill the bitch, then unleash her psychotic, blood-pounding wrath of vengeance against every sick f*cker in that house by killing every one of them. But, that never happened, so I feel cheated. No matter what Anna may have whispered to the old lady, Anna lost in the end. After all that suffering, she deserved some type of justice. Letting her just rot away in that tub of water while the others went on wit their lives was a spit in the face to her character and the viewers.Even if they showed Anna killing the others, then it just turns out that she was hallucinating (since the old lady said their victims tend to see things after awhile), it would have been a MUCH more satisfying ending than the ""oh, gee whiz, I wonder what the hell that ending meant"" crap they gave us.And I'm sure some people will say I just didn't ""get it"", but they're wrong.

The story revolves around 2 girls, who are looking for the people that tortured and abused one of them when she was young. I don't wanna say anything else about the story, just in case i might ruin it for some people. The acting was good, Morjana Alaoui and Mylène Jampanoï did a great job as the 2 friends.

233,dave118118,Not enjoyable... yet brilliant,9,26 January 2012,"Martyrs - 9/10 This is the only film i have ever seen that has left me feeling weak and a bit sick. I remember everyone on here talking about it when it first came out. I downloaded a dodgy version of it and when the download was complete I skipped forward halfway through the film to catch a random scene to see if I had downloaded the right thing...I can't remember which bit i caught, but whatever it was it put me off watching it on my own. Which means it must have been really bad as I generally will watch anything alone or with friends. So this downloaded film sat on my PC for ages, there was no way my GF was going to watch it with me either. I finally found a good time to watch it... NO SUBTITLES So I found a blue-ray copy in one of those trade in stores over Christmas and sat down to watch it the other day. I knew from peoples comments on here that it was going to be a rough ride and was almost guaranteed to disturb me...Well, all I can say is whatever short scene I saw that put me off watching it for years was deemed completely justifiable! To say 'it packs a punch' would be a massive understatement. The director tries his hardest to make you feel uneasy, you never know what is coming next. Just when you think you've figured it out, another twist comes along and completely unsettles you. This really isn't a film to can 'relax' and watch.I've seen so many horror films but none like this. The film primarily has two acts; The first focuses on the highly disturbed and abused girl named Lucie, who escaped torture when she was young but is still haunted by a 'demon'. It becomes apparent that this 'demon' is merely a figment of her imagination long before it is fully revealed to the viewer, so the film lures you into the false sense of security that you've figured the ending out.The scene in which the character Lucie thinks she has finally conquered her 'demon' but is also betrayed by her friend (and lover) Anna is the stand-out scene from the first act. Even though as the viewer you had known that the 'demon' was in her head, you are not prepared for the brutal demise of the first acts main character. Chilling.What follows, I thought was a wind down towards the ending. Anna discovers that the 'demon' in Lucie's head was actually real and she had been wrong in thinking she was crazy for all these years. I was expecting the credits to appear at any moments but what actually followed was the most incredible, shocking piece of cinema I've ever seen...The second act focuses on the boundaries of human suffering. It is clear that Anna isn't just being randomly abused, instead she is undergoing a much more calculated procedure with a specific intended outcome. ""Why am I watching this young girl being maliciously tortured? There better be a point to this"" is the general thought that any viewer would be going through at this stage.The final scenes, which include a very beautiful piece of cinematography, contain a mixture of; brutality, gore, pain, violence.... and tenderness. It all mixes together perfectly and produces something that I've never seen in a film before. A very ambiguous ending that leaves the viewer to fill in the blanks with their interpretation of the events they have just been a 'Martyr' too. Laugier tries his very hardest to make you feel awkward and squeamish throughout this final act and he does the job perfectly.Overall this film is absolutely stunning in many ways but I don't think I could ever sit through it again, which bewilders me! I actually rate this film very highly but could never say it was enjoyable.",Martyrs

He, the director, is in way over his head.""Martyrs"" is nothing more than an expensive grindhouse stinker, despite the glowing reviews here that demand the viewer accept this tedious exercise in repellent imagery as art. It simply isn't. Certainly the gore effects are shocking and disturbing when the movie begins to crank up the level of depravity, but eventually if you don't turn it off in disgust, you become jaded since every type of vicious death is visited ad nauseum in relentless spurts of blood. Cutting. Shooting. Beating. Pounding someone's head into jelly with a hammer. Stabbing. And so on. The ugly parade of death vignettes have a thin plot that defies logic to stitch the separate elements together.Plot holes abound here, leaving the viewer to wonder if anyone was really in charge of this bloody playacting. The first half of the movie is marginally better than the second. By the time the director springs his ""surprise"", you don't care very much. The pretentious twist thrown at you fails to resonate in any way because it feels so random. It exists merely to give credence to the torture. The movie succumbs to the idea that we should be given our doses of death in short blackout sequences before tacking on a ridiculous spiritual idea that comes way too late to salvage anyone's dignity. It's as if the director decided he'd throw a bone of ""meaning"" into the ugly goings-on and make everyone watching feel better about themselves. See? It really was about something, everyone! You're not a pervy creep for watching! It's ART, after all.No, it's not art. It's stupid. Watch at the risk of soiling your soul. The French are good at many things, among them butter and ham sandwiches, deep fried potatoes, and the Louvre. They aren't so good at horror movies.",Martyrs

237,Billygoat,Now I'm a martyr.,1,23 August 2010,"For a film that starts out with some real promise, this film sure lets you down in a way you never saw coming.The first half of the film is intriguing enough. It's outside a clearly defined genre...beginning with an almost documentary like feel as we are shown a short film taken by hospital staff of the location that a young girl (Lucy) had been tortured in. The girl had escaped her tormentors and ended up at the hospital. She is clearly traumatized.Then there are elements of Japanese horror films as Lucy sees and hears things at night while recovering in a clinic / orphanage of some kind.15 years later and we are in shotgun revenge mode a la Sam Peckinpah as the girl, now grown, believes to have found the people who tortured her. Even here the film is outside normal genre classification because we, the audience, are not sure whether the people she's found really are her former captors. Is she a righteous angel of vengeance, or a violent and deranged lunatic? Even her best friend Anna doesn't know for sure.The violence here is already astounding and horrifying - and I say this as an adult male in my 40's who has no problem with violence in films. Or so I thought. It's hard to watch people being cut or cutting themselves and it's put on display here in a very realistic way that really makes one cringe.OK, I sit through this thinking there's got to be a pay off. There isn't. And just when you think things couldn't get worse, it does. And for no discernible reason. That's what helps make it so hard to watch, particularly the last third of the film which involves a young woman being repeatedly tortured over an extended period of time. It's the fact that we don't have any reason for it. And not only are the repeated beatings senseless, but frankly, it gets tedious. I was on the verge of hitting the stop button, but forced myself to keep watching hoping for a payoff at the end.Again, I don't have a problem with violence in and of itself. I loved Takashi Miike's horror classic ""Audition"", finding the final torture scene to be brutally shocking - but in a way that worked and made his film a horror classic.""Martyrs"" doesn't achieve that shock horror at all. It's violence becomes a dark hole of tedium, and with absolutely no morally redeeming qualities whatsoever. At the very end of the film we are given an explanation for the bad guys' behaviour. Whether the explanation is one that you can accept even within the context of this film is entirely up to the viewer. I found it to be a silly cop out, a complete let down replete with pretension. At least ""Hostel"" makes no pretense to be anything other than what it is - juvenile ""torture porn"" horror. I felt completely ripped off by ""Martyrs"", which pretended for so long to be something better - but wasn't.",Martyrs
238,Fa-Rehse,It's torture porn tiiiime... again,2,3 September 2011,"Well, as I find myself in the unfortunate position of living in (or rather through) a decade where depicting torture, and only torture, seems to be the epitome of being ""horror"", I was literally forced (by some so-called friends) to watch this movie.Well, it's got all you'd expect from a torture film. It's marketed as horror, but as all torture flicks so far all the ""horror"" stems from disgusting acts of violence against helpless people. So yea, I can watch people getting tortured (stoned, burned, killed) on youtube for the next two days if i want. Martyrs does the same thing to you: It makes you angry, sick and helpless (in the sense of being forced to watch). I can see how these movies are popular ""toughness""-tests for youngsters trying to be ""cold as ice""; But as a horror movie, it fails. Why? - Because a horror movie is supposed to be fun to watch, getting scared, creeped out and laughing about it afterwards. In this movie, there's nothing to laugh about... Even worse: It's depressing.It has no scares, no real suspense, only one basic twist, it has no demons, no ghosts, no zombies, no insects, no real killer, no one running from anything... it tries to deliver a philosophical message though and a pretty basic one at that.

Yes, it is f*cked/twisted, and yes it all makes sense in the end. I did not have a problem with the portrayal of the wicked and awful things that happen- I thought that they served their purpose. They build up towards a climax and that was done properly. My problem with the movie lies in the first half, and it is probably because the creators were SO tunnel-visioned on the intense ending that they majorly overlooked the realistic aspects of the first half. Many viewers would not mind this because they too only watch for the sick ending, but if you are like me and appreciate the WHOLE film, then you too will see the flaws in this cinematography. The connection between the main characters, Anna and Lucie, seems so incredibly wrong to me. There are times when these characters will simply walk off mid conversation and I find myself thinking ""What kind of life-long friends are these??"" They give no instinctive reaction when the other is about to do something they shouldn't, and it really bothered me because this ruins the aspect that feels genuine. For being friends from childhood, stemming from similar abuse, they don't communicate well at all and I had a problem with this.",Martyrs

Everyone was talking about it as the film to see out of all that were being shown, In my humble opinion it wasn't. The first half of the film plays out like a poor imitation of Switchblade Romance, then in the second half it takes a turn towards the Saw and Hostel type of movies with a montage of physical abuse and torture inflicted on the main character culminating with her having all of her skin cut off apart from her face in order for her to reach some higher level of consciousness i.e. Martyrdom . It just couldn't decide what it wanted to be. There were elements of numerous different films all jumbled together to create this one. It wasn't original or thought provoking, it was just colour by numbers plagiarism.

247,DeltaParadox,A dramatic terror masterpiece,10,30 January 2015,"There are many things that could be said about ""Martyrs"". Some would say it is a violent exploitation film, others would say that is is a gory horror flick, but it is neither. From the first moment the film starts the viewer gets drawn into a bleak world, a young girl running away from sadistic abusers, we do not who they are yet will eventually. The girl escapes but the psychological and physical damage has already left a very severe mark. Years later an apparently simple family home becomes the setting of a horrific nightmare, a nightmare years in the making, carried out by a young woman plagued by grotesque visions symbolizing her pain when she endured as a child. Very soon the viewer knows that terrible individuals were responsible for an act that is beyond inhuman. Then the movie starts with a normal family breakfast that turns into a bloodbath, and very soon lines are blurred of who actually is the antagonist. The girl getting revenge or the people that caused her to commit a heinous massacre. The last two acts of the film combing glorious elements of existentialism and deep dramatic character development that culminates in a terrifying yet bittersweet finale. Obviously influenced by many real world cults and reminiscent of the Jonestown incident this film will leave you thinking. It really should be watched twice. People that compare this to Irreversible or Frontiers are not very smart as both of those films are garbage. Watch this film as you will not be disappointed as long as you can handle the violence. 10/10",Martyrs
248,geddyleeisgod,"A veteran horror fan, but this was stomach-wrenching....",1,3 December 2009,"I am a great fan of the horror genre, and have seen hundreds and hundreds of films, many very bloody, violent and graphic, and this is, without a doubt, the worst. There were parts I had to skip past - the violence is gratuitous, i.e. does not advance the plot, and is so brutal it is literally impossible to watch if you have any degree of human empathy.Literary theory says that you can tell how a writer feels about the types of people in his stories by the fates those characters suffer. If that is true - and I maintain it is - then Mr. Laugier has some serious issues with women that need deep therapy to correct.This is a deeply unpleasant and disturbing movie. That disturbing quality is not a redeeming factor; that is, it doesn't elicit questions for the viewer or teach anything intellectually or morally valuable. Nor is there the ""catharsis"" of shedding negative emotions. This is a movie that really did not need to be made. I would avoid it. You have been warned.",Martyrs

At first I thought Martyrs was some french word for another title..but then I realized..ahhh..Martyr...now I understand. So I went into the movie knowing nothing and came out knowing too much..but in a satisfying way. Thats how you must see this movie, without any trailer previews or reviews that just might take away some of the hard effect that this movie will endure on you.I will not say anything about the movie at all, but I will say it is terrifically acted (that is if u watch with sub-titles - do not have English dubbing playing, it will ruin it) watch it the way it should be watched and you will be able to take in all of the effect.

251,wolfm72,An artistic beacon to the genre world,10,2 April 2009,"First I have to say that all the hype about the violent nature of this movie was far too exaggerated. I'm an horror film fan since the tender age of 16 (now I'm 37) and I've seen hundreds of films that were more grotesquely and perversely violent than this one. On the other hand I have to admit that I saw the German rental DVD and I'm not quite sure if the film was cut or not. There was little information on the net and from the film itself it was not possible to tell if the German censors had again a field day with that movie, because even after 60 years after the Nazi regime art has no free right in this country to tell, or to show what it has to show, but that's a different story. In May I can tell you more about the nature of the film, when I get the unrated American edition on DVD from Amazon and can compare it to the German one. Even if the movie I saw was cut, it's still a far cry from things like Saw and Hostel, especially when it comes to term of the quality and the story of the film. What started with Alexandre Aja's film High Tension in 2005 and found it's following with Alexandre Bustillo's and Julien Maury's Inside in 2007and Xavier Gens' movie Frontier(s) in 2008 French horror directors have delivered films that stand mountain high above the genre outings from the States. I hope I allowed to quote from the DVD review of that movie from the Fangoria home page that these films are ""a shining artistic beacon to the rest of the genre world."" There is nothing more to say about this.",Martyrs

It is the most violent, horrifying and simultaneously brilliant and beautiful film I have seen in a decade or so. If you can make it through the first 40 minutes of this film you'll be hooked. Unfortunately for the weak stomached the ride only gets crazier from there. The film changes in the third act and is in fact hard to finish, but that being said, finishing the film becomes a sort of sacrifice in itself. A sacrifice offered up from the viewer to an almost perfect first 2/3rd's of an awesome horror film. Every once in a while a film comes along that defies any genre, any explanation, and any definition.

253,italbarenow,"Psychological, thought provoking horror",10,17 October 2013,"If you trace or follow the history of shocking films that are intelligent, risky, and even ahead of their time since the invention of celluloid, you get Freaks, Psycho, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, Salo and many more that are not just gore-fests. Gore-fests are really a genre of their own, and some films fit both criteria (Salo, A Serbian Film) but others are meaningless gore that lack intelligence, or a message (Cannibal Holocaust, Human Centipede). I have been sure to watch all the above mentioned films and appreciate them, but Martyrs is much bigger than all of them in terms of message. The Exorcist went from creating controversy, to actually being embraced by the Catholic Church for it's ""accuracy"" and renewing an interest in religion itself. This film is the first film on a list of horror/controversial that is truly spiritual in nature, given the darkness. I was a child who was raised by fighting segments of two families, so I was part time Catholic, part time Jewish, and more disturbingly, part time Pentacostal. There was lots of conflicting reading from bibles and torahs and exciting Revelations. I was 10 when I saw the Exorcist, and had to prove I had read the book first so an adult would bring me. Horror with religious or political undercurrents can prove the most disturbing and disruptive to the psyche, if that's your . . . sensitivity? People who are empathic, susceptible to the suffering of animals and other living things, or who have conflicted spiritual beliefs can see this positively or negatively. Schlocky B-film fans will get nothing out of this. It's so unfair to compare anything about this film to ""Hostel"" or ""Saw"" - those were checklists of ways to do special effects gore and a good reason for the term ""torture porn"". This film Martyrs can enlighten you about yourself, and your attitudes about spirituality. Don't read spoilers, and you'll have the raw unexpected reaction you should have beyond the first rather normal half of the movie. I have an addictive personality, and seeing The Exorcist at 10, and the Omen etc started a fascination with the genre that I'd like to advise those who may suffer from depression, anxiety or spiritual issues to use caution with a film like this. A similar warning in the case of another great film, Antichrist. Several years ago, I got caught up in hype banned films lists, and watched Human Centipede (silly, really high camp), Salo, Cannibal Holocaust and regrettably slipped into a malaise and sadness that took several weeks to dig out of. Likely triggered by Salo, and the research surrounding the film, the ending, the director's death, and knowledge of Italian politics.Several years go by, and now I've done A Serbian Film, Antichrist and Martyrs back to back. Bad move. I feel the sadness these artists may have used film directing of these particular films as forms of expression of a darker view of the human spirit. They are literally martyrs for the cause of film-making for our voyeuristic needs. (all directors who have suffered from depression on the record) I'm sure I may be mocked for this review as being weak in some way - but isn't film meant to make us feel? Don't we all feel in our own way? My message - use caution, and know your heart. This film makes a brilliant overall spiritual statement, that is horrifying to get to. You must not turn away, but, if you are prone to fits of depression, use caution, share the experience with others, or at least clean your palette with something uplifting or funny afterward. Believe in the light perhaps?",Martyrs
254,mvinnaco,It all hinges on the twist. Do you buy it?,8,25 October 2012,"I buy it. I believe it of the French.Twist aside, Martyrs is well made. The practical and special effects are especially good and I loved the minimalist soundtrack. It was well-acted and the script was well written (at least to my admittedly weak French). Best of all it still works as a horror film on the small screen, without needing the surround sound to ""boo!"" at you. That being said, this is not a ""for everyone"" Lionsgate Horror McNugget. If you are used to the ""scary"" crap that Hollywood churns out I can't recommend this because you might be scarred for life. This is a film for real fans of extreme cinema. Everyone else will just wonder why anyone would ever want to watch this crap. Also it isn't ""fun-scary"" with those bouncy jumps everyone likes so much. It disturbs on a deeper level. Definitely not a Halloween movie marathon party movie. Indeed, I've never shown it in any of my screenings.Now, some people think the wheels come off as soon as you know what's going on. That is the reason for the title of the review. Many of the bad reviews are coming from people who don't buy the twist (which is understandable). My recommendation: even if you don't buy the twist, roll with it. Martyrs is saying something important about how dangerous people are when they are driven by religious conviction without falling into the Christian vs Skeptic trap that so many American films land themselves in. That alone makes it worth the watch.If you can stomach it.",Martyrs
255,targosfan1,Ouch!,9,11 September 2008,"I just got back from the midnight screening at TIFF, with a typical Midnight Madness audience that I would characterize as easy to please but difficult to impress. This film impressed us, as it was clearly a cut above (so to speak) the average genre film. The first act takes recent French horror films like High Tension, Inside and Frontiere(s) and shoves them into a hyper-violent blender. So far, so good. The second, far more emotionally grisly act elevates the cinematic experience to almost art-film heights, with sadly realistic parallels to our current insane world situation. Oh, there was a vomiting patron here, too.The director was there along with the two lead actresses (who are looking much better now, I'm glad to say.) He told us that the film has secured distribution in 40 French-speaking countries, but that he hopes it will be viewed elsewhere on DVD only, to ensure that we see it uncut. Someone asked a question that referenced Michael Haneke's Funny Games, (I didn't quite hear the whole question, as the person was well back in the theater) but it really set M. Laugier off -- he denounced FG as ""shit"" and proclaimed his film ""the anti-Funny Games."" He was fine with the hour and a half brutalization of an innocent family, but felt strongly that it didn't have a sufficient point to make, or justification for the violence - ""it just ends."" I'm not sure I feel that way about FG, but it was interesting to hear his opinion. It's hard to discuss how Martyrs backs up it's pretension to be superior without spoiling it, however. To echo another comment, you'll have to see for yourself. Enjoy (not!)",Martyrs

That's good - I'm always up for a good blood-n-guts flick - I usually rent a stack every weekend because my husband is never home to be offended by my rental choices (he is ehhh much more squeamish than I.) So I get about half way through and I'm thinking along the lines of other ""torture and escape"" movies - shouldn't it be wrapping up about now? What could the second half of the movie possibly be about? The bad guys got what was coming to them, almost everyone of note is dead... what's next? What's next is quite possibly a transition into a religiously-tinged side of the plot I don't think I've ever seen before...All I can really say is: this film is not and will not be what you are expecting.Watch it and see what it ends up meaning to *you*.",Martyrs

It is a superbly acted, beautifully realized, gruesomely violent, brutally beautiful saga divided into three ""windows"" if you will - each of which is so vividly realized you feel you are right in there with the action. Everyone will be talking about what a sadistic, graphic, brutal, violent, dehumanizing, misogynist, creepy, f***ed up experience this is...and they're right...sort of. Not on the misogynist part. It's an exploration of misogyny, but so much more than that. Pascal is a genius. This film is very French too, nothing like the down-and-dirty American Hostel or Australian film Wolf Creek (both of which, for their respective sub genres of horror, were very effective too). I felt for each and every character, and just like life - each character is multifaceted and not one dimensional. There are villains in this story, victims, bystanders, creatures, monsters, misogynists, kidnappers, and traumatized children - sometimes all rolled up into one, extraordinarily interesting character. The cast really do their homework - even the guys who quickly exit the story in a surreal, ultra-violent first sequence of action. Would I recommend this to anyone? Yes! If you have the stomach for it, if you are really willing to take a trip to see a thoughtful view on the horrors of human depravity - which as ugly as it is, is so brutally beautiful in its realization because it does not flinch for an instant - that you will be mesmerized, as much as disturbed.",Martyrs

I could have stopped it at any time, but it is the kind of movie you will watch until the end....it is so bad you expect a big twist to come before the final picture, as a reward!!!! it never came. it is not particularly well acted either. as typical, I hated losing 90 mins of my precious time....I had to watch a sure value film just after to be back in love with cinema. this review will maybe tease your curiosity....don t be!",Martyrs
267,redbullrex,Somewhat meaningful,6,2 May 2021,"While it is good for it's genre, it managed to have a meaningful purpose along with it. The ending is actually good and gives us some closure to all the severe scenes that are in this movie. Therefore I give it 6 stars. Without the ending it's a 4-5. I don't recommend this movie to younger people, or even elders if they don't like an endless amount of mental and physical abuse. People that are into these type of films can watch them without it having a negative effect on them. But if you wanna watch this movie just because people tell you not to watch it, then it's not worth it and nothing good will come from watching it. I personally don't seek out movies like this because the plot usually sucks and I don't care for shock value, and this movie is not as horrible as many say it is.

Its like the movie was made by a film student who took elements from several horror movies and used them all at once in the wrong way. The movie shoots in every possible direction without hitting a single target. The main problem here, in my view, is that the movie takes itself too seriously and just goes everywhere. Its like the Director wanted to combine the exorcist, the hostel and funny games in a single picture and it just didn't work... its not appealing to me, its just cheap senseless violence.",Martyrs

The end, when one finally knows what it's all about, ecstasy or near death experience is only added to save appearances! Just an excuse for masking what the movie REALLY is about!

272,drummerboyy123,the US should really take pointers on making a good horror movie,9,2 April 2010,"The vast majority of great horror movies these days come out of France, not the US. Almost every horror movie that comes from the US is a remake now a days but the French still find a way to make amazing, creative and fresh movies. Martyrs is easily one of the best horror movies of the past decade. It's a little bit of a workout though, very hard to watch at some parts. It is extremely violent but there's none of that mindless violence you see now a days where they just put in more violence then what is needed. It gets sad at parts, more in the second half. That's why you feel drained after watching this movie, it's violent, emotionally stressful, and it works your mind to where you actually have to think a little bit when watching it. One of the most refreshing aspects of the film is that there's a reason for the madness and torture, it's not just for no reason or because it's a family of cannibals which you see all too often in films. If you're looking for a great horror movie with a great story line and great acting, you need to see this movie. If you're one of those people that don't really care for a movie that you have to watch subtitles, this should be your exception. If there's a recent horror movie that every horror fan should see, it would be this one.",Martyrs

The slowly unravelling plot line is what makes the film so special, just as you think you have sussed whats going on you're even more shocked when you find out, the DVD case lets hardly anything away attall all you know is to be prepared for gore and terror. This film is definitely a must see for any horror fans and i'm scared to wright anymore as i think knowing nothing of the story or anything adds to the beauty of the film and makes it even more shocking. Definite ten out of ten !",Martyrs
274,johnnybritton,A horror masterpiece,10,5 December 2010,"Almost banned in its native France, dividing audiences at Cannes and pushing the envelope in its stark depiction of violence, this latest entry into the new-era French horror cannon (think 'Haute Tension' and 'A'l'interieur') arrives with quite the following.It's hard to give plot details without spoiling the overall effect, so we'll just suggest you rent it instead. 'Martyrs' contains so many 'WTF?' moments you may well find yourself pausing the DVD several times; not to work out what's going on (everything is tied together in the jaw-dropping final act), but to take a breather. It's that intense.Watching 'Martyrs' for the first time is a unique, disorienting experience. Genre conventions are toppled almost immediately, when the expected revenge-horror that the movie sets itself up with gives way to Grudge-like supernatural episodes and finally an extended sequence of endurance that will test the mettle of even the most hardcore horror fan. And the gruesome finale – along with its accompanying message – will stay with you long after the credits roll.A must-see for fans of smart horror, 'Martyrs' is a raw, intelligent and brutal masterpiece that towers over shoddy American counterparts such as 'Hostel' and the 'Saw' series. The quality of filmmaking on display here is sublime, from the flawless acting of the two female leads to the gorgeous cinematography and the stellar use of sound. Perhaps what's even scarier than this movie is the fact that up next for director Pascal Laurier is a remake of 80s horror classic 'Hellraiser'. Be afraid. Be VERY afraid",Martyrs
275,holsu,"Weird, very weird",4,31 December 2008,Went to the movies without actually knowing what Martyrs is all about. I knew it was horror but...The story in short is about a little girl (Lucie)that escapes from her torturer. Then 15 years later together with her friend (Anna) she kills the guilty ones. Later Lucie dies and her friend gets trapped by the bad guys. Now Anna has to live through all that Lucie had to suffer 15 years earlier.After a bad nights sleep I had moments close to falling asleep in the audience. This was mostly because of getting so numb of all the violence. The end saves a lot since it is really surprising but when rating a movie it's hard to say how much a good end actually can save. I give 4 out of 10 since the audience really feels numb most of the movie. And remember - I like horror movies. The movie was well done. It's mostly impossible to rate the acting since the actresses just swam in blood most of the time. The script just sucked. I myself didn't get any other feelings toward the main characters except hoping they'd die. This was because the movie never built up any feelings towards the characters. It was bloody and messy from the beginning to the end and especially Lucie was so unstable to start with that I never saw any reason for her to live. Yet her friend Anna all the time tried to keep her from hurting herself. Just to collect the problems with this movie: Violence without feelings toward the victim makes one feel numb. The same sadistic acts were portrayed too many times (made me laugh). The fighting and screaming bored me. Martyrs can be recommended to very big horror and violence movie freaks but for others - don't bother.,Martyrs

I've never left a theatre during a movie, but i would if i had paid to watch this abomination. Boring and disturbing, i am trully stunned by the high ratings and the ""masterpiece"" comments. Hoped for a rewarding ending. Not even close. A total waste of time.",Martyrs
277,codylarsen,Glad I watched. Will never watch it again... Probably,9,20 November 2020,"First of all, those expecting this film to be on the level of ""A Serbian Film"" in terms of its goriness, you will probably be disappointed... or relieved, like I was. Instead, it is a brutal assault on your psyche. From the jarring woman constantly chasing Lucie, to the cold, brutal treatment of Anna (and Lucie, although mostly implied).Pascal Laugier seems to have been somewhat quiet on the actual meaning of the film... at least from what I could find. If I were to take a guess, I would think that it was in some way a metaphor for mental illness or survivors guilt, at least for the first half of the film. The lady chasing Lucie seems like a fitting ""demon"" which everyone has to some degree or another. The ending, while somewhat resolute, leaves a lot to the viewer. What did Anna see? Was it fantastic? Was it hideous? Based on the final shot of the film, I tend to think that it was fantastic.As for the technical aspects of the film, I thought that everything was nearly perfect. There was no ridiculous CGI blood spatter or cheesy music. From what I could tell, all of the special effects were practical save one inner-eye shot which was actually pretty cool. The acting was totally on point from every actor in the film and you can tell that it must have taken a real toll on some of them.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this to just anyone... it's hideously dark, humourless and extremely difficult to watch at times. It's the kind of film that will stay with you and nag at you. As one reviewer said: ""it makes Hostel and Saw look like Sesame Street.""",Martyrs
278,Voland-4,Unpleasant to watch but ultimately rewarding,7,2 November 2009,"I was somewhat hesitant to watch this at first - I frown at cinematic gynotorture, and I absolutely hated l'Interieur, a movie often cited alongside this one in reviews. Basically, my stance is: if I'm going to see people (women, especially!) get horribly effed up, there better be a great reason for it. Martyrs succeeds in that respect on multiple levels.It's a sober and focused work, unambiguous, and mostly free from the kind of self-aggrandizement and indulgence some ""extreme"" French films fall prey to. The first half or so is prime horror ribeye - sound design, timing, blood, and a certain amount of ambiguity keep the adrenaline pumping and the brain wiggling to figure out what's coming next. The second half...is somewhat different, but that's already saying too much. Yes, the whole thing is torture-y, but it's not excessive to the point of being almost unwatchable (think rape scene in Irreversible), and pound-for-pound MPAA ratings sheet-style, it's not nearly as graphic as, say, Antichrist or even Cannibal Ferox. Nothing but praise for technical execution - acting, makeup, lighting, etc. And most importantly, there's a common (and rather lofty) Idea at work across multiple levels, one you'll ruminate upon after seeing the film much more than upon any single blood-splattered scene.The only downside is that it's rather unpleasant to watch, which remains a downside even though this film cannot possibly be any other way. The story arc is also a strange roller-coaster, with all the ""boo!"" moments over and done with way before the movie actually ends.Definitely worth seeing, if only once.",Martyrs

All others should think twice before watching Martyrs. You are not going to forget it anytime soon. Apart from the movie's subject matter, there is a lot more to say about the movie.

So, I have very few horror movies that I would consider great. Most have a moment or two that are entertaining, and the majority are just awful. Martyrs had the chance to be one of the greatest horror movies I've ever seen. From the opening scene to the climax this movie was disturbing. Scene after scene of sheer terror and disgust. This movie had it all. There was a lapse of redundancy that went on for quite a while. But, that was tolerable. Then it got to the pay-off. The reason for this young woman's torture, and it was so STUPID, MORONIC and UNBELIEVABLE that it ruined all the brilliance that came before it. There are many who defend the pay-off, they're full of it. Yes, people have done things in the name of God before, terrible, awful things. But, nothing like this, and not for any reason close to this stupidity. If you enjoy violence for the sake of watching violence, if watching humans suffer terribly for no good reason at all, then you will love Martyrs.This had the chance to be absolutely brilliant, instead it was just pure torture porn for nothing.

It was not for me and I give it a 5/10 because I really didn't enjoy the end.

285,kabeile,There are not many movies like this one...,9,22 September 2009,"First of all: This movie is sick, really sick! It is disgusting. To watch it from the disturbing beginning to the relieving ending was painful and i think the writer/director needs some serious counseling! BUT: It's also a stunning piece of art. The fundamental questions are: What does the writer/director want to express with this movie? What are his intentions? And: Does anyone need a movie that shows us every detail of ruthless slaughter, torture, skinning, beating and killing?The Answer is: I AM STILL NOT SURE!!! But this is perhaps the reason, why this movie is a piece of art, not often watched in todays cinema. This movie is thought-provoking. It doesn't send you home with a few nice laughs, a see-through story and it isn't entertainment.This movie only cares for the victims. This is why i think that the violence depicted is necessary. It doesn't make you numb. It even sharpens your sensitivity and you suffer with the victims while watching it.Here in Germany, last week a man was beaten to death in the subway by two teenagers. He came to help some kids, that were molested by the two teenagers. I think a movie like MARTYRS could show those sickos what they do to their victims. This is why I think, that e.g. KILL BILL could be more ""dangerous"" than MARTYRS. Tarantino's movies (which i also adore) always follow the ""bad guys"" and show them as heroes, while the victims die off-screen. They show that violence is cool and funny. MARTYRS shows that violence is disgusting and sick!",Martyrs

Much of the gore effects and makeup are make-for-TV quality at best. The cinematography/lighting/etc. are very bland which contributes a great deal to the lackluster appearance of the effects. The high concept explanation is laughable as is the ending. The pacing is awful as the film burns itself out before the 45 minute mark. It begins being somewhat atmospheric with some spooky moments in the first 30 minutes but that fizzles out as well. Basically, even if you just want a gore film you're wasting your time. Martyrs reminds me a lot of the Saw series in the sense that it was just quickly thrown together and every aspect from the story to the effects to the photography really suffer as a result.

I'm not a fan of gore, as most of the focus more on the sick scenes instead of the storyline. Sure there are rare cases where gore movies are worth watching, like the Saw franchise, but even those get pointlessly sickening at some point.'Martyrs' is no exception. If you like watching pointless torture and bloody scene, this movie is for you. Watching a human being inflicting corporeal torture to another human being is disturbing enough. Watching the torture without substantial reason is just beyond me. If you're looking for a smart plot line and pleasant surprises, you better watch 'Inception' instead. Even 'Cabin in the Woods' might be a better choice to satiate your horror thirst. 'Martyrs' does try hard to give a surprise mind-blowing end, however, it doesn't at all redeem the boring and empty 99 minutes I had to go through.

The first being a revenge and cleanup operation tackling issues like mental illness, the lasting effects of child abuse and how far we will go to protect a loved one.The second, a sick operation run by the elite to experiment on young girls and their pain tolerance I guess, and whether they can achieve martyrdom (this is where it gets silly).They could really be stand alone but do work well together.

Let me say this, the first 45 minutes are one intense hellride. The next twenty five minutes are even worse because MAJOR SPOILER the ghost is actually alive. Then, we have the last twenty minutes which seem at first to be duller and slower than the rest of the movie. They are. But, do not despair, there is still one OHMYGODMOTHERF###INGSH#T HOWTHEF###DIDTHEYDOTHAT? moment waiting. It was absolutely horrifying. And the ending, unlike so many Hollywood endings or half-baked endings by amateur auteurs not only fits the entire film, but is the perfect ending. It is not happy.On the more psychological and thematic elements...Martyrs is about the search for truth, both that of the victim and that of the torturers. Is any truth revealed? No. That is the point of the film, in my opinion, that the truth requires great sacrifice and pain and without that, it will forever be elusive.Myself, I can do without truth if it means I get to skip the torture.

Being a guardian angel is an other younger girl helping her stay in contact with reality. But this is just the established starting point. I won't go into describing the turns and twists of this movie because they play a rather important role in creating the mood and feeling. But i didn't find the points i found interesting about this movie in other reviews. The visual solution is not so subjective as usually is done in these kind of movies with a person suffering from some kind of mental problems. It connects you to the main protagonists but still it's rather distanced, as watched from a safe point of view. I guess it's because of the gore content, which shown in a more subjective, emotional (or painful) way would make this movie unacceptable than it is. But still you can say that it's not the extreme like other reviewers are saying. It's not the top, but it's made right like it should be because gore violence is not really the aim here.I'd say the idea behind is the pivotal point why this movie works. Though violent against women, it works strong in putting women in a role of a messiah. You cannot avoid seeing similarities with Jesus Christ and Jeanne D'Arc.Being the victim of a sick world, the crazy, insane girl becomes a saint. In some way it's a resemblance to the modern world increased in intensity to the limits. Still the problems of a Western world inhabit lives of all these characters. The killing burden of conscience, struggle for a higher knowledge inaccessible to human mind, struggle for immortality. It's all there in a physically sensible way. I'd say this movie goes as far as being a manifest of feminist philosophy. Not many horror movies i've seen are as multilayer-ed as this one. Nevertheless extremely hard to watch, not for everyone.",Martyrs

I finished Cemetery Man and pick this movie , praised highly but I approached with prejudice as IMDb reviewers had let me down before(No Country for old men) . And they did it again .The movie left me disappointed and mad to the point I registered on IMDb just to write this review . Truly this movie was worthy of its praises ! The movie starts off good , with average amount of horror , blood and action . It was exciting and the rescue of a *tortured survivor* was a nice touch . It was good seeing Anna , the MC care for the survivor but things went FUBAR . The survivor dies , the 2nd MC dies . After that , everything is predictable . You'll know what happens to MC but what you won't know is how tedious the movie gets .2nd half kicks in and you'll be treated with torture scenes . Not violent , I watched Hostel and Cannibal Holoucast . Martyrs aren't that violent . But these scenes are long-winded , repetitive , they become tedious and boring . Suddenly you felt , what's the point ? Just stop ! Certain quarters believe that all this is to instil hope , by the viewer , towards the MC(anna) . Yet the MC was unsympathetic , little background and backstory . She was just another teen trapped in horror movie .Quantity over quality , equals large dropped in entertainment and good amount of boringness . The torture scenes shouldn't have been that long , time should be allocated for more character development .Repulsive ? Because the movie simply glorifies torture . Torture will free you , give you the sight of afterlife . The messages are obvious in the torture scenes . I'm not a masochist , so the scenes simply becomes repulsive . I fast forwaded the slapping and punching scenes , but never did that in Cannibal Holoucast because they didn't glorify torture in terms of religion and spiritual .At the end , the ending was left ambiguous . The film had a weak story , it's basically women tortured by group consist of elites so that the women reached a point of insanity and see a vision of afterlife . The blame falls on the writer..yes ? Not , not if you provide an ambiguous ending . Viewers will have to form an interpretation , and thus the blame shifts to the viewers , dividing the audience into 2 . Those who dislike simply because they saw the core of this hollow trash . Those who like it because the ambiguous plot becomes a cotton wool that blinds their judgment .Indubitably , the ambiguity was a nice touch but when you see past that , the movie was terrible and disappointing . The high ratings of this movie unveils more masks , showing how viewers are easily swayed by ambiguous plot . Or is it because of the glorified torture ? coming from a movie said to be of *new era* *highly philosophical* *disturbing* ... Utterly repulsive . What has our society become ?",Martyrs

298,Aurdreyen,This has to be one of the most beautiful movies to exist,10,13 April 2012,"Martyrs is definitely one of the best movies ever made, not just in the horror genre but in the whole movie industry. The movie is packed with superb acting, meaning and ruthless and bloody entertainment.In the first half of Martyrs, we are shown a disturbing, bloody view into what lives for Anna and Lucie are like. Lucie escapes from the hostile environment she had been kept in and tortured, and in later years she decides to take revenge against her captors. This is like your typical horror at first, packed with gore and disturbing violence and seems to keep the story at a steady pace.Then we come into the second half, and the tone and plot change completely. We are introduced to meaning, which is something no horror has ever done and mental torture rather than physical. Everything in the second half is a new and exciting look at what horror movies need to do to grab the viewers fear. It's brilliant.Martyrs is a very unique piece of art, a horror movie that isn't ignorant and obnoxious like other modern horrors. The acting is superb, I've never seen actors having to cry, scream so much, the plot is brilliant as it changes direction and the meaning of this movie is something every single human being will relate to.10/10",Martyrs
299,mkczup,Lacking in coherent structure,4,27 May 2012,"IMDb was right to put this in the same category as High Tension. Like its counterpart it relied heavily on atmosphere and cinematography and misses the mark on the follow through. This movie viewed as though it had three separate directors. The first part of the movie is suspenseful and action-packed, following Lucie through the blood-spattered execution of her torturers. It is intense and compelling as Lucie faces the demons of her past while dragging her unsuspecting friend Anna (and the audience) along for the ride.Then the movie tapers off. Lucie, unable to cope with her trauma commits a brutal suicide and Anna becomes the focus of the film as she tries discover the secrets of Lucie's past. It is a rocky switch of pace, and after the shocking first half hour Anna fumbling seems to drag on. Even her inevitable capture and subsequent torture seems feebly dull.The last part of the movie centers on the concept of martyrdom and Anna's martyrdom. From here we see yet another directorial change as the film seems to be stumbling blindly for something poignant. It leaves the audience grasping at straws while trying to make them believe they've seen a philosophical masterpiece.If the film had been consistent in following the trail left by the first part it could very easily have been a great movie. Lucie's story was compelling and intense. The film hinted at other horror mediums such as ghosts, demons, and (my personal favorite) the psychological thriller. But in the end it was nothing but a common torture porn.",Martyrs
300,theseitzgroup,A Must See Blend of Excellence,10,23 February 2016,"Surprisingly there are a bevy of bad user reviews for this film and contrary to these I really loved this film. You will too. I must say, I was very impressed at how intelligently laid out the story line is, the excellent twist of plot, the character composition, the atmosphere and the superb acting-- and therefore it is a 'must see' in my book.I enjoy intelligent films and have a morbid curiosity for the twisted ones. This one did not disappoint and surpassed expectation. Anyone who says it had no purpose or is just torture porn clearly missed the beautifully unraveling story and main premise. The film touches on a believable topic in pushing the scientific envelope and yearning to understand the afterlife. The entire premise is based on the belief by a group secret researchers that beyond the pinnacle of pain, torture and suffering, just prior to death the strong willed touch the ""other side"" and experience heavenly bliss. The way in which the writer/director arrives at this is simply beautiful, smart and horrifying. The story alone would make for a bestselling book. But the way in which the ""shock"" is trickled among the emotion and depravity of mental illness, revenge, afterlife and hanging on to life through pain coupled with the ending is like nothing else out there in film.Of course, there are brutal scenes but it pales in comparison to some of the unintelligent teeny bopper slashers that lack substance. I found myself cringing a bit yet I understood eventually there was a purpose- - to show that Anna had to bare the brunt of this pain to fight death and experience the ultimate bliss. She is a survivor. She lived on through the torture by having hope to escape like Lucie had, yet the researchers wanted her to live for their own selfish purpose. The second act was the most captivating piece for me because Anna goes through all the stages of despair and suffering to an ultimate horrifying climax. The movie moves from elated escape to exacting revenge, to mental horror to scary monster, to horrific discovery, to pain and suffering and finally to a climactic finish.I highly recommend this film for those who are tired of the same old Hollywood pieces and teeny bopper plots. This movie is something more. This movie is a Martyr in and of itself.",Martyrs
301,airlight-europe,I'm practically speechless,8,20 February 2010,"I just saw this movie about 15 minutes ago, and I am still in some sort of shock from it. It is relentless, atmospheric, and unbelievably brutal. The violence depicted in the movie is so realistic I am still stunned I saw what I actually saw. There are movies a lot more bloody, chaotic and visually disgusting than this, but this is the first time I feel literally traumatized by a movie.The only thing I really feel I can comment on at this point is the performances of the actors in the film, which is nothing short of incredible. Generally the acting was so convincing I felt more like I was watching a documentary than a work of fiction, and to have this level of performance consistent throughout the horrendous events amazes me to no end.Also I should mention make-up, which is second to none, and helps things seem incredibly authentic.If you are willing to endure something that will most likely shock and disgust you to no end, do not hesitate to see this movie.

302,jeff-993,Misguided Garbage,3,4 August 2010,"I'm as big a horror movie fan as anybody, and I didn't care for this one at all - there seems to be a new trend in French horror filmmaking of great talent in camera-work/performances/eruptions of gore joined with completely idiotic storytelling. After a promising start with the two lead characters as young girls, the film moves to a family scene in the vein of Michael Haneke's loathsome Funny Games, as the filmmakers introduce us to a set of ordinary, likable characters, then blow them away in an orgy of sadistic violence. This kind of strategy has been effective in other films, but here it just feels like a trendy way to provide a gratuitous shock. For a while the movie toys with some pointless plot tangents (one of the lead girls wrestles with a demon from her subconscious, a mindless torture victim is paraded in front of us for no particular reason but grimy spectacle) until finally the movie gets around to its pretentious final act: the film's lead character is brutally tortured until she reaches a level of (maybe) spiritual ecstasy, reminiscent of Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc. But without any, you know, actual feeling or spirituality to it - the whole final act is merely justification for all the otherwise pointless brutality, strained and pretentious. If you got some actual uplift from the film, then good for you. I didn't.",Martyrs

The second part is depraved and unwatchable and yet I was compelled to carry on until the end to find out what would happen. No movie has stuck with me quite as long as this, with maybe the exception of Irreversible which is responsible for my newfound fear of underpasses. It is hard to describe how Martyrs makes you feel, whilst watching I felt desperate, helpless and thoroughly involved, for a while afterwards I felt a bit sick and confused. But not necessarily in a negative way, its very difficult to put into words and I'm glad to see others felt a similar way. In regard to the long, torture scenes; I wanted to fast forward through them, but you almost feel you owe it to the character to stay with her. The acting is superb and makes the film feel horribly horribly real. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the motive/ending. I was waiting to whole film to find out why these people were taking and torturing girls, only to find out the reason is ""we want to see whats on the other side so we have to torture them to the point where they basically die and hopefully they are still alive to relay what they experience"". It is a pretty stupid idea and not well executed. It was also frustrating not to hear the answer after the audience had just watched a woman being skinned alive, but I can see why it was done that way. I guess I really wanted redemption for Anna in the end that was never realistically going to come. This is a great horror film but it is not for everyone, even all horror fans, and I can't imagine watching it at a much younger age than i did (20).",Martyrs

As we watched together, I went and looked for anything that could make me hold on to the characters, to the story, anything...I couldn't find anything. The story is pretty messed and lacking in content, it's form is pretty basic and in the whole character meta you don't have to look for anyone but the two ladies, no one is worth more than a few lines, every one is a tool to build the plot, making the whole movie boring and lacking of surprises.As the story and the gruesome violence goes on, I feel repulsed by the whole idea of the plot, nothing is of significance in the story, nobody is worth any questioning and every part of the movie goes as an obvious scheme towards more violence and pain with very few meaning.

Unfortunately the movie goes on just a little bit too long for me and doesn't hold up. I don't need to go on about the premise of this film as you can read that on other reviews. What I will tell you that is the violence is truly graphic and leaves little to the imagination.It totally seems just a little to excessive especially in the last 20-30 mins of the movie. I truly believe that less is more and if it had ended just 20 -30 mins earlier my rating would have changed to an 8 or 9 out of 10.It had a great pace and was quite disturbing and has some nightmarish visions to say the least. But it pales in comparison to ""Inside"" as far as intensity goes.To me it seems that the director had a vision and somehow lost it toward the end of the film and maybe thought that he had to explain in greater detail. I think if he had left it to us to ponder of what did happen?It would have been a much more effective film.Thats why I gave it only a 6 out of 10.",Martyrs

Recently, I bought my own copy which is still unopened. The reason for this is that although Martyrs is a must-have film for any decent collection, it is incredibly hard to watch, hence my reluctance to sit through it again. And my reluctance comes purely from my inability to stomach the absolute inhumanity and level of violence within. This has been compared many films in the ""hostel"" ilk, but trust me, this has the barest of connections to those films. This raises the game to near perfection and although I find this deeply unsettling to watch, I cannot deny the artistry involved- Well shot and perfectly acted with a storyline unknown until the very end- and that part reaches the pinnacle of monstrosity within this film. I don't know if this can be classed as ""Horror""- I'm thinking that Martyrs may well have created its own Genre. An absolute must-see film, and certainly one of a kind.",Martyrs

I've seen hundreds of Horrors and Gory thrillers but I just left the cinema almost ashamed I had to walk past patrons claiming ""That was so scary"" and ""I feel sick"". The violence in this film was so ridiculously played out that I simply couldn't give this a higher rating. The opening scene was promising and reminiscent of the Swedish classic Thriller but just little sense from there on. Also, it really didn't make you care. Oh well, I guess my point being that Im sure another ""torture horror"" film will be out to out do this in a few months time. What happened to decent scares without humiliation. It wasn't even uncomfortable...just predictable and stupid. I know people will be reading this thinking ""oh but it was so beautiful and original"" well OK but just stop thinking arty nonsense like this is the future.

There could have been more background to it(the last parts) & insight into the characters that were introduced later. It just felt to me like they decided to come up with a twist at the last minute & this was the result. It just didn't mesh well. I wouldn't recommend the movie itself to anyone.

319,lepermessiahtr,"""The saddest thing in life is wasted talent."" (Part 1 of 2)",1,9 June 2009,"Nota bene: Unlike most other reviewers which rate 1 star I am NOT criticising the movie for its violence, so please read my whole review before you vote ""No."" --- ""The saddest thing in life is wasted talent."" Martyrs (2008) is a perfect illustration of this saying, since the potential this movie had had was huge. Sadly what could have been a masterpiece got shot to hell by an abysmal screenplay.Setting: A tortured girl takes revenge. Sadly after 50 minutes the original story is dropped completely and the film magically changes into a stupid and absurd ""Hostel"" clone. So the businessmen are replaced with religious nuts, it's still the same angle! Actors: I think Mylene Jampanoi and Morjana Alaoui do fantastic jobs in this movie. Their dialogue performance and facial expressions are shining lights in this catastrophe of a movie, which makes the waste of their talent even sadder. I honestly don't care about the rest of the cast, my perception of Martyrs is focused on the two women who are adorning the DVD cover. I am not exaggerating when I say: ""When Lucie dies, the movie dies."" Story: Lucie takes revenge on the people who tortured her 15 years ago and thus destroyed her whole life. It is shown explicitly that she hit the right people (in the last flashback). Enter Anna. Anna is supposed to be her very, very close friend. After all the two have been staying together for 15 years! This is basically proved by: A) the phone conversation Anna has with her mother and B) Anna's undisputable huge affection for Lucie that she had already shown as a child and C) the fact that Lucie is extremely dependent on her friend Lucie hurts herself sometimes or even often (she bears scars, also Anna is very experienced in dressing wounds, which tells a lot) and might not have even survived without Anna. What the two do for a living is sadly never even hinted in the movie, mainly because the screenplay writer didn't think the story through thoroughly enough. (even though Anna's mother cruelly suggests Lucie was a whore, there is no chance in hell this could be remotely true) So Anna seems to be in unrequited love with Lucie (remember, 15 years (!) - and they haven't worked out any definite solution for that matter!). The scene where Lucie smiles for a second - the first and only time in the whole picture - and Anna just HAS to kiss her, only to be rejected (obviously a kiss on the neck and cheek is fine, but the mouth is taboo?), with her afterwards struggling in utter desperation not to try and kiss her again is very well acted. Lucie pushes her away again later, when they hide from the ""beast"" upstairs and Anna attempts to embrace her to calm her down. Lucie's true feelings remain unexplored, since at this very point in her life she obviously is drowning in emotional and physical chaos, not to mention her violent delusions and overwhelming sense of guilt, so the few scenes we get might not be actually expressing the whole range of feelings she has for Anna. Either way, the fact that Anna loves Lucie is undisputable. Lucie's behaviour can be explained with the great deal of distress and pain she is under. However, Anna's contradictory behaviour is the knife that slits this movie's skin of internal consistency wide open and ruins the film even before everything goes straight to hell after 50 minutes (more on that below).Anna loves Lucie, yet she doesn't trust her fully. Or at all. I don't know, but to me that makes no sense whatsoever! At no moment in the first 40 minutes (which is the instant of time of Lucie's suicide) Anna believes that Lucie has indeed killed the correct targets. Why, it seems Anna does even doubt the whole torture story, even though she clearly must have seen that Lucie was hurt and gravely disturbed when the two girls got to know each other in the orphanage (first flashback)! How logical! So, since I have to choose one path in these paradoxical crossroads, I assume that Anna is indeed ""repulsed"" by the sudden reality of the murders, shocked out of her mind by the corpses and blood. She realizes that it was an unforgivable mistake not having accompanied Lucie on her fateful trip. Anna might not be the smartest person on Earth, which is still no excuse for her random behaviour.(due to the 1000 word-restriction this review is continued in part 2 under the name jcdenton666)",Martyrs

As well made as this film is, the subject matter is just so utterly disturbing I wanted this film to end a long time before it actually did. It is not a film that is to be enjoyed. It is not the escapism that you may be looking for. The first Act is a revenge story on a family who may or may not have been responsible for the kidnapping and torture of a young girl 15 years previously. It is the second Act though that is the more disturbing. The viewer wants it to end almost as much as the girl captured wants her ordeal to end. This is a must-see movie but certainly one that is going to divide audiences right down the middle.",Martyrs
330,DonKowalski,nothing more but a good horror flick,6,7 September 2009,"At least I have to say that the director seems to know how to push the right buttons.But honestly, how can some critics on IMDb call this art or even a master-piece? Did I missed something? There was indeed quite a innovative storyline and the elements of drama are very well made. On the other hand, many things stay unexplained and this is not for the sake of the viewers imagination. It just seems like they were not thought to the end (the cult e.g.).The movie is like a very well made french version of ""Hostel"" maybe even better than the ""original"". However, I wouldn't call it a mayor breakthrough as some ppl do. To show violence as explicit as possible is simply not sufficient.To compare it with Haneke's ""Funny Games"" or Noé's ""Irreversible"" is just ridiculous. They are master-pieces for real and not part of the entertainment-machinery, while this production surely is.Anyway, worth a watch....",Martyrs
331,ngathant,I thought I knew movie violence.. FCUK was I wrong!,10,7 December 2010,"So I was watching SAW series, Hostel, Hannibal & Texas Chainsaw the other day and I was pretty proud of myself that I have the balls to watch such movies and enjoy them. FcuK! I almost siht in my pants watching this movie & that was fukcnig awesome! First off, loved Mylene''s character. A LOT! I can't seem to recall a profound story in all the violent movies I've seen but this Martyrs' was a masterpiece. The story was very realistic and can be related to anybody. That's probably why it was so sick.I didn't knew Martyrs was violent. I saw a cover online somewhere and liked Mylene's look and planned to watch it. HELL! It was fresh and a lot lot more than I expected. I was hooked on the first scene of violence. It goes BOOM without a warning. I was skeptic about that ghost woman Lucie was seeing but it finally made sense. The story kept me on the edge of my seat from then on and never stopped. I had difficulty breathing for about 10 minutes after the last test. I was stupid thinking oh what he's going to spin her now. How is spinning her going to make it worse than beating her up and waking up to beat her up again. HELL I never expected what was coming.It's a 10 for me. I'm becoming a Mylene' fan after this movie =) I thought nothing's gonna be sicker than Hostel. Man, I'm watching French violence from now on. The story as a whole and every scene made me sick! and that was AWEEESOME!",Martyrs
332,joelseeman,makes you think,9,8 May 2009,first off just let me start by saying this. i have seen a lot of movies but i never wanted to open an account on this page so bad. this movie while yes gory and disturbing makes you think about just how sick some people are. and for the people who didn't like it i feel sorry for you it shook me to the core. i have been waiting for a movie like this. i'm an American and i have to say im very ashamed of my countries quality of horror and psych like thrill rides. we try with terrible movies like saw one of the worst horror series ever.then this piece of art comes along and restores my faith in this very genre which has suffered do to bad titles. i will refer this film to all my friends and you should see it as well.,Martyrs

334,Matt_Corkhill,"Bleak, gritty, miserable.",9,4 February 2013,"I know lots of people resent the whole ""torture porn"" trend in recent cinema. But I think that what all of those movies share is a sense of entertainment, a sense of thrill or elevated heart-rate. In Saw or Hostel, we cringe and go ""jeez!"" or ""whoah man! gross!"". I don't know why - maybe it's because of the way those film are made - they still retain some Hollywood sense of glamour, and don't have enough grit; they put all their effort into shocking torture porn that all we get is a visual blood orgy with nothing substantial or meaningful to back it up other than some $1-store story put together overnight. When I walk away from films like that, as I did with Hostel etc., I forget about them quite quickly.Martyrs was different...I think people who call it ""torture porn"" haven't seen enough torture porn. It's hard to put your finger on exactly what makes it different, but this movie stayed with me long after I watched it. It was the first time that I actually empathised with the characters; the cruelty and indifference was so much more vivid and mentally-impressing than anything I had seen before. I was left with a feeling of desolation and powerlessness. I couldn't sleep the night I watched this film, not out of fear, but more a kind of anxiety. I like to think of myself as being thick-skinned, which is why, for me, the fact that it stayed with me for a while makes it a success.",Martyrs

I know that a friend of mine actually cried during the movie and another friend couldn't take it so he fast forward it.The movie closest to this is Irréversible but about 10x worse.I'll never watch this or Irréversible twice.If there ever should be an 18+ discretion then Martyrs and Irréversible deserve it.",Martyrs
337,Teena_Reid,French Cinema at it's Best!,9,15 January 2015,"This movie is one of the new wave of French horror from the past 15 years, such as ""High Tension"" and ""Frontier(s)"". I have to say the acting is amazing and the effects and gore are as well. It starts out that the character, Lucie, is abused and gets away. She ends up in a pediatric psychiatric hospital/orphanage. She won't talk about what happened to anyone. She finally ends up making a friend, Anna. Flash forward 15 years and Lucie sees the people that hurt her in the newspaper and hunts them down to seek revenge through murder. She is tormented by a figment of her imagination, a girl she left behind when she escaped. Finally, her friend Anna notices that the woman Anna shot, that abused her, is not dead and goes to help her. This results in Lucie thinking that Anna never believed her. She freaks out and kills herself. Anna ends up finding a stairway to a basement where there are pictures on the walls of tortured people. She even finds a girl that's been tortured that she tries to help. The girl is so traumatized, she ends up trying to run away and gets shot. It turns out that the people doing this were involved in a group that was trying to create martyrs, basically to see what is in the afterlife. You see Anna go through every kind of torture imaginable. Finally she's skinned alive. She lives and the leader of the group gets her to tell her what she sees. (Which you never find out.) The group shows up to hear what is in the afterlife, but the leader shoots herself before she tells anyone. Overall, don't over think it. It's worth the watch. The plot, acting, and effects are amazing. Give it a try!",Martyrs
338,carlvdl,Horror fan? Possess a brain? Don't miss.,10,18 November 2014,"For fans of French horror of the past decade or so, this is not to be missed. I put off watching it for quite some time, partly due to wanting to savour this genre over as long as possible, but also based on the description alone I knew I'd have to steel myself to finally sit down and watch it. Martyrs never lets you go for a minute, but I must admit, is strongest and most jarring during the first half. Once you're in the second half, there is still a sense of dead, but you know it can't really get any worse. The final lead up ventures more into cerebral, even philosophical or religious territory. One small gripe for those wanting perfect realism, technology or physics wise: shotgun blasts don't send people flying backwards like a projectile, makes for an impressive effect though!Here's the plot: two girls (Anna and Lucie) meet and befriend one another at an orphanage. One of the girls (Lucie) escaped from captivity where she was subject to extreme mistreatment by a cult obsessed with the experience of life after death. Once grown into (excessively beautiful and exotic, for those of you for whom that's important) women 15 years later, Lucie locates her former tormenters, and draws Anna into an episode of vengeance and depravity from which neither can escape.Again, some horror can have 'light' moments, where the viewer can even revel, be joyous, even at some of the violence, which may appear as righteous given the circumstances. Not so with Martyrs. There are no winners here, from start to finish - true horror.",Martyrs

This definitely stands above what we see mostly from production companies like Blumhouse (Who I think had a part in the stupid and uninspired American Remake) as it's not afraid to take risks and go all out with everything it has to say! Hopefully one day this film will be treated with more respect in the future, and maybe Hollywood will someday decide to take interest in the more unconventional route.

341,rafeortiz,A masterpiece that most won't get.,9,15 April 2020,"I was crushed by this movie. Most people will talk about all the violence and brutality depictured in ""Martyrs"", but for me that wasn't nearly the most terrifying thing in this movie.""Martyrs"" is deep dive into the darkest and deepest aspects of fear, guilt, depression, anguish and even love, a feeling that sometimes can be the most destructive of all. It's a big allegory for traumas, the demons that we create in our everyday lives, in other people's lives, and even for when we become those demons ourselves. It not only shows how evil a human being can truly be, how far people would be able to go for their own goals, but how scars caused by this evil, can make someone be consumed by madness, and they will simply not be able to heal, wich is one of the most crushing sentiments i got from this movie.I felt like all the violence shown in ""Martyrs"" was just a diversion, something to distract me from the true darkness that this movie carries. Beacause if you watch this, and somehow feel like it is reflecting something that you felt at some point, or are feeling right now, that's when this movie becomes a little dangerous, because it takes the worst things that exist in our society, mainly specifically the psychological problems that we face nowadays, and put it to an extreme, showing the last and worst consequences of the actions.Once again, this movie is truly violent and relentless, but it's also raw, and cold, it is not trying to be a gorefest, it's not trying to be ""Torture-Porn"", there isn't any beauty or joke, ""Torture-Porn"" is often used as dark humor, it is actually trying to be funny (sometimes it ends up being funny without trying), but one i can assure you that ""Martyrs"" isn't, it's funny, this movie will haunt you, if not with the violence, with its themes.""Martyrs"" easily divides the audience, some people will be disturbed by its graphic content and won't notice the feelings behind the actions, while other people will be haunted by those feelings, and maybe feel like some of the violence is misplaced. However i was able to see the movie with balance, and it made me see it with its full potential, with one thing complementing the other the actions feel natural considering the suffering that the characters go through, and also those same actions prevent us from relating too much to these characters, wich can be dangerous, i know this sounded a little contradictory, but it made sense in my mind.""Martyrs"" is masterpiece of horror, even if you didn't get it, i encourage you to watch again (if you have the guts). If you are able to watch it at its full potential like i did (at least i think i did), it will become a classic for you, instantly.",Martyrs

Although violent, it is absolutely integral to the story telling, as opposed to gore and jump scares for cheap shock value.

344,siminel,Piece of Crap,1,17 February 2013,"Martyrs. Now that I think about it, I don't know what I imagined Martyrs to be, but certainly not this! With a rating of 7 on IMDb from over 32.000 voters, I expected something decent at least. And it failed my expectations. Martyrs is a splatter film (but I prefer the term ""torture-porn"") that starts by presenting us the story of Lucie, a girl who has been kidnapped for unknown reasons, and tortured by some blond lady. But Lucie escapes and then we see her at an orphanage where police officers are trying to make her talk so they would catch the perpetrators. But she's haunted by the spirit of some girl left behind, which later will prove that it's been all in her imagination. Not the torture, but the ghost. 15 years later, Lucie murders brutally a family of four and calls Anna, her girl friend from the orphanage to come and help her, because the spirit is tormenting her. Well, Anna arrives, and for more than half of the film, gore scenes everywhere. Gore here, gore there, gore gore everywhere. Right. And then Lucie kills herself with a little help from her special little friend and Anna stays behind, not really knowing what she's got herself into. But soon she discovers a secret chamber in that special special house, where not long ago, lived a perfect perfect family with happy happy lives. Well, we soon discover, that the family was not so perfect. In fact, they were some twisted motherf***ers.Anna is captured by some evil persons, all dressed in black (I hoped they were from another planet, really) and then she gets tortured for the rest of the film. Really. And then, we get the explanation of why those men (and women) in black were doing this nasty stuff. They wanted a martyr to see what's the afterlife like. And surprise surprise, the ones that really wanted to know, were rich and old. Like that is going to help them!As far as I know, Martyr is a person willing to be tortured and persecuted for his/her own belief. So that's why I find this movie so wrong. If I were to be tortured for someone else's beliefs, would I have visions to answer their questions? And if so, would I tell them? F**k, No! They f***ing tortured me for a thing I don't believe in! I'm already past fear and terror, why would I help them?? First of all, a person in terrible pain will become delirious and hallucinate, but not the spiritual crap. All they is fragments from their life, randomly chosen by the brain, and showed in a different/dreamy manner. So yes, Martyrs is a torture-porn. Just like Saw, just like Hostel. But at least in Saw, he wants to change people and in Hostel, they do it for pleasure and money. In Martyrs, they do it for nothing.I give 2/10 for the effort.",Martyrs
345,slayer_4,visually great but yet completely boring,3,21 October 2008,"First of all, before i start this comment, i got to say that i'm a huge horror movie fan so my dislike for this movie has nothing to do it. I've seen horror movies from every corner of the world and i've got to say, this was one of the worst horror movie have ever seen in my life.Don't get me wrong, visually, this movie is great and i love every special effect use in this movie, the main actress were also very good and i'm sure they will have a long career in this genre. But the thing is the story isn't that great.The film starts alright with the scene of Lucie escape and here upbringing in the orphanage, then again great home invasion sequence, you really felt the anger of Lucie during that segment, then the film start dying of a slow death until we get to the last 30 minutes of pure torture and not just for Anna but for the entire audience in the theater because seeing the same thing over and over again for 30 minutes is boring as hell and the reasoning behind the torture is really lame.I saw this movie last Sunday at the FNC in Montreal and when the movie started the theater i was in was full, 30 minutes into the movie 10 peoples left, then 20 minutes pass and another 5 people left by the end of the movie, half the theater has left the theater before the movie ended so for me, that's a sign of a bad movie. When peoples pay 10$ a tickets to see a movie and they don'T even stay until they end, it says that this was a bad movie and all i got to say is, don'T fall for the hype on this movie, it's not worth it",Martyrs

347,divinebaal,It is french so it must be... Good?,2,2 September 2011,"Pretentious. That is the keyword of this film. And it is FULL of SPOILERS!!!Reading through the reviews it feels that the movie is celebrated because no one understands it so it must be great. I didn't think so.As everyone comments, this is several movies in one but unfortunately they don't really fit together. The new french horror cinema has shown to deliver some great flicks with actually refreshed the entire euro- horror genre.Part one is the revenge movie. Here we see 2 girls kick ass during a vengeance / murder rampage, a sickly ghost and a lot of self mutilation with a razor that ends with a suicide. Mylène Jampanoï plays Lucie with excellence and her madness really comes out. That is the only character that has any really ""life"" in this crap.Then it feels like Pascal Laugier came up with an idea.. ""OMG, I may perhaps have to share why these two girls have gone completely medieval ?""So now we find Catherine Bégin playing ""Mademoiselle"", an old hag who wants to create Jesus. We learn that there is a group who kidnaps women, because they are the only strong ones who can endure the torture, in order to create their Jesus figure who goes back to Papa and learns about an afterlife. And they have tried for 17 years and are still ongoingInitially I though she was an old Nazi-doc who wanted to continue perverted sexual experiments but we didn't even get to see a nipple until the end. But I was wrong, she was just another cultist of rich old people who wanted to know what afterlife was.So, what do you get during these 99 minutes? First part, gruesome murders. Intermission when stupid girl Anna roams the torture chambers finding another victim. She is then taken by the baddies and now second part starts.She is force fed. Has her hair cut of. She gets a sponge bath. A big blond french Nazi.. (no, not a Nazi.. just an a*hole) beats the crap out of her a few times.Then comes the scary doctor who skins her alive - whoa, now she meets God. Tells her secret to the old hag. All the old rich people gathers, waiting for the word of God but fool them twice, the old hag kills herself. And it ends with Anna in a tank, skinned and ""oh so holy"". And because the hag killed herself after Anna whispered the ""truth"" - the rest of the world is lost.Frak - yes, the director should apologize for this. There is a quasi- religious message that perhaps a catholic understands but not the rest of us. F/X was on par with what you would expect of a ""torture porn"" movie but nothing more. It is just that last part of the second half.. I get the feeling that people ""love"" this movie because you need 4 years of religious schooling, a deep understanding in philosophy to understand it. But hey, an artsy movie from France - it MUST be great.When in the end it is just some people dying on the screen, some abuse of a young girl and then.. emptiness. High on the chock value due to the violence against young girls. But low on ""plot"" or ""message"".",Martyrs

From the start the movie was building something, something like a gruesome revenge story but ended with something totally different. I liked and disliked it at the same time. I guess you can't be one-sided about this movie. As far as it goes it's not something very unusual to me because I've seen way too much to be easily shocked I guess. There was only one scene that made me nervous and uncomfortable. The movie isn't bad but not something special either. If not for the well done gruesome scenes it wouldn't be that good. The ending was too boring for me: I just skipped the DVD then came back to that part later and realized that I pretty much didn't miss anything. The ending was funny as hell - I was pleasantly surprised and took it for a dark prank joke. Martyrs left me with a lot of unanswered questions too. The story of the two girls is pretty much clear but later the movie just skips some ""explaining"" and leaves an empty gap to your own interpretations.

Forget the gore, the raw violence and what people seem to think is a lack of plot. (no there is a plot, a depressing, truthfull and disturbing plot) This film is horrible and beautiful at the same time, I feel sick and dirty yet enlightened and free. I have not seen a piece of art like this before. Only one film has matched the beauty of this in my eyes, a Korean film called ""Spring, summer, winter, autumn and winter"" both films are so different yet so awe inspiring.

351,mithhuanion,"Dark, very dark",8,18 August 2009,"The movie starts out like a good horror should: a desperate girl in a creepy environment. Immediately I was hypnotized to the screen, wanting to know what happened to her. The horrors that occurred these 15 years before the rest of the story were something I didn't expect. The cold, cruel setting of the movie drifts on desperation and does a very good job, while continuously uttering the question 'is this real or not?' The blood and gore are not flying around in a brutal yet funny way, but more realistic in a way that creeps most people out to the point of looking away. The cold setting of the kills and the psychotic acting really are the highlights here. The acting is really incredible, I felt the shivers on my back more than a couple of times during the play. As the plot thickens more becomes clear, only to be twisted again and again to make you really wanting to know what is or isn't real. So I'm really sorry to say that the ending didn't really live up to the story we had seen earlier. It ends in a rather quick, almost parody-like way to leave me asking 'why like this?'",Martyrs
352,ajpatane,Disturbing Toture With No Point,1,9 May 2009,"As some have said, you either love this film or you hate it. The film's extremely disturbing torture and violence serves no purpose other than to make the viewer cringe for its victims. While this may be the goal of a typical horror film, this film takes large strides to make the torture something realistic, something that could really happen, and, therefore, all the more harrowing. Once the audience understands this, it expects something more than just typical slasher fare - it expects something deeper and thought provoking. It expects the film to use the torture to make a point. Unfortunately, it never does.The first half of the film culminates in an unoriginal reveal that the viewer expects long before it is made. The first half sets up the second half, which, while making use of a truly terrifying basement torture chamber, goes through torture scene after scene in effort to make the viewer feel the pain of its victim. Having seen that real life torture chambers like this exist, the notion is truly frightening. However, the point of these scenes is made after three of them and the remainder become unenduringly repetitive, pushing the film into overkill - to the point the viewer is so disturbed s/he no longer wants to watch. I fast forwarded through the second 1/2 of these scenes and hung on through the remainder of the film only because I knew the end was near and I was expecting something huge to make sense of everything. While the film succeeds in repulsing the viewer with the depravity of humanity and the horror the victims endure, the film fails to use this to any admirable advantage. One expects more from a film that goes to pains to make the suffering so realistic. And that is the problem: the film is not a popcorn slasher film, one which the viewer goes to for a light-hearted ""scare,"" but which is ultimately an unrealistic ""horror"" film; rather, the film conjures up feelings of discomfort and unease because what is happening could really happen. I disagree that the film makers were doing this just to put depravity on the screen. I think they had a real goal of conveying some deep concept or revealing something thought-provoking behind the debauchery.Unfortunately, we learn all the depravity and suffering were the result of an unclear scientific desire of the wealthy to learn what happens after death. The audience is probably supposed to feel some sort of horror or discomfort at this. But, the ending is not clearly developed and fails to plant enough seeds for thought after the film is over. Thus all that came before the ending, makes no sense. And to put the torture on screen without making a good point causes the viewer to question its purpose.",Martyrs

355,andreea-visanoiu,"A story with no story, violence for the sake of violence",1,5 March 2011,"This movie determines me to write my first IMDb review ever, so there it goes: ***SPOILERS*** First of all, the movie is about an abused girl who escapes somehow (we don't know and don't find out how), gets to an orphanage house. She makes one good friend there and then whoosh, the movie takes us 15 years after. A nice family meal, all happy and normal when someone rings the door and a pretty lady with a shotgun kills the entire family. From here on the movie is a blood bath with no connectivity between the scenes, no logic, total nonsense. Blah-blah, we get to the point where we find out that there's an organization who kidnaps young women in order to reach ... martyrdom (whatever that means in the light of this movie). More or less, by the end of the movie we understand that these people want to find out what's after life.The first problem that I have with this movie is that there is no explanation about why the people torture these women: the old lady talks about being martyrs and dying with a look on their faces, that shows that they saw beyond. Not to mention that the moment we are to find out ...oh well, let's not spoil all the ""fun"" of watching this movie.It's a bad, bad, bad story, with a bad plot, with unconnected action scenes (the freaky lady that keeps attacking Lucy comes and goes like a shadow), with no intelligent lines, the actors are bad, bad, bad, I just find it painful to write about it because I have to review it in my head.Overall a painful experience, violence for the sake of violence, lots of blood (if you're into bloody experiences), torture with no sense and no details ... There is absolutely no point in the movie and no point watching it. Do yourself a favor and read something instead.",Martyrs
356,FearNtremblng,"A pretty good ""lonely Wednesday"" horror flick",6,8 July 2012,"Is Martyrs a masterpiece? No. Let's clear the air right away.But it is intriguing, it starts off in something of a hurry and quells down in its latter half to a much slower pace. However, given that the theme of the second half of the movie is that of monotonous, slow, unbearable pain, the film made a wise style choice to parallel it by the viewing experience at that stage. You shouldn't feel bored, but you will notice the formulaic filming of this half, its slowness, and its unbearableness.Is it really so unbearable though? That depends on how you watch your films. If you keep an active mind about you, if you let yourself become immersed in the pain then it will have an effect on you - one itself close to sickness. But if you watch your films from a distance, in that curious self-numbing way the average horror-goer seems to take in his films, then you might be disappointed. There are no scenes here that are designed to make you shout and talk about how f'ed up it is; no superfluous show of violence for the sake of violence.If you consider yourself an intellectual or enjoy movies with deep plot lines then you will undoubtedly be disappointed, precisely because this film - in the latter half anyway - tries to turn itself on its heels and pull off something profound. When time comes to reveal what really is so profound we find ourselves watching a confession: being told candidly by the film itself that it had no idea how to wrap up, that it really did not contain that bit of profundity it boasted only a half hour earlier that indeed it did have. We watch whatever it is that is so profound as a whisper, one character telling another character everything we have been waiting to hear, and the entire dialogue is muted, never to be told to us.If you can get past this last aspect of Martyrs you might still find a good little horror movie wrapped up inside. I would be inclined to give this a 7 out of 10 (a rather high rating for horrors in general) if it were not for this anticlimactic ending. That was a mistake that should have been avoided, especially if the movie itself knew it had nothing to offer and decided anyway to pretend like it did. For that reason I give it 6 of 10.Not perfect. Not wholly disappointing. A movie for one of those boring nights, or get-togethers where all parties do not have great expectations.",Martyrs
357,Claudiu497,A new era of horror...,8,15 June 2017,"I must start by saying this is not a movie for the faint-hearted. Also I believe there are a lot of good reviews of this film out there that should be read. Shocking, disturbing, brutal...those are just a few words that can describe this movie. What a human being can do for revenge, or just to find answers is unbelievable. I always ask myself how an actor could play so good in a movie where emotions are taken on a different kind of level. This is a movie that makes you feel disgusted with the world and ashamed of what humans can do to each other. It is a horror film that even for gorehounds the stomach may go nuts. A lot of people are making jokes when watching a horror film, trying to make it easier to watch. The moment Anna gets captured nobody can laugh anymore, it is intense and brutal. A normal person could not even think of making a joke at that moment. This movie depicts what human nature is capable of and makes it sad. The movie starts with a horror story and then walks into another one, over and over again. The actors did an amazing job, made it feel a lot more realistic with genuine emotions. Morjana Alaoui pulls in a heart wrenching performance. This is another reason why this movie is so good. I read that a lot of people were repulsed by the second part of the movie and it is understandable, but then again, it is just a movie (clearly not made for those with a weak heart). I still don't understand the world we live in, but I think these are realistic events converted in a fictional environment. The ending went into a direction I was not expecting. Like all horror films, the main character is either saved, either killed. But in this one the director gave a more profound meaning to the whole film. He left us surrounded by mystery and everyone can have their own interpretation. It is original, unlike a significant number of modern horror movies. Again, foreign films shows us that they are way better than Hollywood films.",Martyrs
358,DarkSpotOn,This is a Master-Piece,10,16 May 2021,"I have seen many horror films, and NOTHING can TOP this film. This film is AMAZING. The film contains Gore, Exploitation, Jumpscares and a Good-Message. I saw this film THREE Times, and every time I LOVED This film. Out of every horror film I have seen, nothing is even close to this film.This film hits on the psychological, gore, and story-message levels. It makes all holes filled. In the beginning you do NOT understand nearly anything. You just get shocked and frozen from the Gore and the story building up. Though when you get in the middle of the film. The whole film turns around 360 degrees, and the film starts hitting real-hard to home.You just stare and can not believe what is going on. This film is a Masterpiece, and it deserves much MORE recognition. Most horror films are honestly pointless, horror for being horror, and it just loses its weight. This film is everything except horror for horror. Okay yes, there is some jump scares, and scare factor, it's a horror film. BUT this film has a ridiculously hard-hitting message underneath it.I saw this film first time in 2020, and the first time I saw it I just was frozen. This film is just amazing in all aspects. You just feel the suffering, the pain, everything through this film. This film builds you a lot of emotions, of confusion, fear, shock, and mind-thinking.If you REALLY want to see a good HORROR film. Then this is YOUR film. Though be warned: This film is really depressing and dark. It's really REALLY sad that this film isn't more famous in the media. This film deserves much more, and I hope people watch it. Because this is not your classic horror, this is a horror film with an in-depth message.The ending is also a perfect cherry on the cake. You have to THINK yourself what the ENDING is. The film gave you everything to connect with, and the ending just makes you think about what and why. The ending just makes you silent and just trying to puzzle the whole film.Everyone should watch this film. Not because of the gore, not because of the horror. Just because the message is really strong and heart-breaking. I hope you watch this film.",Martyrs
359,ColtGanloso,I've Seen Worse.,4,30 January 2013,"After all the hype about ""Martyrs"" I was expecting some REALLY nasty torture scenes; which is why I put off watching this film for so long. However, I needn't have worried as for at least a third of the running time it is a bloke punching and slapping a girl in the face. Not a good thing, or something I enjoyed watching but certainly I didn't find myself averting my gaze from the screen as I did when I watched another french film, the really rather gruesome ""Frontiers"" Perhaps, I'm being a little disingenuous; there are nasty moments to be found in ""Martyrs"" but is it ""torture porn"" as some seem to be suggesting? Not for me. If anything, sexuality is played down, for example, Mylène Jampanoï (possibly one of the most beautiful women in the world) spends most of this film dressed in a beanie hat and long overcoat, as if she has come to collect your weekly rubbish. On the few occasions there is nudity, the camera certainly doesn't linger on the androgynous looking bodies on offer; there are certainly no big-boobed chicks running around with their cleavage on display a la most horror films, and non of the torture had a sexual element or motive. So I don't see that the ""torture porn"" accusation, is merited.Did I enjoy this film? not really; I don't think it is a film meant to be enjoyed. It was well acted and directed with an unusual premise but, ultimately - not a film I will watch again or recommend to anyone.",Martyrs
360,emacs72,Gory and harrowing,7,11 September 2008,"I attended the Midnight Madness screening of Martyrs at the 33rd Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).The first hour and a bit of Martyrs was quite effective in delivering unsettling imagery and sounds. Elements of child abuse is something that is certainly unnerving so it's subtext in the film added to the creepiness factor. the gore had it's place; it wasn't presented just for the sake of gore in of itself. Special makeup effects artist Benoît Lestang who passed away several weeks ago (as noted by director Pascal Laugier during the Q/A session after the screening) did a remarkable job to showing the brutal effects of violent physical injuries. The audience reaction is typical MM stuff: audible gasps, rolls of nervous laughter, loud and appreciative applause to truly gruesome scenes and other good stuff.The last thirty minutes of the film held the audience in almost complete silence. The lack of any crowd reaction, aside from the revelation of what happened to Anna in her final stage, was due to the harrowing endurance test they and Anna (played by Morjana Alaoui) went through. The film turned from a highly engaging gore flick into a sad and rather depressing reflection of human suffering.I had a strong reaction to the film that lead me to appreciate it on its dramatic and production levels. The filmmakers and actresses obviously had a lot of trust among themselves to deliver this film. after the screening Pascal Laugier, Morjana Alaoui and Mylène Jamanoï went up onstage to answer questions from MM programme director Colin Geddes and several members of the audience. Pascal fielded most of the questions while Morjana and Mylène nervously chimed in with their responses (mainly because neither of them speak English natively nor are they accustomed being infront of such a massive crowd of people). The Q/A session did get a bit awkward because some killjoy decided to challenge Pascal on why he made Martyrs. As to the context in which Martyrs was first conceived, Pascal mentioned he is going through deeply personal issues which (unsurprisingly) translated themselves, quite graphically, into Martyrs.I'm pretty sure Martyrs is too intense for the general public so don't expect a wide theatrical release of the film. I could go on much further but that would necessitate revealing plot points and specific scenes.",Martyrs

362,daniel-lsrag,Rapturous Trauma and Violence That Is,5,12 January 2013,"Mademoiselle, one of the people behind what transpires in ""Martyrs,"" says this:""Martyrs are exceptionally rare. They survive pain, they survive total deprivation. They bear all the sins of the earth. They give themselves up. They transcend themselves they are transfigured.""Mademoiselle's words bring to mind artistic representations of Saints being killed. In these images, trauma is portrayed as something rapturous. The veil between heaven and earth seems torn, the Saint's face glows, and he or she is transported by an otherworldly vision. Thus, the event is not called trauma, or torture, or murder. It is martyrdom.Having known many who have experienced great violence, it is clear to me that trauma is very different than martyrdom. Trauma knows no heavenly companions, no separation from one's tortured body, no justifications, and no escape routes. Trauma is a tidal wave that sweeps a person away and leaves the person stranded in a world that is no longer recognizable or safe. It becomes definitive because it posits a before and after in one's life and an unbridgeable gap is wedged between the two.The establishment of a completely different before and after permits one to describe rapturous moments as containing elements of the traumatic. But can one posit elements of the rapturous within the traumatic? Can one, especially as an outsider looking in, view the torture of another person and conclude that there was something rapturous about what was experienced? Speaking of being an outsider looking in, I arrive at Laugier's film, ""Martyrs,"" which explores questions like these in great detail. ""Martyrs"" is singularly successful in communicating the reality of violence. Violence that is terrifying. Violence that is traumatic. Violence that is random, unexpected and, well, violent.This is a different violence than what is seen in most horror movies. It is not sexualized, there is no escape through humour or moralizing, and one cannot say that the violence is so over the top that the viewer can distance herself from the film. This is why the reaction that many have to ""Martyrs"" is also different. As Laugier explains, ""Martyrs"" is an ""affecting film"" and the majority of people who have viewed it have ""felt a lot by watching it but they don't quite understand the nature of the feeling."" Here, the simulacrum comes close to re-presenting that which it explores (violence, trauma, and signification).""Martyrs"" actually prompts our initial question: is there something rapturous to be found in observing the trauma of others? Mademoiselle is seeking this, but the film throws the question back at the audience: why are you watching this? What are you seeking here? Like Mademoiselle, viewers of violent films seem to be in search of ""something more"" in the sufferings of others.But is this the case? Evangelicals who watched ""The Passion of the Christ"" might answer affirmatively. Viewing Gibson's snuff film made many feel closer to Christ than they had ever felt. This is odd I don't know anybody who would watch a snuff film about somebody they loved in order to ""feel closer"" to that person. I think a fundamental mistake is occurring here: the traumatic is being mistaken for the rapturous, simply because the rapturous contains elements that appear traumatic.Therefore, what is one to do when Mademoiselle speaks of rapturous traumas? Do those who suffer know more than those who do not? Believing this leads us to stare at the sufferings of others with the hope of sharing that something more. Consequently, perhaps those who are drawn to ""Martyrs"" are experiencing the simulacrum of ""something more."" We are seeking the transcendent but since this is only experienced by those who actually experience the traumas we witness, we continue to stare.But is this a true statement about trauma? When a woman is being beaten can we say that some kind of deeper meaning, previously absent, is now present? Ask those who have gone through such beatings and pretty much the opposite experience is the case. Perhaps, then, we stare at the traumas of others because we imagine that there just has to be some kind of deeper meaning or explanation. Otherwise, what is going on here? But maybe there isn't any sort of explanation or rapture. Maybe we stare and stare because we need suffering to ""make sense."" We want our traumas to be revelatory but maybe they are nothing more than what they are. At the end of the day, perhaps violence just is, and perhaps the experience of trauma will always be non-sensical. Maybe we stare because we can't get our heads around that, maybe we replay the images so that we can force them into some sort of system of meaning. Maybe we desensitize ourselves so that we can protect ourselves from remembering that much or all of this doesn't make any sort of sense – and movies like ""Martyrs"" disrupt this systemization and so we are unsure how to feel about them.When trauma does occur with others, it lets us live in the moment. When planes are flying into towers, nobody is thinking about paperwork. Nobody is thinking about the rules of everyday life. The trauma of others permits us to forget ourselves. This is the opposite of what we experience when we go through trauma ourselves. Personal trauma isolates me within myself (my body hurts; what is going to happen to me next; I'm afraid for my life). Hence, we seek the former and shun the latter. Maybe we only live vicariously — we can create meaning with the lives of others. We can witness it all and slot everything into a narrative that makes sense. With ourselves, we cannot do this as easily, and when we think we have succeeded, it is trauma that reminds us we have not.Perhaps it is the realization of this that leads Mademoiselle to put a gun in her mouth.",Martyrs
363,Dsuarezmlc12,Big balloon full of hot air,1,7 June 2017,"The movie has a plot that it is shoddy at best and only needs ten minutes of screen time to portray it. Its lauded by some as such a good movie but has plot holes and doesn't seem to advance at all while only dragging on. Some will say I missed the point but movies like No Country for Old Men which is an in depth character study, Manchester by the Sea which explores humanity, Pulp Fiction which is a craft in more ways than one, etc. all convey their message and craft excellently. This movies is part horror, part torture-porn, part existential film. It tries to have some deep meaningful message which depending on the way you look at it is just gonna make you mad. I'm not saying that it should have ended more jovially but it doesn't give you anything to hold on to, really, just the images but not a message or a plot. Sure this movie will stick with you and make you feel depressed and question humanity but it does so in a similar way that a ten minute real life gory video will. If all it pretends to be is a movie that makes you see how ugly humanity is, like i said, ten minutes would have been enough. It throws in a shamble of a plot an some kind of allegedly meaningful ending but its just a big balloon full of hot air. A pretentious film that acts like it is more than it actually is. There are other movies labeled as pretentious that actually have a coherent message and strong plot and strong character study, this has none of that and ill stop now before this gets any longer.",Martyrs
364,piramisfej,Holocaust movie in a weird way,8,14 July 2021,"As the title suggests for me this was partly a Holocaust movie - in a way that for as long as I know cinematic history there hasnt been made a movie that revolves around the mechanical evil theory of the Holocaust: which suggests that the Holocaust was the first historic event where killing was automated for its every little evil segment and purpose - as in a sistematic cycle of soap being made from human body fat for later usage.In the movie a very similar mechanism is used for sistematic torture to make people in a deep state named being a martyr - which is believed to be a gateway between life and death. Such memories escaping from this kind of torture could lead to hallucination. Hallucinations help cope with childhood trauma that may predict inception of delusional ideation or a sudden suicide that has no prelude since it feasts on dark after images of the past.Keep in mind that besides this, the movie has nothing to do with the historic event, I just made a parallel which helps to understand the motive behind a cycle of torture: which is believed to be for a greated good by those who commit the torture and murder.The second part we get to see the truth behind those dark after images, which is very disturbing to watch, but is essencial to make a horror experience and to connect the storyline with the atmosphere.I believe that the creators wanted this to be a horror flick with an interesting, yet simple to understand plot about imagination and memories becoming reality once again. The movie overgrew what it meant to be in my eyes.There are also multiple twists in this movie to make it a subgenre gore - philosophical horror including the twist where it turns out that the hauning pictures of a dark past were real for the girl.Its a really good movie within its genre. I gave it 10/8.",Martyrs

If you enjoy pure blood and gore maybe this is for you. Basically some tormented Asian chick goes on a psychotic rampage then later it somehow turns into some bizarre religious social experiment. Half way through i felt like jumping through the screen to torture and make suffer in the worst possible way these oppressors. The audience gets a real glimpse at some of the worst humans are capable of. Not really sure what the point of this movie was other then to assault the senses making me ashamed to be called human.

369,writetostuart,"Pointless, Disturbing, Trash.",1,20 January 2018,"When I first heard of this movie , I was like 'this sounds interesting let me check it out'. After watching it , I can tell you that I basically just saw a extremely violent movie that had a strong message behind it . But, the movie doesn't do anything creative with it and once you understand why it's all happening , you just become no longer invested in it because you are already sick to your stomach and there isn't any characters that are interesting . Every character in this movie is just an inanimate object for more gore to be shown and the performances aren't good either and they become annoying and the whole movie feels annoying , hollow, dull, vile, and pretentious . The violence is so much that I begin to feel like vomiting at certain points and the beating scene of Anna was too much for me . The end was one of those ending that doesn't give you any explanation of why anything is happening and let the audience guess , which is a common in these artsy-fartsy movies. There are so many plot holes in this movie : 1, when she kills the entire family and calls her friend to help and after doing that , they don't even leave the house , they just stay there 2, When Anna finds the woman locked in the basement , instead of taking her to the hospital or calling 9-11 to help her , she puts her in the bath-tub which I felt was just an excuse for more gore to be shown. 3, why didn't the police arrive when Lucy killed the family . The in the end , Martyrs is just another generic torture porn movie with virtually no plot and a slight twist that 's they re searching for the afterlife stuff.",Martyrs

When a film has managed to do that, it's done something right.That being said, I hated watching this movie. It started out normal enough. There was disturbing imagery and a creepy atmosphere about the whole thing but it wasn't ""most disturbing movie of all time"" territory, but as the film went on, the gory/disturbing stuff got more and more extreme, and by the end of it, it took me longer than the movie itself to go to sleep that night.This film deeply affected me on a psychological level, and anything that does that deserves a high rating, but because of how it affected me, I seriously cannot recommend anyone watch this movie because it will shake you to your core.",Martyrs

Then it turns very violent involving murdering children (again not sure why some horror films think this is acceptable esp the French films). The troubled heroine finally winds up killing herself and then the film shifts into more of a sci fi conspiracy. The second half is for sure more interesting, but it also doesn't really explain itself that well/isn't very believable. You don't really care for any of the characters. I just didn't find myself invested at all with the film as its tone shifted way too much and the story/characters seemed very fake.

I really don't understand how it can be called ""horror porn"". The reason behind the torture (with no specifically sexual abuse such as rape involved as was stated at the beginning of the movie when the girl escaped) was because the ""powerful rich"" wanted to know what was on the ""other side"" by reproducing the agony of the religious martyrs (even though many ""martyrs"" shown were not religious at all, but the idea is the same: through their agony they ""see the other sid... or God""). I see political implications here (remember ""Society""?). The idea that at the end there is no other side makes the old lady of the powerful aristocrat shoot herself because she knows now that it was all useless.

377,MishkaBarton,"A beautiful, melancholy sadness.",8,10 August 2016,"There is a lot of intelligent debate about whether this film is a masterwork or simply pretentious exploitation, but I'm leaning toward the former. What begins as an almost unwatchably bleak/brutal film slowly transforms into a sincere and deeply moving study on pain, and in so doing, it takes the viewer on a journey with the main character, slowly changing us as it changes her; leaving us as numb, exhausted, and possibly as transcended as she. As the violence intensifies over the run-time of the film, so too does our perspective and understanding. I didn't take my eyes off the screen, but I almost don't remember the violence and torture of the third act. All I remember is....beauty....a melancholy sadness....and an almost paternal love for the main character.It's almost as if I was subconsciously blocking out the experience of the torture and putting myself in the same brain-space as the lead female. The metaphysical questions posed by the film's ending are interesting yet unnecessary afterthoughts, because at that point in the journey you either will or won't have accepted the main impact of the film.

I'm a big horror fan and am happy watching and enjoying 'popcorn' slasher movies for what they are but really the genre is crying out for more pictures that truly assault the senses.The French are particularly adept at painting bleak, unforgiving landscapes as well as thrusting you right into the action but rarely have I experienced anything quite so memorable as Martyrs.Comparisons will (and have) been drawn with Hostel, Saw, Hellraiser and others but this is really rather misleading. Further comparisons have been drawn with Inside, Frontiers, Funny Games etc. and while slightly more credible in that atmosphere and psychology play a far greater part, none come close to Martyrs.I'd challenge anyone not to be affected by this movie. It's gory, but you won't laugh. It's shocking, but you won't be able to look away. 24 hours later it's still running through my mind and if I see a better horror movie than this this year, I'll be truly amazed.As much as I'd love to write more this is most certainly a film you should watch knowing as little as possible. Suffice to say the acting, cinematography, score, atmosphere and unbridled tension combine to create one of the most engaging films in this genre of the last two decades.Watch it.

Vengeance, traumatic experiences and suffering are themes to which the viewer is related to strongly while watching the film.Graphical horror is certainly the most notable aspect on the film on several both torture and self harm scenes. Anyway i think that in this movie violence or blood are never pointless but it is the necessary moments to achieve the desired frightening objectives (not the weird pointless lots of blood and torture as seen in later saw movies).Nonetheless the graphical aspect can be certainly horrifying and this movie may not be suit for anyone.The story is really well written and the final act is deeply horrifying and thrilling.

While watching it you are waiting to see what is behind all this violence, what is the aim of all of this. Do they do it for fun? Are they Psychopaths? Are they ill? Are they deranged? The answer is sooooo weak and so poor that you realise those who made this film just wanted to film some torture scenes but needed the excuse of a 'film' to fund it and do it. Nothing makes you engage with the characters, the 'twist' which becomes predictable after 5 minutes is revealed in the first third, leaving you with a pointless movie.

This film remind me to ""Haunte Tension"" write&directed by ""Alexandre Aja"".(skin-head girl from France)Showing gore and a lot of thrilling scene.But you can see something called ""the art of movie"" in it. which let the audiences enjoying the whole movie since start to the end.but not suffering the audience by showing only torturing a girl scene like this. various gore movie which worth to see are ""Hostel"" or ""Last House on the left"" which containing the ""Art"" in it.This film was worse to see and wasted your time.disturbed and repulsed feeling after seen it.it should come with an extreme warning ""R-Rated"".",Martyrs

386,aseneca-1,A masterpiece of Modern Horror,10,12 November 2008,"To avoid fainting, keep repeating : it's only a movie,...But this time it is for real.I will start off by saying that Martyrs is probably the most shocking horror film in a very long time, the concept of a revenge-flick upgraded to extremes.The French have been known for making extremely violent flicks over the past few years and this time it was Pascal Laugier's turn to provide us with a movie that is meant to be more shocking than entertaining, the reason why horror movies were made back in the seventies. And indeed, Martyrs is an unapologetic throwback to the seventies-horror flicks( the likes of The Last House On The Left and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre come to mind ) but Laugier uses the methods he can use and makes it even more shocking than these films are.Apart from being the most shocking and disturbing horror movie in this long time ( were the aforementioned titles or Cannibal Holocaust were just very disturbing),this film is also very scary and creepy : i can stomach a lot but at some parts in this movie I really was creep-ed out and scared to death. This is an extremely scary movie. The script is absolutely fantastic : it manages to combine 3-4 different happenings into one movie and contains several nods to other recent horror-works or to the classics without falling into plagiarism. Then we also have the direction of Pascal Laugier :It isn't anything we haven't seen before but he certainly is a man who knows how to build up and it shows during a lot of the scenes where he manages to keep the audience very tense and frightened. He is a man who takes a very poetic approach to the visuals and really, some of the visuals are very beautiful. Just like Xavier Gens did with Frontière(s), Laugier manages to give his film a very polished look while still keeping it dirty. The whole movie has some sort of atmosphere of dread, just like Hooper's TCM had. Yes, you have read it: Martyrs is a very atmospheric movie. The acting is very credible, especially from the two main actresses. I was sold. And then there's the gore : Laugier didn't want to make a blood-fest.Well it turned out to be some sort of a gorepic, but obvious it wasn't the director's main target. The gore is NOT the kind of gore the audience likes to see. This isn't a film where you really are waiting for the next victim to be bloodily dispatched, the violence in this film is much worse than anything that is shown in movies like Hostel,Wrong Turn 2,... It isn't as gory, there are no geysers of blood and maybe this isn't real gore. Gore is supposed to be fun this is much worse : it is realistic violence, graphic as all hell and incredibly difficult to stomach. Keep in mind that this isn't a happy-go-slashing slasher-film but I will say there are some really disgusting scenes which are hard to stomach, even for the real gore-hounds (like myself) due to the way the violence is portrayed. Compliments for Laugier to create a film that really does shock us with its explicit violence, just like Noe's Irreversible did.The soundtrack also is worth mentioning, it is experimental but it really works. It is at times a very melancholic type of soundtrack but very memorable. I won't spoil anything for you, but I will tell you something about the end of the movie. Making it through the last 20 minutes of Martyrs is a tough task. This part of the movie is extremely sad, but ends up being very poetic and very beautiful. The very end of the movie is almost cynical, without becoming comedic. The movies stays true to its dark roots and will leave you saddened. That being said: people looking for an entertaining slasher-film will be very disappointed, but people looking for a film that will be remembered for a very long time and that will be talked about like they still talk about some of the shocking classics should give this movie a try. Like somebody already mentioned, this movie veers closer to Irreversible than to ,lets say, Inside or Haute Tension to which it has been compared. And I wonder what the MPAA would make of this. Again, NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART !!!",Martyrs
387,pierpaolobv2,The most disturbing thing about this movie is how pretencious it is,2,16 August 2021,"It is probably that the saw saga and other similar films have hardened my stomach, after so many reviews and so many phrases as the most disturbing movie of all time, what I found incredibly disturbing is the weak script, the lack of logic in the characters and the story, for example 4 shots from a shotgun and no one nearby was alarmed and called the police? What about the boy's girlfriend? Didn't you worry about not hearing from him? And the logic of anyone to commit 4 murders and flee the crime scene as soon as possible and not stay there for days and days? And the senseless torture, it was supposed to be so that people would reach some level of enlightenment or heightened state of consciousness? Would scientists believe this? For me, it is an extremely pretentious film that pretends to be intelligent and hide a deeper meaning, but nothing of that.",Martyrs

389,guyatbar-4,A horror movie with a story line,9,28 March 2010,"Firstly I feel as though I have to warn the viewer before they pay four dollars and rent it. Harrowing is not a strong enough word to describe it. This movie is for people who have strong minds and stomachs. It is nearly impossible for me to tell you the brief outline of what happens in this film without ruining it for the viewer. All I can say without ruining it is that it is about a young girl who was abused as a child. I can't really tell you anymore, because that is what, in a nutshell, this whole movie is about.I can personally watch any of those gore filled movies like 'Saw' without flinching, but Martyrs was different. I watched it almost half a year ago, and it still sticks in my head. There is a real believableness about this entire film. It perfectly depicts human cruelty, and the ability the human body has to survive, even when the mind might just want to die. Some of the scenes in this film are brutal, and people might want to just turn off the movie and throw it away, but I urge you not to. Stick though the film and you will start to understand.You would have to be a strange sort of person if you could watch this and openly say that you enjoyed it, because I think it is a type of movie that you really can't enjoy. Even with all of the violent themes that run through this film, it can still be called a beautiful film. The directer has used light and shadow to not only create a atmosphere, but as a whole other character. This gives it a type of mystery that is never really explained.I hope that if you are one of those people who think that they can watch this that you do. The whole movie is in French, but please don't run because of that. Stick through the whole movie, then if you can watch it again. I think that you will get a lot more out of the movie the second time around. I will warn you one last time, do not, I repeat do not watch this if you don't like these sorts of movies, or if you have children of any age in the house with you.",Martyrs
390,cmbiggs113,polarizing,10,18 August 2012,"this is probably one of the most polarizing horror films since cannibal holocaust. people either think it is brilliant, or just garbage. i am surprised that this film is scored so high, especially since 9 out of 10 of the people that bother to put their opinion online have a negative opinion. this should tell you that the film has a substantial amount of fans that believe it is brilliant. of course, this film is not for everyone. the film is extremely brutal and very hard to watch at times. what really differentiates it from hostel and other film with extreme violence or torture is simple. eli roth made hostel because he wanted to make a takashi miike film. this is a quote from Tarantino. the problem is, the movie has none of the depth or meaning of anything miike has done, like his masterpiece, audition. the violence in hostel is meant to be entertaining. draw your own conclusions as to what that says about mr. roth or anyone who really liked the movie. the only way that hostel succeeded at all, was that it had a simple message about violence for entertainment, and by the end, most people were screaming for it in the form of some good old fashioned revenge. the violence in martyrs is not entertaining. AT ALL. i have never seen a movie where someone being shot by a shotgun is so disturbing, and that is because somehow, the film captures that this guy is so instantaneously destroyed and dead. also, this is some of the least disturbing violence in the film. there is something extremely disturbing about a film that involves torture, where the torturer isn't even having any fun. it is calculated and precise, like solving an extremely complex mathematical equation, but there are even a few people on earth that would take great delight in that. the torturers work like it's any other day job that gives them no particular joy. that's disturbing. if you've heard of or seen audition, irreversible, the woman, or high tension (a great shocker until its ""twist"") then you may like martyrs. if you are looking for something that will entertain you with its violence, go somewhere else. this is about vicariously experiencing something awful and unpleasant that might make you ask some questions about life, good and evil, and that is something few people want to get TOO close to. HERE ARE THE SPOILERS. there has been a lot said about the whole point of the film as being stupid and nonsensical. many people have said that if these people are trying to find out about the afterlife, then their means of doing so will send them to hell. simply put, you're wrong. there is a point to what they are doing, and it cannot be achieved by just waiting for death. proof of an afterlife is proof that life is unending, that our lives do matter. it is proof that we are significant, that our souls are in fact real, and that there is a god. so why don't they just go to church, worship god, pray, and wait for the inevitable happy ending? they can't. there are many people that would like to believe in god but just can't. they need proof. so isn't torturing young girls to death going to insure a toasty spot in hell? nope. not if they come to truly believe and repent for their sins. the bible is a funny thing. one part that most christians forget is that all sins are equal in the eyes of god, because any sin is the equivalent of saying that you know better than he does. another part is that judgment is a sin, and this is a sin that most christians commit several times a day. judgement is mine, sayeth the lord. when you judge someone, you are declaring yourself god, and taking his power. this is as offensive to him as deciding that you should end someone's life before their time. thank god for all you judgemental christians out there, god forgives all sins in exchange for worshiping him as the highest authority and asking for forgiveness. so no, these people doing terrible, terrible things could turn things around if they had enough time and found true belief, no matter how they got there. if you have a problem believing that, don't argue on message boards, go argue with a minister or priest. if there are spelling errors in this review, please forgive me. i am typing one handed thanks to a boxer's fracture in my right hand. too much time in the basement with anna.",Martyrs

Its opener is grisly and it builds from there. The brilliant use of that which is unsaid is powerful. There is no shying away from death as so many horrors do, this movie shows the full hardcore nature of murder and almost truamatizes viewers. This movie is basically everything a film should be, it lingers in your mind for weeks after the film is over and makes you contemplate many things it brings up. This is not for the faint of heart, this is not for the lovers of slasher/comedy. This is a brutal story of revenge and the search for answers. It will go into the film history books as the film that retold a tired genre and it is one of the few films that really makes you feel. Give it a shot if you can, it will win you over.",Martyrs

If you want a sense of visceral horror watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. In fact watch anything in between. Both films show you can move or shock an audience without needing to endlessly (oh so very endlessly) brutalize women like steaks under a braising hammer or even shave their skin off in search of what's on the other side...but hey maybe I'm just old fashioned. It's a shame because the film starts promisingly and looks like it might bring a sensitivity to the subject matter of abuse and build character relationships in a paced and involving manner. Nope. In the same way that the film appears to first be one thing then another then another...but not in a good way - any early seeds of promise are trampled underfoot. And, boy, do the joins show...how do we change it into something other than standard torture porn fare? Cue weird, strange lady from shady organisation with sinister aims (yaaawn) with creaky Bond villain-esque dialogue 'we were, you might say...less organised in the past.' Yup so was indie-car but at least they go round in circles to an ultimate end.

Of course, I was only 10 years old, but it was the first time a movie had left a lasting impression on me.My favorite movies tend to leave me feeling drained, as if I had just experienced a traumatic event. We all want to ""feel"" something, whether it's good or bad. For me, it's the later. I want to feel sad. I want to feel disturbed. Is there something wrong with me? Nah.""Requiem for a Dream"" is another film that sat with me for days. ""The Elephant Man"" is another. These films are not classified as horror, but they effectively display human suffering in a way that few films have. ""Martyrs"" is of the same tattered cloth.I'm not going to bore you with a plot summary. There's no need. In fact, the less you know the better. I will say this, though, the story is unique and the message it conveys is deeply profound.It's true, the graphic violence and subject matter will offend many viewers. But don't we all need a swift kick in the rear every now and then? Seriously folks, if your idea of horror is ""Twilight,"" then avoid this like you would a porta-potty at a biker rally.

The film we wanted to see didn't work (fanboys) so i put martyrs on instead. We had heard comparisons to hostel which we all found very silly and even slapstick in places. All good evil fun. The first act of the film passed with us genially chuckling at the English dub and the somewhat odd performances.********SPOILERS AHEAD! SKIP THE NEXT 2 PARAGRAPHS!*********As soon as Anna Was captured nobody was laughing any more. It was disturbing, brutal and graphic. The fact that you actually saw this woman who had been trying to help people through the whole film and had not done anything to deserve this go through the dehumanisation and horror she experienced was just beyond anything i'd seen outside of certain Japanese titles. I was actually happy to hear one of the torturers telling her it would be over soon, showing some humanity to the poor girl.Well, they really shat all over that one. By the time she was skinned nobody was making any jokes anymore, the odd nervous laugh had ceased and my girlfriend had actually walked out. ********NO MORE SPOILERS!*******After the film had finished we were discussing the ending for a good hour or so, my friends and i all love horror films but the opinions of us five people all differed wildly, and i've never had that happen before.

I like that, i like that the film wasn't just a cut and paste slasher where you can pick a survivor within 5 minutes and the bad guy is some shadowy figure.

In the end of her life she kills herself. Her sister (who was following her through her life) manages to also end up getting abused by people her end up skinning her and she apparently 'sees the other world'. She tells the person who tortured her about the 'other world' and the women kills herself other knowing. Just don't watch it it's Freakin spit.

402,barna-brbs,A small complementary from my view: Love and compassion wins in the cruel environment,10,18 September 2013,"I would like to talk about the characters of this film, especially Anna. From the beginning we can witness her big heart and empathy towards those people who really needed it - Lucie. She also had a bad childhood, maybe not as cruel as Lucie's. She was so big hearted with her, that she could bear her ""demon"" (Of course Lucie's demon was her own conscience.) and the cruelty of it. And after all the years, Anna didn't lose her integrity with her Self, she wanted to help people still - she wanted to save the mother's life in the house, unnoticeable to Lucie. I guess not because she was afraid of her, rather she knew how big revenge is eating her friend inside, and she was understanding her so much. She was not starting to talk to her friend Lucie, about what is right and what is not, because her friend was unable to grow up in a normal situation. And what great power she had to find and help the other tormented woman. She took care of her, and hugged her, even that a lot of people would run away because of her frightening sight. So I have to tell again: Ann had so much deep understanding and really big heart! Even her all fear and hatred against her sick tormentors had gone totally. I guess in the end the suicide of the ""lady"" somehow an influence from Anna. Maybe she realized something more important than only the question of afterlife?!... Lucie's character was also showing that she had empathy. But it couldn't develop to so broad like Ann's, because of her terrorized childhood. So her conscience became her demon. She wanted to help the other tormented girl, but she couldn't. Her actions was so much clear. In the state of her, she could not act differently. She had to kill those people, and herself also. But her death was so long and painful... So it was a relief after all. The tormentor group was totally living only in the idea's world. So much, that they lost all of their connection with the heart. They victimized people, young girls, for the sake of their thirst to know what is in there after life. Or for the sake of their hypothesis. They killed Life, to know what is Life. It can show how much people can do wrong if they ""live"" only in the mind! ALthoug as I said, maybe the ""lady"" got to know something important at the end. Who knows? Pascal Laugier may be :) So, it is a really hard movie to watch, but with very important topics. Sometimes extra violence or brutal environment is needed in the movie for us to see Something.The actors and actresses was doing very good job in this movie, also the director. The atmosphere was totally perfect, I could feel it all the way. It was so heavy, that I hardly could breath sometimes.(I was reading a few opinion in a different websites. Some people wrote that the writer should be ""rot"" because of the sick violence in this movie. Can they think with the heart? Because how can somebody wish to a LIVING person anything bad? And with the reason that his movie was so brutal? It is paradox. So... we should be opening our heart...)/Sorry for my bad English./",Martyrs

It was amazing to watch and I wish I could rate that part of the movie separately - I would have given it a 10. Perhaps I thought so because that was the traditional sort of psychological horror, while the rest of the film delved into body horror. In any case, Anna's torments simply didn't engross me as much. The atmosphere may have been too pervasive. There may have been too much routine in her abuse to maintain that sort of immersion. Perhaps it was just the notion of an afterlife which provided the backbone of the movie? Had it been a group of sadistic monsters, it would have been more believable; I wouldn't have had to question it. The second I questioned the premise, the atmosphere came apart.",Martyrs

405,cjc-31590,A transcendental experience,10,1 February 2016,"On the occasion of the release of the remake I decided to watch Martyrs again. Watching it the first time was an experience like no other. It's the kind of movie that after it's over, you need some time to regain your composure and your senses and to process what you just went through. A truly impactful movie that's in all honesty unforgettable.In the years since it's been made it hasn't lost anything. In part because despite some recent attempts at making fresh horror, nothing comes close. It was the seal of the short French extreme horror years. In a way it was also the end of the ""torture porn"" era, even tough Saw continues to limp along for no good reason, a dreadful and pointless franchise that should have ended a long time ago.I'm not a fan of the ""torture porn"" label, even more so when applied to Martyrs. Still, Martyrs is the best torture porn movie that isn't a torture porn movie, but so much more. No other movie has made more visceral torture scenes than Martyrs, scenes that are more of a ritual than individual scenes. No other movie has managed to torture its audience along with it main character like Martyrs; it martyrizes us in the process.And yet, this isn't torture for the the sake of torture, like all those true torture porn movies. When it's all said an done, this is torture for the sake of something else, something other than torture, something much greater than pain and suffering. In this case, ultimate knowledge or knowledge of the ultimate. And the huge payoff in Martyrs is intellectual (again not just for the protagonist but for the audience as well) which is why I think many don't like it. The payoff isn't emotional. You're left with a huge emotional question mark.Granted, the knowledge we gain in Martyrs isn't an answer...but a question. However, after having experienced Martyrs, even a question is enough.

It's difficult to know what to say about this movie really; like a birth or a death, you really have to experience it yourself and draw your own conclusions. What I will say is that as a committed horror freak, rare is the occasion when I tense up and watch a film contorted, somehow trying to protect myself from what I'm putting myself through.. It contains enough tough to see horror/gore to satisfy the bloodhounds (though it doesn't feel like another attempt to up the gore ante for the sake of it, thankfully) and then - if you can watch it and many couldn't - transcends the genre totally with a jaw-dropping final act which if you're interested in the human condition and the capacity for seemingly normal people to do incredibly bad things will have you asking questions for some time to come and recognising that when horror and ideas mesh successfully, the result can be breathtaking. Absolutely not enjoyable but there again if you go to see a horror flick at a film festival and you know beforehand that it originally received an X-certificate in France, kicking up an almighty stink in the process - well, you know that an open mind is the least you can bring to bear. With that in mind I would recommend Martyrs as a film of incredible tension, harrowing physical violence and indelible imagery; unsurprisingly, the director name-checked Dario Argento during the Q&A as a major influence in his youth and there is a clear and confident signature in the work which suggests some parallels can be made between the two film-makers. I loved this movie and for those who have already posted comments good, bad or indifferent (and I really can't imagine a neutral response!) I hope like myself you have come away with a genuine sense of having seen something the like of which we are unlikely to see for some time..",Martyrs

408,joeyvelajr,Woah!,10,17 May 2020,"This movie is truly disturbing. As a huge fan of the horror genre, no movie prior has left me in pure shock as Martyrs did.

409,rcsscr,This is the type of film that does the horror genre justice,10,9 February 2021,"I have a pretty strong stomach and have seen lots of films that others have described as disturbing. Most of them I felt fell short of the mark or made too much of an effort to be exploitative to be taken seriously. This is not one of those films. Three years after watching it for the first time, I still feel affected by it while most movies I forget about after a week. There are a few things in particular that made it stand out to me.Too many ""horror"" films rely on an abrasive soundtrack and over the top jump scares to get your intention. But with Martyrs, the atmosphere is unsettling without resorting to that very often, and the plot is truly haunting on its own. As other users have pointed out, ""torture porn"" is not an accurate way to describe this by any means. It is well written, draws on themes that are hauntingly familiar, and the violence and depravity serves a purpose. Movies like hostel don't provide any sort of thought provoking message, and merely attempt to shock the viewer with its excess. Martyrs, on the other hand, really wants you to think about the concepts it portrays and it does a phenomenal job in doing so.A lot of people seem to go into horror movies without actually wanting to get uncomfortable and question things. It irritates me to see people bashing the film just because they couldn't handle it. Those who believe the kind of stuff portrayed here doesn't happen in real life have been living under a rock and can't stomach that aspect of reality. When you think about the countless prisoners of war that have been subjected to god knows what, and the number of children that go missing each year in the US alone, it really makes this movie get under your skin all the more.I give Martyrs 10/10 because it makes you think in a way that very few horror films are able to. I recommend it to anyone with an open mind who isn't afraid to examine the darker side of humanity.",Martyrs
410,anthononymous,"1st half top, 2nd half flop",5,25 January 2010,"Well, this is only my second review on IMDb (the other being for Eraserhead), but after seeing this movie, I just knew I had to write something about it.I do see myself as a friend of rather extreme and unconventional movies, so my interest was piqued while reading a review of 'À l'intérieur' here on IMDb, and also learning that the movie was banned in Germany (from where I am now writing this review).I didn't know much about it, except that it was about a girl who was tortured in her childhood, and, later on in her life, takes revenge.Well, I have to say that the first half (and it is pretty much exactly the first half), I found quite amazing. It appeared to be an intense, unflinching and honest depiction of a woman who had been so severely damaged during her childhood, that the actions she took appeared to be quite unavoidable, and the way in which these actions were portrayed were, in my opinion, fantastic cinema. Still, it kept me wondering, how this might be sustained through the second half...Well, and this is where it all goes pear-shaped. Had this movie stopped at the middle, I would have given it a 10 out of 10, but unfortunately, it goes on...What follows is a completely superfluous and at times even unintentionally comical segment of, for lack of a better term, 'torture porn'. I really couldn't see where the point was. It appeared to me to be a celebration of everything that the first half of the film would have seemed to criticize. The only reason I continued watching to the bitter end (and believe me, it is an utterly ridiculous end), was the hope that somehow, the film might manage to breathe at least some sort of sense into what I had to endure during that second half... but alas, my hopes were smashed to bits. I don't enjoy watching people on screen being tortured, but I can accept the fact that it might be necessary to show such scenes, in order to get your point across. However, what the point was supposed to be here, I have yet to learn. The scene when Anna is about half-way through her ordeal, and suddenly the melancholy piano music sets in, had me cringing in my seat. I mean, come on, that is so cheap... trying to redeem yourself through wanting to make us 'feel sad' for the victim, after you have just subjected her (and us as viewers) to about 15 minutes of constant abuse... Maybe it's just me, but that was, I think, the weakest scene of the entire movie (apart from, I have to repeat, the ending). The old lady that was the head of the organization was also a terrible choice in my opinion. Why go for a (stereo-)typical villain, when someone less 'obvious' would have done the job. All in all, it seemed to me that the second half was just shot for cheap thrills, geared towards people who have a faible for this kind of violence.Let me repeat, I thought the first half of the film was quite amazing, with acting, direction, editing all being above par, but the rubbish that follows just destroys that. The first half could have stood for itself, even if it was only 45 minutes long... so the five stars the film gets from me are basically the 10 stars that the first half deserved.",Martyrs

I finished watching this movie around 25 minutes ago and sat glued to the chair for about 10 minutes after the credits had finished rolling. I then needed another 15 minutes to compose myself and think of anything sensible to write about it. This movie really packs a punch.From the first second to the last you are taken on a wild adventure which, to begin with, seems to make very little sense. This changes about half way through as the story is further developed and this is where you begin to feel the effect which I discussed at the beginning of this review. The sense of helplessness, knowing that this will not end well for Anna makes me want to hate this movie. But I can't. I feel as though this is a movie which I will never forget, and isn't that what a movie should do?

418,paulh310162,Sensory overdrive,9,23 October 2012,"If the object of this movie was to leave me feeling utter rage and anger then it succeeded. But Don't take that as the start of a bad review. This is an excellent movie which grabs you right from the start, shakes you around and never lets go until the closing credits and even then you are feeling revulsion from what you have just witnessed but also guilt from actually admiring the standard of the film making. The opening scene of a young girl obviously fleeing from some unspeakable experience sets the scene perfectly for what is about to come. The plot is actually a simple one - abused and tortured girl (Lucie) seeks revenge on her abusers with the help of the one girl (Anna) who could connect with her in the hospital both were admitted to with most of the movie concentrated 15 years after the opening scene. But don't go thinking this is just another revenge movie - it isn't. There are more twists and turns than you'll find at a roller-coaster in a theme park and the intensity builds and builds until you don't think you can take any more. But then comes the final 25 minutes when Anna, the main character is subjected to inhuman abuse which is a relentless assault on your senses and I almost found myself wanting the movie to end to stop her suffering. Finding out just why she had to suffer such inhuman abuse made my blood boil and I had to keep reminding myself that this was just a movie. The very last scene had me full of so many emotions - anger, pity, grief, sadness and ultimately relief that her suffering would soon be over. This is a movie that will stay with me for a long time. Some may compare it to Hostel but it is nothing of the kind. This is an intelligently made movie but also the fact that the victims weren't tortured for some perverted pleasure but for another almost worse objective makes this far more disturbing. Watch this if you want to see a good movie but don't expect to feel good about yourself afterwards. Right, I'm off for a shower to clean this feeling off me!",Martyrs
419,XfreshfromitalyX,"The kind of film a person may not want to see, but should",10,30 June 2010,"I saw this title with a few friends tonight, following ""REC"". I still had the vibe and fun intensity of ""REC"" in my system and, after a 10 minute snack break, we put on ""Martyrs"", which I had never heard of before hand. As the film started, I began to get the feeling that it would be a supernatural thriller. But, as it progressed, it became more and more obvious that it was something much more disturbing than I could've predicted, and my previous giddiness was no more. This a very great title, in that it lives up to the genre's true roots; you will be horrified by this film, in one way or another. However, the material is something you don't find terribly often in horror films, which is what most likely led to my stomach pains that I'm experiencing while I'm writing this review. The characters in this film aren't being hunted down by Michael Myers, Leatherface, or any famous slasher. They are tortured to points of profound pain by humans. Watching this just reminds me that this is happening in dozens of places every day, worldwide. That's why I love this film - it makes people understand what goes on while they live what they call ""hard"" lives.I can't say I enjoyed watching this film, per se, but it was important I finished it so that the impact left a permanent mark on me. To be honest, I don't even know if I plan on watching this ever again. Don't watch this for a fun movie night, for you will just ruin anything fun planned for that night. However, if you plan on watching something that will leave an eternal imprint on your vision of society, then I deeply suggest this title.

423,breakz_1984,Im Quite Stunned...,10,4 April 2009,"I have just seen Martyrs tonight after wanting to see it since hearing about it when it was in production.. I must admit, i was not sure what to expect from this movie, but i have been quite stunned and hugely impressed by what i have seen - i am by no means a master of reviews like some of the previous, well worded, well informed reviews i have read just now before attempting this so please bare with my novice opinion on the movie. To which there may be some spoilers, however, although i normally don't mind spoilers, i really think this may be the very 1st movie I've ever seen - where spoilers are unacceptable and the movie really has to be seen while knowing very little about it if nothing at all! so with that in mind i will be vigilant to keep them at a minimum.Martyrs opens with a scene to set the mood of the movie, a child escaping capture from something surely horrible - this sets thoughts in your mind of what may follow.There is then a family breakfast scene, quite long but brilliantly paced, nothing prepares you for the way this is about to be disrupted.We are then given via flashbacks, the story of this little girls nightmare before escaping and why she is seeking brutal retribution 15 years later.This is to set the mood for the movie, or so you think, as the brilliant pace of it throws you completely off course and does not properly prepare you for what is to come.I give these examples as the movie is clearly in 2 stages, and i must admit, i did not know the reason for the movie (its plot) until it was approaching its climax right at the end... For a movie to not give itself away until the very end, and genuinely keep you guessing for this long is a true testamant to the brilliance of this piece of cinema - i will not mention anything about the rest of the movie as this would be robbing the people who have not seen it of the experience i am feeling now and would not be fair to anyone - you simply need to see it! I love horror movies, a lot of my movie taste does contain violence and disturbing imagery - but this film is something else altogether. I have not felt so many emotions during a movie, of any genre, ever... and saying this i would not even put Martyrs in the 'horror' genre - as it is not a horror movie, it is simply a very disturbing, very thought provoking, masterpiece of modern day cinema.Like i mentioned before, i am no expert, i am not very good at writing, and i do find it difficult to get my point across - i am just someone who LOVES cinema, and have so many thoughts jumping through my head after literally just watching this, i felt i had to put them down here because i know my fiancée would never watch this movie with me so cant exactly talk to her about it...This is the best movie i have seen for quite sometime, and if you have the stomach for it - i really suggest you watch this as it will pose many questions afterwards and anything that creates thought must be a positive thing in my book.",Martyrs
424,aleksa47,masterpieceofgarbage,1,29 October 2009,"I guess I will never understand people who like the horror genre. Does watching this make them feel tough? Do they find some meaning in this artificial pain and suffering? This is nothing compared to what happens in real life and screenwriters and directors who make this sort of films seem to be bored, overgrown kids with no life experience and imagination. And then people say how it is an exploration of psyche and blah, blah... Everyone who is not too prudish can make up three stories like this before breakfast and if you think you can't, I can only say that the evolution, god or whatever you believe in, hasn't been too kind to you. Every once in a while I think to myself - maybe I'm missing out on something, not watching horror films, so I watch something and every time I regret it. Luckily, I was able to fast forward through the meaningless scenes of torture and violence, only to find that there's no excuse for it in the end. There never is with horror movies. I have watched (almost) the whole film to witness the whole 5 minutes or so of something that was supposed to be a story. A bunch of old people who are eager to know about afterlife, so they torture young girls. Hahahahaha what a joke!

That said I was also extremely disappointed by Hostel and the whole grind house genre. My view is that if you take the violence out of these films you are left with nothing. These directors know what people want to see and are simply packaging a product (sadistic violence) into a form that people can watch without feeling like a pervert.

429,scherrge,Torture porn à la française,2,10 February 2016,"HERE THERE BE SPOILERS!I've read reviews that called this film ""transcendental"" and ""meaningful"" and other things to that effect. But in the end, ""Martyrs"" is torture porn à la française. That's really all this is.Let me preface this by saying that I am not easily disturbed and not generally averse to violence and gore in film, whether it serves a meaningful purpose or not. Gore for gore's sake is just as fine with me as is gore for meaning's sake. What irks me, however, is when a deeper meaning is merely affected to hide the fact that really, it's all about the gore. ""Martyrs"" is a shining example of this. The last act of the film makes the attempt to philosophise everything that went on beforehand and it fails on a spectacular level. This might have to do with the somewhat patchwork structure of the film. Even while watching the film it seemed as if it consisted of three very different ideas stitched together: The beginning takes its cues from classic horror movie tropes, then it makes a sharp turn toward a thriller and finally plunges headlong into the world of torture porn. This leaves us with three pieces of a film that feel very different, most of all because of a sudden change of protagonist that comes with this. The first part makes out Lucie to be the main character, not least because we bear witness to her hallucinations. Then, Anna takes her place and in the last part, she becomes (justifiably) mute and inactive. This leads to a real difficulty, at least for me, to identify with any of these characters and ultimately takes a whole lot of punch out of the torture sequences later on. If I am not invested in a character, seeing that character be tortured for the better part of half an hour is not going to affect me emotionally. What I'm seeing is an actress and an actor performing a scripted sequence. Some have said that this was hard to sit through and having heard those sentiments before I wondered if something was wrong with me when I felt rather bored during the last part of the film, instead of being properly horrified at the human propensity for violence. But it wasn't violence I was seeing, it was acting. And it served no purpose other than to horrify and disgust the viewer. Having failed to be horrified by the goings-on, I hoped for a great revelation, of any kind whatsoever. A justification for the hour and a half that went beforehand. And then the film ends. There is no explanation, there is no twist, there is not even the explanation that there is no explanation. So even as a statement on nihilism, it fails. Bang, The End. That's it. Even tripe such as ""Hostel"" had a (flimsy) explanation for its ludicrous plot. No such luck with ""Martyrs"".So, lacking any emotional investment in the characters, a coherent plot, motivation and sense, this is just violence and gore for its own sake. Which would be fine if there wasn't the constant sensation of the director tapping the viewer on the shoulder, saying, ""See what I did there? Clever, isn't it. See those pictures? See how I've made Anna's revelation silent to keep everyone guessing? See that home video footage with the end credits? It's all terribly clever, but you probably don't get it. It's art, you know! This is definitely not violent for violence's sake! No, it's definitely not!""Yes. Yes it definitely is.Two stars for the good performance by Mylène Jampanoï.

I'm not very intuitive, but I figured that out after about 2 minutes into the movie. Then perhaps we are meant to like her friend?

433,vedranstuc,"excellent,very brutal and disturbing",10,12 April 2011,"When i saw trailer for Martyrs i thought it's gonna be slasher type like High tension which is very good horror movie.French 'new wave' is pretty brutal,with extreme gore and is disturbing to watch,with no comics reliefs or any reliefs during movie.Movie is extremely brutal,the mood in film is very depressing from the beginning...Seeing young,tortured girl running away from captivity makes you feel uneasy already but movie hasn't even started and you ask yourself can it be any worse?Ooooo yes it can,when it starts we see grown up Lucie,ringing the bell on the house where u see 'normal' family living there lives...then BAMM daddy is blown away and the revenge starts,we see our girl Lucie struggling with her traumas and her friend Anna isn't fully sure that all those things are true. As movie goes Anna finds hidden door which leads to torture room but it's already too late.They are captured and Anna ends in same torture room she earlier found.This is where movie becomes torture-porn,very unpleasant,violent,brutal and no mercy at all.I found myself at disbelief at watching what that big guy is doing to Anna.I am a horror-fan and i have watched almost every single so called disturbing movie(August underground serious,Serbian movie,TLHOTL,Men behind the sun,POTK,Cannibal holocaust,Henry:POSK,Sthram)and this one belongs to top 10,simply cause it shows what kind a of monster can we be for such meaningless goal,plus scripts seems pretty real and possible. Martyrs is kind of movie u love or hate,there is no middle.You will not have fun while watching and u could say movie is ugly,full of unnecessary violence,brutality but if u watch it be sure u won't forget ever.One of few movies that made me awake for 3-4 hours,couldn't sleep at all and feeling very uneasy.Highly recommended but not for everyone's taste ***** of *****",Martyrs

This is cinematic history. If you are looking for something with lots of murders or killings this is not it, this has lots of violence but only about 10 deaths, about 4 being in the beginning.At the beginning of this you think wtf, this crazy girl has been here 5 minutes and already shot this house up but as the story unfolds you see all the pain and TORTURE that Anna and Lucie were put through. This is weird in parts but always explains the reason. It shows the traumatic pain something like this can put on a fragile young girl and the family. It is also quite crazy that they would believe its OK to do this thing for anything never mind RELIGIOUS RESEARCH! To be honest why would anyone care so much about the afterlife? I find it odd that thy would pry out metal from somebody's head without anything as much as a first aid kit or a doctor or even a sane person!One thing that i do not understand is when the dying mother is found to be alive why help her i know its sounds brutal, horrible heartless whatever but i don't think forgiving for something like that is that easy. Honestly i would lock the bathroom door or tell my friend to finish her she might as well been dead already! This is already one of my horror favourites i would recommend to fans of REC 1&2, The Tortured and possibly Hostel and Saw sagas. I recommend watching the UNCUT version and not the television cut!!!",Martyrs

But, in the end you'll be glad you did."" OK I was not glad (mostly furious) at the end that I watched it, seriously? this has been the biggest waste of time ever, I sure hope French cinema isn't all like this because if so, I will never watch one again.

438,colejames16,"Madness, mental issues, mutations and 'Martyrs'",6,26 September 2012,"Each and every time I read articles about horror movies, which are the most horrific, the ones that will shock the pants off you, 'Martyrs' is always close to the top of the list. Naturally, after reading profusely about this film, intrigued at its' ability to shock even the most jaded of horror fans, I had to give it a look. Of course, things aren't always as they seem in the world of film criticsThe film itself is French, filmed in Quebec, Canada. Don't be disheartened by subtitles; I find them an excellent way to help fully absorb yourself in a movie. Anyway, not the point. It follows two girls, Lucie and Anna, both subjected to horrible abuse as children (however, in separate circumstances). Adult Lucie is determined to get revenge on those who put her through such terrible anguish, with Anna (generally) supporting her. Lucie, suffering from trauma as well as delusions, soon allows herself to be consumed by her mental instability, leaving Anna alone in the house of Lucie's abusers. I know this seems like a long-winded introduction but I don't want to give any of the events away.Shortly into her time in the apparently empty house, Anna makes a discovery: a sterile, hospital- like basement hidden away from the world. In this basement Anna finds yet another like Lucie who has been tortured in the same manner, minus the escape. Needless to say, Anna's attempts to help the other are short-lived. Once again alone in the house, Anna is confused and becoming unravelled. That is, until she is found.From here on the film takes an interesting turn, exposing us to a world filled with depravity and torment, all the while lacking humanity and reason. As Anna's life begins a rapid downward spiral, it becomes quite difficult to understand why this film was made. The concept of a martyr is not entirely convincing and while many reviews rave about how different 'Martyrs' is from the shock-horror gore-porn we have all come to know – I don't know, I can't say I necessarily agree. The film is bizarre, twisted, degrading, horrific, unreasonable and, to be frank, f***ed up. Don't get me wrong, I understood it, but was there a need for it? Perhaps not.Look, give it one viewing – if you get squeamish at mutated humans like me, then you'll get a slight kick out of it. But ensure you are prepared for a whole lot of strange. 'Martyrs' will definitely not be anything like you are expecting.** If you liked this review, don't forget to follow my blog! horrorble.blogspot.com **",Martyrs

The superb cinematography contributes to immersion of the viewer into the evil, depravity and violence directed upon the victims, almost as if you were actually there, watching, as a eye-witness to the commission of a horrendous crime. This is not a theater experience that you are likely to forget. There is a remake of Martyrs that was released in 2015. If you plan on watching both, watch this original production first. The remake does not come close to capturing the raw emotion and the true portrayal of the devastation wrought upon the victims nor does it adequately portray the overwhelming hatred that has been fermented, spawning a unwavering need and a determination for retribution that the perpetrator has projected so deeply within the psyche, even the very soul of the his victims, as brilliantly demonstrated in this original motion picture. After watching this movie, you will feel as though you were physically present, living the excitement, the naked terror and horror generated by the totally believable depictions of pure sadism committed as you stood by, frozen, just watching.",Martyrs

I think it did itself a disservice by holding its cards so close to its chest.IMHO it would have been much more satisfying if we'd been let in on the secret much sooner. By the time the truth is revealed I was thoroughly bored by the torture. Because we didn't know the why these awful things were happening it just felt like some sort of vile sadomasochistic porn.Maybe I'm a bit stupid, but I really hadn't worked out exactly why such terrible things were happening to these women. More intelligent viewers may have realised what was going on, but not me.That said, I still think it would have been much better if we'd been given an insight into the religious loons and their search for redemption. Without that it felt too much like any other piece of torture porn.A shame, because once the motives of the torturers is revealed, everything makes sense.TL;DR: could have been much better if the writer/director had told the story differently.",Martyrs

443,AJzkitten69,This is not a horror movie.,1,6 November 2010,"First off, I know I checked the ""contains spoiler"" box, but just to be clear, this review definitely does contain large spoilers.Let me start by saying this: ""Martyrs"" is not a horror movie. It's practically a snuff film. In fact, the only difference I can see between ""Martyrs"" and a snuff film is that a snuff film is supposedly real.For one thing, it seems unable to decide which genre it is, which is fine when such a blending of genres is done well. This isn't. It's so choppy that it made me almost feel like I was watching two or three separate films. In fact, the reason this isn't getting one star from me is because at least one of the films I felt like I was watching was actually pretty good.The film does have a lot of good ideas...but none of them pay off. The pseudo-philosophical bits had potential, but it didn't make sense that they would make one of the torture victims completely unable to communicate if they wanted the martyrs to report back on what they saw beyond the point of death.As for the last 30 minutes of torture porn...well, it is what it is, and if you're into that sort of thing, this review won't stop you. Personally, the unrated version of ""Hostel"" is pretty much my limit.However, what's the point of watching a movie where you know, from the second they have her in custody, that there's no hope left? I knew as soon as they cuffed her that she was going to be brutally tortured for the rest of the movie, So the only reason to keep watching is in the vain hope that there will be some sort of payoff, which there never is.Basically, I have no real issues with the idea of torture porn so long as the movie is honest and straightforward about what it is. I'll use ""Hostel"" as an example again because it's the best example of this genre I've seen. ""Hostel"" tells the viewer, even in the preview, that it is a movie about people torturing other people. It doesn't hide from that. It revels in it and presents that fact proudly, so only people interested in that sort of thing would bother watching. ""Martyrs"" presents itself as being about the lengths people will go to for friendship, and the depths of depravity some would sink to in pursuit of knowledge. I'd like it a whole lot better if it were actually about those things, and not just about watching the complete destruction of a human being.",Martyrs

Never a motion picture has made me feel so empty and amazed by the sheer brutality and hopelessness shown... All of it is top notch: Acting, pacing, makeup, cinematography, plot, score, atmosphere...

Another big plus is the realism! ""Avant-gardiste"", this movie was ahead of the curve in understanding that what's truly scary is seeing something that could really happen!!

If you have even a passing interest in extreme horror or extreme cinema in general, chances are you have heard of this French language film.It is a film that has proved to be divisive. Some feel it is almost a masterpiece, while some feel it is a tasteless and extreme gore-fest that only appeals to sickos.I happen to think it's pretty great. However, this is not a movie I would watch if you have yet to sample more extreme films, as it is a lot more extreme, both in gore and dark themes than your average horror. If the thought of stabbing, evisceration or skin removal sounds too much for you; don't start your journey into extreme cinema here.If you do decide to give it a go, don't be like me and read up too much about it. I basically knew the whole plot, which was maybe why I was a bit less shocked than I could have been. If the thought of ultra, fairly realistic violence, dark nihilistic themes, great cinematography and an ending that is open to interpretation appeal to you, just watch it. I won't even give any plot details, this is a film to see blind.Is it a perfect film? In short, no. Some decisions the characters make are a bit unbelievable in a 'no sane person would go down that tunnel' kinda way.So can you handle it? Well I am at this time a relative novice to extreme films. One of the few ultra violent films I had seen before this was Takashi Miike's Ichi The Killer. I could handle that, and I could handle this. So if you have a strong stomach and the urge for something fresh, I highly suggest Martyrs.",Martyrs

A girl escaped from confinement of kidnapper where she was tortured badly. She recovered from the trauma gradually with the help of her friend. Things were looking interesting. Then story moved 15 years ahead and with that began bloodshed. Apparently girl was taking revenge for the abuse she endured in childhood.

Unlike all the other films of the festival, there were no cheers when characters were bloodily dispatched. Equally there was no unintentionally funny dialogue to snigger at (Jack Bauer vs The Exorcist, anyone?).What Martyrs did have was a suggestion of the emotional horrors (rather than simply the physical) endured by someone who has been tortured. That was the first half of the film. The second half shifted plot-wise and also provided us with a motivation (however twisted) for the abuse - far more creepy than simply entertainment for the sick, as with Hostel.Despite it's bleakness I came out feeling uplifted, and evidently this was the director's intention. It could have been purely because this was the only film over the course of the weekend that had any intellectual aspirations, but it did succeed in eliciting strong reactions from the hardened horror audience, both positive and negative.The nearest I can compare this too is Irreversible, but unlike Gasper Noé's film, I do feel that I can stomach another viewing of Martyrs, and the sooner the better.",Martyrs

Before seeing this movie I had no expectations about it; actually, when I saw the poster, it didn't strike me as something special; in fact, it looked just like one of so many low-budget gory films. Then I saw the movie and I was very impressed in a really good way. First of all the film shocked me with how psychosis hallucination is described in a way I had never seen before. It was too realistic! Then I was deeply involved with the philosophical plot. Of course it was disturbing and not for everyone; however, I can make a risky statement: this is art. Why?

What I do before I watch all my movies (ALL I watch is horror) is read the critic's reviews and synopsis on IMDb to make sure it is actually worth watching (I think we can all agree so much of horror is just pure crap nowadays). After reading up on this movie, I was really excited to watch it. I am American and watched it subtitled. Surprisingly, the movie was SO engulfing within a few minutes I forgot I was even reading subtitles! The movie is basically split into two stories, which is really cool. My advice is NOT to read anything about this movie before you watch it! Since I knew what to expect, it really took a lot away from the movie, and I deeply regret doing so! A lot of people name this as ""the most disturbing movie"" (or one of them), and I definitely don't agree with that. However, I guess it depends on personal taste. I watched a YouTube review where the girl was practically crying reviewing this. Maybe I'm just that desensitized? I've seen A Serbian Film, and while I didn't consider that all that disturbing either, I think it goes beyond Martyrs. What I love about this movie is that you don't just get gore or torture for the sake of it, there is REAL meaning behind it. The end of the film is one of my favorite's ever put to screen, and this movie will TRULY get you thinking. I adore psychological thrillers (Victim is one of my favorites as well), and I think this imparts some aspects of that. At any rate, this is a MUST SEE for any horror lover!!!

The film itself has stages, the first half an hour or so is very creepy, but it then changes into more of a story with a few twists.The last part where Anna is taken by the organisation is something obviously I could see coming as soon as they entered the house.It was extremely disturbing and you can see why in the world of today the UK does not provide consumers with movies like this, partially because its morally and ethically wrong and partially because the majority of consumers will just moan about it being too disgusting.

Like August Mordum Requiem, I don't care for movie that's showing me realistic torture just to disturb me.It's not really scary and more just disgusting.It's just EXCESSIVE with the torture and at the end all they throw on it is an ambiguous ending that doesn't really make the slog through the torture worth it.Although I liked the ending, and do think about it from time to time, it was one of the ONLY parts I liked about the movie.If I were to re-watch it I would only watch the ending.

461,george_brkly,Art (for people who have an airbrushed painting of a decapitated women in an bikini next to a Harley hung over their fireplace),1,19 June 2009,"Many commentators on IMDb have claimed this film to be some kind of 'art'. This of course is ridiculous. The philosophical background to the film, as previously pointed out by no-one, can be found with Bataille. He acquired some photographs of a young Chinese rebel who was executed for attempting to assassinate the Emperor. The photos were of the execution itself, which was the death by 1000 cuts. The agony of the ordeal causes the man's hair to stand on end and a look of - what Bataille took to be - a kind of ecstasy is seen on his face. Bataille would stare at his photos for hours on end looking for inspiration, thinking his mystical thoughts and plotting his rather bizarre pornographic novels. This was in the days when such images were hard to come by. If you'd like to see the pictures yourself, simply type ""Bataille"" into Google Images.Bataille considered his greatest book to be the Tears of Eros, in which he looks at violence and eroticism in art from prehistoric cave paintings onwards. It is fully illustrated with pictures of cavemen sporting erections next to split open bison dangling their bloody entrails, woodcuts of unborn children bursting out of protestant martyrs wombs and through the flames and they burn alive at the stake, and so on.Art is full of death, torture, suffering, eroticism, mysticism and so forth. In almost all cases the tortured and the dead are real people or based on real events. In films like Hostel, Saw, and now Martyrs the characters and events are artificial, the suffering being pornography and titillation not eroticism and art. We are not getting close to understanding the relationship between eroticism and death, or any other philosophical aspiration, nothing new or original is being raised by the film.As pornography looks for boundaries to cross in order to satisfy its audience desire for sexual release, it turns increasingly to degradation. Viewers watch it to get off on the lack of humanity, and then get off a second time, afterwards, at their own lack of humanity. So-call 'horror porn' does the same. Film-makers look to make films that satisfy their audiences desire to see people degraded, tortured and killed so they can get off watching it and then get off feeling degraded themselves afterwards. But, as with the porn, viewers can take comfort in the fact that the scenes they watched were staged, the actors playing roles, and no-one really got hurt, just a little psychologically sore. It is little more than an emotional game. Not art but a game.Martyrs isn't art. Films don't have to be art but they shouldn't be a game.",Martyrs

464,mojo7676,well made but gratuitous violence and gore masquerading as something deeper,1,8 January 2011,"a bizarre film; it's saving graces being good acting, a decent script and relatively high production values. so why the bad score? well, the whole premise of the film (as opposed to any flaws in its execution) is complete nonsense; a bunch of elites, headed up by a wrinkly old 'madamoiselle', have the time and resources to inflict capture, contain and dehumanise human beings so that a. they create martyrs and b. the martyrs can talk to them about their state of ecstasy by describing visions of or contact with 'the other world'; the final stage of achieving said martyrdom before a thankful death. what i found annoying and a little disturbing were the very graphic depictions violence and gore: a woman minus her skin (except for that on her face) and a fair few violent beatings she receives throughout the second part of the film. don;t get me wrong, i understand that depictions of violence are often necessary either as a way of moving plot forward, as a feature of representation itself or even simply shocking/entertaining the viewer. in this case, the violence i could live with but the completely nonsensical denouements - theological/philosophical in nature - simply didn't justify it. as such, i found the movie pretentious and over reaching in its attempt to legitimate its depictions of inhumanity through some banal reference to cheap, naive and somewhat flawed doctrinal framework.",Martyrs
465,plutsieo,Horror in it's purest form!,9,1 June 2020,"This film should be at least an 8/10 overall.
It's full of gore and chaos throughout, which I understand may not be everybody's cup of tea, especially for the light hearted, but if you went into the film not expecting total brutality, why did you bother watching in the first place?
The film uses an incredible concept which is very rarely explored, yet has so much potential.
Pascal laughier has certainly created a classic horror which not only uses dark subjects such as child abuse, and mixed it with something that has been narrowly explored for a very long time.
The delivery of the film was executed perfectly, the opening shows every part of backstory needed in order to understand what is happening throughout, yet leaves questions to be answered at the end.
It almost feels like watching two films, with a large twist at one specific point. Similar to Ryan Gosling's unexpected death in A Place Beyond The Pines.I really appreciate the ending which Laughier uses, as it can leave the audience with an open mind as to what they believe the answer truly was to the myth of becoming a martyr.Overall, this film is 1000000% worth a watch, but don't expect it to be easy on the eyes, every subject which is presented throughout is dark and brutal.

466,sophiawatchesfilm,A Horror Masterpiece,10,18 June 2020,"I will defend this movie forever because I think it is one of the most effective modern horror masterpieces I have ever seen.People who call this ""torture porn,"" have trouble differentiating a movie such as this, with a genuine theme and context to the violence, from something that exists only for shock value, such as ""Human Centipede."" This movie's violence exists for a reason. There is a message behind it. What is depicted is the most brutal portrayal of human suffering that I have seen.This film explores the idea of transcendence and martyrdom in such a violent and thought provoking manner, that I can't help but sing its praises. It truly explores the depths of the human psyche and what happens after suffering and death.Pascal Laugier made this film when he was suffering with depression and it makes a lot of sense. It touches on abuse, mental and physical suffering, transcendence, martyrdom, and humanity's cruelty and morbid curiosity for the unknown. For something better.Though it is extremely hard to stomach, it is so incredibly awesome that it upsets me to see people misinterpreting it. I am a pretty big horror fan and this movie is just perfect for me. It really did freak me out and stuck with me for a long time afterward. 10/10 movie in my opinion.",Martyrs

But the way it was hyped in online spaces is that it was one of the most extreme disturbing torture flicks. Most of the torture in the movie (in fact most of the movie) just consists of a woman being slapped and force fed porridge. It doesn't have all the creative dismemberment and torture techniques of films like Saw and Hostel until the very end where the main character has all her skin surgically removed which causes her to achieve ""Martyrdom"" which is the goal of the mystery torture cult, since they think that it a person is tormented enough they will reach a state of being where they are still alive but can see into the afterlife. The leader of this torture cult is then told by the protagonist what the afterlife is like, and when she calls all the members of the cult for a reveal of what she has discovered the cult leader just shoots herself without revealing it.This leads you to ponder, did she find out that there is no afterlife? Did she find out how horrible OR wonderful the afterlife is? The ending is both interesting and kind of annoying, on one hand it leaves you pondering, on the other hand the one and a half hour of build up with kidnappings and torture ends up with a nihilistic climax.In my opinion the best part of the movie is the first 1/3rd where the two protagonists hunt down the torturers and you're trying to figure what the hell this is all about. When the cult captures the one protagonist after killing the other it is just followed by an hour of slapping and force feeding which just bored the hell out of me.",Martyrs

474,overlordabel,Terrible because of deus-ex machina resolution,8,29 November 2012,"Whoever watched Guinea Pig, Hostel, Aftermath and so on, know what type of films torture porns are. There is little room for additional explanation here. However, here we get something really interesting. First half or so of the film we have an intense horror/thriller movie. Great direction and editing. It is so intense and well-paced, one can only hope for an awesome resolution at the end. Then, things go the other way. You get your more or less torture porn where we watch a girl who is getting tortured. But, there is more than pure sadistic satisfaction by people in black suits. Or so we are told. Now, why this film doesn't deserve more than a 1 star. Because we get the setup that there is something GREAT beyond all the tortures. Even Jesus Christ or other saint references can be seen here. We know that at the end of the film, we will be the witnesses of the great truth. An author of the film will tell us what his vision of that truth is. And what we get? Nothing. That's right folks, we get - nothing. All that brilliant setup. All that great acting, horror scenes and nice back story. All for the cheapest of the cheap resolution. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone except if you're the fan of torture porn as it is. Nothing beyond surface here.If you ever read From Hell by Alan Moore, then you will get the glimpse of what I'm saying. A movie which is so well produced can't have an open ending. It mustn't. I want to see the vision of the director/writer. However banal or unimportant it may be, I want to see it. This, however, proves to me that he didn't had anything upon his sleeve. He didn't had any vision. Just an opportunity to film naked girls which he presented as if it's something deep and thoughtful. It isn't. And thus, I conclude my 99 minutes of life completely wasted.",Martyrs
475,jankat_111-1,Very Bad Organized Crime Story,2,11 July 2010,"The first 30 minutes of this is magnificent. It is both frightening and very emotional. It does not only have a blood bath to offer us on the screen but also the emotional workings of one of the main characters (who ironically die in the middle of the film). Although at first sight it feels like another monster story, in fact it is abundant with psychological matters about conscience.BUT: After the first 30 minutes, the film changes completely. It becomes an organized crime story, which I loathed. The originality, complexity and intensity of the first half hour is not to be found during the rest. It is simply like Hostel, where we see a lot of torture and do not even feel disgusted by it any more.The organization is apparently a maniacal group of rich people who are obsessed about finding out about the other world and who torture young women (because they are the best to put up with pain) to bring them to a state in which they continue living but are able to see the other world. So, yeah, bullshit. Absolute crap. What I find even more disturbing is the fact that the director seems to imply that what this organization does is not in fact that bad! I mean, there is no criticism of their actions in the film. None at all.There are a lot of references to Christianity and especially Catholicism (the scene where Anna is on a wheelchair, under white sheet, looking like Holy Mary and the way she is exposed to light after she has been skinned, looking like Christ on the cross), which is fine. And I do not attack the principles of Catholicism, which say that you have to put up with a lot of pain in this world since it is a test and the real world is the other one and so on. However, in the film, it is not the natural difficulties of life that these women are subjected to. It is organized torture! If the director thought of the organization as a metaphor for life, it was very stupid. And I feel disgusted by the idea.",Martyrs

We realized that the movie is an extreme version of the giallo films from the 60-70s which Dario contributed to. There were a couple of problems we had w/ the movie, but it has certainly stuck w/ us today. A lot of those Italian giallo films were certainly graphic and sexual for the time. A lot of them also were pretty strange, but many of them had secret organizations with nefarious designs on pretty women. Sounds a lot like Marytrs. Of course there are a lot of other films/styles the movie evokes - young people/girls being tortured has become a staple in horror - but this movie is certainly thought provoking while being disgustingly perverse at the same time.

477,manliano,God Awful,1,7 January 2011,"I'm all for big ideas and grand finales, but this one had absolutely nothing profound to say at the end. A sad, silly, and misogynistic little movie made for boys who love to think big, but don't have the capacity to hold their own train of thought up to the light. In interviews, the director has said he did not want to make a tongue in cheek movie, and wrote this script from an honest and emotional place. If he truly understood any of the points he was trying to convey, and if he had any sense of what those ideas actually mean to humanity, he surely would not have copped out at each and every turn. Either this man is an idiot, or merely an idiot savant. Regardless, he's not nearly as cut throat or deep as he clearly wants us to believe.For a far superior example of what this movie was trying to portray, please see Dreyer's 'The Passion of Joan of Ark' (it's available for free on you-tube).

483,ukbloke,Possibly the only indifferent review you'll read of this movie...,5,30 March 2009,"Martyrs is... average.It is not a philosophical masterpiece searching for answers about the human condition. The central premise is interesting, but the payoff is so, so feeble - if you've ever watched the (excellent) video for the song 'Just' by Radiohead, then that is the sum total of the payoff. It's fine for a music video which only has to justify 3 minutes of action, but when your movie has been responsible for the previous half hour of relentless violence, you really need to come up with something better. The movie is also far too predictable.The film can be split into two definite halves, and the first half is considerably better than the second. The visceral reality of someone haunted by childhood demons is beautifully visualised - although I find it hard to believe anyone believed that the 'demon' was anywhere but within Lucie's head. The second half, brutal and near bereft of dialogue, is a real drag. The fact that the payoff is so poor renders it all worthless.Incidentally, I don't buy all these reviewers who criticise the film for the fact that Anna doesn't call the police, instead going to sleep next to her dead friend. She is exhausted, grieving, traumatised and doesn't want to be implicated in mass murder. She doesn't call the police when she discovers a mistreated girl in the basement because she knows they are in a remote and isolated house. She goes to sleep next to her lost love who is lying in state. It's really not that hard to follow.All in all, no masterpiece.

485,archaosus,reminiscent of the film 'Hole',10,19 April 2009,"This film reminded me of several other films- Hole, Hellraiser, Hostel, Stigmata, and The passion of the Christ. It is beautifully shot, very Art-house, quite bleak, yet emotionally engaging. It is not a regular 'Horror' film, but tries to portray the darkness of the Human Psyche. The film creates a dark and uncomfortable and foreboding feeling that is reminiscent of when watching black and white documentaries of the Holocaust and the seemingly, disaffected mental state of the German Na*is who tortured innocent Jewish people...The 'Indifference' that a human can show while inflicting pain on another, and the lack of concern for another persons' suffering at their own hands, is what makes this film most disturbing. It is very graphic but instills psychological discomfort by the interaction between captor and captive. The title of the film however does have me baffled as i feel that the title 'Martyrs' is misconstrued completely...i think that the film could have had a better title...however, it depends on who in the film;- captors, captive, writer, director, - is conveying the term Martyr. If you love films like, 'Dead man Walking' and 'Dead Babies' (both British) and other films like Battle royale; Wreck, The orphanage, Hostel, Hellraiser, The Hole, Stigmata, -then i really think you will like this film. It really is excellent...(except for the Title!.....)-but it still deserves a 10 for pushing boundaries and sticking to an 'interesting plot'...despite a few inconsistencies here and there.

(Part 2 of 2)",1,10 June 2009,"(This is the continuation of my review under the name lepermessiahtr, due to the 1000 word-restriction)Anna knows that Lucie cannot be trusted to be on her own, yet she abandons her at every chance she is given (3 or 4 times in the movie), which, combined with the unreasonable distrust mentioned above, FUELS Lucie's self-destructive behaviour.After 15 years Anna must know that Lucie needs an ample amount of attention and affection, which is an arduous assignment as her amicable companion is obviously a difficult and rather uncontrollable subject. Lucie is shown to constantly drift into despair more and more with every time Lucie leaves her behind, and when this behaviour culminates in THE BETRAYAL(tm), it is not a surprise anymore that she breaks apart filled with hopelessness and the feel of being betrayed by her (very likely) only friend and kills herself - and this time it is herself, not the monster, who raises the knife. ""Why don't you believe me?"" Lucie makes perfectly clear how she feels, yet is unheard.So to tackle the ultimate failure of Martyrs, Anna's betrayal. It is Anna's nature to save (and what can change the nature of a man?). Lucie, the mother and the imprisoned woman. Make an intelligence check: who of those three is different from the rest? If it had been the child who survived Lucie's initial onslaught, and not the unbelievably unsympathetic bitch of a mother (which visually reminds me of the equally despicable mother in the ""Seventh Heaven"" series), this flick would have been so much better. Pity for the innocent child - reasonable. Sympathy for the slut who tortured the beloved person - behaviour absolutely not justifiable under any circumstances and therefore a screenplay mistake.Because I'm running out of space I'm not going into detail on all the other shortcomings like the fact the monster that is Lucie's personified guilt is shown too explicitly (don't show the shark!), various plot holes, and the absolutely dreadful second half of the film which can be summarized by quoting the famous two word review of Spinal Tap's ""Shark sandwich"" album...So, this movie, which was intended to be disturbing, left me but feeling so unbelievably cheated (the only other time I felt disappointed that bad was ""Nikita"") - usually I would rate the movie 1 star and have my peace of mind. But this story had so huge potential to become an emotionally grappling masterpiece, and was raped so violently by the hack screenplay writer, I can only shake my head in disgust and disbelief. Sure, even the way it is this project has some remarkable qualities - the two protagonists' excellent performances, some good direction, some of the soundtrack and the torture scenes (especially Lucie hurting herself is very gripping) - but those are distorted, eclipsed and raped by the horror that is the rest of Martyrs (2008).If you don't care about believable characters and just want to see pseudo-meaningful torture porn, this is the movie for you.

We can emphasize with the level of desperation of a tortured person. We see religious fanaticism or fanaticism of any other kind in hands of crazy (probably rich enough to get through with it).

This is a slow story that builds...and builds...and then,at the final moment, if you don't laugh out loud at the awesomeness of what you have watched, you should not be watching movies like these.Now, yes, it is slow in building, and a bit silly here and there, which is why a 7 not an 8, however, if you are looking for something to sit at home with and see as the characters go on through these moments, through these trials, through these exquisite scenes of pure grimacing torture that make you think, why am I watching this, as hell is brought forth and unleashed on innocents on the road to get you to that final reveal that leaves your jaw dropped and your thoughts racing as you laugh at how, after all this, the final moments of the movie come to an end and your left thinking...Now, THIS is why I watch movies like these...then this is what you will enjoy.Look, this is not for everybody. This is not for most people. This is not Hollywood, nor pretentious art house films that make you ""delve into your soul to find the...blah blah blah..."" This is a film about searching for something...and when you find it...was it really worth it? I hope you enjoy, and if you don't, I'm sorry...you shouldn't have watched this. Best of luck!P.S. Before you get upset, I do love a lot of the films out there from Hollywood and the art house circuit, all I'm saying is there is depth and there is a bit of gore, nothing like I've seen in low budget or slasher films, but yes, some things could be looked as a bit over the top.

(From what I gathered of it)The cinematography is phenomenal. The score (although there isn't much music in the movie) is great. The acting is superb.Yes, this movie is disturbing, violent, and may bring nightmares to some people...But it's worth the watch, trust me.

It is very intriguing, as the story unfolds with each puzzle piece. Amongst the very graphic darkness, it also portrays friendship, which has the emotions going on a wild rollercoaster.

There are some genuinely scary parts in amongst the depravity and violence. Acting was very good and even though there is quite a bit of gore, it is the violence and deprivation that makes its mark on the viewer.I wonder what goes through the minds of the actors while making this kind of film? It was as brilliant as it was disturbing to watch.Despite very polar reviews(love or hate it), Martyrs is definitely not a film that you could recommend to just anyone.",Martyrs
500,rumbaabaa-594-789105,well made but overall slightly uninspiring,6,6 December 2009,"This is definitely worth watching.I'll give a few bad points first. Firstly, I wouldn't really agree with all of the 'plot twists' that other reviewers found in the film. If you've got half a brain, you'll spot them coming a mile off. The plot overall was fairly ridiculous (a load of rich crumblies looking for evidence of life after death through torture of young horny women!)and unbelievable (the actions of Anna after Lucie kills herself).I wasn't overwhelmed by the 'twist' at the end either.It was more of a cop out than anything else.The good points are the acting is excellent, as is the production and direction, it's a good looking (great hellraiser type body suit)and sounding film, and moves along pretty well. I wouldn't let the torture bits put anyone off watching this film, it wasn't too graphic and I don't think the torture scenes were stretched out for the sake of it (as other reviewers think).It was just right (in my opinion).The ending leaves it open, so that Anna could have whispered anything in the old bags' ear. However, she actually did see something (white light) so, there's a few options as to what the old dear was thinking of before she blew her head off.I was wondering whether 'doubting' was the perfect translation from the french language?If the ending had been a bit more solid, it would have jumped to about an 8 out of 10, but it was far too 'vague' to be satisfactory. I expect hellraiser remake (reboot) will be in safe hands with this guy directing it, should be good.",Martyrs
501,tannisroot,Brutally effective criticism of religion,9,5 January 2010,"An extraordinary example of why the French are producing the most brutal yet thoughtful horror films of recent years. On the surface a tale of revenge that could be categorized as torture porn, but with much to ponder over afterwards that takes the film to another level, of existential bleakness... this is every bit as brutal and unrelenting as it needed to be, every moment as captivating as horror should be. It's interesting to note that the director is going on to remake Clive Barker's Hellraiser- in my view the original film is a classic, but lacking in directorial panache in a way that I'm convinced Pascal Laugier will prove he possesses when he tackles the remake. A fantastic, no-compromises voyage into the depths of human behaviour in the name of religious enlightenment, this film makes us question the similarly inhuman behaviour of various religions throughout time, which brings us to such a bleak point that anyone who recognizes their part in placing human compassion below pursuit of their religion should choose the exit that the mysterious Mademoiselle chooses in 'Martyrs'!",Martyrs

To spoil would ruin the experience, and yes that's what it is, an experience, so i'm going for the big picture. This film is about love and death, sounds familiar, sounds simple? Well it's not. Have you ever thought about your own death? What it feels like and that you can read science books, believe in god, but you will never know for sure before it's really happening to you? Have you ever wondered what the love of your life beside you really thinks, has on his-her mind? does he or she really loves you? How can you be for sure, when you can't feel the same...The first 30 minutes of the film hit, the next 30 you just want it get over, the last 30 tear you apart.

505,taylor058-902-78052,Don't watch if you don't think a gore filled film can have a deeper meaning,10,8 March 2018,"One thing that I have noticed about some of the reviews on this film is how bloody, gorey, violent, etc. it is and how it's violent to just be violent. I cannot agree with that statement at all. The film tells a story of revenge at first and then shifts to a psychological thriller for the second half. Lucie is the first half and her story is to make you sympathize with the character while Anna's story is meant to provoke thought. When Lucie'sstory was being shown there was a moment where I thought maybe she had killed this family of four for no reason other than she mistook them for her captors 15 years earlier. I was on the fence about it and so was Anna when she tries to help the wife escape until Lucie kills her with a hammer. It isn't until Lucie ends her own life and Anna finds a woman that has been kept down in their torture room for at least 15 years, did I realize that Lucie wasn't crazy and really truly sympathized with her character. After freeing the woman some people in all black come in and kill the girl and take Anna prisoner as they subject her to horrible experiments designed to break her will and cause her to give up all hope. After awhile she finally does this and upon ""letting go"" she is able to become a witness, or martyr, and see into the afterlife without having died. This is what the cult like group wanted all along. They wanted to have the knowledge of what was on the other side. The head of the group, a rather old women, comes and asks Anna what she saw. Anna whispers to her what it was but we as the audience never actually know what is said. It is after this that the woman goes into the bathroom and takes her own life. But before she does this she tells one of her servants to ""keep denying"" when talking about the afterlife. This statement is what the entire film is about. Denial is what keeps us going and keeps us from doing certain things. In the case of the writer it was stopping him from killing himself since he wrote the film while being horribly depressed. Not knowing what the afterlife holds helped him realize he didn't need to kill himself, because if we know what lies behind death then life would be meaningless.",Martyrs
506,valfar9286,Terrible masterpiece,9,16 February 2011,"The movie starts like a common movie of this kind of genre. The tortured child that escapes, the gory slaughtering of the family, the grotesque fights with the imagined deformed woman. The first half of this film seems like nothing special and is partially foreseeable and hard to classify: not spooky enough for a horror-, not brutal enough for a torture-movie either. But since the captivation of Anna the movie makes a 180° turn and just hits the viewer's face like a high-speed-train. The torture scenes last for about 15 minutes and are wordless. The first pretty looking young Anna turns more and more into a flayed meatball. As much as her once beautiful outside changes her inside also breaks apart and all these terrible transformations are relentlessly thrown right into the viewer's very heart. One really wants to get this vulnerable girl out of the claws of her devilish torturers but the more the tormenting moves on the more one becomes aware about the fact that there will be no redemption for the poor innocent victim. These scenes don't shock with their amount of gore but will hurt you on a psychological level of your mind caused by the unsparingly presentation of the girl's suffering and the unbelievable coldness of her tormentors. This tour-de-farce peaks into the skinning of Anna and when you see her raw body you won't be able to close your mouth anymore. But the biggest shock maybe is the goal that lies behind all this seemingly senseless torturing: getting behind the mystery of death itself. The sinister organisation and especially the queer old lady worship their victims as martyrs for mankind for they reveal the deepest secrets that lie beyond the ecstasy of near-death experiences. This revelation almost reminds one about the twisted ending of Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"" but with a much harder blow into the stomach.As common as the film might begin as unbelievable and shocking it will come to its end. The acting of the main-characters is highly to be acclaimed. Mylène Jampanoï (Les filles du botaniste) gives a solid performance yet her role must be considered as quite short and without room for any development. Morjana Alaoui instead convinces with an outstanding show of her decay. She possesses a rare sort of appeal which makes the viewer want to protect her and make her tormentors pay. Her aura of innocence and vigour beauty increases the crime of destroying such a being even more. All these facts put together make a film which will blow the viewer's mind sustainably and force him to contemplate his views about moral, ethics and his own mortality anew.Finally it is done: a movie that is worthy to be called ""the most shocking"" yet actually is more than a movie but a true experience of the darkest and most lost places of human's abilities.",Martyrs
507,khouli,"First Half Good, Second Half Boring and Dumb",6,2 February 2011,"I was excited to see this. It has a good rating and something about it just looked interesting. Overall I was disappointed and I'm surprised this film is rated so highly.The film is technically competent throughout and the first 40 minutes are quite good. If realism is an important metric for you in your choice of horror movies this film is excellent in that regard. Even less common wounds are impressive and the film really succeeds in the repeated portrayals of someone who has been... erm ""ravaged"". Camera work is solid. Several scenes cut to the same scene, same angle which is interesting, it gives a disorienting feel that seems appropriate. Acting is alright, nothing fantastic, but nothing that distracts form the film.The second half of the movie is where things fall apart. Essentially the movie ends half way through by pulling a cliché and this is then drawn out for the second half. A bit of extremely unfortunate plot is added which really should have been left out - it's a real ""this is so stupid..."" forehead slapping moment. The movie gets very graphic here but because it's so dumb its not interesting. By the end you're just watching mutilation scenes without any interest in who or why.",Martyrs

One can consider, starting from the point when Anna found Sarah, that the violence and the structure provide us with the necessary background needed to contemplate the suicide of Mademoiselle. Though, it is not like the horrific scenes prior to finding Sarah had no impact, but I feel the scenes after discovering Sarah had a direct influence on our understanding of the psychology of Mademoiselle. The question I had at the end of the film was ""was the knowledge gained worth the pursuit?"". Mademoiselle killed herself because she got an answer to this question. Though, we do not know if the suicide was caused by guilt, or happiness to die because it was better to be dead and she wanted to keep this to herself.

I was very wrong.This is the type of movie that you see once for its artistic merit, then never again. This must be the only movie to ever affect me and even when I think about it I shudder. Despite having torture scenes like any other horror movie, the message I got from this movie was of anti-torture. The whole point of the movie was to show how devastating torture is in real life, and not just in a movie that uses it for the sake of violence. It is a very emotional movie that'll catch you off guard.If you're a very sensitive person you probably shouldn't watch this.

It uses the merest imagining of a plot to unfurl yet another showcase of gratuitous sadism. Before finally manifesting into the worst kind of self-masturbatory climax of embarrassing pseudo-intellectualism.The film wastes no time on things such as character development or any tangible sense of a back-story. Instead, it hangs itself on the flimsiest of pretexts (""They experimentally torture people to try and make them see Heaven/The Other Side."") and stretches it out for 90 minutes. As a full-length feature film, it really doesn't have enough gravity to sustain itself.

513,pranaysharmadelhi,Sleeping Supid Beauty,1,24 August 2011,"This movie expects the audience to be retarded like Lucie to believe what's going on. SPOILER ALERTS! I do agree that the Lucie is mentally challenged, however her friend Anna seems to act very adult and responsible. Apparently that is quite opposite of what is portrayed by her actions. 1. The first thing she does on finding the bodies is try to hide them. WHY? It would take cops only 5 more minutes to find the bodies if they are hidden in washroom instead of living room. Then she does not seem to be satisfied with her hiding spot, so she begins to bury them in a pit. Wow! Now cops won't even waste 5 minutes, seeing a freshly dug pit in front of the house with blood all over. Instead of fleeing the house and cross country in few hours, she utilizes the time to drag bodies from one spot to another in the house. WOW! Just burn the house and leave.2. When Lucie calls Anna from the crime scene to a telephone booth, she panics because it would give cops evidence to trace them. However, she calls her mother from the same house. So cops can trace Anna from telephone booth call and not her home phone? WOW!3. When Anna finds the tortured woman in the basement, it was the perfect time to call 911 or even her mom to report everything. Report that her friend found the people who run this torture business, and she found a woman who needs medical help. Anna didn't kill anyone and the one who killed(Lucie) is dead anyways. But NO! Instead she decides to take care her. While still in the House! To make matter worse instead of treating her wounds (like she did for Lucie several times), she decides to give her a spa bath and crack open her skull. It was pretty clear she needed medical help from a certified doctor and not pretend nurse. And still does not call 911 or flee the crime scene with her, throw her in front of ER and scoot away.4. Sleeping Beauty! The girl Anna is definitely a sleeping beauty. No matter how much blood, crime goes around her, she does not think twice before taking a nice refreshing nap. She can sleep with her dead friend and 4 other dead bodies in pit on couch of very people killed. She can even found sleeping between torture sessions. It is quite boring with no entertainment, but still. Several scenes start with her waking from a nap. She surely is laid back girl.5. Fight Back? Anna is shown to be quite determined and strong. She can bust open a door with her shoulder, drag heavy bodies across the house, but she cannot kick a guy in between the legs to escape. Several instances of her being in the room alone with one guy and plenty of chances to seriously injure him (like grabbing the very chains she is tied to and tying around his neck, leg, or smashing his bald head with chains, pinching his eyes out, bite his ear for fun), but all she does is spit, bitch slap and show a tantrum. Its like she does like bondage and torture. She could have at least tried for the sake of her freedom.Moral of the story. If you commit a crime, flee. If you find proof that the person killed was criminal, call 911. The worst thing you can do is try and have a 2-day vacation in the house of people you just murdered, dozing off and eating from their fridge.",Martyrs

I have watched so many horror flicks, yet this one leaves me cold. Its a powerful film if you wish to deal with it on an emotional level. If you just want blood and gore, go watch Hostel or something. Those kind of flicks don't do anything for me, but this one challenges everything on an emotional and psychological level.The subject matter is one of those taboo subjects that most films wont touch, child abuse. Thankfully, there is no sexual child abuse here, but in many ways, worse imagery is present. If you are put off by any kind of abuse, then move along and don't watch this one, its not for you. I watched as I watched, a sense of numbness seemed to spread across my body and mind. The second half of the film was so powerful, I very nearly didn't watch the end. I hung in there and glad I did as the twist makes it worthy of the effort.If you can stomach the subject matter, don't mind some very powerful psychological images and you have a reasonably sound mind, watch this, it wont disappoint you. Unlike Hostel and its elk, its not just about violence and sexual degradation, its a whole lot more than that.To sum it up.

In my opinion, the only genre that could be any more pervert is snuff (an idea which I despise with all my heart). The level of violence displayed in the second half of the film is far beyond obscene.Why would I want to watch some girl in underpants, tied to a chair, being force fed and then beaten senseless by some guy, a scene which is repeated over and over for twenty minutes before same guy skins her alive to be able to report from a possible afterlife (which is why people are held captive in the first place in this ""story"")? Seriously - this film is about martyrdom, at least that's the message the director wants to rub in your face in a statement by a prop actor shortly before it's over at last (a moment I had been longing for). The biggest torture involved is watching it. Hostel and Saw head off in the same direction, but do so grossly oversubscribed. This film is nothing but repulsive.Good critics don't make a good movie - as Antichrist and Dogtooth have taught me. But nevertheless, they were at least a gazillion times as good as this one. With incidents of abducted minors who are held captive for years and are tortured in a variety of sickening ways, it would have been nice if a competent director had tackled this subject in a movie worth watching that wouldn't leave you angry for wasting your time with it. Instead, this film seems to focus on the direct display of violence, which is displayed in a way that only this film's playwright seems to be capable of coming up with. It's absolutely unrealistic.The revenge bit of the film creates high hopes of a vendetta film, but then again, unanticipated and unoriginal twists wreck this whole idea, and then the obscene display of repulsive violence starts.I seriously can't recommend watching it.",Martyrs

From the jarring opening sequence to the conclusion's various implications, I became lost in my personal interpretation of a film I hadn't viewed in years. It's both renowned and detested for being disturbing, graphic, and abstractly artistic (all lubricants to the average indie-buff's horror wet dreams), but it was Martyrs' spiritual and cathartic nature that truly remained with me. And I couldn't untangle myself from the thought for the rest of the night.It was in the way that Anna (Morjana Alaoui) held the hands of the dead and dying that originally cued me into this movie's sentimental core. For every act of stomach-churning horror, we are likewise treated to a moment of absolute tenderness. Lucie (Mylène Jampanoï) is tormented by the ""ghost"" of a woman she was unable to rescue, given deep and serious wounds by its pale, gnarled hands; shortly before inflicting some of the worst injuries yet, this ghoulish creature embraces Lucie, tucking its head into her bosom, gently touching her bloodied face. Because of instances like this, the picture's perpetual storm of gore avoids cliché and becomes legitimately powerful – there is an impact to the suffering we witness in Martyrs, and it has little to do with the amount of gristle on screen. When we're first introduced to Anna and Lucie, they are children in an institution, united through their loneliness and fear. The initially slow and methodical pace promises a gradually unfurling mystery, a potential whodunit revolving around the kidnapping of Lucie (the opening scene shows her half-naked, fleeing barefoot down an alleyway, screaming loudly and covered in lacerations). However, this is but one of many stylistic stages in a varied rotation of horror subgenres, the first being the briefest of them all. Without warning, the plot quickly leaps years ahead and acts of shocking violence take the film by storm, these young women engulfed in a world of revenge, murder, and horrendous torture. They feel pain, both physical and emotional, and it is portrayed with empathy and realism; the camera remains close for a majority of these shots, the characters' suffering represented through facial expressions far more than jump-cuts of the obvious carnage at hand. This breed of intimacy sparks an outcome that many horror movies have been lacking for upwards of two decades: the audience's feeling of true and biting dread when they witness a protagonist in peril. We have been given opportunities to love and understand these people, thus we are upset by their misery.All the same, instead of opting for more obvious tropes to relate characters and viewers (a dead parent/unrequited love/mentally retarded sibling), writer and director Pascal Laugier allows us to connect during the littler moments. As Lucie lies on her back, she inspects the thickening blood on her hands; astonishment and bittersweet relief swim hazily over her face, and she is both troubled and relaxed at once, caught in a moment of self-reflection. These ten seconds may not directly narrate her motivations or backstory, but they show us the impacts of both, additionally hinting at the weight of their presence as they drift ever closer. She doesn't just kill, she ponders the killing – she doesn't casually walk away from the body of her victim, she weeps and rocks herself over its pale form, leaning in to kiss it on the cheek (""why did you do that to me?"" she asks the corpse). Sure, the picture has slick production, a fitting soundtrack, and killer cinematography to boot. But it's also brutally soulful and self-aware, immediately setting it leagues above the competition in a genre known for possessing the highest highs and lowest lows. Its transitions have meaning, splitting the film into three incredibly diverse acts with their own tones and implications. As it stands, the final product is far more than the sum of its parts, and yet the parts alone are still fantastic. This is no simple slasher, gross- out pic, or torture pornography; this is an auteur's vision.In an especially memorable scene, one character bathes another, attempting to wash their gored skin and remove a harmful device from their body (that's about as specific as I want to make it). From the moment their flesh touches the bathwater, a plethora of emotions are put on display, from overwhelming remorse to a form of desperate frustration, the latter burning in a young woman's eyes as she struggles with her companion. It's something frantic and human that really shines through an industry defined by faceless men who needlessly murder teenagers – it's an energy that musters the need to bust out critically overused hyperboles in a way that isn't solely meant for humor or exaggeration. Though there are some extreme moments (namely plot elements) which will surely divide viewers by the end, all are there with purpose and acted with intensity and passion. Controversy may be an overused term in Hollywood, but that doesn't make it an overrated concept. After all, cinema is art and art is propaganda; if your motion picture cannot stir people in some regard, then you've created an ineffective piece of said propaganda. And Martyrs stands as some of horror's most intriguing propaganda yet, communicating an array of ideas that most will feel uncertain of by the time its curtains fall. Exactly what Laugier wishes to tell us is left to interpretation (a smart move, in my opinion), but some key messages are crafted so sharply and so keenly, you may find yourself turning them over in your thoughts years later, sitting alone in a long shift at work.",Martyrs
519,punky_monkey47,Too much for me,3,15 April 2012,"I've always been a big horror fan but I just couldn't handle this movie. The plot itself was decent. The premise made sense, the whole ""let's torture people till they 'let go'"" thing. But the level of torture and what was actually shown was just too much. The removal of Anna's skin was what did it. It really disturbed me that someone would survive that, that someone did that to her on purpose. I've been paranoid of getting kidnapped since watching this movie. But what I did really like was how believable it was that the girl Lucie was seeing was real until right before her death. I think that's why I gave this a 3 instead of a 2 or 1.",Martyrs

Horror should be horrific and Martyrs certainly delivers on that front. The casting is also brilliant in particular the use of trained dancers. It is a shame the promo-posters and the box cover look so bland and try to make the girls look like typical pretty victims...which they are not. Everyone I have recommended this film to loved it so give it a watch you will not be disappointed. French horror really is some of the best in the world they grab their subject matter by the spinal cord and pull it out never backing away from that which must be shown to gain full effect.,Martyrs
522,daniel-pereira-94,A magnificent horror movie,9,10 June 2012,"I'll write this review trying to avoid spoilers, which is very hard, since the essence of this movie relies on it's plot. It's impossible to transmit by words how great this movie is without spoiling it to others who haven't seen it yet.The beginning of Martyrs shows already the type of horror movies it's going to be: a psychological one and not a typical gory one. Sure, there are shocking scenes that are almost unwatchable, but the psychological part is what really shines on this movie.The scenarios, costumes, camera angles, background music and special effects are marvelous, contributing a lot to the mystery feeling we get from almost every scene.The acting is also one of the main aspects of this movie. The feelings are well transmitted, making it easy for the public to connect with the characters. There are moments where you'll feel sadness, regret, love, fear, all due to the great acting behind it.I was confused in the beginning with a lot of questions in my head about what was happening on the screen, but those questions soon vanished as the story advanced. Not only did I have a brighter view about what the movie was about, but I was also more captivated to know what would happen next. All I can say is there are a great deal of surprises on this film.I don't really know of any bad aspects about this movie, except some minor flaws with the story itself and some scenes which were too slow-paced with no music. These scenes were also a bit disconnected between each other.My favourite sequences were the scene where we learn why is the movie called Martyrs and the end of the movie. The end is just amazing. It leaves the audience thinking about it and frustrated for not knowing the answer.I recommend this movie to everyone who loves a good horror movie, with a clever plot and good acting, with the right amount of blood and violence scenes.9/10",Martyrs
523,City_Wolf,Moraly dehumanizing,9,6 April 2021,"The movie takes some cues from Audition, in a way that it tries to make the dehumanization horror argument. There aren't many scenes drifting far into the extreme, but those few that do are done amazingly. For me personally, there is only one scene I find extreme, and it is more than enough to justify the whole movie's brilliance.All the intense horror is sourced from the dehumanization argument. This basically means it tries to dehumanize the victim into a shape terrifying to a viewer. It's a brilliant horror style, as it makes you scared not of the people who have done the actual attrocities, but of the victim they had created. This leaves you highly demoralized and depressed, knowing you yourself could be disfigured into something you fear. There would be no recognition of your suffering or sympathy by your fellow humans. This dispair is even enforced by the movie as a character shows sympathy without fear, which I myself could not, being in that situation.The concept is not original by itself as it has been implemented before (think Audition, or the cannibal victims scene in The road), though it is more focused here.I noticed some reviews not understanding why someone would like this. Maybe we watch movies for different reasons. This is not a movie to be enjoyed, it is meant to be experienced.Also some are arguing about the ending. Honestly I think it's ok, though notihing special.",Martyrs

Only Torture!,3,9 August 2012,"A Martyr 'voluntarily' accepts death and they understand their belief in a cause will lead to death, but post death they will inspire others to an admirable cause.This is not a horror film. An entity throughout the first 40 minutes is kinda spooky.It is brilliantly acted.After the first 70 minutes (which we thought was OK and building the plot), it took a turn for sadistic torture and unrelenting abuse.

527,king_josh10,French Masterpiece,10,11 November 2012,"I cannot fault Martyrs on any premise. It succeeds in creating fear and tension, whilst drowning you with intrigue for the duration of the film. The film attacks you from every angle, starting with the classic horror techniques then moving into more of a psychological battle towards the second half of the film. It uses the best from every genre and uses it to great effect through strong acting and an even stronger storyline with constant twists and turns. Its a hard film to review, as it can be seen as several films in one, once one question has been answered it's replaced by more, then the more you question the deeper it takes you into its twisted world of martyrdom.",Martyrs
528,Schmiggss,Deeper meaning,8,10 December 2012,"Horror movies as a form of artistic expression usually have a deeper meaning, and this one is no exception. Like in Body Snatchers or nowadays in all omnipresent zombie movies, where we can recognize a fear of spreading of the brutal and low life Communism, here the author also describes his view of today's social circumstances. As enclosed and usually highly secretive circles of people like bankers for instance, rule to us all from behind the scenes, in this movie author uses a form of a cult, that seeks to find a look into the life after death through deliberately induced suffering of another human being. Which most appropriately shows to the extreme a lack of compassion and inhumanity that such circles can exhibit in pursuit of their selfish goals. Yet they live their lives like ordinary human beings in a completely normal way with all the love and affection when it comes to their own families. This was nicely presented in a scene when Lucie, before she shoots him, asks the oldest son, how old is he? And he answers 18. Which means that his parents had a three year old child, for whom they cared with all the love and affection, yet that didn't prevent them to horrifically torture a slightly older girl. Similar to the Nazi's families, like Goebbels for instance, which cared dearly for his six children, but at the same time torturing and murdering countless others. As we can see these things are not just a fiction.",Martyrs

I thought to myself, ""I may as well see what this movie is like,"" expecting your typical ""gory, slasher movie"" but boy, was I wrong. Straight from the very beginning, the movie had me gripped. I found this film unbelievable in so many ways. I felt the need to look away or turn the TV off several times, but needed to see how the movie concluded. There are several parts to this, superbly interwoven to keep the viewer guessing, right until the ending that does not disappoint. There's some terrific acting, so that the viewer can truly sympathise with the person on-screen, almost ""feeling"" what they do. In conclusion, I would indeed give this top marks. The acting is top notch, the shocks unexpected and the atmosphere always tense. If you do not have a strong stomach, I would stay away from this movie, but if you do, this is not a movie to miss.",Martyrs
532,thegreatsoutherntrendkill_5000,Bleak movie which left me unsatisfied,1,3 July 2009,"As many reviews have pointed out before me, this is a polarising movie. You either absorb its messages as high art and embrace its philosophies with a willing mind, or if you're like me it will leave you hollow from a lack of resolution; at which point all that's left is an exercise in gratuitousness.I'd like to preface my damning opinion with a comment on what this film did well. It's vastly superior in production quality and acting than most horror films you could watch (thinking of the vast stock of direct-to-DVD cash-ins) it never felt tacky or poorly delivered. The twist at the 50% mark was unexpected and felt original.As for what I didn't like? Well pretty much everything else. I felt like this movie was a plodding nihilistic beast, something you had to endure rather than enjoy. The story was set up well at the beginning but fizzled out as soon as any rationale was attempted to explain the torture. I'm a fan of horrible bleak things, but if you're going to put a 30 minute torture scene in a movie you better have a damn good way to put it into some sort of context. I got that sinking feeling while I was watching it; there was no way this was leading to anything good. And I was vindicated when I given some second rate bataillesque philosophy to try and explain away maddening cruelty and try and elevate above all those other movies that delight in gory excess.Thinking about it, this movie made no sense, there was no satisfying motive for the acts committed. This is really the cusp of the problem I had with the movie: why? Why would the characters torture people for 20 years based on such a flimsy motive? And when the head honcho finally found what she was looking for, she kills herself?!? Why waste the 20 years? You believed in it enough to commit horrendous atrocities for 2 decades but you needed confirmation from a delirious dying women to act on your belief? This is really what I can't wrap my head around, the film gives us an incredibly silly reason to explain why this all happened, so the result feels absolutely hollow. The explanation the film delivers was completely meaningless to me, a philosophy so vague and devoid of logic that you would never care enough to think of it yourself. Like an idea someone invents while off their breasts on drugs because they've grossly misinterpreted the real world. Again, what this movie desperately needed was something clever to rationalise its depravity, yet all it delivers is a 5 minute afterthought composed of senseless mysticism.Ugh running out of space here, I'll try to be more succinct. Other problems I had:--it isn't a horror movie, horror movies are about atmosphere, mystery and tension. All the tension dissipates when the movie devolves into a relentless torture fest. -it's misogynistic, who honestly wants to watch a fat bald man beat a Young women for ages with no context apart from some vague martyr nonsense? I'm misogynistic but this was too much. -make up and gore effects are pretty bad apart from the ""flayed"" effect at the end. Cellar woman really didn't look convincing enough compared to the stomach churning effects in the saw movies.In summation, this isn't just a torture porn movie. It is the ultimate torture porn movie. I believe someone commented that is isn't like SAW because the characters perpetrating these acts were emotionally detached (which ironically I think is a problem with the story, if you're going to torture someone have the decency to enjoy it). However, the emotional state of the characters is irrelevant, all that matters is the stimulus that provides the titillation and the interpretation of the viewer. And of course the stimulus is torture and gore and this film has it in sickening nihilistic abundance. SAW and HOSTEL take a back seat, the gorno king has arrived in all his pointless pretentious gory glory.",Martyrs
533,Nebraska097-883-89254,Really disturbing without point,1,10 October 2017,"Before I say anything about story, first you should know, this is NOT a true horror movie, you can't call this a revenge movie too unlike what people are commonly telling about this film! And about the story: first you are watching a painful past of a young girl named Lucie that taken by a mysterious cult group and tortured, she escaped and is growing up in somewhere like orphanage and doctors can't cure her mental sickness but the girl keep growing and being alive for next 15 years!!! In continue you will see how hard and dangerous is her sickness, that make her easily murdered a whole family with their children and keep hurting herself but what the ...? How was she living these years?! As she has a very close friend (however you will understand its more than a friendship and more like a lesbian relationship) named Anna that take care of her but she must spend every minute of her life with her to stay her alive. These events happened in less than half of movie and those are the best parts of it! the ideas in movie are over! And remaining minutes of film are totally waste of time!Because Lucie had her revenge and killed herself and with that, the small and ONLY scary part of movie (""Lucie's paranoid vision of a creature"") is over! Now what we have are just Anna and those insane cult members, they found Anna and start doing what they done to others, to her and I blame myself why I didn't use fast forward to prevent myself from seeing those sick behaviors that director put details on this part. you will watch painful scenes of tortures that have nothing to do with horror! Seeing a big bald guy mercilessly hit a small and weaken girl in every weak is more like a torture p*rn than horror or slasher movie. And at last skinned her alive! To make her see what they always looking for! She said something in ear of their boss And people being curious about what Anna saw on that moments! THB I don't give any f*ck what Anna saw! I don't know how kind of feel should I have! Why should it being important when its a result of sadistic methods!? And the boss commit a suicide before telling her followers what she heard from Anna and movie ended! The question is what is this movie about? Revenge?! Being a lover of a stupid person you will win a stupid price?! Or about to advertise that cult?! Even we forgot Lucie's events, because of misleading of story! I can not find the point because the movie is not entertaining anyway. And I guess people who enjoys this movie and its scenes are typical fans of torture p*rns and the goal is; people in p*rn doesn't graphically get hurt but in this movie they do!

This is just plain depressing and I see no reason why anybody would want to sit through the whole thing given that, I hope, the movie has no artistic ambitions.The movie is articulated around a bunch of really rich old folks. The bunch of around 30 old folks somehow got together at one point of their life and decided it was necessary to put young girls through excruciating torture in order for them to witness life after death (yeah right).Then at another point, they hired a really big engineering firm in order to build a futuristic dungeon along with a really cool device to skin people alive more efficiently.Man those old folks can get their act together. They can even manage to drive all the way from their respective places with their Mercedes (I guess they got a group discount on those) and to get to the dungeon within an interval of 45 seconds.I mean, the storyline here is perhaps enough for a short movie but certainly not enough for a full movie where you have plenty of time to think of dumb the whole thing is.

537,v_hancu,Amazing...,9,21 April 2014,"""Martyrs"" may be gory, horrendous, disturbing, unforgiving and cold, it may shift your mood to depression or even make you physically sick. But if that's all you're left with after watching it to the end, you've missed the point. Beyond the disturbance factor, I consider this film to be a vivid allegory of life. There will always be suffering and people who benefit from it,whether they cause it or are subject to it. Suffering binds and teaches us the greater purpose of our existence just as much as love,perhaps even more-so than love -I think- since, due to commercial marketing,the latter has become somewhat shallow and we've become more desensitized towards its core. As a film lover in general, but as a horror buff in particular, I state that 'Martyrs"" quickly became my absolute no.1. If viewed as an allegory, it has an uncanny applicability to the journey of knowledge through perseverance. It may give one the strength to see things through, despite the level of discomfort they stir up, and the faith that all will make sense in the end if one is true. Or it may not; perhaps you will see the redundancy of knowledge. I, for one, gained a lot of balance after seeing it enough times to assimilate the message. None of those times did i feel comfortable watching it, despite- or perhaps because of- my awareness of its ending. MUST WATCH!",Martyrs
538,glinners,Beautifully Brutal,9,11 April 2017,"Pascal Laugier's Martyrs is one of the defining films in the successful extreme wave of French horror movies during the 21st century. Capitalizing on the successes of contemporaries like High Tension, Martyrs is a film which hits the viewer hard with an array of relentless torture sequences coupled with a gritty style complementing the genre. The film's tone is its stand out feature, as rather than presenting you with a fun gore-fest it instead submerges you in an uncomfortably grotesque story which is sure to play with your emotions. Unlike films such as Hostel, it isn't just an excuse to push cinema to its visual extremity. The film has a powerful story and interesting concepts which sets it apart from other installments in this type of disturbing cinema.The film boasts beautiful cinematography, powerful sound design and strong character development which only adds to the films overall look and feel. Aside from some shaky writing in regards to Anna's character early on in the film, I found Martyrs to be lacking in negatives and would happily give it a strong 9/10. Recommended to all of those who want to experience an educated form of the darker side of cinema, Martyrs thoroughly deserves to be considered an iconic installation into the horror genre.",Martyrs

541,brianlawrence1989,The Best Horror Film I've Watched in the Last 5 Years,10,6 March 2010,"Martyrs is one of the few horror films I've seen in recent memory that shocked, repulsed, fascinated and engaged me in a such a way as Martyrs. Reading the back of the box, one would assume a typical Hostel-like torture movie with the added twist of revenge. Within the first 15 minutes,however, you'll realize this movie is far more intelligent than you may have given it credit for, I know I sure did. The events of the film unfold in a very non-linear way most viewers, especially on the American coast, are not used to seeing. Rather than the revenge taking place in the 3rd act, it is thrust onto us right at the very begging of the film, playing with our emotions of who is the victim vs. the culprit. The first half of the film is truly scary, having to do mainly with the psychological manifestations one of our main characters is experiencing. These scenes are filmed expertly and maximize on the ""scare you pants off effect"" The second act is where I began to realize this was not a typical horror film. Although I've marked this post as having spoilers, I won't get too far into detail. I will, however, say that up to this point, the viewer has seen nothing that they've expected to see and everything that they haven't expected to see.The third act is where my fascination took flight.Surprisingly, the torture I had expected to see gratuitous amounts of throughout had been held off until the final act of the film. When this does begin, however, the film makers, and a special recognition to the editors, handle the torture in such a way that never feels cheap,immature, or pointless. The final payoff, which reveals the motives and goals behind the actions of the third act, are so shockingly fascinating that it will stay with you long after the credits stop rolling. Any true horror fan would do themselves a favor and watch this film which shows that horror films don't have to be cheap gimmicky pop corn flicks.

543,princess_frogs4me,Very sad and DISTURBING,10,27 July 2010,Oh boy! Im gonna try to make this short and simple..first off this is def in my top 5 of disturbing films..and to say that it is disturbing is putting it lightly..i remember reading a review before i saw it where the person said the movie made them feel sad..now im a huge fan of disturbing and graphic stuff and it takes a lot to get me but WOW this movie got me all kinds of sad..i found myself feeling bad for even watching it..and i never feel like that about movies..me and my bestie both felt sick after watching it and it wasn't a sick like from the gore..we just felt a sinking feeling from it..anyways its a great movie from beginning to end..no dull moments..final words to describe..DISTURBING..shocking..gory!,Martyrs
544,bluedarknova,Quite Terribly Haunting.,10,5 January 2016,"MARTYRS has got to be one of the Top 5 movies of ALL time in my book. Of the countless times I've seen it, I never tire of it...Love the 2 gorgeous french girls in the lead; Madame Turban-Head is right on up there with the grandest of torturers, deservedly next to Pinhead & Marquis DE Sade...the reboot is bound for disappointment (i'm dreading it--but must know JUST HOW bad it is to be)-- most assuredly in Amerikan spoiling hands...meh to that! The tense, edge of your seat atmosphere is consistently permeated from the beginning of the film to the very last second! Any film encompassing that which is ""Otherness"" is truly monumentally worth the watch. The tintinnabulation in the resonance of the haunting it plagues one with is timeless and without bounds. A true French New Realism Magnum Opus...Incomparable, I have found this treasure...most definitely NOT for mass consumption as it's far too sublime in it's pathos & slicing edge onto one's psyche & very core. To have survived the truest sufferings of existence is to have truly appreciated MARTYRS in all its' ground-breaking breadth. The pity was that the film had to end at all, so enrapt does one become in the entanglement of it's living and gasping misery. I truly envy anyone about to see this gem for the first time.",Martyrs
545,ricardorodriguezdelavega,"Truly French, over-rated horror",3,30 April 2015,"Spoiler-alert (if you know what we're talking about) Thanks to the social-media buzz and well known, yet unfamiliar with horror, critics, Martyrs makes a neat entry into the, so-commonly, over- rated French cinema. A Hostel wannabe (reckon only Saw fans would consider it arty), it switches to REC and turns truly French in chapter three. Quite probably planned after a two-days course on horror-movie-unexpected- switch-making, after a nicely-crafted intro (Hollywood-friendlyly flashbacked when deemed necessary), the movie goes over two flips on the story. If you don't know by the 5th minute of each chapter what is all about, you'll probably like it.",Martyrs
546,tat_it_up_rockstar,Great movie.... Although kinda disappointed with the WOW factor...,10,8 July 2015,"SPOILERS... This was an excellent movie!!! It's not gruesome... There are certain torture scenes, but it's more of a mental torture, not physical... And there's some physical abuse scenes (big man hitting small chick)... Other than the very end, the movie isn't very gross, at all... It's rather sad... You feel sorry for the girl... Not sure exactly why people keep comparing this to Hellraiser... The only thing about this movie that has a likeness, is the skinned girl... The helmet and chastity chick, looked a little Clive Barker Tortured Souls... But, nothing about the story resembles HR... Comparing to High Tension??? No... Still not a good comparison... The only likeness is a crazy chick who sees things (Martyrs - chick she left behind/ HT - crazy man) and desire for the other girl... If I had to compare, it WOULD be a mix of, Hostel meets The Lovely Bones meets Saw...",Martyrs
547,sassyn-49676,"Martyrs is the story of one woman's devotion for her traumatized friend, The result alters our heroine's.... everything. In a very, very bad way. .",9,6 August 2015,"OK. I don't want to sound like a weirdo, but...I enjoy the hell out of a well acted, beautifully directed, smart/tightly written script that sits atop a large stack of the old ultra-violence.(Sorry Clockwork, But I'm talking about High Tension/I Saw the Devil/Texas Chainsaw made a new friend; The Devils Rejects/The Walking Dead & its name is Hannibal~the series. Clear? cool.) Martyrs is truly unlike any other film. It's horror genre, but not, it's also thriller,crime drama,and ""wtf"". The category of ""torture porn"" horror- it is not. That would require ""sadism"" in a serial abuse/murderer for no reason way. Martyrs and it's ""reason"" is a dark hallway, paved with glass shards,leading us thru our heroine's very complex yet, brutally simple set of new circumstances. It is a visceral,engrossing journey that will, at times, have you peaking thru your fingers from the edge of your seat. And still thinking about it days later. I first saw Martyrs in 2009. Then I bought the DVD. Watched it again many months later. And again last night. Yep. I recruited the uninitiated. I don't recommend it to everyone. But when I have, they are just as taken with it as I was, and remain. Martyrs is a quality, cool, ""horror"" movie. Good luck and try to sit back and not chew off all ten fingernails.",Martyrs

I love it when you actually see a monsters face, this is true thriller, not just jump scares. The two halfs of the movie is too separated, otherwise i'd give it a ten.

549,Jacksberry,A psychological journey into the wicked human beliefs,10,10 September 2016,"This film left me speechless; it makes you wonder ""What if these things really happen out there?"".It really was a unique experience for me to say the least, everything in the film being well done, from the characters to the story and, of course, the ending. From what other films I have seen I can compare Martyrs to Hostel and the first Human Centipede in some regards but far superior because it can really strike fear in you.When I played the film I expected nothing more than a simple plot in which the victims get their revenge on the perpetrators and then we get a plot twist at the end which wasn't the case, this film delivering much, much more than that.As a horror genre enthusiast this film didn't disturb me in terms of gore, but I must admit that there are some scenes that may be hard to digest for some viewers, but if you fancy a great film that shows you but a small fragment of the dark corner of humanity's mind you must NOT miss this one. If you are a horror genre fan like me then this one is a must-see.A masterpiece like this one deserves no more than the maximum score of 10 from me. It was a unique film unlike any other I have seen.As a conclusion I'd like to thank everyone involved in making this movie and, of course, you, the reader, for taking time to read this review. I would also like to encourage you, if you haven't already, to watch it because, even if it's not for everyone's taste, it's unique.",Martyrs

The problem has been that, the majority of these so called horror films i've been watching have been fairly terrible, and i thought that eventually i would finally come across something half decent. I stumbled across this film and checked the score out here, which at the time was 7.1/10, so decided to give it a go. I won't bother with what it's about as there are plenty of reviews here which pretty much will tell you all you need to know. What i will tell you though, is that this is one pretentious, arty steaming pile of turd of a film. I dunno, but when you get past the gore, violence, etc and realise there is no decent storyline or characters you could care less about, the boredom quickly sets in. And that's where i'll leave this review - Just do yourself a favour and read the bad reviews on here - all these people are correct and the rest must be just trying to trick you into losing 1.5 hours of your life like they did!",Martyrs

Do I urge you, reader, to watch it, nope. Just accept my review as is. 8/10.",Martyrs
552,headwound-1,Finally a movie that martyrs...,9,31 August 2008,"i was lucky enough to see this masterpiece at Frightfest this year.Pascale Laugier's worried about this movie. He was apologising to people who despised it, he was profusely thanking the people who liked it. He is the modern day equivalent of Victor Frankenstein. He knows that he has created a monster and doesn't really know how to deal with it now that it's being released upon the world.Martyrs truly is a monster. It's a ground breaking, brave, stunning, brutal & moving piece of work that is guaranteed to divide audiences everywhere it gets the chance to play. Even at a genre event like Frightfest the audience reaction ranged from 'loved it' to 'hated it' to people actually going outside of the cinema to be physically sick (really). For me it was the highlight of the festival and i absolutely loved it but I don't believe it's a movie that anybody will truly 'enjoy'.As others have already given away too much of the story i won't bother with a synopsis as Martyr's is definitely a dish best served cold. Not knowing what to expect makes this a refreshingly shocking piece of celluloid that will hopefully astound you with it's gutsy originality. Written by the director during a fit of depression (that he did not elaborate on in the Q&A) it is an almost schizophrenic movie with two distinct halves and coda of such ambiguity that it is possible to view it as nihilistic or strangely hopeful. It's beautifully shot, really well paced and contains outstanding performances from the two female leads.This movie is inevitably going to be compared to Hostel and other movies in the horribly monickered 'torture-porn' genre and that is a genuine mistake. Martyrs bears more resemblance to movies like Nacho Cerda's Aftermath as there is nothing here that is designed to be titillating. The true horror lies in the the clinical detachment of the antagonists. In the end, despite all the on screen violence (and there are some truly brutal scenes on display here in the movies second act) the prevaling reaction that this movie elicited in me was not one of revulsion but one of true sadness. Martyrs really is a truly brilliant, surprisingly moving film and one that will remain in my mind, jostling for attention with my other thoughts for a very long time to come. Thankyou Pascale Laugier for creating a monster that i love...",Martyrs

554,orangejuicer,My new pick for worst movie ever,1,1 December 2010,"Indeed, a zero star rating would be appropriate. The worst piece of garbage I have ever seen. And I saw a couple Saw movies, both Hostels, all the Hellraisers, and countless other scary/horror/slasher movies.Almost all of those movies were bad, but had a sense of humor. Or at least no pretensions that art was being created. Martyrs, on the other hand, is dull in every sense of the word, yet tries to transcend its fate as a pointless, boring exercise in film.I looked through a few reviews, and the predictable fan-boy reviews giving it 8-10 stars were laughable. I imagine 95% of those who liked this movie were males 16-30 years old. As with crap like Saw and the Date Movie/Epic Movie/Scary Movie, long as clueless people keep patronizing these awful movies, they will continue to be made.Too bad, because there are some good, genuinely creepy movies that I am sure don't get made because the kiddies need to see explicit torture to get off.Tip - see Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.

Try it, it's absolutely worth a viewing. Yes, it's violent, gruesome, and gory. It's still worth it.I don't plan to divulge any plot information, just understand that I was kept in a state between quiet nervousness and shivering terror, for almost the entire run-time.

556,gaisford-00299,What a waste of time!!!,1,12 November 2016,"Okay, I created an IMDb account for the sole purpose of rating this movie.First the good. The actors were amazing, all of them. And the directing was spot on, every shot/scene was beautifully woven together, also I remained engaged, I was engulfed in the despair that is ""Martyrs."" From the beginning I was enthralled. So why the low rating?The bad. The first half of this movie is packed with mystery, revenge, emotion and grit. Then the second half starts and we are forced to endure a looong abusive montage. Again, looong. But I stuck with it, I thought there has to be a payoff, there has to be a climax, there has to be answers!!! Then comes the ending, what a disappointment... The reason for the violence/abuse? The reason for the movie? It's idiotic, the reason for everything is based on a guess, or superstition. ""Okay fine lets hear this superstition, the reason for this whole movie!"" NOPE. The movie ends, without any answers, or climax. I imagine anyone that likes this movie, just enjoys human suffering. However I need an actual story, or at least an ending. For the record I love horror movies. Hellraiser, The Exorcist, High Tension, You're Next, The Shining, 28 Days Later,I Spit on your Grave, The Thing, etc. I love horror movies, but this movie should be erased from history.

557,twsttempo,Appears Very Misinterpreted,8,18 November 2016,"I feel there are a lot of misconceptions of this film. I've watched this film twice, the first time I was relatively disgusted by the seemingly empty impact it left, however the 2nd time I came to a complete different conclusion. This film is not devised to be enjoyed whatsoever, or your regular horror, the lack of enjoyment and darkness cultivates a void, filled with a variety of thoughts during the film and allows the audience to manifest in those, should they arise. It is incredibly bleak at times, often mistaken for ""torture porn,"" however the malicious, visceral and macabre notions of screenplay are vital to construe the complete reflection of the films ideas, serving as an symbol to human pain. Personally, the heinous nature of the actions partly represent aspects of the arguably dysfunctional capitalist society as it is regarded by many today. The almost unbearably gritty nature in way the film is exhibited and executed plays an exceptional correlation to the ultimate destruction of hope. The duration in which Anna is tortured brings up much controversy but in my honest opinion it creates a bleak build up yet essential appreciation in comparison to the malicious beat down and struggle endured by many people in postmodern society, where dreams are smashed into a drab, isolated resignation of 'slavery' to the capitalist system (the very powerful scene in which Anna has a mental conversation with Lucie.) The rich and powerful (those perpetrating Anna's suffering) are so dissociated and proceed to prolong the suffering of people in which is a selfishly justifiable cause to themselves. The almost unsatisfactory ending to me represents an analogy of the insatiable nature of greed, largely leaving the rich unsatisfied (as Mademoiselle commits suicide because she possibly, cannot handle the truth of realisation of her actions) and ready to prolong suffering e.g.: continuing the ""experiment.' (due to the lack of conclusion.)Understandably a potential downside could be the hints of misogyny, potentially using women with the symbol of the 'weak and beaten down in society' (as the plot clearly states females are more susceptible to the torturing, using only females for the characters enduring the suffering.) This film really leaves an impact like no other, originally of disgust but upon 2nd viewing pure sadness. However it is definitely not recommended to everyone due to the very challenging scenes within it, which are integral to the symbolisation. it definitely requires an open mind.",Martyrs
558,lavghterovhades,A great idea behind a mediocre production,7,8 February 2019,"Watching 'Martyrs' was a experience I certainly don't regret and contrary to what most people feel about it, I would watch it again. The problem with it was that the plot was developed in a very predictible way.This is the only movie directed by Pascal Laugier that I've seen so I don't have any experience with his style, but I expected something quite different from a French movie. I received what I wanted in a very small dose, but the rare moments of insightful introversion, silence and flashbacks weren't enough for my taste.The whole 'standard horror film' linear plot gave me an American vibe and that's what killed it for me. I didn't appreciate the jumpscares either since they weren't very tasteful.But my take on 'Martyrs' is more than simply seeing it as a shock value movie. It has some subtance to it and it displays the vulnerability of human nature in an unconventional manner. It is the fear of death that makes people do inhumane things and the journey of Anna gradually presents the process of dehumanization of both herself and the organisation members. A better approach of this theme could have transformed this movie into a masterpiece.Visually, I found 'Martyrs' very aesthetic and it didn't fail to make the public symphatize with the main characters through a sensory amplification of their dreadful experiences.The music was very good and I will certainly check it out for its quality and for the nostalgic feeling it didn't fail to give me.All things said, I would recommend 'Martyrs' to anybody who want to see a horror film which roots from an original idea, only if they can get over the graphic violent and gory scenes.",Martyrs

The only thing remotely scary in this stupid movie was the weird ending. I hate this movie. The story line is not exciting at all and this whole movie doesn't make any sense at all.

560,munkey-87760,A horror gem,10,28 February 2017,I loved this movie. This movie is almost solely for those who have disturbed/ sick minds (which I proudly possess). Everyone who gave this a 1 star rating are people who can't handle anything that makes them even slightly uncomfortable. If you consider yourself having a disturbed mind you will love this movie. It is not for everyone hence the 1 star ratings. The low ratings anger me so much because they shouldn't have watched the movie in the first place. It was not meant for people who do not have an open mind and not for those who can't handle any disturbing content. Anyway I found this movie very interesting and unique compared to what horror movies are popular in the US. Unlike others who claim you can't re-watch this movie I've already seen it twice and will most likely re watch several more times. I am so happy i found this gem.,Martyrs

562,kriscmill,Absolutely Regret Watching This,1,7 September 2017,"I realize this is an incredibly polarizing movie in terms of audience response, but for the life of me I cannot see why. It's absolute trash. It's gratuitous torture porn, made worse by it's highfalutin attempt to trick us into believing that it's deep. The fact that the movie blatantly states women make the best martyrs (aka recipients of emotional and physical torture) is particularly disturbing. I'm just going to recap this for you guys, so you can do yourselves a huge favor and skip this pile of garbage [ *spoilers to follow* ]. Lucie, a young girl, is the victim of ritualistic torture, who has recently escaped from her brutish torture chamber and her two abductors. She is placed in a psychiatric facility where she meets fellow woebegoner Anna. The two form a close friendship. Flash forward 15 years, and Lucie thinks she's found the couple responsible for her childhood suffering from a photograph she sees in a newspaper article. A revenge style home invasion ensues. After Lucie has hacked her way through this seemingly idyllic family of four, good ole loyal Anna shows up to help clean up the bloody mess. While Anna is playing maid and grave digger (seriously Anna should rethink this friendship), Lucie is coming to terms with her demons - literally. There's a psychological component that is actually pretty scary, but with a twist that is so obvious it could've been spelled out on the walls in blood. If these first two acts had been flushed out with a little more storyline and a lot more subtlety, I think this would have made for a decent movie that explores the depth of emotional trauma in abuse victims. But, of course, it doesn't stop there. There's a whole third act of depravity left to endure. Anna discovers a new and improved torture chamber below the house, that is accessed through an unlocked cabinet in the living room. I can only assume that the couple's two teenagers were in on their parents' unusual weekend hobby because what kid hasn't looked inside every cabinet of their home (gotta find that secret stash of booze amirite?). It would be sort of hard to miss the tunnel leading into darkness behind that Ikea cabinet by the television. So the audience is now asked to suspend belief on one of two seemingly impossible realities - A.) that the children were really that dense to never realize their parents had a giant, gleaming, modern underground bunker beneath the house dedicated to Satanic style ritualized torture and murder, or that B.) these seemingly well adjusted, star athlete high schoolers were living in full knowledge of their parent's alternate lives. It's the Devil's Rejects meets the Brady Brunch people! This is the plot holiest of all plot holes, and deserves at least five eyerolls. But anyways So Anna, keeping with her shtick of having poor freaking judgment, decides its in her best interest to go explore said chamber of Satanic Doom. I refuse to go into all the terrible things that happens next, except to say there's a cult and some more ritualistic torture, but trust me when I say it's hard to stomach. There are visuals in this film that I reacted to as strongly as I did the first time I saw pictures of Holocaust victims. The brutality that's depicted in the final act is just gut wrenching. I wanted so badly to turn it off, but I kept thinking there was going to be some culminating purpose. And what was I left with? A sense of regret, and a bad taste in my mouth. I simply cannot fathom what the meaning of this film was supposed to be. People can transcend their suffering? Yes, it's called disassociation. At the end of this twisted journey, there is no answer to the question ""why did I just watch this?"", there is no justice for any of the poor, brutalized women depicted, and there is no deeper meaning. This is M. Night Shyamalan levels of pretentious debauchery.My advice: SKIP!",Martyrs

566,pezzullomartino,Masterpiece??? No......,6,8 September 2018,"Not a horrible movie but I was not fazed in the least by this movie....maybe that is more an indictment of me than this picture. Sure there are graphic scenes, but have seen it all before. I have seen skinless bodies before in several films (namely Hell Raiser), have seen people die from shotgun blast, and have seen women held in a torture-like basement/dungeon situation. And as disturbing as some of the torture scenes are, it is all in fact being done with a ""purpose"" if you will, versus other films where it is just being shown for it's shock-value. So to me the ""purpose"" and existential quality of the narrative in this second half of the movie nullifies the ""purely disgusting"" and ""I had to leave the movie and go vomit"" type reactions being caused by this film. Not all other films of this genre are as tense or well-directed or well-acted, as this film was, but nothing here seems ground-breaking or includes anything that lends to this movie in many circles being called the ""most disturbing film of all-time"" or a ""masterpiece""...a word thrown around very loosely these days in my opinion for seemingly any new film that just pushes the boundaries a bit and is fairly well-acted and directed etc.This movie is worth a watch for sure, has some interesting things to say about society and violence and and what it all gets us in the end. But at times it is choppy from one scene to the next...lots of fade-outs towards the end of the film which seem to break the flow of the film. This I'm sure was purposeful as I'm sure the fade-outs were to show each ""step"" Anna was enduring to reach enlightenment. But much of the cuts seemed to detract from the mood and overall story-line. I felt myself saying ""where are we now""?? a few times throughout the film as the jumps in time, mood, and mental state detracted from the power of what the intentions were in my opinion. And the mother of the family that tortured Lucie as a young girl comes back to life after being blasted by a shotgun through the chest? I tried to wonder if this was just an apparition or fear that Lucie had of the mother NOT dying, of continuing to torture her in some way...but Anna finds the mother alive in the bathroom and she tries to help her to safety only to be found out by Lucie. Who then bludgeons the mother's head with a hammer questioning Anna's loyalty to her for trying to help the mom. I don't know, was this just metaphorical or imagined?? If so, why??Some of the makeup effects are very well done, while others seems outwardly sort of second-class. It appeared to me that the ""demon-spirit"" (just a manifestation of her own tortured self) woman haunting Lucie in the first part of the film had a plastic suit on full of cuts and scratches etc (as it appears she did if you watch the ""making of"" extra on the dvd). And we all have seen the ""contorted maimed twisted walking like a crab"" demon in many films before. Pretty well done here but still not ""ground-breaking in my opinion. Same for the tortured girl found by Anna in the basement in the second half of the film with the helm stapled to her skull?....it looked like she was wearing a rubber bodysuit with lots of makeup. I may be nitpicking but it was a distraction for me nonetheless.As for the underlying narrative of this film, the first half seemingly was about revenge and exorcising one's demons...as Lucie repeatedly tells the demon spirit following her that ""I've done it, I've killed them all....even the kids"" as if ""why are you still bothering me, I've done what you want""....a manifestation of her inner self trying to rid herself of her horrid memories. She enters the home of a family who tortured her 15 years earlier and guns down all four of them including the two children. She never succeeds though in exorcising her ""demon"", and is driven to madness and suicide by the requisite ""slit throat gushing blood"" death scene. Anna her best friend now picks up the baton to fight this demon-type girl, and she is spared by a group of official-looking types who enter the house and blow a hole through the demon-girls head. They soon show themselves to not be friendly at all, as Anna is shackled by them and dragged down to a dungeon/hospital ward type basement setting to begin her ""enlightenment"". Seems this group of mercenaries works for the ""Madomoiselle"", an older woman who seems in charge of the whole ""martyr/torture/enlightenment"" scenario being undertaken with Anna. And she is just the latest in a long line it seems of girls who they have tortured in the past, seemingly with the objective of finding out whether enough deprivation and torture will actually bring about the loss of ego and self, and the attainment of a state of pure enlightenment and a transcending view of the after-life. Madamoiselle says that too many women call themselves victims, while what we really need are martyrs, and she is out to find if she can turn a ""victim to a martyr"" if you will. Most of the prior victims it seems have gone mad, while Anna they notice is accepting each ""step"" in the process in comparison, so they see the potential of their experiment succeeding. Anna is deprived of normal food and drink (she is repeatedly fed a groul-like substance that she at first can't stomach and she spits it out at her captor).....her head is shaved, and she endures repeated beatings by a male guard, and finally she is ""skinned"" and placed in a vat of solution to linger. While there, the woman who feeds her tells Madamoiselle that it appears ""it is happening, you should see her eyes, she sees nothing around her, it's like she is not here anymore"" which to them is success....she has transcended.Madamoiselle invites many guests to ""come and see"" the success they have had with Anna...and all seem very excited to finally find out what her enlightenment has brought and what has been found out about the after-life. Before they do, Madamoiselle goes to see Anna and asks her if she has crossed over and seen what's there, and she gets a whispered answer from Anna in her ear. While preparing in her room...actually un-preparing because Madamoiselle is taking OFF her headdress and makeup/eyebrows etc....she asks her attendant through her bedroom door if he believes or knows if there is an afterlife and he says he doesn't know. She then says to him ""keep doubting"" as she pulls a gun and shoots herself through the mouth. I believe after all the torture and deprivation, Anna told her that there was no crossing over or sure answer about the after-life, in fact unable to tell her if she in fact became a martyr. With Madamoiselle seemingly so close to what she thought was the breakthrough she was seeking, and now with no more answers than if it never happened at all, she kills herself knowing there is no other level to go to in THIS LIFE to find out what exists in the next.Maybe a ""victim"" only remains so..........",Martyrs
567,DarklyDivinest,There is more under the hood of this tortureporn-flick.,9,12 November 2010,"(Spoilers about the movie-structure ahead, minor spoiler about the premise of the film) Let me first say that I do not consider this movie to fall under the torture-porn category. Because the the total abuse of power that is shown to the viewers is not intended to just shock the audience or even give satisfaction to the deranged that get a kick out of see someone suffer.No, the movie goes deeper than that. It draws a fictitious painting of how far humanity can go, as history has shown over and over again, in its quest to find answers. Replace the suffering characters in this movie with animals for example. Then this kind of torture exists everyday around us in that perspective. Or you can draw parallels to how we experimented with human lives during the first half of the 1900's and yet again you come to the conclusion that what you see is not that far from reality as we want to think. And that is only the tip of an iceberg since we have always loved to come up with creative ways of torturing each-others in the past when words like ""ethic"" and ""human value"" only existed as a philosophical definition that had little to no impact on our behavior. On to the movie. The structure in the storytelling is fascinating since it can be cut into at-least two halves. The first half leans towards the Japanese kind of horror ala The Grudge and is on its own not interesting at all and fooled me, at least, to believe that i've come across yet another sub-par horror-flick. But it is in the second half that the film shows its true form and is what some has reacted too and misjudged in my opinion as an example of poor taste. To me this film exists as one of few perfect examples of how to make a horror movie with a clear focus on the horror. It reaches our subconscious and stays with you after the credits roll and stimulates our imagination and that is why I rate this movie as one of my favorites regardless of genre.",Martyrs

In brief, the director should be kept in an asylum under strict surveillance until he be cured; of course if there is any cure for sadism.
Although I have to confess it proposed cues for some scenarios may I make them in future.",Martyrs
