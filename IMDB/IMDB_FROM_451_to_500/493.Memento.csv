0,MartinHafer,Intriguing idea--but #26 on IMDb??!?!?!?!,7,7 December 2006,"Huh? Talk about an unreliable score for a film! Unfortunately, IMDb is very, very, very skewed by recent movies. So many older great films have very few reviews or have generally lower scores--not because they are worse than newer films, but because there is a bias against older films because SOME reviewers are teens or people who simply won't consider anything that was not made in the last decade or so. Likewise, there is often a strong bias only for Hollywood blockbusters, even though many foreign or ""small"" films deserve recognition but are ignored because people just refuse to try something outside their comfort zone. This is a real shame, as there is just so much more out there. While MEMENTO is a decent and very unconventional film (I sure respect them for trying something DIFFERENT), it isn't great when viewed in context.Okay, so you may think I am just some crazy crank who is totally negative! Well, this might be true (the verdict is still out), but of the IMDb top 250, over 30% were made just in the last two decades. Also, films like THE WALLACE AND GROMIT movie, MAGNOLIA, FINDING NEVERLAND and V FOR VENDETTA make the top 250 and yet films like MARTY, THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US, SHOW PEOPLE, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, BANSHUN, THE CAINE MUTINY, CAPTAIN BLOOD, MY MOTHER'S CASTLE, CHARIOTS OF FIRE, DINNER AT EIGHT, DODSWORTH and ELMER GANTRY don't make this list (among others). It's sort of the like the expression ""out of sight, out of mind""--if a film isn't recent or make a ton of dough at the box office, it's chances of making the list are very low indeed.Okay, enough of my rant--now on to this movie. MEMENTO is a very strange movie in that the film starts at the very end and works its way backwards towards the beginning. This is an intriguing and clever idea. You know that the main character who was brain injured committed a murder, but because his injury makes it physically impossible for him to remember any events AFTER his injury, he tries to solve a mystery by leaving notes for himself and tattooing himself so he can eventually put all the pieces together. The problem is that after a while, the very stylish film becomes awfully tedious. Plus, the ending, to me, just wasn't very satisfying--it's an ending you will either love or hate. Leonard Maltin gave the film only 1 1/2 stars out of 4. I won't be THAT critical, but I just can't see how stylish film making and an odd plot result in this movie being elevated to near the top of the IMDb list of films!!NOTE TO PARENTS--the ""f-word"" is used about 200 times in the film and there is some intense violence, so this film is rated R. I watched it with my 16 year-old, but you might want to think twice about letting the kids see this one.",Memento
1,TheLittleSongbird,A very strong contender for Christopher Nolan's best film,10,22 January 2017,"Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.'Memento' was not his first film, having directed 1998's 'Following', but has been considered by many the film that rose him to fame and brought the world's attention to him. Cannot disagree with this, and also that not only is 'Memento' his first great success but seventeen years later it gets my vote as his best film. It really makes one think hard about what is happening, crucial in a film where a lot of concentration is needed, without being treated like you are an idiot or dumber than you are. It is also one of the few Nolan films where it was difficult to find anything to fault.As always with Nolan, 'Memento' is a wonderfully made film. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious , with some scenes strongly reminiscent of film noir (as a fan of film noir that was great to see). David Julyan's synthesised (something that could have sounded tacky but actually adds a lot to the atmosphere) score makes very clever and dynamic use of distinct sounds, oppression, yearning, loneliness and loss having a haunting but also affecting vibe, the feeling of being lost adrift being perfectly captured.Nolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and the length, after seeing some later efforts that have suffered from over-length and over-ambition ('Interstellar'), was ideal.It is the story that makes 'Memento' Nolan's most fascinating film, with a unique non-linear, time-reversed structure with two converged time-lines. That sounds on paper confusing but with Nolan telling the story in an intricate, tense and atmospheric way (meaning that he takes his time telling the story) it makes perfect sense, with beautifully interwoven use of thematic motifs of memory, guilt, perception, self-deception and grief and a stunningly moving ending that one does not expect.Guy Pearce is astonishing and give one of his career's best performances, don't think from personal view that he's been as good as this since. He gets excellent support from particularly Joe Pantoliano and even Carrie-Ann Moss.Overall, a brilliant film and a contender (my personal vote certainly) for Nolan's best film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Memento
2,Leofwine_draca,Genius thriller,9,28 August 2016,"This unique and well-crafted tale is a top-notch thriller packed with suspense, excellent characterisation, and a style of story-telling which means the viewer has to use his or her brain for a change. Unsurprisingly it seems to have been ignored by the mainstream crowd, but in any case it's one of the best (if not THE best) films of 2000. Guy Pearce is outstanding in the leading role of Leonard, a man who has developed a short-term memory loss syndrome since a horrific accident which means he cannot remember anything for longer than twenty minute intervals. Thus he is forced to tattoo clues on his body and take Polaroids to remind himself of his quest, which is to hunt for the man who raped and murdered his wife and kill him.The genius thing about this film is that it starts at the end (Leonard begins the film by killing the man responsible) and goes back to the beginning. I was pretty sceptical of how this would work but director Christopher Nolan has done himself proud. The style of story-telling involves one scene ending and the next scene finishing at the beginning of the previous one. Confusing at first, but don't worry as Nolan takes things slowly, giving the viewer time to get used to the method before hitting them with two-faced characters, plot twists, and some tense situations. The film is extremely suspenseful in that you really get inside Leonard's head and can sympathise with his plight and the unusual story makes for lots of interesting situations and ideas. On top of this, there's a breath-taking surprising twist ending (or is that beginning?) which rewards the viewer for watching and is as good as any I've seen beforehand (THE USUAL SUSPECTS or otherwise). The film is technically excellent, the supporting cast brilliant, and I can't fathom why Nolan or Pearce failed to get Oscars for their parts in this. Seek it out now.",Memento
3,SnoopyStyle,unique viewing experience,10,25 August 2015,"Leonard (Guy Pearce) suffers from short term memory loss. His last permanent memory is an attack by two men. He killed the one who killed his wife. The other one escaped after clubbing him in the head. The police dismisses the idea of a second man. He keeps a record of his experiences using tattoos, Polaroids and hidden notes. He has to figure out whether he can trust Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) or Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) as he searches for the second man to avenge his wife.Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan announce their arrival with this unique screenplay. The forward-reverse order makes the movie disjointed and confused in a good way. It's a beautiful struggle to figure out the plot. It puts the audience in Leonard's shoes. It's a jigsaw puzzle that Leonard with his memory loss also struggles with.",Memento
4,Hitchcoc,Mind Blowing,9,7 November 2001,"I spent considerable time doing research on the brain for a class I was teaching.  One of the most intriguing things I dealt with was the idea of short term memory.  There are cases of people who carry around a suitcase with them, containing all the things they need to continually review to stay in the present with any sort of functionality.  I had heard about this film and read a very sketchy review.  I rented it because I knew my family wouldn't be interested in the violence.  So late at night, I sat and took this film in with total concentration.  I need to watch it again, but right now it may have cracked my top ten list.  The last time I was so enthralled by a film was Coppola's ""The Conversation.""  Both of these films are fairly bleak and occasionally confusing and absolutely captivating. How anyone can be bored by this with all the junk that is being produced these days, I will never understand.  I know it's a gimmick film.  I know it's manipulative. So what?  Don't all films manipulate us, especially those steeped in mystery and suspense.  I knew exactly what was going on and I couldn't wait to see how it ended (began).  At first there are so many questions--why the self mutilation?  Why are these people treating this man this way?  Where is he?  How did he get there?  Who does he work for?  Does he actually work for anyone?  And yet, how skillfully is is all done.  I suppose if you want to begin nit picking, you can come up with a few inconsistencies.  This doesn't detract from the way that the principle character floats from even to even, trying to recoup his memory each time he faces the day.  The one thing I will grant is the emotional investment required for revenge--but because he is aware of his shortcomings, he feels he must act.  If  you are bored with most movies these days, rent this and it will affect you for a long time.",Memento
5,Horst_In_Translation,"Not bad, but eventually too many twists and new directions",6,18 April 2017,"""Memento"" is an American 110-minute movie from 2000, so not too long anymore until this one has its 20th anniversary. And a lot of its popularity such a long time later is of course because the director is Christopher Nolan from the UK, the man that many consider the most gifted filmmaker of our days, even if he still hasn't managed to get a Best Director nomination at the Oscars. But he received a nomination for his writing here as he also came up with the script together with his brother Jonathan. Nolan was only around the age of 30, maybe even under when he made this movie and it also has as many plot twists and moments that f*ck with your brain as many of his later works. So his style is easily identifiable in here. The one lead actor here is Guy Pearce and it is probably still the most known work of his career, even if he has appeared in several Best Picture winners. The supporting cast includes also several well-known names, maybe back then more than today, but still very recognizable, also several familiar faces from the small screen.So this one here is the story of a man who severely suffers from short term memory loss since the day his wife got murdered. There are situations when we know just as much as he does, but the longer the film goes the more we actually find out about his illness, his background and his motivations. And also about the ways in which he manages to help himself, especially when it comes to remembering things. His body is a sheet of paper basically. So yeah, I do believe that this film has some good moments, maybe even one or two great moments. But I still must say that Nolan occasionally went over the top here in terms of trying to make this movie as smart and mind-blowing as possible. It's of course a fine line, but back then he may not yet have had the talent to deliver really convincingly and walk that fine line from start to finish. This becomes especially visible in the second half of the film. I definitely enjoyed it more in the first 45 minutes. Acting is okay by everybody, but there is also nobody who really stands out, including Pearce. This is absolutely a writer's piece. What else can I say? Oh yeah. I did not really like the fact that it wasn't chronological. But that is very frequently the case for me and just subjective approach. I don't think it is subjective though when I say that this film overall is not as creative and memorable as it turned out in Nolan's head himself. Making an argument that I and other people who don't like it that much have just not understood it is not valid. There are flaws and weaknesses here that are occasionally pretty grave. So I am still relatively generous with my 3 stars out of 5 I would say. It is a joke that it is apparently according to IMDb voters one of the best 50 (not just 250, which would already be very exaggerated) films of all time. I do recommend it, but just cautiously. Definitely one of my least favorite Nolan works (maybe my actual least favorite from his full features). Don't expect too much or you will be majorly disappointed.",Memento
6,kosmasp,Have I seen you before?,10,16 September 2010,"If you have watched the very first movie done by Mr. Nolan, than yes you have seen this before. Not exactly like this and with quite a few flaws, but if you consider that it was more or less a student film and seeing this, probably nothing more than an exercise on how to do it on a grand scale, than it was more than decent.Nolan is one my new favorite directors and as the rating does show you here, I am not alone. Not that that will convince you he is better than you think he is. Actually you might even not like Memento, for one reason or another. There is people out there who just want to be entertained, when they go watch a movie. And that's not a bad thing. Nor does that mean that if someone likes, say Transformers 2 better than this movie, that he/she has no clue. It's just a matter of taste.I for one, can tell you that this is a movie that merits watching it more than once. And the disc version offers you to watch the movie ... in a different ""order"", which gives you a new unique experience. If you haven't watched it yet, you are in for treat.

7,classicsoncall,"""It's amazing what a little brain damage will do for your credibility"".",9,14 October 2011,"I just watched this picture three times in five days, and before you get around to asking - no, I'm not a glutton for punishment. It's just that I was totally fascinated with the way the story was presented, as if it was rigged with a perpetual rewind button that brings the viewer back a couple days prior to the last rewind. These kinds of stories have a way of making my head hurt, but there was something about this one that was different. Maybe it's the way the story had you empathizing with Guy Pearce's character Lenny. The man was relentless in his quest to find his wife's murderer, but at the same time, that murder might not have ever really happened. There are literally as many interpretations of this picture as there are people who have seen it, and reading some of the other viewer posts and discussion threads are bound to move even the firmest of opinions to yet another different conclusion. So in that respect, the film invites criticism for being nothing more than a gimmick, even if a thought provoking and mind bending gimmick. I have to say, I usually like my movies wrapped up in forthright fashion, even if I don't like the resolution. But here it's virtually impossible to know anything for sure because it's all based on Lenny's reconstruction of events, relying on facts and not memories, as he explains in one of the sequences to Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). But what happens when the facts can metamorphose as they did here? I just know I can't watch this again for awhile because I've come to enough different conclusions already.",Memento
8,gavin6942,The Breakout Film of Christopher Nolan,9,20 April 2014,"A man (Guy Pearce), suffering from short-term memory loss, uses notes and tattoos to hunt for the man he thinks killed his wife.Although Christopher Nolan had previously made ""Following"" and a short film, this was easily the film that catapulted him to worldwide success, landed him the Batman franchise, and made him one of the greatest directors working today. Although it may not be a fair assessment, the fact almost every one of his films has been in the Top 100 on IMDb suggests he has a magic touch not seen since the days of Kubrick or Hitchcock.This was also a great role for Pearce. He has been known for ""The Time Machine"", ""LA Confidential"", and more recently ""Iron Man 3"", but I think he will always be remembered for ""Memento"". He was, after all, the driving force behind the film in the acting department, appearing in basically every scene and conveying a wide range of emotions... the fact Pearce is not one of the highest-paid actors in the world is a bit unfortunate, because he can hold his own with the likes of Christian Bale and Daniel Day-Lewis.",Memento
9,lee_eisenberg,like nothing that you've ever seen before,10,25 June 2005,"""Memento"" is one of those movies that I fear discussing because I don't know how much I can tell without giving the whole thing away. You might have heard that the story gets told in reverse and that Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, who has a memory problem. People are able to abuse him and all sorts of other horrible things. Then, he has to use the little bit of memory that he has left to...no, I can't tell you; it would give the whole movie away. My point is that ""Memento"" is a most incredible movie. You quite literally have to see it to believe it. You might even want to watch it more than once, possibly backwards. Or something similar.",Memento
10,jboothmillard,Memento,9,12 September 2005,"Written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Insomnia, The Dark Knight, Inception), I had seen this film a couple of times before, but apart from the obvious bits and pieces of it I could not remember everything that happens, so I watched again to be sure of my opinion. Basically the film starts with the reverse of Leonard ""Lenny"" Shelby (Guy Pearce) shooting dead John Edward ""Teddy"" Gammell (Joe Pantoliano), which would be the end of the film, this is followed by scenes in black and white and in colour, the black and white sequences take place chronologically. Leonard is in a motel room talking to an unnamed and unseen telephone caller, Leonard has anterograde amnesia and cannot form new memories, the result of an attack following the rape and murder of his wife (Jorja Fox), his last permanent memory, besides who he is. He recalls from that night that there were two men, Leonard believes the second attacker's name is John (or possibly James), with a last name starting with G, Leonard conducts his own investigation to find this man, using a system of notes, Polaroid photos and tattoos. As an insurance investigator, Leonard recalls one Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), also diagnosed with the same form of amnesia, Sammy's diabetic wife (Harriet Sansom Harris) was not sure if his condition was genuine, repeating acts to see if he would realise, he did not and as a result of his repeated requests for insulin injections she fell into a coma and died. The colour sequences are shown in reverse chronological order, picking up from a particular recognisable moment, Leonard gets tattoos detailing the licence of John G, using his notes he meets bartender Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), she resents him as he wears and drives the car of her boyfriend Jimmy Grantz (Larry Holden). She does use his condition to her advantage in moments, but understanding his situation she gets Leonard to drive a man named Dodd (Callum Keith Rennie) out of town, and in doing so she agrees to run the licence plate to help his investigation. Leonard meanwhile meets contact Teddy, he helps him with Dodd, Teddy warns him about Natalie, but Leonard left himself a note not to believe Teddy's lies, Natalie provides Leonard the driver's licence of a John Edward Gammell, Teddy's full name, he believes he has found ""John G"", and he lures Teddy to an abandoned building to kill him, as seen at the beginning. But the final black and white scene reveals that the unseen caller was in fact Teddy, he is an undercover officer and has found ""John G"", Natalie's boyfriend, Jimmy Grantz, at the same abandoned building Jimmy arrives, Leonard strangles him and takes a photo of his body, as it develops the black and white transitions to colour, thus beginning the colour sequences and meeting in the middle of the story. Leonard swaps clothes with Jimmy, who before dying whispers the name ""Sammy"", he has only told those he has met about Sammy, he doubts Jimmy is the attacker, but Teddy tells him that he in fact killed the man who killed his wife a year ago, he helped Leonard find him, Teddy tells him ""John G"" is a common name, he will end up going in circles with his amnesia, he remarks he is a ""John G"" himself. In the end, after hearing Teddy explain everything, Leonard makes the drastic decision to burn the photographs of Jimmy, and writes down the licence plate of Teddy's car to be tattooed on himself as a ""fact"", he will then assume that Teddy is the second attacker he is looking for, this leads to all the events concluding with Teddy's death. Also starring Mark Boone Junior as Burt and Russ Fega as Waiter. The performances of Pearce, Pantoliano and Moss are all good, you could argue that the story is nothing spectacular, but it is made that way because of the really clever editing, going backwards and forwards, this also emphasises the serious amnesia of the leading character, it is a film you really have to focus on while watching, and it may be a little complicated as you gather the facts, but it really tests your sense of reality, a most worthwhile thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Editing (losing to Black Hawk Down) and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay.

Because the story ran backwards, I guess that was supposed to be cool or hip or something. If you make things too hard on the audience and most get confused on what's happening, it makes the elitist critics feel good because they ""understand it"" and thus feel superior. It's so much hogwash.Having said, I didn't say I didn't find the movie interesting. I did, and enjoyed the performances of Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss. A man with no short- term memory goes back, scene-by-scene, trying to find the killer of his wife. It's a film I saw back in 2001 on VHS and I'd like to see it again, now that six years have passed since then. I understand one of the special-edition DVDs of this showed the movie in the correct time sequence without all the flashbacks. That might have been less-creative, but better.However, be warned: this is a frustrating film to watch for first-time viewers.",Memento
12,Tweekums,Christopher Nolan plays with memories and time to create a gripping thriller,8,2 December 2015,"Protagonist Leonard has an unusual condition; he can't form any new memories; anything that happens to him fades from his memory in a matter of minutes. He explains that he still recall events that took place before the night that he came home and discovered his wife being raped and murdered. He is hunting for the killer; to make this possible he must keep notes and take photographs to remind him who the people in his life are now, the most important facts he has tattooed onto his body. In the opening scenes we see him driving to a remote location with a man called Teddy; he looks through his pictures and on the back of Teddy's picture is says that he is the killer Leonard shoots and kills the man.Because of the way the story is told this is actually the end; as the film progresses two narratives unfold; on, in black and white, moves forward, and the other, in colour, gradually moves backwards. As the two narratives converge we learn more about Leonard as well as Teddy and a woman called Natalie who helped him.This early film from director Christopher Nolan is gripping and manages to avoid being too confusing as we gradually learn more about the characters. As time passes it becomes apparent that Leonard is a far from reliable narrator thanks to his condition. The way time is played with gives an idea of what Leonard's life is like; he can only trust his notes and what people tell him; not easy when his notes tell him not to trust certain people. When the truth is finally exposed it comes as quite a surprise despite hints that we have seen. The cast does a really good job; Guy Pearce does a great job as he captures Leonard's condition in a believable way, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are also great as Natalie and Teddy. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting a thriller that is different check this out; you might want to watch it again though as I suspect many details will improve on a second viewing.",Memento
13,Quinoa1984,"See it twice, or more, depending on your brain",10,8 April 2001,"Memento, unless you outright hate it for one reason or another, needs to be seen twice. I saw it once and immediately, as a dumb-s*** 17 year old, jumped to comparing to to the backwards-episode of Seinfeld (not, as I should've the Harold Pinter backward-plot construction he was infamous for). Now, years later, little moments and parts of performances remain in the memory. And now, how curious, to revisit the film with a greater knowledge and appreciation for film art and story construction, not to mention going through a few more Christopher Nolan pictures, and... it's much, much better than I remember it. Just luck, I guess.Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man on a mission, and he'll go after his wife's rape and murder, that is in reverse. Or really, at the start of the film its the end, and he kills a man named Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) who we are not sure who or what he's doing there but have some trust that out hero, or just protagonist, knows what he's doing. Does he though? His own tattoos and his own markers are not always the great markers of truth. He says others, like Teddy, lie and can't be trusted, but is it so? The color and B&W photography is symbolic of something, I think, not simply as a gimmick with creating temporal ""present"" and ""past"". It's as if they combine to create a real GRAY area, one where it's hard to tell if Teddy is telling Leonard all he needs to know (though he may be a cop in point of fact, who knows for sure what he has for Leonard, or if he'll help him in the end... not).This is a tricky little movie, but seeing it with eyes fresh and mind ready for anything its really brilliant on the front of construction. A scene ends right where the last one ended, the sequences of Shelby in his motel room punctuate these scenes with his story of another man with short-term memory loss (no ""New Memories"" as he says repeatedly), and it loops back around again. By the end we have a better idea of what happened, and how Leonard was most likely not at all an innocent in the rape and murder of his wife, but we also don't have the certainty of closure. Only in the point of view of Shelby, who is an unreliable narrator, do we have a real semblance of events.The effect is disorientating, but never boring, and the film-making is rich and clever and direct. There's no punches pulled by Nolan this time, and his editing is as elegant as his cinematography (the latter was much more for than the former in his Batman movies). And we feel for the characters, or at least character; especially painful is seeing how Natalie really feels about Leonard, berating him with a dirty mouth and then after being punched for egging Leonard on, sits in the car and comes back in to start the ""new"" memory that will soon fade, much like the polaroid unless its fanned out. The performances rock as well with the script, with Guy Pearce giving a career high point as Leonard (albeit I could just as easily see Steve Buscemi in the role of Teddy).It's a memorable movie, ironic enough, because we care about the character's plight and descent (or is ascent) into/from hell. He has no life except this mystery to unravel, which may be no real mystery at all. It's a post-modern enigma that is fun to watch, again and again.",Memento

It stars Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby, a man with anterograde amnesia,which impairs his ability to store new explicit memories. During the opening credits, which portray the end of the story, it is shown that Leonard kills Teddy,played by Joe Pantoliano. The film suggests that this killing is vengeance for the rape and murder of his wife based on information provided by Natalie,played by Carrie- Anne Moss.This film is often used to show the distinction between plot and story. Its events unfold in two separate, alternating narratives — one in color, and the other in black-and-white. The black-and-white sections are told in chronological order, showing Leonard conversing with an anonymous phone caller in a motel room. Leonard's investigation is depicted in color sequences that are in reverse chronological order. As each sequence begins, the audience is unaware of the preceding events, just like Leonard, thereby giving the viewer a sense of his confusion. By the film's end when the two narratives converge we understand the investigation and the events that lead up to Teddy's death.Memento is not only a film that would give the audience great entertainment but it is also provides them a one of a kind movie experience.Aside from having the plot and the story told in a non- traditional manner whether it is colored/black and white or chronological/reverse-chronological,it involves the viewer into solving the puzzles and mysteries of a crime thriller. Although some may not appreciate the way the story was told as people may not get right way the fashion on how the plot and the story is being told,it nevertheless puts the viewer into the inner workings of the mind as well as the character of Leonard as well as emotions depicted in the movie.That is why it definitely provides the viewer an absorbing experience although it may create confusion to some.",Memento

18,hitchcockthelegend,We all lie to ourselves to be happy.,9,12 July 2015,"It's not until a film like Memento comes along, or that you personally have to deal with someone close who suffers a form of this subject to hand, that you get jolted to remember just how your memory is such a prized and treasured thing - and crucially that it's one of your key safety devices.Christopher and Jonathan Nolan crafted one of the best films of 2000 based on those facets of the human condition. Their protagonist is Leonard Shelby, played with stupendous believability by Guy Pearce, who is suffering from a memory amnesia caused by a trauma to the head as he tried to aide his wife who was raped and murdered. He can remember things before the incident, but anything post that and he can't form a memory. So who can he trust? Does he know any of the few people who appear to be in his life at the present time? He tattoos his body to help him remember, constantly writes notes to keep him alert in his now alien world, while all the time he is on the search for the man who ruined his life.Christopher Nolan plants the audience right into Leonard's world. By using a reverse story telling structure it's deliberately complex and ingenious given that it opens with the ending! It has been argued that it's trickery for trickery sake, style over substance, but the way each scene is built upon in the narrative is a thing of high quality, it's all relevant and demands the closest of attention from the viewer, where cheekily we are ourselves asked to form memories of prior narrative passages. Mystery is strong throughout, the characters currently in Leonard's life may have different means and motives, it keeps us alert, with the confusion, lies, manipulations, enigmas and amnesia angles booming with neo-noir vibrancy. And the Nolan's know their noir of course, adding a narrator who is hard to define or trust himself!The reverse structure wasn't new in 2000, but Christopher Nolan picks up the idea and adds new strands to it, simultaneously bringing his visual ticks as David Julyan's musical score shifts from elegiac forebodings to pulse pounding dread, and as evidenced by the darling easter egg option that allows one to watch it in chronological order, it's a damn fine thriller without the reverse trickery anyway.

It's a totally enigmatic mess of a nightmare ""from end to beginning"", to coin a phrase based on the fact that the story is told backwards.If it made even one iota of sense to me, it was only toward the end when I had a clue as to what I suspected all along. But even then, nothing was clear and much of the story is unresolved so that you, the viewer, can fill in all the gaps depending on how brilliant and imaginative your mind is.The storytelling technique used here is a tricky one and altogether unsuccessful, in my opinion. As far as I'm concerned, short term memory would be a blessing if only to forget this one entirely. The payoff is zero, as Leonard Maltin has already suggested, and makes watching a film like this a total waste of time.GUY PEARCE does an okay job in the central role but his talent is totally wasted in a script that is as ungrounded in reality as his character is supposed to be. The film itself is all style and no substance, as pretentious and manipulating as any film can be that does not respect its audience.JOE PANTOLIANO and CARRIE-ANNE MOSS are competent but their characters are given coarse language full of expletives that should have been directed at the script they were forced to recite rather than inflicted upon a viewer patiently trying to follow a deliberately incomprehensible storyline. What hurts here, is there is no real solution to the puzzle, leaving the audience just as confused as the central character.What should have been a taut film noir turns out to be nothing more than a cheap shot at manipulation.Apparently, audiences these days are willing to swallow anything that seems unusual or offbeat in its appeal but--even so--there is no way I can account for the sort of comments I see here.

Why did he do it? Through scenes shown in reverse order (with individual scenes separated by another set of scenes shown in forward order), we unravel the mystery.Christopher Nolan's second movie. His first, Following, was great and showed his penchant for clever, original plots. Here he exceeded himself - Memento is probably the cleverest, most original movie you'll ever see.The reverse order thing is a brilliant concept in itself, and as far as I know the only other movie to try it was Irreversible by Gaspar Noe (released after Memento, so Memento did it first). Irreversible was much more simple in its method - just play the scenes in reverse order. However, with Memento, Nolan goes one step further. By having intermittent forward-moving scenes he helps add backstory. These eventually meet the backward-moving scenes, closing the continuity loop and making for a seamless, continuous story. Furthermore, it is not the reverse order of the scenes alone that make this movie brilliant. Reverse order scenes without a solid plot behind them would just be a gimmick, and this is certainly no gimmicky movie. The plot itself is brilliant, and ultimately explains why we have to see the scenes backwards.Moreover, despite the enormous complexity of writing and staging such a concept, in the end everything fits and makes sense. Nolan also leaves just enough ambiguity and mystery behind so you can fill in your own theories and backstories.This movie deserves every superlative a movie can get.",Memento

26,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Unique, brilliant and deep",10,23 January 2005,"Ever since I first heard of this film, I was intrigued and wanted to find out if it was really pulled off as well as everyone said. Incredibly enough, despite how sky-high my expectations were for this film, I was pleasantly surprised and my expectations were definitely exceeded. As you probably already know, this whole film runs 'backwards'... meaning that you start by seeing the end, and then go all the way back to the beginning. There's a line in the film that perfectly states the immediate thought that just about anyone has about this idea when they first hear it: ""I always thought the joy of reading a book is not knowing what happens next."" A reasonable assumption, but not always a true one. Especially not when it comes to this film. Because every single scene, up to (but not including) the very last one, starts with the ending of the next one, and ends with the beginning of the previous one. This makes the mystery even more elusive and adds more intensity to the thriller portions of the film. The brilliant and unique reverse time-line is perfectly explained by the main characters condition. This is the best film I've seen in quite a while, and I can't argue with its position on the top 250(as I'm writing this, it's #20). While some might think it's just a typical mystery-thriller with a non-linear time-line thrown in, but it's so much more than that. Like another reviewer points out, it's not what you say, but how you say it. Between every scene in the backwards moving time-line, there is one in black and white that follows a normal time-line. This is great as a break from the scenes moving towards something you already know, and makes the mystery even harder to figure out. The great thing about this film is, not only do we experience the same confusion that the main character does, but we also find out the truth, which he learns at the beginning of the story, at the end of the film. With it comes some nice observations and truths, which I'll let you discover for yourself. I won't jot down the plot here; read a quick summary somewhere or just watch the film and find out about it. I might ruin the surprise for you, a crime greater than most. Everyone deserves to see this film and discover all of it for themselves. I will say, though, that it's brilliant. The pacing is excellent, you're never bored and you never lose interest. The acting is flawless. The characters are well-written and credible. Do yourself a favor; know as little about this film as possible. Don't ask anyone about it, don't read about it. Just rent it and watch it, you won't regret it. I recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate fine film-making, but I suppose fans of mysteries, thrillers and/or dramas might enjoy it more than people who aren't interested in those genres. I do suggest that everyone should at least consider this film. 10/10",Memento

Brilliantly conceived by novice filmmaker Christopher Nolan (who adapted his brother Jonathan's short story ""Memento Mori"") weaves back and forth with storytelling devices at full throttle including flashback, piecemeal clues and red herrings abound and more tellingly the ingenuous use of editing and the adrenaline pumped consequences the film unspools with great elan and aplomb.

The writers did an excellent job staying consistent with Leonard's (Guy Pearce) short term memory loss, and they did an even better job of not revealing to the audience any more than Leonard knew.The best way to keep the audience in the dark about the course of events as much as the main character was to do the story in reverse with each significant event Leonard could remember. Although most movies/stories progress chronologically forward, this movie went backwards event by event in order to find out what lead Leonard to the point we found him at the very beginning of the movie.As I stated before, the movie was done excellently.

Its fans seemed to me to be the same people who like a lot of the movies I really hated over the past five years or so, movies like The Matrix, Run Lola Run, Fight Club, and many others. I avoided it for a long time, though I always thought I had to see it no matter what. And when the chance to see it for free came along, I jumped at it. Fortunately, Memento lives up to the hype. It's one of the few movies that can. Seriously, I wouldn't doubt that this movie will one day be counted as one of the best ever made. Perhaps not the ninth best ever, its current position on the imdb top 250, but it will certainly have its place in the history books.The main reason for this is its unique narrative structure. Add this one to the ranks of Citizen Kane for its high level of narrative innovation. What it does is it tells its story backwards. It will give us one large chunk of narrative information, stop, and then rewind to the last place Leonard (Guy Pearce) began his small chunk of memory. You see, Leonard has this condition where he has little short-term memory. After a few minutes, he forgets everything that has happened to him since a serious injury. He reminds himself of his purpose every time he wakes up in a new chunk of memory through hosts of photos and notes that he has written to himself. His purpose: to avenge his dead wife. She was raped, and her rapist knocked poor Lenny on his head. This condition, which is the foundation of the narrative structure, is clearly false. You just have to suspend your disbelief as you watch, and, I promise you, you'll see something very unique.The best thing about this film is that it gives you some real mental exercise. It asks you to remember a large amount of information. Add to that the fact that not everything is trustworthy, and that truth and memory and facts and everything that we take for granted are constantly being questioned and warped, and you've got yourself an enjoyable uphill battle.
The rest of the film is equally commendable, which ought to be remembered as long as you can retain it. The acting is quite good, especially Joe Pantoliano, so good in Bound, and Carrie-Anne Moss, with whom I was quite unimpressed in The Matrix. Here, she shows that she can play a complex character and that her main assets aren't her T&A. Guy Pearce is also quite good, though he was perhaps better in L.A. Confidential. I think someone else might have brought a bit more depth to the part, but perhaps not. One of the most difficult things about his role is the fact that he really has no complexities - he's a blank slate. One could honestly call him simply a tool of the plot. However, someone who would say that would be missing the fact that he is often being used as a tool by other characters. Christopher Nolan is not just a master scenarist, he's also an excellent director. Also great is the cinematography, sharp color with some spatterings of black and white.Perhaps there are some plot holes, but I didn't notice them.

34,StevePulaski,"She deserves vengeance, regardless if he knows or not",9,7 November 2013,"Before Christopher Nolan began mixing the spectacle and the narrative device, along with the real show of characters and eccentric personalities. With the recent Batman franchise, Nolan became more about the darkness aspect of the story and noticeably amplified the action spectacle, but with his directorial debut Memento, he was all about the mystery. Memento is a great film mainly because of its element of surprise, mystery, and its narrative device. Nolan conducts the story atypically from the end of the story all the way to the beginning, focusing on an array of characters that may or may not have anything to do with the outcome of the story. But is the outcome the first scene (the story's conclusion) or the final scene (the story's beginning)? That is one of the many questions you'll ask yourself when watching Memento for the first time. Seeing it for the first time, I wasn't prepared for the constant mind-race I'd be experiencing. The plot should not be spoiled, so I'll give basic the story's basic framework. Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man suffering from a memory disorder after a man apparently attacked and murdered his wife before knocking him unconscious. Now, Leonard wants to avenge his wife's death, but his memory loss makes it more of a challenge than it already is. Leonard can't hold onto newer memories but has all the ones prior to the incident. To keep with the information about his attacker, Leonard tattoos himself with crucial information in his search for the murderer and takes many Polaroids of the people he meets along the way.That's as far as I'll go in trying to sum up the plot. If you haven't seen it, you don't need to know much else. The story, being told backwards to forwards, intrigues and mystifies, as it should, and heightens the mystery of the entire premise. However, I question the impact the film will have with repeated viewings. Seeing it once and exploring the ins-and-outs of online movie-guides and analyses for Memento, I am seriously skeptical about it being as exhilarating and as gripping as it was the first time around.Despite my speculation of whether or not Memento will hold up for a second viewing, the film should be commended for its intrigue and intricate use of characters and story development. Sometimes the value of characters' motives - and characters themselves - are questionable, making the film tricky to piece together. This is not a criticism because it makes you connect with the stress and confusion of Leonard. The whole thing is akin to a hazy, vigilante/detective story. Nolan puts us in the position of Leonard so deeply that there's hardly a frame or scene where he isn't there. This gives us the feeling of confinement; the odd and often eerie feeling of embodying a character in a film.Guy Pearce's enticing performance only levies this. Pearce adds the hazy and disoriented qualities of Leonard's character subtly but effectively as she makes the character sympathetic but simultaneously unreliable. With Leonard's severe condition, even his buddy Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) sometimes seems like a complete stranger. This not only leads to an unreliable narrator, but an unreliable cast of characters, seeing as Leonard feels as if he can't trust his own friends and acquaintances due to his condition. The same applies to us.Memento is a great thriller thanks to its mystery and high-levels of intrigue. The great performances of Pearce, Pantoliano, and Carrie Anne-Moss as a woman Leonard meets during his search. The scene that rings in my head the most from the film is when Teddy informs Leonard that even if he does kill the person responsible, it isn't like he'll remember it. Leonard has the most logical response there could be. ""My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make a difference whether I know about it."" Starring: Guy Peace, Joe Pantoliano, and Carrie Anne-Moss.

38,Red-Barracuda,Brilliant debut feature from Christopher Nolan,10,10 October 2014,"Memento is of course famous for being a film whose narration is told in reverse. It's divided into several segments that go back progressively further in time; each is separated by black and white sequences told in the correct order. Eventually both dovetail together in a sequence at the end that reveals crucial details that inform the whole story. This unique structure is brilliant. It's far from a gimmick though, as it is an extremely effective way of putting the audience in the lead character Leonard's shoes. The reason for this is that he is a man with a rare short-term memory loss disease so he, like us in the audience, has no idea of what has happened just a short time before. He has to take Polaroids of important objects, write notes to himself and even apply tattoos in order to proceed through life with any purpose. The last thing he remembers is the brutal murder of his wife - in which he was also assaulted, leading to his condition – and it's an event he lives to get vengeance for.The reverse order structure and memory problem of Leonard creates a very interesting and unusual tension. The film's plot is structured ingeniously so that events unfold in this reverse chronology in such a way that maximises the twists and turns of the story-line. One of the beauties of this type of narrative is that, like the main character, we also have to depend on his notes and so we never really know if friends really are friends and how long he has actually known anybody. It's a disorientating effect and the reverse chronology perfectly captures the confusion of it. Leonard is, therefore, a perfect example of one of the staples of literature – the unreliable narrator. Except in this case, what we see is fact, it's just that we interpret it via Leonard's self-made clues and we increasingly discover how flaky they are as the story progresses further into the past. The effect of the memory condition is often used for wildly differing ends; sometimes it's used comically, like where Leonard forgets if he is running away from or chasing after a mystery man or where he discovers by chance that he has been booked into two rooms in the motel he lives, while at other times it is used for intense drama, as in the powerful scene where Natalie abuses Leonard, which is a brilliant sequence that hits the audience hard and really illustrates the impossibility of Leonards predicament.The cast helps a lot here. Guy Pearce shows again what a fantastic lead actor he can be, with a highly nuanced and varied performance as Leonard. Carrie-Anne Moss gets it spot on as the enigmatic femme-fatale, Natalie, while Joe Pantoliano is funny and shifty to the perfect degree as Teddy. But you really have to give the most credit to director Christopher Nolan, as this is really an extraordinarily assured debut movie. It remains easily the best thing he has ever done and the sheer audacity of attempting something so original for his first feature really indicated that he was someone with considerable talent. Memento is a neo-noir masterpiece and a towering achievement for all involved.",Memento

40,sddavis63,Certainly A Unique And Interesting Premise,5,21 September 2009,"It's certainly a unique concept. Leonard, played by Guy Pearce, is a man who has no short-term memory after being attacked when trying to save his wife from a rape-murder. The rest of his life is spent in a quest for revenge - a revenge he can't remember if he's ever been able to achieve because he has no short-term memory. That's an interesting enough premise, the added piece here being the decision to offer us the story in reverse chronology - beginning with Leonard killing the man he believes to be his wife's killer (played by Joe Pantoliano) and then scene by scene retracing the story, going back just a bit at a time to fill in the details of his search, and how he came to the conclusion that Teddy was responsible. Essentially, then, the viewer is pulled into Leonard's own condition - seeing what's happening with no clue as to how it came about because we haven't seen what came before. Edited into the regression scenes are black and white scenes in which Leonard, holed up in his hotel room, essentially talks about his condition and seems to fill in some essential details about his past.It's an interesting way to present a ""whodunit"" - because the question all the way through is whether Teddy is actually the killer. The ending offers up a twist - although it isn't the biggest surprise you'll ever see, if only because the way the movie is put together you're conditioned from the beginning to expect pretty much any twist possible, it still leaves open a decent bit of uncertainty about who actually killed Lenny's wife. So, the premise and construction of the story is interesting enough. Also interesting, though, is that - while it's intriguing - I just didn't find it particularly enjoyable to watch. Perhaps it's because I didn't buy Leonard's condition - for one reason. He used photographs to jog his memory, so he took pictures of important people, places, etc,. to refer to when necessary. What's wrong with that? Well - nothing, I suppose, except that I found it passing strange that, for a guy who supposedly forgets everything within a couple of minutes of it happening, he always knew exactly which pocket to find the pictures in. He NEVER had to search for one of his photographs; there was never even a moment of hesitation when he had to refer to one. That's a small point, perhaps, but it caused a bit of a credibility gap for me. The movie's well acted by the leads and interesting enough as the pieces of the puzzle are sorted out, but for me it fizzled a bit on that admittedly relatively small point. 5/10",Memento
41,thesar-2,Tattoo 'Memento' on your body as a MUST SEE,10,30 June 2009,"This is my second viewing of 'Memento' since it debuted in 2000 and I have the same feelings about it: masterpiece, original, great dialogue, wonderful concept and extremely well acted. And since 2000, hardly any other movie has come close to the brilliance this movie has shown. What other movie has been played backward? 'Memento' starts off with a murder and works its way carefully and uniquely backwards through a mystery a man with no short-term memory and an audience must solve. Pearce plays the main character completely convincingly as does co-stars (and 'Matrix' co-stars) Moss and Pantoliano. A man stricken with no short-term memory after an accident must put together pieces of a puzzle after his wife gets murdered, so he can get revenge. Along the way he meets and re-meets people who might be aiding his quest, all the while we learn certain people are extremely dangerous. I can't say enough, I LOVED this movie. Everything worked for it, and finally a movie (not a dumb summer popcorn movie, sorry 'Transformers') makes me use my brain. You really have to think, take little breaks and pay attention. I admired the episode of 'Seinfeld' when they did the same thing (one of the series best episodes ever) – and that was the only other work I can think of that used this concept: telling the story backwards. Sure, you can like big-budgeted movies, but they hardly ever show the respect that director Christopher Nolan did during this feature. Ironically, Nolan also directed the big-budgeted, latest 'Batman' adventures. Guess what? They're 100x better than the previous four. This man knows what's good and how to show it. Sit back, listen to every word spoken or unspoken and enjoy one of the best mysteries, or simply, best movies ever made.",Memento

43,Lejink,Memento more!,8,5 August 2012,"Christopher Nolan's breakthrough film displays in full his originality in choice of subject and bravura style. ""Memento"" starts and ends with different murders (or does it?), keeping the viewer engrossed and always on the hop with its forward and backward time-frames, not to mention contrasting colour and monochromatic cinematography.Brilliantly edited and skilfully acted the film demands complete attention from first to last, or is that last to first, as Guy Pearce's haunted Lenny tries to rebuild his memories and uncover the truth about the rape and murder of his wife. The jump-cuts each time he goes back further in his flashbacks jolt like one waking from a dream and yet build a rhythm to the movie which takes away the viewer's initial expectations as to when his next recurrence will crop up. Just occasionally the disparate characters and the interlocking story lost me and I'm not completely sure I got the ending but up until that point I was in thrall for most of the time as Nolan presents us with a brilliant twist on film noir, as Pearce's insurance investigator (acting for all the world like a private investigator) finds himself embroiled in a convoluted murder mystery. Pearce is excellent in the lead, but the rest of the cast are excellent in support in what I imagine must have been a confusing shoot. After a run of excellent original thrillers in the late 80's ""The Usual Suspects"", ""LA Confidential"" ""Se7en"", ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", it was going to take something very good to continue the new tradition.For the most part however Nolan delivers and as his subsequent track record shows, it was no fluke",Memento
44,ElMaruecan82,"""Chris N. will trick your mind"" ... a review a la 'Memento' ...",10,3 May 2011,"""Memento"" is not your typical whodunit film, it's more a howcatchem, where we don't know who to catch, except maybe the first victim, Joe Pantaliano, a friendly mustached man, accused of being the author of a horrific rape and murder. He doesn't even have time to defend himself, Lenny, played by Guy Pearce, kills him ruthlessly, until we see the stains of bloods and drops going in reverse, and understand the direction the film will take, for our delighted surprise.'Remember Sammy Jenkins': Lenny's motto, the only thing he conditioned himself to remember. It's the story of a man suffering from his same short-term memory, until it ultimately killed his wife. This probably is the element that justified the use of the backwards narration because it shows the deadly nature of Lenny's memory problem, Lenny who just killed a man thought to be his wife's murderer. Two parallel stories, one bloody murder, one revenge story, a short-term memory, a story in reverse, a claustrophobic setting, there's something quite uneasy in this cinematic journey. And the dizziness is the same as when you sit in the opposite seats of the train's direction, but you will arrive at destination. And that the identity of the murderer will be revealed, or no, that the revelation will be shocking. Because Memento is not your typical whodunit film  Basically, the reverse thing's point is to teach us, not to believe in the appearances. Lenny's condition needs proofs, things written, everywhere, tattooed in his body, pictures with names on it, and devices written as to warn himself from the danger of being teased. The guy killed in the beginning, named Teddy, surprisingly seems to be Lenny buddy and helper, but he's tagged as suspicious in his photography. Every hint has to be material, but the more we get in Lenny's conditions, the more we realize that these precautions act like a double-edged sword. So the movie basically, prepares us to a biggest surprise about the identity of the murderer, who's probably not that Teddy. How could we be so sure? Simply, because the movie is a mystery, and the resolution can only come at the end. Besides, such a powerful film can't afford an ordinary ending. And this is where the 'Sammy Jenkins' situation interferes with our understanding of the film. 'Remember Sammy Jenkins': Lenny's motto, the only thing he conditioned himself to remember  Among the great memorable scenes, there's one where you wonder why Lenny's being mocked by a drunkard while tasting a beer given by the waitress that would help him in his investigation, until the previous scene that happened before in the story, you see that she spitted on it, to test him. Then, she was convinced, and so were we. That was a comic relief scene, but how about the one where she comes with her face beaten, asking for his help, until we realize in the previous-next scene that he was the one teased to hit her in the face. But the palm of the funniest (yes, I know it's a drama, but this one was priceless) is the priceless ""I'm chasing this gun?"" ""No, he's chasing me"". These ten seconds are enough justifications to the backwards narration. And since the movie starts with the killing, basically, the reverse thing's point is to teach us, not to believe in the appearances  Lenny's short-term memory problem: the kind of plot device that could taste like caviar when handled by a good screenwriter and like tomato juice by another. Basically, if he just finished reading this part of the review, he can't remember how it started; imagine how painful it would be. I don't know, if this handicap convinced Chris Nolan to make the story backwards of it's the idea of making a story backwards that reminded him of memory problems, but it would be like discussing of what was first: the egg or the chicken  The idea was perfect, and the way, we follow Lenny in his backwards quest to find the murdered of his wife is a gold mine for memorable situations. Among the great memorable scenes, there's one where you wonder why Lenny's being mocked by a drunkard while tasting a beer given by the waitress  Simply, a brilliant story. Did you notice I used a specific word: story? There is the script, and the story, too. The story had to justify this architecture. By the way, I'm using the word architecture for the second time, because I know Nolan is like an architect of screen writing, using plot devices as so many bricks to build unforgettable movies, I didn't think it worked that well for ""Inception"" because it lacked something called 'heart', it works with ""Memento"" because the story has one, and its heart pumped by a true desire of revenge. Lenny, played by a superb Guy Pearce, has one quest, finding John G., the one who raped and murdered his wife. His motives are understandable, and the story would have been a normal linear chase if it wasn't for one handicap: Lenny's short-term memory problem, the kind of plot device that could taste like caviar when handled by a good screenwriter  ""Memento"" is a cinematic experience that tricks your mind from beginning to end, or should I say, from the ending to the beginning, or wait a minute, again, I'm lost  Now, where was I? Oh yeah, you know that they say about a good script? It must have a beginning, middle, and an ending  but not necessarily in that order. I guess ""Memento"" respects the idea of what makes a good story, but the genius of the script, and the brilliance of its creativity rely on the incredible architecture that started the film at the end, to go on backwards, until an unforgettable climactic conclusion, that occurred at the beginning of the story. Simply, a brilliant story",Memento

Summarise it in terms of its most conventional elements: a serial killer, a quest for justice, a bent cop and a convoluted plot and it might sound like a thousand other hackneyed films marked only by their stunning unoriginality.  Watch it, however, and it takes your breath away.Nolan's triumph in this film is the perfect marriage of form and content. How you you make an original, engaging thriller?  A conventional approach is to confuse the viewer, cut the story up into lots of separate threads that are only re-united in the ending.  Yawn yawn yawn! But this is a film about a man with memory loss. Each moment is new to him, because he never knows what happened before.  So Nolan tells his story in reverse, capturing his character's utter placelessness and simultaneous assembling a plot that is complex, baffling, yet original and natural at the same time, its structure just the consequence of its hero's plight.This is audacious, but Nolan pulls it off.  With a dry wit, moments of poignancy, plenty of action and some interesting questions that lurk below the surface, he never underestimates the viewer's intelligence, in a tale as real as it is bizarre.

Its backwards nature is a clever conceit that's more than just a gimmick, though. It's woven into the very nature of the narrative and, as such, one should not be presented without the other. It also comes as a natural extension to the main character, allowing for plenty of unique moments that challenge audience perception. This is essentially the piece's mission statement and it achieves it in full.

48,ThomasDrufke,Memory Vs. Imagination,10,3 November 2014,"It's Interstellar week so my quest to go back and review all of Christopher Nolan's previous films continues.Christopher Nolan has a neat way of presenting high concept ideas that all of us have thought about but not quite understood, and bringing them to the big screen in a highly entertaining way. Memento is quite possibly Nolan's most thought provoking film. It tells the story of a man who was injured during the murder of his wife and has short term memory loss. Only of course the film isn't told chronologically. It is told in two ways. The black and white scenes move forward but are of his past. While the color scenes are more present but are told backwards. When they meet we have the end. I have seen many films that take concepts like this and fail to truly entertain and are more artsy than audiences would like. Nolan mixed brain power with a unbelievably entertaining thriller.Leonard's main goal is to find and kill his wife's killer, only with short term memory loss he has trouble remembering clues or even if he has already killed the man. He has tattoos to remind himself of his daily goals and who or who not to trust. While all this is going on, flashbacks tell the story of Sammy Jankis who suffered from the same disease as Leonard and supposedly kills his wife unwillingly because of it. The more and more the story progresses we begin to question everything we think we know about the character(s). As the color scenes are told subjectively we begin to find out more and more objective things once the scenes move backwards more. Where as we are told Leonards black and white scenes through an objective lens from a distance.Nolan basically invents a new way of telling a story with this film and perfects it beautifully. It's really a story of memory versus imagination and how as we lose our memory we begin to paint our past with imagination and how we want to remember things. So Leonard may or may not fill in the gaps of his memory with what he wants to believe happened or not.Guy Pearce gives an Oscar worthy performance in what should have been an all around award winning movie. From the writing to the editing to the directing to the haunting score, this film is a masterpiece and a true work of art that we just don't get often in film. Nolan combines art house directing with the utmost entertaining and engaging way to tell a story. I wont begin to try to explain the ending or go into true spoilers because this is a film you want to watch without knowing much and then go back and watch it right after. It's truly one of the most brilliant stories ever written and greatest films of all time.+Inventive storytelling by the Nolan's +Objective vs Subjective +Memory vs Imagination +Beginning is the end is the middle +High concept yet highly entertaining 10/10",Memento

I thought it took a little too long to get there and was repetitive in its overlapping bits, so I got a little less caught up in the cleverness of it all than others. Part of me felt it was too contrived, and part of me wondered why the main character didn't just take copious notes rather than scrawl single lines on photos and tattoo himself, or better yet, shoot videos of himself. How could he be functional on his own, driving, etc in this state? How does he even remember that he has a memory problem?

It would usually take years of experience for most directors to create a film like this. I compare this film to another one of his that came out ten years later and that is Inception. They both have the same goal: to get the audience to think. Memento will surely get one to think. That is why this is a brilliant movie.This film has a very complex plot. It's about a guy who has no short-term memory so he writes notes all over his body. Quite simply, that guy is looking for the person who killed his wife and took away his memory.The acting is really good. Guy Pearce is such an underrated actor. He should get more credit with the Academy. Also, Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano gave great performances.Overall, this is one of the best mystery films out there. This movie also has a rarity.

After his wife was murdered and presumably he was beaten, he has no short term memory. His last recollection is the moments before his wife's demise. Now, he is determined to track down the killer the police couldn't find. Yet, everyday he must read his notes and gaze at the many tattooed phrases on his body so that he can continue. Two people appear to be helping him in his quest. One is a man named Teddy, who pops around all the time but seems rather shady. Equally so is a Natalie (Carrie Anne Moss) who is sleeping with Leonard but may have ulterior motives. Meanwhile, Leonard stays at a cheap Los Angeles Hotel where the manager introduces himself every day and, underhandedly, adds to Leonard's bill. As he crisscrosses the city looking for the murderer, the film also flashes back to his time as an insurance investigator to give us more clues. For you see, this film is designed to force the viewer to piece together the plot, bit by bit! Are you game? I finally saw this fantastic Nolan film that everyone raves about incessantly. Its worthy of the highest praise as the plot travels backwards, forwards, and sideways. Pearce is wonderful as the main character, but, one quibble, I'm not fond of him as a blonde. The supporting cast is also superb with few big names except Moss. The setting in Los Angeles has its splendors and its dives. Memento is a huge cut above most other film experiences.

The purpose of this narrative device is to let the viewer experience what the protagonist is going through. It may have seemed like a clever idea on paper, but it makes for a muddled and unsatisfying film. The plot is preposterous and there are too many loose ends.

Okay, it certainly isn't as confusing as, say, Tenet, but it really is quite mind bending in a lot of ways, especially since a bulk of the film actually goes backwards, and there is a really good reason for this. Yeah, the film starts at the end, and moves to the middle (while cutting back and forth to the part of the film that is heading forward to the middle) to where the big reveal actually is.The film is about this guy, Leonard, who suffers from Anterograde amnesia - that is that he can't retain memories. As such he resorts to a number of ways to remind himself of things, such as tattooing important things to his body, and taking photographs and making notes on these photographs. His mission is to find the man who murdered his wife, and put him into this state. Yeah, it's the same condition that the woman in Fifty First Dates has, but this film is much, much better.That is actually the reason why Nolan has the film go backwards, so as to give you, the viewer, the feeling that you actually suffer from the same condition that Leonard does, and that you are just as mystified by all of the notes as he is. This is the same with all of the characters that he interacts with, namely because you pretty much know as much about them as he does. This is what makes the film so intriguing because as you head back in time, more is revealed, and characters that you initially thought were nice, turn out not to be so. Like there is this constant reference about why Leonard is wearing these specific clothes, and the car that he is driving, and at the beginning of the film there doesn't seem to be an issue.Another of the great things about this film is that pretty much everybody is unreliable. Leonard is clearly unreliable because he can't remember anything. As for Teddy, well, we are constantly reminded not to trust Teddy everytime Leonard looks at the photo, so of course he is unreliable, but we also ask ourselves whether there is any truth to this or not. I won't say anything else because that will no doubt completely ruin the film. Hey, even the guy at the desk in the motel is unreliable.What is surprising is that this is quite a low budget film, which is surprising coming from Nolan, but then again you really do have to start off small and work your way up, as well as get involved in some more mainstream work. However, if you like Nolan's work, and love how he messes around with time, then this is definitely a film to watch.",Memento

That is exactly how I feel when I watch ""Memento"", perhaps the most perfectly-crafted movie of all times in terms of screenplay and plotting.For a basic plot summary, ""Memento"" tells the story of an amnesiac who cannot remember short-term events. He knows who is and basic tenants of his life, but the day-to-day details reset from time to time. Thus, this film is devoted to him trying to avenge his wife's killing and putting together the pieces of his confusing identity.""Memento"" is much deeper than that above description, but to say any more would give away the fun of figuring it all out. The story is told in such a unique fashion that it will keep you guessing (but in a good way) until the very end. In what would prove to be a pattern for the Nolans going forward (especially projects in which Jonathan is attached too), the narrative does not play out in a linear format. Instead, it gives us little chunks in reverse order, so basically we see the ending first and then keep pulling back the curtain to understand the ""why"" of it all. What a concept! It takes a perfect screenplay to pull that off, and the Nolans come through easily on that front. I can only imagine the time and effort it must have taken to tell a story in this manner.Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give this film, however, is that it accomplishes the feat of bending the mind yet ultimately creating a remarkably cohesive overall story. In other words, it is both very complicated and very fun to watch. I was taken on a psychological adventure and given an ending worthy of the journey. Unlike other mind-benders such as, say, ""Primer"" or ""Donnie Darko"" (that revel in the confusion they are creating), ""Memento"" accomplishes the rare feat of being equally entertaining and challenging.Thus, ""Memento"" is now firmly ensconced on my ""Top Films of all-time"" list, in large part because, 18 years after its debut, there still really isn't anything like it. There's a reason why the Nolans have become such large entities in Hollywood, and it all comes back to this groundbreaking film.",Memento

You really will end up thinking ""Now, where was I?""

He is, however, committed to discovering and punishing a murderer, resorting to post-it notes, tattoos and Polaroid photographs, where he notes what he has discovered. Its an interesting concept, later revisited in ""Before I go to Sleep"", film that approaches a similar story. The way the narrative is constructed, with multiple linearity twists, helps to thicken the mystery and hold our attention but it can have the opposite effect on people who don't understand the film right from the start. And this happens because, from the middle, the movie loses rhythm and interest. The ending works well but it can really disappoint, just as it disappointed me. I did not want the ending to be the way it was. Guy Pearce is the protagonist and did a reasonable job, as well as the generality of the cast, but the film is not exactly a dramatic show for any actor. Its worth, essentially, by the original story that tells.",Memento

66,Anonymous_Maxine,Memento is the most creatively made and brilliantly engaging film of at least the last decade.,10,6 April 2002,"SPOILER ALERT First of all, I would like to point out that I am a huge fan of Roger Ebert. His reviews are well written and enlightening about the movies that they focus on and often a lot of obscure movies that are related to the one in question, but his review of Memento is one of the most ignorant and just flat-out incorrect pieces of film criticism that I have ever read. Sure, there's a hole in the plot. If the last thing that Leonard remembers is his wife dying, then he should not technically remember that he can't form short term memories. Plot hole, yes. But who cares?! Anyone? Anyone? Me neither. Plot holes plague the Back to the Future series, one of the most entertaining trilogies ever made, left and right. In Part II, Marty McFly leaves 1985 to travel to the year 2015 to prevent his teenage son from robbing a bank and getting thrown in jail and starting that horrible chain reaction that destroys his entire family. In his review of that film, Ebert seems to have overlooked the MASSIVE plot hole that far overshadows the one that he points out in Memento  if Marty leaves 1985 and travels to 2015, there is no longer any Marty left in 1985 to grow into the 47-year-old Marty that he finds in 2015. This little revelation suggests that Ebert is either judging films on varying and unstable criteria, or he has something against someone involved in the making of Memento.Regardless of what Ebert says, Memento is an absolutely brilliant film that engages the viewer and literally brings him or her into the mind of the main character. Ebert naively points out that the reverse plotline of the film has nothing to do with Leonard's condition, which is arguably the most foolish thing that he says in his review. Ebert has made what may be called the idiotic assumption that the reverse plotline represents the way that Leonard lives. I am finding it difficult to determine how he has managed to come to that conclusion without inserting plotlines of his own into the film, such as ones involving time travel or some other such science fiction nonsense. Memento is a dramatic thriller about a man with a severe psychological memory disorder, and the reverse plotline is there to put the audience in Leonard's shoes. He has no idea what happened before what he's doing right now, and neither do we. Are you hearing this, Roger? I suggest you watch this movie again, because you missed a LOT.(spoilers) Another gigantic element of the plot that Ebert seems to have missed (BOTH times he saw the film), is the fact that Leonard's wife was never raped, and never killed. There is a single shot near the end of the film (I warn again, there are spoilers ahead!) that is not more than a few seconds long, that proves that she was never killed (I suppose rape is still a possibility), and also eradicates the plot hole that Ebert pointed out, that Leonard should not be able to remember his `condition' if the last thing that he remembers is his wife being killed. The shot that I am talking about is one in which Leonard is laying in bed, and his wife is laying next to him with her head on his shoulder, running her fingers over the tattoo across his chest that says `John G. raped and murdered my wife.' Are you hearing THIS, Roger? One viewing, contrary to what Ebert foolishly suggested in his review, is NOT enough for this film. Memento is one of the few films that not only invites repeat viewings, but requires them.Confusion is not the state to be in here, not by any stretch of the imagination. Repeat viewings will remove you from that state and put you in a state of blissful enlightenment as you realize the astonishing intricacy of this film. The poignant back story about Sammy Jankis and his wife is not only powerful and moving, but relates DIRECTLY to Loenard's condition, which is yet another thing that Ebert has amazingly managed to completely miss. In Ebert's defense (because I do not intend this review of my own to be a knock against one of my otherwise favorite film critics), I can only say that maybe he latched onto some erroneous idea the first time he saw the film that clouded his cinematic vision the second time he saw it, or perhaps he was simply viewing it from the wrong perspective. I invite you all to read his review but also note that there are maybe half a dozen or so things that he says in that review that are simply wrong, and this can be easily seen just by watching this incredible film. Roger, I love your work, and I have all of your books, but in this case, it seems that YOU may be the one with the condition!'",Memento

It's an odd bunch of people, not unlike the TEA Party in the US, where any criticism is pounced on with uncompromising gusto?

Fortunately Memento is one of his movies where I can safely say it's worth 10 out of 10 without feeling like I am selling out to they sycophants.For starters Guy Pearce does an amazing job and that is generally not the case in his movies. The Hurt Locker, The Proposition, L.A. Confidential, there are very few movies where he was actually believable in the part. So we have that and it generally takes a competent director to bring it out of him.Then the plot itself, what is it? Comedic mystery? Would that be a decent enough title for it? It weaves itself in and out of the story, taking time to use Leonard's peculiar memory to it's best comedic effect.The plot heavily revolves around his extremely short term memory and, because of that we get to see the movie through his eyes and all the complications that come with it, both in their most brutal and their most brutally funny as he attempts to solve his wife's murder and gets exploited along the way.It's just a great film, funny and violent, like I love them.",Memento
69,freemantle_uk,"A intelligence, compelling piece of filmmaking",10,23 June 2012,"Memento is a wonderingly complex, intelligence and bold thriller from Christopher Nolan, offering us a rich tapestry of story and ideas. It was the film that put Nolan on the map and was one very compelling thriller.Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man suffering anterograde amnesia, which results in having no short term memory. He has to take Polaroid photos and making a lot of notes to get by as he solves the mystery of who raped and murdered his wife. He has two allies, a bartender Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who is in trouble with a local drug dealer and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). But one or both of them could be using Leonard for their own reasons. Leonard also thinks back to his past life as an insurance investigator and to a man with the same condition Samuel R. Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky).Nolan employs an non-linear narrative, telling the story backwards, unfolding the mystery the other way and see how Leonard came to that conclusion. We know as much as Leonard as we dissect the web of clues and we do not know who we really should trust. These are characters in there own self interests and the whole film is a puzzle.There are three great leads performance, playing interesting characters that motivations swing back and forth as they play on Leonard's condition. They are well written, complex characters that were believably played by the actors and makes them compelling. Pearce has to be on the top of his game for a very challenging role. He pulls it off exceptionally well and it is a shame he was never the big leading actor he deserves to be.There are some nice little touches through out the film, from a scene where one of the characters takes all the pens to prevent Leonard making a note and the different filming styles to show the duel narratives.Memento is an intelligence, well thought out film that deserves the reputation it has earned. This is a film that deconstructs the typical storytelling approach and makes something unique, whilst still being an interesting piece of work and a compelling story.",Memento

71,dfranzen70,A field of forget-me-nots,9,3 October 2001,"Leonard (Guy Pearce) has a memory problem: He cannot form new memories. He forgets things a few minutes after they've occurred. This is caused by emotional and physical trauma he suffered when he once woke up in the middle of the night and saw his wife murdered by asphyxiation. Now Leonard's determined to figure how who the killer is.   To combat his ailment, Leonard takes photos with an Instamatic camera and writes a sentence or two on the back of the picture. He snaps pictures of people whom he's not sure if he just met - and he's also never sure if they're friend or foe. Among the players are Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), the latter of whom supposedly lost a loved one in a similar matter and who therefore feels a sort of kinship with the traumatized Leonard. The most fascinating aspect of this movie is that it's shot out of sequence. Because Leonard's memories are pretty much kaput (he can clearly remember everything up to the murder, but not subsequent memories), we actually get to see the same scenes a couple of times. No, it's not repetitive. Here's an example. Scene fades in, and Leonard is running through backyards, cutting, juking, zigging, and zagging. He suddenly says - for we can hear his thoughts - ""Ok, where am I? He spots another man running nearby. ""Oh,"" Leonard thinks, ""I'm chasing him,"" and he starts to move in the other man's direction. Oops - the man suddenly charges back at Leonard. ""No, wait... he's chasing me!"" Leonard thinks. And in another scene, we see the events leading up to that particular chase, as well as events after it. It's up to the viewer to place them in the right order, but seeing the scenes out of sequence, I think, is very useful here. Things are clearer when they're revisited with more information. Now, when Leonard writes on the back of the photos, what he writes is influenced greatly by whatever has happened just prior to the photograph's creation. This complicates things greatly; if he thinks someone's a nice person, he'll snap the picture and write on the back that they're a nice person. But later, he'll look at the picture - without remembering anything - and take the words at face value. If it says he liked the person, then the person's good, even though he might not have known much about that person. There are infinite twists to this movie, and the ending is fantastic. You may know right off that this is no ordinary who-killed-my-wife caper, but you will have a tough time predicting the outcome.",Memento
72,meeza,Mementous Film!,10,16 April 2001,"The memento has come for me to tell you that you will not see a more original film this year than  `Memento.' The film is about an insurance agent who is on a vengeance mission to find out who raped and killed his wife. However, this is definitely a challenge for him because he has short term memory loss from the time that his wife was murdered. This means he only remembers real life experiences right after they happen for only about 5 minutes (which is very similar to my situation when I go out drinking). He experienced this trauma because of a head injury he suffered when he was trying to save his wife from the killer. Star Guy Pearce delivers an unforgettable performance that academy award voters should not forget during oscar time. The remarkable thing about this film is that is presented backwards. We see the action-packed conclusion at the beginning of the film, and the beginning of the story at the end (which is very similar to how I always hope my dating nights would turn out to be like). Anyway, this makes us be in the same predicament as the main character because of his condition. Whatever you do, don't forget to see `Memento.' ***** Excellent",Memento
73,drqshadow-reviews,Early Lessons in Controlled Perception from the Nolan Brothers,9,13 November 2020,"After stretching his legs in the arthouse scene with 1998's Following, Christopher Nolan gets a little more mainstream in this swervy, concept-rich tale of amnestic vengeance. Guy Pearce plays a man with short-term memory loss, constantly overwriting the VHS tape of his near-past as he tracks a nameless, faceless killer. He employs some blunt methods for retaining important information - hand-written notes and Polaroids for loose facts, tattoos for solid truths - but when you're operating on such a short timer (the dreaded memory wipe seems to occur every ten minutes), I suppose you've got to take what you can get, even if it makes you a target for manipulation.The whole fable unfolds in a sort of stuttered reverse, immediately revealing the plot's ending before slowly walking back to its beginning, which leaves the viewer feeling almost as handicapped as Pearce. It's an early example of Nolan's experimental nature, his interest in tinkering with traditional storytelling formats to bend viewers' perceptions, and it works just as well here as we might expect from his later works. At each intersection, we're forced to second-guess everything we thought we knew, which continually changes the context of that first ten minute chunk. Our trust is earned, betrayed, diverted and rehabilitated.Sure, sometimes it feels like this is more about the experiment than the plot (for all its ambition, the actual story is very small-scale), but conceptual risks carry a lot of weight with me and Memento is a verifiable playground for such things. It's as effective a ""walk a mile in my shoes"" experience as any I've seen on the big screen, and a large part of that can be credited to the Nolan brothers' peculiar knack for outside-the-box cinematic creativity.",Memento
74,Chris_Docker,A compelling mystery that maps unknown territory with a terrifying feeling of absolute certainty,8,22 October 2000,"Tightly acted and directed, and brilliantly adapted from a short story that used an unusual idea for a mystery thriller: supposing the central figure can only remember things that happened a long time ago or within the last 15 minutes? The psychological condition where someone, after a trauma, cannot create new memories, is vividly recreated as we are introduced to 15 minute segments one at a time, in reverse chronological order.
To pull this off and maintain smooth continuity is quite a feat, which is why this movie is such a remarkable accomplishment. We are as bewildered as Leonard (played by Guy Pearce) as he searches for the man who brutally raped and killed his wife. He leaves himself clues in the form of tattooed notes and Polaroid pictures to substitute for memory.The tension towards the climax and gut-wrenching revelations reminded me of the Usual Suspects as I came out of the cinema dazzled by the inventiveness and mental pace which this film achieves.",Memento
75,MaxBorg89,The Ultimate Mind-twister,10,15 December 2005,"There are a lot of excellent movies whose scripts rewrote the rules of cinematic storytelling (the Oscar-winning The Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction are two good examples). Memento deserves a place among those films: it's the most complex, original, innovative, intriguing achievement I've seen in a while. Thought The Matrix was confusing? Think again. Memento looks like an ordinary film noir, having all the conventional elements (femme fatale, unreliable characters, ambiguous protagonist/narrator, bleak ending), until it fatally strikes you with its originality and audacity, making you unable to stop watching.From the beginning you realize you're not watching the usual thriller: the reversed opening sequence is a fascinating narrative choice, and even more fascinating is the director's decision to tell the whole story backwards, with each separate scene ending where the previous one began. Thanks to this trick, the audience is as confused as the movie's main character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a peculiar DIY detective who wants to find the bloke who raped and killed his wife (CSI's Jorja Fox). The problem? Because of an accident, ""Lenny"" has lost his short-term memory, so every new event is gone from his mind after 10 minutes. He has to go on with his life by taking notes, snapping Polaroids and putting tattoos all over his body. He also gets some valuable help from a cop, ""Teddy"" (Joe Pantoliano), and a barmaid, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss). But should he really trust them, given he can't almost even trust himself (""You don't even know who you are!"" ""I'm Leonard Shelby. I'm from San Francisco."" ""That's who you were! Not who you have become!"")? Writer/director Christopher Nolan knows how to build up the tension, as well as add emotion, with the touching parallel story of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), a man with the same disease as Leonard.Both Pearce and Tobolowsky are superb as the two troubled men: the former makes you feel as uneasy as he does almost immediately, and he's got some really ace lines (""How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time?""); the latter, on the other hand, is heartbreaking, his experiences make us wanna cry before the film's over. Pantoliano and Moss are very impressive too, their true intentions remaining unclear until the end.For those uninitiated to Nolan's genius, Memento is the perfect way to start.

I've been a fan of Guy Pearce since his Australian TV days, on into ""Priscilla"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" and this allows him even more range.For us to experience time the way he does, the story unravels through backwards scenes; the technique is indicated from the opening shot where a graphic Polaroid photo fades while being shook, instead of the expected getting brighter and clearer -- a visual metaphor for the protagonist as well. After that, the story isn't on literal rewind; instead we see the scenes in reverse order of how they happened; onion-like we see how the character ended up getting to the scene just before. If Humphrey Bogart's character thought ""The Big Sleep"" tough to figure out, this one is even more convoluted.Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano are terrific, and not relying on some of their tics from other movies and TV shows, as the folks who may or may not be lying to or manipulating the protagonist.I'm not 100% sure how all the pieces fit together and went to see it again a week later -- and came away with different interpretations.

It's a clever, even admirable film in the way it is constructed. Pardon me for not enjoying it more.Guy Pearce stars as Leonard (don't call him Lenny) Shelby, a fellow hot on the trail of his wife's killer...if only he can remember more than five minutes ago. It's an intriguing concept, to what extent personality and identity are beholden to the brain's ability to make new memories, and you have to give mad props to the filmmakers for dreaming this one up, only they didn't bother to create any sympathetic characters for their drama, or a story worth caring about beyond the novel ""story-backwards-through-unfolding-plotting"" means of narration. You have to watch the movie more than once, perhaps several times, before you begin to realize what happened. But when you do, it feels like a cheat, because without the gimmick of the constant memory-lapses, the story itself isn't the sort that would hold you very long.All the acting in this film is quite good, in a soulless '90s way. Pearce seems to have borrowed some voice inflections from `L.A. Confidential' co-star Kevin Spacey. He makes for a good anti-hero in many ways, playing his emotions down rather than up, a good choice that makes him a more compelling cypher. His short-term memory loss doesn't seem to have affected his workout regimen, however, nor his hair-treatment routine. But you shouldn't try penalizing movies for small logic lapses, if the movie makes you think hard enough about it after for you to figure out those lapses.The always superb Joe Pantoliano is especially interesting as Teddy Gammell, a sort of helpful or not character who may or may not be a cop, and knows something about the man who killed Lenny's wife, or else maybe killed her himself. He's amusing, anyway, though not always comprehendible in his motives, either before or after you've seen it a few times. Still, a plus. So is Matrix hottie Carrie-Anne Moss, another possible helper or bad guy. Like Gammell, her character Natalie is no easy read, even after repeat viewings, and much of the fun in watching `Momento' again is trying to guess at what's going on inside her head in a given moment. She should keep the sunglasses on, though. Those cold pale blues of hers give me the creeps.A lot to give away here, and I won't do it, even if the backwards-narrative makes such reticence impossible in reviewing the movie. The film plays off so many angles so well you can't help but admire the ride, or not want to spoil it, however much you may or may not actually enjoy it. Suffice to say it's as clever as everyone tells you, but you may not come away liking the bottom-line story as much as you thought. The mystery is hardly that involving (think ""Law And Order Special Victims Unit"" if you were watching it on drugs), the characters interesting but nobody you'd care enough to light a ciggie for let alone spend time with, and the final resolution as nihilistic as anything outside a Beckett play.""Memory's not perfect,"" Leonard notes. ""It's not even that good."" Especially his, though he still seems able to spring a few traps. If only I cared more about them, or him. Good last line, though, one of the best, right up there with ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" and ""Tomorrow is another day."" (Which isn't far off point, come to think of it.)Yes it's very good. No, it's not great. It's not in my top 200, let alone top 20.

The woman I went with didn't like it either but said she's recommend it so that others can see it and then maybe explain it to her. Great!I liked Guy Pearce in ""Priscilla"" & ""LA Confidential"" and he was good here. Its not his fault.

88,Jonny_Numb,An Engrossing Puzzler,7,18 February 2008,"A lot of filmmakers have gotten their big breaks on the foundation of films that are, upon closer inspection, more stylistic than substantive...and while there's nothing wrong with an overly stylistic film, its accolades can erode with the passage of time, especially if there isn't much under the glossy surface. What's interesting about Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is how its stylistic touches are synthesized within the narrative itself; furthermore, the backwards-flowing narrative also becomes an extension of our protagonist's robotic, detached, and ""system""-oriented way of living. Guy Pearce plays Leonard, an average man who loses his short-term memory after his wife is murdered, and embarks on a quest to catch and kill the guy who did it; he holes up in a fleabag motel, tattoos clues on his body, encounters a downtrodden bartender (Carrie-Anne Moss) and a man claiming to be a cop (Joe Pantoliano), all while flashing back to a extended phone conversation wherein he tells the tale of a man with a similar condition. As played by Pearce, Leonard is like a postmodern vision of the 1940s noir detective, a perceptive Everyman driven to find closure; his performance is properly detached, only randomly showing traces of normality, but Nolan's structure cleverly plays like a visual extension of Leonard's mental processes, putting us in the midst of his search. Moss provides solid support (and sheds her ""Matrix"" persona gracefully) as the noirsih femme fatale, and Pantoliano keeps us guessing as the mysterious ""Teddy."" While many other films have borrowed ""Memento""'s structure since, few have made it feel so justifiably vital to the credibility of the plot overall--to ""start"" at the very end of a story and move backward to the beginning is a daring move, and Nolan is confidently aware of how the preceding events truly gives the conclusion its impact.",Memento
89,aidanratesmovies,Unforgettable,10,2 September 2020,"A clever and well written mystery, Memento is great due to its fantastic performance from Pearce- direction from Nolan, and the mesmerising editing of Dody Dorn. This is a film truly like no other. Not only is it unique, twist-filled, and timeless- but it is also a story told in a way that has never been told before. It's a truly brilliant filmmaking achievement, with Nolan's screenplay and direction truly transcending the medium to become a true work of art. The film can be rather complex, and in result, a bit tough to follow, especially in the first viewing- but given time and focus throughout- Memento is incredibly worth your time and an experience you will never forget. It's greatest flaws are its dullest moments, as its pacing can drag a bit from time to time. However, it makes up for this in the way it tells its tale, as well as the fabulous performances throughout. I love Guy Pearce in this role, and I honestly believe it is the best I have ever seen from him. His performance does not only go unrecognized, but also that of Joe Pantoliano who always shines, and actress Carrie-Anne Moss who is also quite underrated in this film. In the end, Memento shines in a way I never expected it to. It's an original take on a classic mystery tale, and a viewing experience that will not only gain your attention but will make you awe as it begins to unfold.

91,davidmvining,Chris Nolan proves he's worth watching,8,3 February 2021,"This has one of those endings that so completely recast everything that came before it that it actually makes the rest of the movie better. It's easy to see why this blew a lot of minds when it first came out. The finale takes actions from the very beginning and gets the audience to reconsider them in completely new ways, all while keeping the incredibly complex structure clear as the film moves both backwards and forwards to a point in the middle. It really is a bravura performance from a sophomore director looking to make a name for himself in the industry.It is the story of Leonard Shelby, a man who cannot form new memories having been hit in the head during a break in that led to the rape and murder of his wife. He is on a quest to find the man the police say doesn't exist, a second criminal other than the one Leonard shot during the crime. He has a set of clues tattooed on his body, a large police file with missing pages, and a story about Sammy Jankis. Sammy was an accountant who, after an accident, couldn't form new memories when Leonard was an insurance investigator. Leonard turned down the claim, but the memory of Sammy gave him the foundational knowledge of his own condition and how it should be treated, through repetition and routine (explaining how Leonard could know so much about his own condition).The most obvious advantage to the movie's structure is that we enter new circumstances just as new to the situation as Leonard. When we suddenly see Leonard in a chase, we're as confused as him as to whether Leonard is chasing the other man, Dodd, or if Dodd is chasing him. The realizations are often some of the strongest sources of comedy in a largely serious and attention requiring film, but they have the more important task of keeping us firmly in Leonard's shoes. Perspective has always been important to Nolan, and this is probably his flashiest form of that focus. It also has the advantage of being more than a gimmick.There is a surprisingly strong emotional core to this film, and it's not quite what it would obviously seem from the beginning. Leonard has an acquaintance, or maybe he's a friend, or maybe he's some kind of malevolence, named Teddy. He's an undercover cop, or a drug dealer, or a snitch for the police, but he spends most of the movie chasing after Leonard in a friendly manner, helping him clean up his messes and being generally amiable. The movie begins with Leonard shooting Teddy in the head, accusing him of being the man who raped and killed his wife, and goes backwards from there. As we go back, unlearning what we've assumed, we piece together the little bits to realize that Leonard is being manipulated by everyone. The guy who runs the Discount Inn Leonard's staying at is renting him two rooms. Natalie, a woman who works in a bar, tricked Leonard into attacking Dodd. The seemingly big reveal, though, is that Teddy helped Leonard find his wife's killer a year before, but it did nothing to fix Leonard's condition, and Teddy's been using Leonard ever since to attack bad people who match the killer's description ever since.The movie's emotional payoff though is in the interplay between the memory of Sammy and how Leonard, to a degree, comes to accept where he is. Leonard, through his own experiences, has learned that Sammy maybe could have been helped. If he had made the effort to help Sammy, then Sammy's wife wouldn't have gone through the dangerous experiment to test her husband (getting him to inject her repeatedly with insulin over a few minutes) that led to her death and Sammy wouldn't have been left alone in a strange hospital where he doesn't know anything or anyone. Meanwhile, Leonard has the same condition, knows it, and he uses it to exact some justice on the world, taking out a dirty cop.It's an ending far removed from the easier endings Hollywood likes to put out (one of the advantages of an independent production, obviously). Leonard doesn't find his wife's killer. He doesn't get cured. He manipulates his own condition so that he can feel justified days later and without any guilt taking out the man who had been manipulating him for months if not years. It is both clever and satisfying in a strange way. The ending to Memento is one reason why I find the ending to Insomnia to be such a let down.Now, this film isn't perfect. On the first go through Carrie Ann Moss's character of Natalie feels a whole lot more important than she actually is. She's not unimportant, but the time spent with her and Dodd end up feeling like a side quest rather than an essential element of Leonard's journey, a way to help expand the short story written by Jonathan Nolan that inspired the script. She does help illuminate the idea of manipulation and she has a direct connection to the very end of the movie (the beginning?). However, since Leonard's actual story is about his relationship with Teddy, Leonard going off to deal with Natalie's problems because the suit he picked up had her name in the pocket ends up feeling a bit thin.That's my only real complaint about the movie, though, that one of the main early drivers of the idea that Leonard's being manipulated feels a bit too disconnected from Leonard's actual journey. It's minor. Otherwise the movie is pretty great. Trippy while working firmly in a limited budget, holding together a complex idea through complex execution really well. This Nolan fellow, he could be going places.",Memento
92,Spleen,Nothing much to say - I just want to add another voice to the general chorus of praise.,9,20 November 2001,"The year 2000 produced, so far as I can tell, just three flawless gems; this is one of them.  The narrative device is the kind of flashy gimmick writers dream about being able to use properly: the story is divided into lots and lots of very very small chapters - each chapter connecting directly to the next - and we are given these chapters backwards, last to first.  (Yes, I know it's not as classically simple as that - there's also the black-and-white footage.  But this serves the function of expository narrative; it isn't a chapter in its own right.)  It's amazing that EVERY SINGLE ONE of the umpteen transitions back in time works dramatically, and that the story makes far more sense this way, and is easier to follow, than it would told chronologically.  So perfectly cast is the narrative that it's impossible to tell which idea came first, the technical challenge of telling the story backwards, or the exceedingly clever story that justifies this conceit.We open watching a killing in an abandoned building and the puzzle is how we got there.  That's ALL the puzzle is.  The film won't even tell us, until the end (beginning) whether this is a whodunnit, a Thorndyke-like police procedural, a gestalt-shift exercise, or something else.  The protagonist, who has no long-term memory, is precisely as lost as we are; the only thread that feels secure to him when he tugs on it is the knowledge that he's out to avenge the death of his wife - and he seeks revenge mainly because he's left himself little notes he's left for telling him to.  So good to see a Hollywood movie willing to make fun of the very idea of revenge, although this is a minor virtue of a very rich work.",Memento

96,eric262003,A Favorite Of Mine,9,30 November 2009,"For the first time in nearly nine years since its release, ""I had the opportunity to watch Christopher Nolan's authentic masterpiece, ""Memento"", which to this date holds a special place in my heart. Guy Pearce throws himself into his part as Leonard Shelby, a man who has suffered from a short-term memory loss. Shelby can reminisce the past, but his amnesia forces him to not recall any recent memories.Shelby depends on tattoos to keep him on track of things and may lead up to finding his wife's killer and the person who's responsible for his memory loss. Shelby also sports photographs of people, his motel and his car as a way to potentially retrace his memory. As I mentioned before, this movie was excellent and the man behind it all is the British born director Christopher Nolan who should have bagged in some awards along the way. What's original about this movie is that the film's events are reversed. Nolan's intentions are to trace a scene from the past, which are featured in black and white. After the scene closes, the present scenes return in colour. The following scene will conclude the way the previous scene concludes. It's hard to explain, you just have to see it for yourselves to get the idea. Other strong notables in this movie are Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano who turn in equally compelling performances. The twists delivered by Nolan are out to make you go bonkers, but as the film progresses, the journey into the past will lead you to incredible discoveries revealed. Shelby's memory loss is so bad he would be the type of person to befriend a man who may have pick-pocketed him. Then after a while, he'll forget that he was pick-pocketed only if he writes it down to remember what just happened. The black and white sequences are placed to turn back the clocks to past events that lead up to the story. It's not all entirely serious though, there are some funny moments like when Shelby meets Teddy (Pantoliano) frequently and he ventures out to find people who may know him and his mental condition even though he knows what his state of mind is already. When watching the movie, we gradually grow on Shelby and realize that this man lives on repeated events that continually linger on in his mind. Everyday he thinks his wife's death was just recent. I know it's sad to see a person live a life like that, but the character study is very involving and we all hope for a miracle and that we hope he can get his full memory back. It's a bit odd that the events are told backwards, but it was still executed to perfection and succeeds to keep the audience motivated. Overall it was a crowd-pleasing success and the twists are handled subliminally. The reversed scenes were brilliant and original and the characters are a pleasure to watch. The direction by Christopher Nolan was both crisp and immaculate with an unorthodox method to his madness.",Memento

Now Leonard goes about life trying to catch the one who destroyed his life. He tattoos his body with clues as to who this man is and relies on pictures and his handwriting to help him remember certain things.In Christopher Nolan's film, Memento, he brilliantly constructs a murder mystery that leaves the viewer in the dark as to what really happened. Nolan structures the film in such a way that makes us feel exactly like the lead character, Leonard. The film doesn't follow any normal structure, because it begins with the ending, then ends with the stories beginning. The viewer has no idea what has happened prior to what we are being shown, much like Leonard who has short-term memory loss.Nolan uses black and white as transitional scenes between the structure of going backwards. These are breaks in the story line and act as a narration to give the viewer more insight into Leonard's condition. These scenes in black and white actually take place before the film and in the film's conclusion these scenes connect with the rest of the film. The viewer much like Leonard again must connect pieces of the story to come to a conclusion as to what has happened, but in the end the answer is ambiguous and we are told to make our own conclusion as to what happened.Leonard will never remember himself killing John G. He will always go on trying to find his killer even though he has most likely already killed him. There are no ""good"" characters in this film, since everyone Leonard meets ends up using him for their benefit. Teddy uses him to kill a drug dealer, Natalie uses him to get vengeance on Teddy, and even the hotel receptionist fools Leonard by checking him into two separate rooms. The film takes more then one view to comprehend what happens and it takes a great filmmaker to be able to make people talk about something years later. Nolan has manages to become an auteur with Memento, not only being the vision behind it but the creator all together.Joe Pantoliano, who has a knack for playing evil roles, sets himself apart here and really shines. Where Pearce is most of the times flat Pantoliano brings life and comedy into the film. His Matrix co-star Carrie Ann Moss also brings a certain charm here; in her own little evil way.Everyone should watch this film at least once, trust me, you'll need more then one viewing to know what's going on.

99,brando647,Great Mystery with a Unique Style,7,23 December 2007,"Christopher Nolan has created a classic, and very unique, thriller. Based on the short story written by Nolan's brother, the movie follows Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man on the hunt for the person responsible for the rape and murder of his wife. The catch: Leonard suffers from anterograde amnesia, he is unable to create new memories. So to keep track of his investigation, he must take notes and pictures; in some cases, actually tattooing the facts onto his body. During his hunt, he must learn to distinguish between those who aim to help him, and those who aim to use him.As you probably know, the real interesting aspect of this movie is that its events are told in reverse. The movie begins at the end of the story and works its way to the start. In doing this, Nolan keeps the audience in the same state as Leonard himself. Just as Leonard has no recollection of how he came to be where he is, neither does the person watching the movie. In editing the movie in this way, Nolan helps the audience sympathize with Leonard's situation and his constant confusion. Of course, this style is definitely not for everyone. In fact, a good chunk of the people I've shown this movie to can't stand it for that very reason. They become too confused and can't follow the story, so they give up and walk away. Oh well, in my opinion, it's their loss. I personally thought it made the movie that much better, almost placing the viewer in Leonard's scenario. And despite the fact the movie starts at the end, there are still a couple twists the audience may not see coming.The story, while seemingly a simple concept, is fantastic (and definitely complex). The characters are shady and you never know who to trust. Joe Pantoliano plays Teddy, a cop who has been helping Leonard in his search, and Carrie-Anne Moss plays a waitress who agrees to help Leonard but may have a deeper connection to the situation. Without knowledge of prior events, like the protagonist, the audience is left suspicious of everyone Leonard encounters.Despite the many haters of this film out there, I think everyone should give this movie a chance.

As the sequence plays backwards the photo reverts to its undeveloped state, entering the camera before the man is shot in the head. This is followed by sequences of black and white chronologically and color reverse- chronologically interspersed.The black-and-white sequences begin with Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) in a motel room speaking to an unnamed telephone caller who is not shown on- screen. Leonard has anterograde amnesia and is unable to store recent memories, the result of an attack by two men. Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife (Jorja Fox), but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker's name is John or James, with a last name starting with G. Leonard conducts his own investigation using a system of notes, Polaroids, and tattoos. As an insurance investigator, Leonard recalls one Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), also diagnosed with the same condition. Sammy's diabetic wife (Harriet Sansom Harris), who was not sure if his condition was genuine, repeatedly requested insulin injections to try to get him to break his act. He overdosed her, falling into a coma and dying as a result.The color sequences are shown reverse-chronologically. In the story's chronology, Leonard gets a tattoo, based on self-directed instructions, of John G's license plate. Finding a note in his clothes, he meets Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), a bartender who resents Leonard as he wears the clothes and drives the car of her boyfriend, Jimmy. After understanding his condition, she uses it to get Leonard to drive a man named Dodd (Callum Keith Rennie) out of town and offers to run the license plate to help his investigation. Meanwhile, Leonard meets with a contact, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). Teddy helps with Dodd, but warns him about Natalie; Leonard finds a photo written to not trust him, however.

104,DeeNine-2,Brilliant,10,18 February 2002,"Looking at the premise of this movie, I recall that it can really happen. Neurologist Oliver Sacks, in his wonderful book, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986), recounts the story of a man who could only hold the memory of the last thirty seconds or so. Leonard's condition in this movie is better. Apparently he can hold in his mind what has happened over the last few minutes. Also he has the ability to follow a kind of learned routine in which he is able to function by continually writing himself notes. In the case recalled by Dr. Sacks, the man could not do that. He could not even remember enough to finish a short conversation.The idea of taking notes to ""remember"" is something that some Alzheimer's patients are able to do in the early stages of the disease (which may be where Jonathan Nolan got the idea for his short story on which the film is based.) Sacks recalls such a case in his An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales (1995). The notes act as the man's memory, just as the notes and photos do for Leonard in this movie.The next question might be, could someone with Leonard's ""condition"" actually function well enough to get by without being institutionalized or having somebody take care of him on a minute to minute basis? Leonard says, ""Habit and routine...conditioning make my life possible."" He ""remembers"" to look in his jacket pocket to see where he is living. Presumably he also does this when he is in his car and has forgotten where he is going and doesn't know where he is. Presumably he has many notes that we don't see him refer to. How does he find his way back to his car after going somewhere? He identifies his car from a photo, but where is it parked? In the scene where he wakes up next to Natalie, he gets up and goes to his jacket and finds her picture so he knows who she is. He also finds a picture of her and Dodd. He somehow ""remembers"" the significance and writes on the back of her photo, ""...she lost someone too. She will help you out of pity."" How does he remember these things? Perhaps they are examples of ""implicit learning"" that ""Sammy"" was not able to accomplish, what Leonard calls ""conditioning."" In implicit learning as opposed to ""explicit,"" we learn to do something without knowing we learned it.Regardless of these questions, this is a brilliantly conceived and plotted thriller, and the acting by the three principals is superb. Guy Pearce, plays Leonard in a most immediate and affecting manner so that we are forced us to identify with him and his predicament. Carrie-Anne Moss is mesmerizing with her sexy, mysterious eyes as the hard-edged and haunting Natalie. Joe Pantoliano is first rate as Teddy, the wisecracking, cynical and rather annoying undercover cop.But what really makes this a stunning movie is the way it is constructed. The scenes are presented in reverse chronological order, so that we know the latest action first, and at the end of the movie find out the earlier action. This seems an extraordinary way to tell a story, but it works. Incidentally, there's a Seinfeld episode told this way, the one where they go to India for a wedding; and to some extent this technique was employed in Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992). What makes it particularly effective here is the material. Leonard, as Teddy points out, is not the same person he was before his wife's death and his injury. For him the arrow of time has lost its meaning. Earlier events are just the same as later ones. Director Christopher Nolan (Jonathan's brother), who also wrote the screenplay, was able to dovetail the action scene by scene as we move backward in time so that what seems true in the beginning becomes different than what is true in the end. And indeed, like Leonard, our experience of the story doesn't depend on time's arrow.Viewing this the second time (and you may feel a compulsion to do just that) some of the lines that were not funny initially become very funny. The voice-over in the chase scene with Dodd is an example. Leonard finds himself running and he says, ""So what am I doing?...I'm chasing him....No, he's chasing me!"" Or when Teddy asks about the gun, Leonard says, ""Must be his. I don't think they'd let somebody like me carry a gun."" Or Teddy's line to Leonard, ""I've had more rewarding friendships than this--but I get to keep telling the same jokes.""The key to the powerful psychological ""ending"" of the film, where we realize what will eventually happen, occurs when Natalie tells Leonard that revenge is useless because he won't remember it. He replies, ""It doesn't matter whether I remember or not...."" Indeed we see that he really doesn't remember his revenge and that implies that he will... But you really need to see the movie to appreciate the stunning implication.On another level this is a movie about what makes us human. What would life be like if we lived in an eternal present without reference to the past? We could be easily exploited by those with knowledge of the past, as Leonard is, but there is a deeper question being asked. Does life have any real meaning for a person without memory?(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

105,sme_no_densetsu,Memorable for its audacity,8,9 March 2014,"Back in 2000, Christopher Nolan's name meant little to the average moviegoer. Long before blockbusters like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception"", Nolan made his first big splash with an independent feature by the name of ""Memento"". Its inventive storytelling techniques breathed new life into the mystery genre, particularly the tired trope of a character suffering from amnesia.In Nolan's film, the protagonist, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), is sort of an amnesiac in reverse. Injured while preventing a robbery that left his wife dead, Leonard's short-term memory has been seriously impaired but his long-term memory is intact. Intent on revenge, he must deal with this considerable handicap while hunting down his wife's murderer.The twist on the oft-used amnesia theme is only the beginning of the film's inventiveness, though. The narrative structure audaciously puts the viewer in the shoes of the protagonist by alternating between scenes proceeding both backward and forward in time. The forward-progressing scenes are mostly expository in nature while the backward-progressing scenes are more plot-oriented. The trick is that as the plot unfolds (in reverse) we're no more aware of the preceding events than the protagonist. While somewhat disorienting at first (which is partly the point), before long piecing together the mystery becomes second nature.The cast is uniformly capable but I don't know if I'd necessarily single anyone out. Guy Pearce perhaps deserves the most credit for convincingly playing Leonard, which is easily the most challenging part in the picture.As far as the film's technical aspects go, I feel that they are also ably handled but not truly exceptional on their own. I find it unsurprising that the film's two Oscar nominations came for editing and original screenplay since these are the two elements most responsible for the film's uniqueness.Regardless of the film's perceived strengths, I can say for certain that ""Memento"" isn't for everyone. You definitely need to pay attention in order to make sense of the plot and, even then, you may find the narrative structure a little too disorienting. Add to that the fact that the ending is subject to interpretation and you have elements that some viewers are liable to regard in an unfavourable light. Thus, those who count on a linear narrative with a pat resolution should avoid this movie at all costs but for anyone else it ought to provide a unique viewing experience. Personally, I think that Nolan and company did a remarkable job of delivering on this ambitious concept, particularly given the low budget.",Memento

He had such potential, but never was able to recover after starring in this film. I would or wouldn't have liked to see him in more movies. But the movie bases itself on him and his star power, coolness and good looks. And then goes into so much more.Memento is a crazy film. It's about a scrambled film about a man who cannot remember things for more than an hour at a time. And he's hunting down the man that killed his wife. I don't really remember how it went, but the twist was that he accidentally killed his own wife or something. Which makes the movie pointless because he's just out there basically doing nothing. There's no mystery to solve, and yet he's just causing mayhem.It's a really funny concept actually. The end of the film gave me a feeling that we all sometimes do pointless things to entertain ourselves and keep us happy. It's different for everyone. Some like to work long hours, others take up painting, some like adventure. It's just wasting time in whatever way we want. It's life.The movie is told in a deranged way, where there really is no timeline. It's told from the ending to the beginning, but not really. There are flashbacks. And that's really the genius of the movie. I got bored in my third viewing. It's special, but not too special. Sort of like the main actor.8 stars",Memento
107,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,This is the film that gave us Chris Nolan in full artistic capacity.,10,23 September 2015,"Memento is the kind of indie film which you wouldn't think could have appeal to a general audience, but surprisingly this one does, and film-goers are still discovering its brilliance today. In light of Christopher Nolan breaking onto the Hollywood scene with The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception and last year's Interstellar, Memento still holds its own ground very firmly and still has strong footing.How can this film be separated from Nolan's other films? For one thing this is a post-modernist neo-noir movie, and quite the psychological kind, which is made all the more watchable by Guy Pearce's performance as Leonard Shelby, a man out to avenge his wife's death. It sounds simple, but the plot spools into a really complicated case of mystery, secrecy and femme-fatale seduction.Memento is the film that showed the world Chris Nolan is a man who visually questions things in life, and in the most subtle yet cinematically clear scope which speaks truly of ourselves, and our condition. This film is no exception to that exploration.Christopher Nolan is one of the cinema greats of our time, and this was the beginning of his career in the American film industry, and making history.",Memento
108,oneguyrambling,Nolan hits another out of the park - a gem.,8,6 November 2010,"Movie promoters nowadays go one of two ways, they either want to remind you of other popular (usually better) films or attempt to convince you to see their film by saying it is different to anything else that you've ever seen.Option one often starts with ""by the guy who made Jingle All The Way"", or some similar crap, and ends with an even worse film.Option two is even more criminally overused, The Mighty Ducks 3 all of a sudden is sold as a revolutionary change in filmmaking and anything with even one differentiating concept or idea is ""ferociously original"". Take Dead Snow for example, the movie is a cookie cutter shoulda been straight to DVD mediocre 80 minutes, but got a cinema release for one reason, ""Nazi zombies"".Not much is fresh and truly new in Hollywood anymore...Looking at the DVD cover for Memento I was surprised to see that none of those adjectives were used, as this is one movie made in the last decade where it is justifiable. The movie could have been made in a more traditional way, with some judicious flashbacks or the omission of select details until the end to preserve the twists.The route Christopher Nolan took though makes Memento one of the better films of the millennium so far, not that there has been a huge amount of competition to this point. Guy Pearce is Leonard, the central figure in the film and the focal point of every scene.It's a pretty big ask to expect one guy to carry almost 2 hours of cinema but Pearce - terrible hair and all - manages to carry it off. Pearce also handles the narration, but rather than just tell you what's going on he mumbles to himself almost under his breath, and pauses and backtracks at time like he's developing a script to be formally presented at a later stage.Leonard experiences a real version of Groundhog Day, waking up each morning with no recollection of any events since a particularly stressful event that of the murder of his wife. There were many ways that this could have been played, but Christopher Nolan threw every ""standard"" method aside and sets the film out back to front, so the very first scene that we witness is the ""final"" scene in the film, and every scene prior is a reverse explanation of the plot.So as mentioned in the opening minutes Leonard kills an acquaintance named Teddy for his wife's murder, with again the remainder of the film explaining the preceding events back to the very origin of Leonard's decision.Confused? At times you will be, but if you pay attention you'll soon twig and learn how to follow events, and it all makes perfect sense eventually.So while these events are being told in reverse, a few minutes at a time, with the start of each scene being blended into the final seconds of the previous one, there is a another plot line moving forward (kooky huh?) which loosely explains a similar situation to Leonard's. In a former life Leonard was an insurance investigator, the guy who investigates large claims to ensure that they are not false or fabricated, his very first case involved a claimant named Sammy, whose condition was remarkably similar to that of Leonard's.So while Leonard's storyline unfolds in reverse, it is intercut with a relatively simple, yet parallel story which helps explain what Leonard goes through each day. Leonard retains his sanity through repetition and routine, he is unable to make new memories so periodically his mind resets to the previous default, and his recent experiences and conversations vanish permanently. Handy if you're a disgraced politician standing before the jury, annoying if you're a guy trying vainly to solve the murder of your wife.To remedy this situation Leonard writes down important information and takes photos of prominent people and places in his life on polaroid, where he also jots down their name and significance to Leonard. For reeeealllly important information Leonard gets phrases and key points actually tattooed on his body. The amusing thing is that each morning, after he wakes up and looks for signs as to where he is, Leonard rediscovers the tattoos and repieces together the events and goals of his life.Every day.So we know that Leonard kills Teddy in the end at the start, but why we don't find out until the very end at the start. Got me? But rest assured this isn't a flick that rests upon one clever gimmick. It is understated, intelligent and favours a solid story over glitz. The acting is strong and though you have to follow the story a little more carefully than say Hannah Montana, it is far more rewarding when you eventually piece together the fragments and realise exactly what lead to Teddy's demise.I recently had a late night semi-drunken convo (I was drunk, the other guy wasn't), where the topic of movies came up. We went through various classics and my mate wondered aloud why I felt the need to buy DVDs rather than just rent them or catch them when they are on TV. I thought about it for a minute, and eventually explained that films like Memento though simply require the type of acknowledgment that I feel can only be given by shilling out to pay for the product.This is worth your money - buy it.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. One of the better films of this decade to this stage, made all the more enjoyable with the deft direction.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",Memento
109,Maciste_Brother,Haunting narrative structure! Nothing more.,6,22 February 2002,"Memento is fairly ordinary. Nothing earth-shattering about it. The slight story boils down to a man being manipulated left and right because of his disability: short-term memory loss. The tattoo idea is hard to swallow and there's a big storyline goof in the film: during the B&W scenes, when Guy Pearce relates the story about a another couple, with the husband suffering from short term memory lost, I thought, ""Now, what are the chances of having two men suffering from STML in one movie?"" I thought about this during the first part of the movie and pretty much figured out that what was going to happen in the remainder of the film. Memento only has three main characters. So seeing the old couple in the B&W flashbacks dramatically reinforced the fact that few real people populated the landscape. And with the main character acting from a disability and revenge (when the main character of a story seeks revenge, it's always misguided revenge) the other two characters (natalie and the cop) manipulating Guy, well, there aren't that many likeable people around to care for. All of this could have been saved if the performances had been great but alas they're simply okay. Nothing spectacular.There's very little emotional core to this movie, no gravity. The scenes occurred one right after the other, with none of them being more memorable than the next. Memento has a seamless blandness to it when riveting scenes and stylized action was in order. Hitchcock would have done so much more with this story: likeable or interesting characters, for starters. And loads of stylized filmmaking this film was in desperate need of.But if there's one aspect where Memento succeeds is how it lingers in the mind. Its ultimate creation is that of a totally distorted world, and in the end, seems to be what the director wanted to achieve. You might not enjoy Memento while watching it. You might even find it trite and convoluted. But like its main character, you'll be left with fragments of images and distorted time frame weeks after you've seen it. Memento is much better when one thinks about it afterwards than while watching it.",Memento

Memento is an awesome film that you may have to see twice to understand, but I didn't. I'll tell you this... If I had the condition that Leonard(Guy Pearce) has, I would commit suicide. If I had the condition that Wolverine has, I would commit suicide. Memento, behind The Dark Knight and The Prestige, Memento is Christopher Nolan's best film. Nolan goes all out on his films, trying to make them as unique as possible, and blowing us away in the end. The Prestige and Memento both have incredibly surprising twists in the end. Memento is such a fantastic film and was my favorite film of 2000. The Prestige was my favorite film of 2006. The Dark Knight is my favorite film ever. So it's official...

111,RNMorton,This movie's upside down !,10,8 December 2005,"Does your memory play tricks on you? Leonard's problem is a little bigger. Struck on the head during the murder of his wife, Leonard can't (as he says) ""make new memories"" - that is, he has no short term memory after his injury. Through the use of notes and tattoos Leonard, a former insurance investigator, tries to solve his wife's murder. Problem is that his investigation restarts every 20 minutes or so, which can leave him subject to manipulation by others with their own agenda. And to make things even more interesting the movie is shown backwards from the most recent event to most remote. Pearce and Pantoliano are both excellent in the leads. The problem with these trick movies typically (I'm excepting Pulp Fiction but including movies like Wild Things) is that the story-telling is somehow dishonest. Here that doesn't seem true, as much as possible they fairly accommodate the viewer within their considerable constraints. I have a different problem - I'm not willing to accept that perception is reality, and I'm not Leonard (who would have forgotten most of this movie by the end anyway), so when I've invested a couple hours I want to have some idea of what really happened (like, is Leonard's wife really dead?).

114,TheUnknown837-1,It's no wonder why Christopher Nolan has become one of the more widely-discussed filmmakers of the twenty-first century,7,22 December 2011,"Two hobbies that I enjoy above most others are going to the movies and puzzles. As long as the latter isn't more tricky and complicated than it really needs to be, and focuses on a point where an average person can ponder over it and figure it out without losing the enjoyment of solving a problem, I am always looking forward to a good brain-teaser. So, as you can imagine, I was very eagerly looking forward to ""Memento"" one of the early films of the much-lauded Christopher Nolan, whom I also have great admiration for. Now ""Memento"" could be considered more of an avant-garde narrative puzzle than a groundbreaking film and it probably works better on a first viewing than a second, but it had me enveloped from the word go.Director Nolan and his brother, co-screenwriter Jon Nolan, took the conventional narrative movement and essentially played it in reverse. The movie's timeline starts at the end, with an amnesiac (Guy Pearce) murdering another man (Joe Pantoliano) and then photographing his handiwork. May not seem all that extraordinary or new, except that it's played in reverse, so the Polaroid we see in extreme close-up goes from developed to black and the blood on the walls runs upwards instead of down. From there, the picture plays its narrative backwards in section, with black-and-white prologues and epilogues, if you will, providing the groundwork for what will come in between.The story is that Mr. Pearce is an amnesiac for anything that happened in the past few minutes. Yet he's on a mission to murder the man who raped and killed his wife. Could it be the fellow from the beginning? How would a man with this condition maintain such a task without being conned, used, or targeting the wrong guy? Well, that is one of the great things about ""Memento."" The imaginative if non-plausible information that it supplies in suggesting how a person with this handicap could accomplish (or try to, at least) something of this nature. For instance, Mr. Pearce photographs his current residencies (motels, usually) and the people he's helping or help, and jots down notes. They're notes for the audience as well as him, and that's another thing that makes this so much fun: audience involvement. It's up to us to help solve the mystery as well.Played in a regular narrative-form, ""Memento"" might have been a neo-noir. To some extent, it might still be, with its elements of a misguided, vulnerable man, a femme fatale (or is she?), and a mission to murder. But overall, it's more or less a film of its own kind. One of the best things about Christopher Nolan the director as well as the storyteller is that he's like Stanley Kubrick in this regard: he's self-defined. He makes his movies in a way that is distinctly his own and unlike others, probably part of the reason why he's admired by some and absolutely despised by others. He's got an aggressive style that is mostly foolproof (although I would prefer he learns to frame action in wider shots and ease up on the quick cuts) and very engaging. It's always fun to see something new, and so his radically unique style is perfectly matched to this radically unique form of storytelling.The picture is like your favorite jigsaw puzzle, if that's your thing. It's most exciting the first time around and still plenty enjoyable once you've done it a few times and gotten a pretty good handle on which pieces go where and when. It is also very well-acted, with an especially good performance from Joe Pantoliano as the murdered man, who turns out to have played a big part in the amnesiac man's life before. As the amnesiac, Mr. Pearce does a phenomenal job acknowledging one fact and then seeming to forget it a minute later. A picture like this requires a star who can work well with the audience and he succeeds on all levels. Carrie-Anne Moss, as a woman who might not (or just might) be helping Mr. Pearce along is in good form as well, providing flesh and blood to a fascinating supporting character.It's no wonder why Christopher Nolan has become one of the more widely-discussed filmmakers of the twenty-first century. Again, to compare him to Kubrick, he's self-defined and engaging in his own unique way. But it's more than unique that makes his films, ""Memento"" included such a treat. It's the way he engages the audience. Granted, his style is not for everyone. Folks who dislike puzzles and mind tricks, beware.",Memento

You look at your surroundings, and it appears as if you are supposed to be there. You see the room keys. You see your personal items. You see car keys. It looks like you checked in, but you do not remember doing so. And you see pictures and notes that appear to have been created by you, but you have no memory of the moment of their creation. You only have a vague sense that you did them. This is the dilemma of Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce in maybe the role of his career. Leonard's problem is simple but makes his life more complicated than most people could ever comprehend. He has lost his short-term memory capabilities. Every subsequent situation in his life seems born anew as if nothing came before it.Each scene is presented in a way that allows the viewer to experience, more or less, this dilemma. Shelby sees people, buildings, and cars, but is not sure how they relate to him. And he uses little mementos, photographs and notes, to remind him not only who they are but how they relate to him, hence the title. What others might use to simply enhance their existing memory, like photos, Shelby uses to function. And he's trying to solve a mystery: to find the murderer of his wife.A highly original and surreal film that lacks comparison. There is simply no film quite like it. For those who believe that Hitchcock's work is the pinnacle of suspense, you haven't seen the potential of the genre until you've experienced ""Memento"". And it all works largely because of the tour-de-force performance by Guy Pearce, the equally superb acting by the supporting cast, and the incredible writing and directing of Christopher Nolan, based on a short story by his brother Jonathan Nolan. The film also forces you to learn how to watch it as the story is not told in a traditional linear style. But I'll keep the door shut on that as you'll have to be the one to open it. And please do.

119,hall895,Perfection,10,2 May 2010,"This is why you watch movies. You watch hundreds upon hundreds of movies hoping to someday find a gem like Memento. This is, quite simply, the perfect movie.The less said about the plot the better. Best to let you try to put this movie's puzzle together yourself. And what an ingeniously crafted puzzle it is. Anyone who saw this movie upon its initial release knew writer/director Christopher Nolan was a filmmaker destined to do great things. And we all know how that's turned out. Along with his brother Jonathan, writer of the original short story upon which the screenplay is based, Christopher Nolan here has crafted a story which seems impossibly complex but which is actually rather simple. It is the manner in which Nolan chooses to allow that simple story to unfold which is the genius of the film. The story is so engaging and so brilliantly put together that when the movie ends you desperately want to see it again. Immediately. You can't pay a movie any higher compliment than that.Memento centers around the character of Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce in what is an absolutely stunning performance. Leonard is out for revenge, hunting down the man who murdered his wife. But Leonard's investigation is hampered, to say the least, by the injury he sustained on the night his wife was attacked. He has no short-term memory. He remembers everything up to the attack. But he can't make new memories. Everything fades away. If he meets someone he won't remember them minutes later. And Christopher Nolan ingeniously puts us right inside Leonard's head. How? By telling the story backwards. We begin at the end and work our way towards the beginning. So as we see events unfold we, like Leonard, do not know what has happened beforehand. The effect is downright brilliant. Leonard will be helped by two people in his quest for vengeance. First is the mysterious Teddy, played by Joe Pantoliano. Who is this guy and why is he helping Leonard? Because the movie begins at the end we know right away something is not right about Teddy. And you can't wait for the story to unravel itself to find out how we get to that end. Also providing assistance to Leonard is a bartender named Natalie, played by Carrie-Anne Moss. Much like Teddy it seems Natalie has her own motives for helping Leonard. Who is this woman and what exactly is she playing at? Part of the thrill of watching the film is finding the answers to those questions.So there's the plot, a seemingly simple story told in a wonderfully unique way. Needless to say the story is not nearly as simple as it seems. There are so many twists and turns but best to let you discover those for yourself. It really is a perfectly constructed puzzle. Everything has to fit just so, any small mistakes anywhere along the way could have sunk the whole thing. There are no mistakes. It's perfect. There are really only three major roles and they're all performed wonderfully. Pantoliano and Moss are very good but Pearce is truly spectacular. What a challenging role to play and he pulls it off brilliantly. Great actors performing a great story...that's generally the formula for an exceptional film. And that is the case here. Memento was nominated for the Oscar for best screenplay. It lost to Gosford Park. Does anyone even remember Gosford Park? Nobody who sees Memento will ever forget it. This movie will live forever. You'll want to see it again and again and again. It is the perfect movie.",Memento
120,sharky_55,Now..where was I?,9,30 July 2015,"Many critics have expressed the view that the backwards chronological order of the colour sequences of Memento is nothing more than a gimmick, a story-telling device that doesn't align with Leonard's point of view. After all, he certainly doesn't experience events in backwards order, does he? However, this structure is crucial in many ways in Memento presenting its story. The narrative is fundamentally about self deception and betrayal; Leonard sees it from everyone he knows, right down to the inn manager who tries to rent him two rooms and freely admits to it, knowing Leonard won't remember. The structure deliberately denies the audience the same information that Leonard is denied as a result of his condition, and slowly subverts initial expectations and reveals facts as lies, as the motif of memory is constantly discussed. Leonard doesn't trust himself or his memory - he works on instincts and conditioning, and most of all, the little notes and tattoos he carries. The audience, much like Leonard, willfully submits to their truth. Playing Memento chronologically would remove this set-up and all the confusion and suspense that he rightly feels. Tt would remove the emotional payoff and complexity in the scene which foreshadows his darker motivations, where he hires a hooker to arrange a room and wake him up, yearning for one small moment where his wife still might be alive. Dorn edits with precision within these colour segments in order to nod to the backwards order, if the first scene doesn't immediately tell us that, or an alive Teddy right after his death. Key actions and scenarios from the end (and thus beginning) of each scene are neatly stitched together to portray the cause and effect of Leonard's journey and the instructions of his mementos. But the reveal of each character's deception of Lenny (including himself) would not be as effective without the excellent casting. The film comes right after the hugely successful Matrix, where Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano play a trustworthy protagonist and deceptive antagonist respectively. The genius of this is that it subconsciously sets up our expectations for these two characters; we know nothing about them, like Lenny, so we are forced to trust the little notes and clues and their performances. Moss plays a wonderfully exposed and vulnerable character, stumbling into the house with signs of injury...before it is later revealed that it was Lenny who inflicted them as she hurled profanities and insults at him. Teddy is shown to be the villain from the very first scene but later is revealed to be assisting Leonard's quest for revenge. Of course, they aren't too cut and dry. Teddy's corruption and drug deals slides seamlessly into the Natalie's side of the story; he shows manipulative (phone calls) but also caring actions towards Lenny. Natalie, realising that Lenny doesn't remember anything about acquiring her dead boyfriend's car and clothes, sleeps with him. Of course the backwards colour scenes would not have the same effect if they weren't separated and paced by the chronological black and white scenes, which start with the opposite tone. Whereas every colour scene Leonard wakes up with no memory and has to restart his brain and focus on his next move, the B&Ws start with an almost objective sense. Nolan shoots in a documentary-like style, the almost droning voice-over of Lenny feels like reading a script, narrating a story or sound-bites from an interview. Extreme close ups demonstrate disorientation and confusion while the overhead, surveillance camera-like angle focuses the scene objectively. They start with Leonard almost devoid of motivation or outside intrusion, but slowly shift throughout the film, as he begins to question who exactly he is speaking to on the phone and what he is being asked to do. This sets up the culmination of the two levels converging into a very clever shot where the colour emerges just as Leonard shakes the polaroid. There's been plenty of debate on the veracity of Teddy's confession in Memento's climax. Taking it as it is, it's the catalyst for the movie's themes to converge and manifest into the decision of Leonard to start the whole chase for Teddy, which ends with his death at the start of the film. Having being deceived by ever other character himself, he deliberately sets up his own deception and consciously alters the truth. He burns the evidence of the two former John Gs (who knows how many have been erased) and decides on a new John G. Like waking up to his deceased wife's mementos and thinking for a fleeting second that she is alive, Leonard yearns for that same satisfaction in revenge. He conditions himself to believe so - my wife wasn't diabetic, he says, as his memory flickers and the insulin needle is altered to a finger, or the very quick flash of himself in the mental institution instead of Sammy. But that's okay - his memory has covered up those instances. It's a remarkable transition from the sometimes clueless but passionately motivated Lenny that Guy Pearce delivers from the beginning. Memento is tightly wound - it's edits never linger for more than the necessary time in order to orientate its audience for just the tiny amount - it's paramount for us to be as confused as Leonard, even as we slowly unlock the puzzle. Every note, tattoo or fragment of information is then disclosed with much more suspense and revelation than a chronological structure would allow. Each 10 minute memory segment then is able to build and sustain upon the twist ending with haunting implications. How many more Teddys? How many more John Gs?",Memento
121,jhclues,"Talk About ""Living In the Moment""",9,10 June 2001,"This is one unique motion picture; a film noir the likes of which you've never seen before nor are likely to see again any time soon.  Like `Jeopardy,' the TV game show, `Memento,' written and directed by Christopher Nolan, begins by giving you an answer (not to be confused with `the' answer), then lets you try to fill in the question.  The story, told backwards (beginning with the end, the scenes are presented in reverse chronological order) is about a man named Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), who after suffering a traumatic blow to the head during an incident involving his wife (Jorja Fox), can no longer create new memories.  Though he can remember everything up to the time of the incident, his short term memory lasts no longer than fifteen minutes, which renders him somewhat incapable (as you can imagine) of functioning normally.  Which makes his current preoccupation especially difficult-- tracking down the man who did this to him.	Ensconced in a cheap motel while he attempts to sort out his new life, Leonard must rely on Polaroid photographs and quickly scribbled notes to keep himself in the game.  The particularly pertinent information he uncovers he tattoos on himself (a man's initials, a license plate number, whole sentences that remind him what he's after), thereby insuring that no vital piece of the puzzle that is now his life will be lost.  But it's a tricky business, especially when it comes to remembering who he can trust. All he has to go on are his instincts and his notes; and constantly having to deal with people he's just met-- even if it is the same ones, over and over again-- puts him in a perpetually vulnerable position.  He knows there are those who would exploit him because of his condition, so along with everything else, he has to keep his guard up every minute.  How can he know who to trust when everyone he deals with is a stranger?  It's a sticky wicket, to be sure; but he's determined to play out the hand he's been dealt, one way or another.	Pearce gives a solid performance as Leonard, a guy to whom the phrase `living in the moment' takes on a whole new meaning.  He makes Leonard convincing by never overplaying him, and by maintaining a kind of subtly reserved resignation laced with tentative anxiety; traits you would expect of someone in his condition.  And that Pearce can make that critical connection with the audience, making Leonard someone to whom they can relate, is especially important, as this is a real `What would I do in that situation?' kind of film.  	Also very effective is Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, the woman whom Leonard may or may not be able to trust.  Natalie becomes something of a mystery within the mystery, as she comes across as rather enigmatic initially; one of those characters you can't quite figure out, which allows you to identify with Leonard even more, because you know he's trying to decipher her motives, as well.  The same can be said for Teddy, played by Joe Pantoliano, who becomes another constant enigma in Leonard's life.  It's another case of `Who is this guy, really?' and, again, along with Leonard, it keeps you guessing until the end-- which is really the beginning.  But it's that kind of movie; a first rate mystery, from end to beginning (and when you see it, you'll understand).  At any rate, by the time it's over you have a pretty good idea of what fits where.  Natalie, at least, tips her hand at one point; Teddy, though, is a bit tougher to figure out.  And if you don't believe me, just ask Leonard.	The supporting cast includes Mark Boone Junior (Burt), Stephen Tobolowsky (Sammy Jankis), Harriet Sansom Harris (Mrs. Jankis), Callum Keith Rennie (Dodd) and Larry Holden (Jimmy).  This is one of those movies that leaves you asking yourself, `Who could think up something like that?' while at the same time you're saying `Yeah! give me more!'  To say the least, `Memento' is emotionally involving and thoroughly engrossing, and Nolan wisely throws in some humor to give some respite to the constant, underlying tension (at one point Leonard says to Teddy, `Did I ever tell you about Jankis?'  To which Teddy replies, `Only every time I see you.').  Reminiscent of `Jacob's Ladder,' but taken to the `Nth' degree, this is one film that will keep you talking about it-- and debating-- for a long time.  And in another unusual twist, the real irony begins once the film is over, because at that point you're able to identify with Leonard even more-- there's just so much you have to remember to arrive at your final conclusion.  Your best bet?  Watch it again.  That's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",Memento
122,Stampsfightclub,One of the best films ever written,9,24 March 2010,"Leonard (Pearce) suffers from a condition where he can't make new memories and with the help of photographs, tries to recreate the memory of his wife's murderer.After short UK hit Following, Christopher Nolan broke minds with his first major worldwide smash revolving around Guy Pearce's determined investigator and with a backwards storytelling motive and star studded performance, the director had rightfully cemented himself onto the big stage.Opening with a glorious POV of a man holding a photograph of a murdered victim we are enticed into a completely unique psychological thriller revolving ideologies of misguided friendship, paranoia and vengeance that in eventuality is a complete mind warp of a crime thriller.The ideology of backwards story telling allows the British director to engage audiences through numerous possibilities of solutions and explanations. For example as we start to realise which character is which and how their current presence affects Leonard, we realise the deadly truth of what is really happening.Now I have never watched Gosford Park, but how can memento lose in the Oscar writing category to a period drama? Naivety is a quality I possess but a story told backwards with a revolution surrounding a short term memory condition and corrupting it with a fast flowing clue dropping narrative? Well, whatever the awards shelf has, this is by far one of the best plot devices ever devised.Guy Pearce is strong enough to dive deep into his character's mental agony and carries the film's muddled plot on his shoulders, given the character a sharp and jittery edge that was necessary to generate the harsh nature of the mental handicap. Carrie-Anne Moss shines through a multi persona that gives off a great twist. Joe Pantoliano always seems to have a knowledge of access into great films with small roles. The Matrix, Risky Business, The Goonies and The Fugitive and his sharp voice cascades here to with his perfectly portrayed figure of either good or bad in the film's context that has many twists and turns and together with Pearce and Moss, reinstalls a feeling of corruption amongst friends and anonymous faces.Filming in black and white for the flashback sequences are a stroke of genius as the mood and tone feel appropriate to distinguish how Leonard is dealing with the past and his current state of mind, particularly when on the phone.Nolan appropriately uses a feeling of isolation and drama to gain a vibe of paranoia and clue dropping simulation to gain the ultimate film watching experience, collecting fast paced action sequences with dramatic implications that would also appear in his later films and thanks to his brother's terrific novel, makes one of the finest crime thrillers you will ever see, a true marvel.",Memento
123,CharltonBoy,"A Brilliant,unique movie.",10,20 November 2001,Momento is like no other movie i have ever seen or am likely to ever see. This a film that that is fairly easy to describe the outline of the plot but almost impossible to describe the story. Guy Pierce plays an insurance investigator who suffers from short term memory loss after a bash on the head during the murder of his wife. this means that he can't retain any memories for more than 5 minutes although he can remember eveything before the accident. With this affliction he tries to find the killer of his wife to inflict revenge. The way the film plays out is quite brilliant. It has little pattern yet it is so watchable simply because all the time you are trying to work out what it going. It is like the viewer has the same term memory loss as the main character.While it is almost impossible to know where you are in the story it is not irritating in the way some films can be when the story is to complicated. Guy Pierce is superb and pulls this off to perfection.But i think a big congratulation goes to Christopher and Jonathon Nolan for the brilliant direction and writing. 9 out of 10.,Memento
124,gbheron,Whoa!,9,26 May 2003,"""Memento"" is one of the more innovatively crafted movies I've seen. For starters, the story is told in reverse, the final scene of the story shown first, each scene following in reverse order. Therefore while the opening credits unfurl, you know the end result of the story. The remainder of the movie is the 'why' it occurred. This is intriguing in that previously viewed scenes become clearer and more understandable as earlier events are shown. The viewer's point of reference is constantly ping-ponging between the current scene and those he's viewed earlier. And the plot is also very odd. It's basically a revenge story for a savage crime in which the protagonist is injured and suffers a rare form of amnesia. He can remember everything up to the crime, and from that point on, can only remember events that have occurred in the immediate 15 minutes, i.e., he has no long term memory. This makes day-to-day activities very tough, and his solutions for dealing with his infirmary are memorable.If this isn't enough, ""Memento"" is a puzzle-movie in the sprit of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Fight Club"". After all is said and done, the final scenes (actually earliest scenes) obviate most of the assumptions you've collected. Everything is tossed on its head. I had to visit a ""Memento"" web site where the movie is pieced together for the confused viewer. ""Memento"" is a unique movie, a definite one-of-a-kind, and is highly recommended.",Memento

Sure, it's a clever idea to start a murder mystery at the end and work back to the beginning.  However, it's just as well that ""Memento"" did it that way, because the story does NOT stand up to even average scrutiny.  Worse, it is played out in a sluggish manner, the conclusion of which would be obvious about 15 minutes before the denoument, had the film makers not resorted to cheating (Something a genuinely great film such as ""The Sixth Sense"" never did.The always excellent Guy Pierce plays a former insurance investigator who is searching for the men who raped and killed his wife and left him with brain damage, leaving him incapable of creating new memories. This forces Pierce to take some drastic actions (including tatooing his body with important clues) in order to maintain enough coherency to pursue his quest.  He is aided(?) by a waitress (Carrie-Ann) Moss and a mystery man (Joe Palantiano).  As, I said, the story plays itself out in reverse.  That's a pretty easy task, even for a student film maker.  Just edit the story out of sequence.  Big deal!DEFINITE SPOILERS AHEAD1. The film relies on coincidence.  Joe Palantiano's character has the same initials as the rapist. 2. Joe Palantiano is an undercover cop.  Yet, he never tells Pierce after the first killing, even when he knows Pierce could kill him. Certainly, if he is hanging around for the money, he might try looking in the trunk of Pierce's car.  Pierce probably doesn't know it is there. 3. Pierce has false memories which deceive the audience. 4. Dodd, the ""big time"" drug dealer comes alone, even though a HUGE amount of cash is involved.  By the way, just WHERE does a guy with no memory hide a huge stash of cash? 5. Dodd is easily subdued by Pierce. 6. Moss's characters actions are inconsistent.

Writer-Director, Christopher Nolan, creates a world for the audience where we experience the life of his ""hero"", Leonard (Guy Pearce), with more insight than the character himself. Nolan telling the story in a reverse time line (i.e. present to past), his attention to detail, and speculation of the nature of memory make the movie powerful. The movie is truly an amazing viewing experience. Guy Pearce gives a stunning performance as Leonard-- a man who has no short term memory since the murder of his wife, and is seeking vengeance on his wife's murderer. Pearce lends a sense of humanity and sadness to Leonard's quest that is touching. Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie is perfect as the mystery woman who is definitely not what she seems to be-- the classic femme fa tale. Carrie-Anne is a versatile and talented actress. Joe Pantoliano is so effective as ""Teddy"", whom according to Leonard, can not be trusted. Nolan just gives us so much to look at in terms of our own lives... the memories we have and the stories we create for ourselves.",Memento

That it succeeds in not only being comprehensible - thanks to bold, indelible performances - but a resonant musing on identity makes the film even more astounding.

I feel it explains the problem of evil in a way that David Lynch--for all his facility in constructing those clever, creepy little inbred tautologies of evil--could not.  Leonard's plight is our plight; running around creating havoc without meaning to, and for the same reason; because our sphere of perception is crimped.  But there is a silver lining to this dark cloud.  Whereas Leonard will probably never get a resolution to this root problem (will never ""heal""), we can get a resolution to the problem of spiritual blindness; we can ""heal.""  It's a struggle, but one that's worth the effort.  And I encourage all readers who are aware that they're struggling with their spiritual ""Leonardness""--they're cuss'd tendency to forget they ever cared to grow in faith, hope and charity--to continue the fight; think of all the Leonards who don't know they're Leonards.  Keep up that good fight.I found myself explaining the attraction of the film to a friend in the following way:  It doesn't discourage the U.S viewer from engaging on the usual level; you start picking out the white hats and black hats and prepare for the usual, cozy, process of watching your moral expectations achieve fulfillment, albeit with some twists and turns.  A lot of what passes for inventiveness or innovation in movie narrative has its locus in these twists and turns.  But ultimately everything works out, right?  But the disappointment of this standard ""parse"" in Memento is profound, if not downright outrageous.  But I like to think the movie succeeds, in perhaps the same manner as a magician's levitation act.  After the magician knocks out the supports, the ""lovely assistant"" is still floating.  I like to think that what remains ""floating"" in this movie--after the supports have been knocked out--feels just as magical to the viewer as the denouement of the magician's act.  The ultimate moral to this movie has the best set of legs I think I've _ever_ seen; and they're all the more marvelous for the fact that one reads them off the retinal afterimage of the explosion of one's expectations.All this, and the fact that it has to be one of the most simply gorgeous movies I've ever seen.  And the fact that, yeah, one is constantly on the edge of one's seat waiting for the next moment that one's jaw hits the floor.  I don't want to leave you with the impression that the movie doesn't deliver any of the standard ""goods;"" it does, in spades.  It's just that the ""dark"" anti-heroic aspect is more than made up for in an overarching theme with cosmic implications that are inspiring and directly applicable to your own life; a rare thing in film, wot?",Memento

I couldn't believe it when I found I had never seen Memento. Well, a day work off due to an injury gave me the time to rectify this situation.Leonard suffers from short-term memory loss. He can remember meeting you, but only for a few minutes, and then it fades away. He got this condition when he was hit in the head whilst trying to save his wife from the man who raped and murdered her. So, he can remember everything up to that point, but no further. In order to help him he takes photographs of people he meets and places he goes. He annotates these so he can refer back to them. There are also tattoos on his body of things he has decided are too important to lose. He is determined to find the man that murdered his wife and kill him. To this end he is helped by a character called Teddy, who seems to be a bit of a low-life. Along the way he also runs into Natalie, who has also lost someone and is more than she might first seem. Before the murder Leonard was an insurance investigator and he uses his skills to try and track down the mysterious John G, a name he has tattooed on his chest.The story is told backwards; we start with Leonard killing the man he thinks is responsible for everything, and work back from there. It's a very interesting and effective way to tell this story, but you can't really take a bathroom break because you'll lose where the story is. I found the DVD pause facility very useful! Great performances from Guy Pearce as Leonard, also, Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie and Joe Pantoliano as Teddy Gammell. Honourable mentions go to Jorja Fox as Leonard's wife, Stephen Tobolowsky as Sammy Jankis and Harriet Sansom Harris as Mrs. Jankis.Although there are some nice action sequences in the film I found it to be quite slowly paced. It gradually draws the audience into Leonard's world as we find out more about how events transpired. The score is quite subdued and fits the mood of the piece perfectly.

Memento is about Leonard, a man on the hunt for the man who raped and murdered his wife, only he has a pretty big wrench thrown into the whole plan  he has no short-term memory because of injuries he sustained during the attack.  He may talk to someone and then two minutes later still be standing there, but have no idea who he's talking to anymore, so he employs the use of Polaroid pictures, body tattoos with clues, and many notes.  The story is compelling in itself, but the way it is told is fantastically brilliant.  Instead of a regular linear story that has a start and a beginning, Memento is essentially told backwards.  While the obvious thought would be that knowing a film's conclusion five minutes into the film would be anti-climatic, the screenplay and film are so well done that this only makes the film more suspenseful and thought-provoking, and of course, puts the viewer in a similar mental situation as Leonard themselves.There are absolutely not enough good things to say about this film  even the acting is top-notch.  Memento was Nolan's breakthrough film, and it really showcases his incredible talent.  Shortly after seeing Memento, I watched `Following' his debut film, and was not disappointed.  While I haven't yet seen `Insomnia' (which is on my short list to watch in the near future) I'm definitely looking forward to seeing his vision for the next Batman film because I think he is one of the very few filmmakers who could possibly compete with Burton's two installments.

They are not his flashbacks, for he is the protagonist of all of them. But the structure allows the viewer to imagine what it would be like to be him, dealing with a totally fragmented experience caused by brain damage. The result is fast-paced, compelling and more than a bit disturbing. I was glued to the screen for the length of the film, so obviously it was convincing enough in the moment to hold my attention, despite the kaleidoscopic structure.I do have a post-viewing question, which fortunately did not pop up while I was watching, else it might have disrupted the flow: How can the protagonist remember that he has lost the ability to form short-term memories? When he is compared to Sammy, there is a world of difference. Sammy does not know that he cannot form the memories. Lennie, in contrast, is completely fixated on this single idea, which drives his action and motivates everything else that he does.Despite that single quibble, the film is quite thought-provoking and may serve as a cautionary tale, now that brain tech is being developed by DARPA to control soldiers´ minds, making them manipulable in precisely the way the lamentable protagonist of Memento has become.

How can we learn from our experiences if we cannot remember them. What is the purpose of revenge if someone cannot recollect or prosper from it?

How can we be in the same mental status with the main character when he cannot remember anything? Writer/director Christopher Nolan has that answer: he tells the story backwards. We begin at the end and work our way towards the beginning. However, each individual scene plays running forward, often overlapping, providing us with clear, constructive transitions. The main character, Leonard, is confused in prospects of time and experience, and so are we.	Other characters include Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss, from ""The Matrix""), who also lost someone close and can help Leonard, and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano, also from ""The Matrix""), whose identity often shifts mysteriously. Then there is the series of flashbacks of Leonard's experiences while working as an insurance agent. The situation involves an individual named Sammy, who has a memory disorder similar to Leonard's. His diabetic spouse is not sure whether her husband is faking his condition or not. To prove it to herself she arranges a test I dare not reveal. Leonard is more intricately involved in this story than he even believes.  	""Memento"" is smart and imaginative. It doesn't pass up little details of the characters. Leonard is constantly jotting himself notes and taking Polaroid pictures so his life can make some sense. He even gets permanent tattoos all over his body so he does not lose or forget some of the most important information. In a movie like this, it would be almost impossible to make without leaving some information out; even some of the film's actors were confused and requested a script told in sequence order. But these filmmakers have constructed a movie with a plot hole big enough to drive a semi through: If Leonard cannot remember anything after the accident, then how can he remember that he has a memory condition? There are no tattoos or notes to remind him, and whenever he meets someone he explains his condition thoroughly. This is necessary information he reveals, but there are better ways to do so. We could be there when his doctor explains the condition to him, or see his friends talking about it. The sky is the limit in a movie like this. It was not essential to leave such a massive, obvious hole in the plot. ""Memento"" is still a unique mystery thriller. It is a tantalizing experience we do not often come across at the movies. For audiences who like to sit back and relax, this film is a waste of time. It requires us to follow along, participate, fit puzzle pieces together-""Memento"" doesn't provide any easy or obvious answers. All but the most intelligent and thoughtful kids will not be able to follow this film; it is intended for adult audiences. ""Memento"" is one of the year's most challenging movies, not to be missed if you are looking for something clever and original.",Memento
144,anselmdaniel,An examination of mental illness,7,27 June 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Memento is directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Guy Pierce. Guy Pierce plays an investigator called Leonard as he tries to find his wife's killer. Leonard cannot form any new memories as he embarks on this quest. It is this disability that causes Leonard to come into contention with characters that knew him in the past.Memento requires the audience to be patient as the beginning of the movie can appear convoluted. The movie is edited in a way to not play the scenes in chronological order. The movie also interplays flashbacks of Leonard before his condition and of an old insurance case he investigated. The movie wants the audience to stay but it is difficult to continue if they are not interested in the mystery. The mystery is fun to follow and many plot elements that are introduced in the opening scene is followed up by the end of the movie.Memento is not a complicated movie, but it is told in a complicated way. With the backwards narrative to allow the audience to journey through Leonard's condition, the audience can relate to the confusion of Leonard. They can also form an overall narrative for the movie. The audience can judge each of the characters that Leonard interacts with by remembering key details of what he says. Memento is still flowed, but its gimmick of a backwards narrative is still engaging.I would recommend Memento to any mystery thriller fan.Grade: B",Memento
145,the red duchess,Brilliant culmination of a series of anti-detective thrillers.(possible spoilers),9,15 November 2000,"It is refreshing to see a (relatively) mainstream thriller that does not follow the tired old rules, that uses Resnais, rather than Mel Gibson, as a starting point, that substitutes for an inevitable linear plot a temporal time bomb, where the straight line of events is smashed to pieces and put together with seeming haphazardness.  Further, this plot is told completely from one character's point-of-view, a character as we by now know, with short-term memory.  His great boast is that he remembers his identity and memory up until the accident - the denouement suggests that even this is a myth.So what is the plot we're watching?  Has the emotional shock of finally getting revenge had the required, cathartic effect, and that Leonard Shelby is now piecing back the bits of remembered past?  Or is he, in effect, a dead man, if we agree that someone does not exist as an identity without memory, exists in a kind of limbo, and that this dead Leonard is watching his life flashing before (or behind) him?  As all the 'revelations' at the end take place in the narrative's begining, Leonard is denied all the action hero's usual rewards - increased self-knowledge, knowledge of the world and the plot.  He is given the answers at the start of his plot, and forgets them.  Leonard at the end (his beginning) is a more coherent character than at the beginning (his end) - is this just because we've given a mass of (highly dubious) information by then and think we know him and his situation better?  Or is he, as his narrative progresses, getting vaguer, moving towards inertia, the catatonia that finally swamped his altar-ego Sammy Jankis.  Our problem is that the film comprises not one plot, but four, all fragmented, full of gaping black holes, all mediated by this character who knows nothing.  One is Leonard's narrative as he sees it, as he tries to avenge his wife's murder.  The second is told in monochrome flashback (or whatever this is called in a film that runs backward), mostly told in mysterious phone calls, and seem to flesh out the gaps missing in the first plot, but actually creates more. The third is the 'real' plot that may have something to do with cops, snitches, femmes fatales, or may be hallucinated, misremembered by Leonard, or simply planted there as cover for another plot, or may not even exist at all.  The fourth is the story of Sammy, who suffered the same 'condition' as Leonard.All four are obviously connected with each other to create a discordant fugue, but each undermines the other; in a sense, hell is other plots, and Leonard is in hell.  We can only take the opening sequence, where Leonard stands holding a fading photograph over a dead man's bloody body as the only 'reliable' image, and in this 'reliable' image, another, the photograph, is slipping away, ungraspable, like Leonard's memory, like the film.In another sense, though, what this film does is what any detective story does, which is work its way bakwards from the crime to its source.  This is what Dupin, Holmes and Poirot do, followed by legions of TV and movie detectvies.  This film just takes this journey literally.  In a conventional detective story, this travelling into the past is a way of making the present and future safe, of reasserting order, of filling up the gaps.  As Leonard doesn't succeed in reaching the source, and as the audience flounders too, there can be no reassertion of present and future. 
Leonard is the logical conclusion of a long line of anti-detectives, figures who do not solve the crime, who are personally implicated in the investigation, and are eventually destroyed by it.  'Vertigo''s Scottie Ferguson is the most famous example, others include 'The Spider's Strategem', 'Blow-up' and 'The Parallax View'.  These films offer detectives who do not order chaos, who cannot reorder the world, in the way Holmes used to.  Crime, solution and detective get lost in a temporal vacuum, never to be saved.  These abstractions are firmly grounded in 'Memento' in the body and the eye; Guy Pearce's rather splendid physique as palimpsest, where history is recorded at random, where the keys of interpretation are lost.  The split between mind and body is complete, and with it the essence of our unified humanity.  Similarly, with all the Polaroids he takes, the camera may never lie, but, as discrete entities, images are meaningless, in narrative terms anyway.",Memento

The truth is that, when it comes to the crunch, it's actually not really anything that special.Pearce, as the man who has no short term memory after he sustains a brain injury when his wife is raped and murdered, is competent enough, but this film does get really annoying in the way that it loops within the plot in order to get you back to the same point you were at 2 minutes ago -- and then moves onto the next scene.That was really annoying.A lot of this only makes sense in the last scene -- when the Sammy story finally comes to a point -- but by then it's taken an effort to sit through a lot of the rest of the film.Make no mistake, it's not bad, but it's not anything sensational either.",Memento

149,rajdoctor,Memento,3,24 June 2007,"In India, one of the top Bollywood super stars Khan  Amir Khan is making a movie. We hear that he is very choosy, selective and does lots of discussion with the Director of the movie before saying YES. So when he said yes to act in a movie everyone got interested and we knew that he is re-making a Tamil version of a movie called Ghajini in Hindi for national release. While reading the story of Ghajini, I remembered that this story is something I have seen. I thought for a while and realized that during one of my International flights I saw a movie (and felt asleep half way) with same story line. So researching on the web  I found that the story on which Ghajini is made is Memento. That is when I decided to give Memento another shot, determined not to sleep this time during the viewing.The story is about a man Leonard (Guy Pearce) whose wife (Jorja Fox) is killed and due to the fight with the killer Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), Leonard looses his short term memory. Leonard remembers every event till his wife was alive, but after that his memory captures only events for 12 seconds maximum. To remember that he has to take revenge for his wife's murder  he has tattooed all over his body the events and facts, and he keeps taking photographs and writes lots of paper notes to remember what he has to do, where he has go etc. That is the way Leonard takes the revenge and kills his wife's killer.It is a typical revenge story. What makes people interested are two things  the concept of 12 seconds memory thrown in and the story is told backwards by the Director Christopher Nolao; meaning the movie starts with the killing of the murderer, and it goes backwards to the scene when wife was killed. This I think is the unique selling point of the movie.The Director must have really spent a huge amount of time and energy in scripting this unique concept. Why one should say the story backwards is a question I still am not able to figure out. For what purpose and sake  just for experimentation, just to show that yes a story can be told in this fashion too? I suppose YES. Earlier we have seen many movies of the same genre where the episodes are juggled and presented to the audience, and only through the last episode the real mystery is uncovered. But does Director Christopher succeed in this experiment? Yes  in getting audience interested in the concept, and yes in getting nominated for Oscars for best scripts and editing.As I told earlier  during the first viewing I fell asleep, because I could not make head or tail of this movie. My second viewing, I forced myself to see it through the 113 minutes. I saw it. As the movie is presented in reverse, I viewed the movie twice in reverse to get hold of the story better. I must have spent about 250 minutes viewing this movie again and again from all possible ways. My verdict is the movie is badly made because: The director even though experiments with a new concept, but fails to hold interest of the audience. All the actors have acted with stoned faced expressions. The love scenes between Guy Pearce and Carrie Anne Moss (another woman Natalie  who helps him) are too irritating, distracting, clichéd and unnecessary for the flow of the movie. The direction  apart from the reverse presentation is very poor.The biggest flaw is that it thinks that the audience is stupid and fool. I could not understand when this hero is not able to remember anything more than 12 seconds how come he figures out that he has kept the notes and photographs in his pockets? Every time he pulls them out  how his memory works then? The story seems to be said lasting two days in total, during which time  he solves the mystery and kills the murderer. What happened between the accident and that two days? How many days have gone by? I saw the movie backwards too. The precision with which he solves the mystery and leads up to the killer is so simple and like child's play  one thing leading to another. The director says that the police don't believe in the hero analysis and thus have not helped him. The efficiency and confidence with which the hero analyzes and corrects his notes is laughable. How he knows what he wrote earlier was false, just because someone has just said the opposite? Could be the person who just gave him the facts  must be telling lies. No questions asked  just a big gimmick by the Director Christopher  who wants to prove a point that he too can make an intelligent movie.But according to me he has failed miserably. I would like to give this movie a zero rating out of 10 just to bring it out of the number 28 slot on IMDb database, but because of this unique concept and attempt I have to give him (Stars 3 out of 10)",Memento
150,WriterDave,A Perfect Movie to Usher in the New Millennium,10,4 March 2003,"""Memento"" is one of those rare gimmick movies (it's shown backwards, folks!) where the gimmick actually pays off.  Highly astute director Christopher Nolan simultaneously deconstructs the film noir genre while at the same time gives the audience the feeling that they are suffering from the same malady as the protagonist searching for his wife's killer.  The brilliant structure actually gave me short-term memory loss when I first watched it.  When was the last time a movie actually made you feel what it was portraying so acutely?

Although there's no blood / gore, it is too scary for young kids, but besides that: perfect. The acting is great. Guy Pearce is definitely headed for an Academy Award at some point. The cinematography and editing are out-of-this-world fantastic. The story doesn't exactly have ""something to say that changed my life"" (see ""October Sky"", ""Dead Poets' Society"", and ""Contact"") but there are plenty of deep thinking intellectual issues.One caveat: you will need to have your brain 100% alert to get the full impact of the film. For me, I loved that, but if you prefer to relax and just go with the flow you will probably get a little lost.Who should see this film:-- Everybody, it's safe for arty types who don't normally see thrillers-- Everybody, it's safe for action buffs who hate arty dramas.If you normally hate over-intellectual films that make you think too much, but you had to see one in your life, see this one.I'll give ""Memento"" a well-deserved 10 out of 10.",Memento
155,Horror-yo,"Nolan's best, most certainly",9,21 May 2016,"First off, this reviewer thinks Nolan is a massively overrated, so definitely no bias/fanboy-ness here. On its own, this film is superb. It's a good concept, and an even better execution of it. The plot, despite having a very plain core, is actually quite complex and strengthened by strong dialog and other secondary elements, such as the anecdotes for one. All relevant to the plot. Guy Pearce is an excellent actor, however almost too discreet he may always be or difficult to grasp, he puts in just the right performance for this lead role, so very demanding in the field of tight proximity with the audience and raw, realistic acting. So much of the film lays entirely on his shoulders and performance, and it's no coincidence it's such a strong film. The cinematography is deliberately simple, and he is at the center of every scene. The film is straight-to-the-point and there is enough actual story substance that this never feels like it lingers on about the plot or stretches the main concept and rather actively moves forward smoothly. Ultimately, beyond the 'mere' structural strength and unusual chronological format, quality acting and cinematography generally; there is a genuine point, an actual meaning to the story rather than just a (good) story. The twist at the end contributes enormously to the film's strength while maintaining coherence, giving true closure to the story and a sizeable morality; as opposed to soaring out of context as to provide a bigger surprise (which Nolan often does in his films, actually).",Memento
156,asda-man,You won't forget this one!,10,24 February 2012,"I'm quite convinced that Christopher Nolan is not a man at all, but is in fact a movie-making machine. I don't believe that it's humanly possible to make films that are just so insanely clever as ""Inception"" or ""Memento"". Christopher Nolan even manages to make Batman seem clever, and you know how that originally started out. I saw ""Memento"" for the second time yesterday and its incredibly complex writing blew me away if not more so that the first time. I was awe-struck the first time that I watched ""Memento"", not only at the screenplay, but at the directing and acting also.If a film like ""Memento"" had been placed in the hands of any other director then it very easily could've turned into a confused and boring mess. Like, ""Inception"" Christopher Nolan deals with complex ideas that are very rarely seen in the movie world, but he handles them with such careful control and sophistication that they end up being some of the most mind-blowing films ever! Watching ""Memento"" with my parents was an experience in itself. To understand ""Memento"" you need a mind that is prepared to not just watch a film, but to be a part of it. Because ""Memento"" is placed in a backward order, you need to figure out and remember what's happened before a scene and try and piece the mystery together yourself.In hindsight this might seem like just a gimmick. But, ""Memento"" couldn't be told any other way, as it leaves you being confused as much as Leonard. It places you in Leonard's mind so that you don't know what's happened, like Leonard doesn't know. However, to follow the mystery we have to go back to see what has happened and Christopher Nolan uses this to his advantage and is able to create an extremely clever and complex mystery with an ending to die for. However, my parents failed to realise this. They were asking questions like ""why's he still alive, he was shot a minute ago!"" They just didn't get the idea of telling the story backward and the ending just left their mind in a graveyard! Luckily I didn't watch it with them the first time, so the second time was more amusing.Christopher Nolan's directing is also just as brilliant. He manages to place us into the mind of Leonard through excellent uses of narration and also completely gripping black and white sequence which is like a short film in itself. Guy Pearce is also brilliant at playing Leonard, it makes you wonder if he's got the same condition as Leonard! (He doesn't, just for the record.) Chrstopher often places us in the eyes of Leonard and so we suffer the same problems as him. ""Memento"" is like an experience that leaves you mentally exhausted.""Memento"" is one of the best films I have ever seen and is probably in my Top 10 list of the best films I have seen. It's beautifully written and directed and had me completely engrossed from the minute it started. It's also an excellent character piece, with people we can care about. It's thrilling, enthralling and involving. ""Memento"" is the perfect thriller, told in such a way that it's difficult to forget.

157,elicopperman,Confusing and Complicated? Yes. Thought Provoking and Unique? Absolutely.,9,20 December 2017,"Before his days of Batman, Inception and Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan started off making low budget independent neo-noir crime dramas. The one that kickstarted his acclaimed career however is a movie based on a short story from his brother Jonathan called Memento. Praised by critics and audiences upon its release, this movie became so beloved across the world that Nolan himself even got an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay (as well as Best Editing for Dody Dorn), and watching the movie recently, it really holds up as a complex unconventional crime story.The movie focuses on a man with short term memory loss named Leonard. Some criminals made him amnesic by knocking him out, but they also killed his wife which causes Leonard to search endlessly for who they were by using Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track down information he soon forgets. Basic enough narrative, yet the movie is presented in two different ways. One is a conventional series of black-and-white flashbacks where the other is an unconventional series of color sequences shown in reverse chronological order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist), while still completing a cohesive albeit complex narrative. While it can turn off some viewers, the innovative structure is bound to really capture ones interest in the story to see what led to Leonard's conclusion on the person who murdered his wife and ruined his life. The puzzle pieces connect together well and there's never one moment where the viewer is not curious to wonder what's the cause of each individual moment. Thus, the narrative is confusing, but it makes sense because we are living in the mind set of Leonard, and considering how forgetful he is while trying to solve the case, it fits the complicated albeit gripping path Leonard goes through that lets the audience relate and sympathize with him.Along with a story that will constantly have viewers guessing, the characters also keep on track. Even though he is stuck in his own mind, Leonard has no choice since the few decent memories he has left are what lead him to finding the cause of the murderer, thus making him worth rooting for and feel sorry for. You want him to succeed in his task, but you also wish he could just seek the proper help to make him function better in the world. Along with a tightly stellar performance by Guy Pierce, Leonard embodies both the intellectual anti hero and the troublesome victim in his endless search to avenge his late loved one.The rest of the characters are all obstacles for Leonard in his search, whether it be helping him, being supportive from flashbacks, or being straight up offenders. The supporters like Natalie and Teddy are good supporting characters, but they also have their own dilemmas of their own which either shape Leonard or conflict with him. The offenders like Dodd and Jimmy have their tendencies to get rid of Leonard for trying to seek his revenge, but their presence one further brings Leonard to wonder if they killed his wife or not. Add on great performances from Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and Larry Holden and you've got a cast that you won't want to forget about anytime soon.Personally, I think this could be Nolan's best work alongside The Prestige. When you work independently on a low budget, you tend to be more creative and improvisational with your work since you can only work with so much, and Memento is the perfect mesh of a thrilling script that will always keep the viewer guessing and relying more on brisk cinematography and psychological momentum than big budget practical effects and a grim style. Christopher Nolan kept me guessing throughout the feature without going overboard with the story, and he'll keep you guessing the more times you watch it. Check out Memento on Netflix and get ready for a nonstop thrill ride that will cause you to think the whole way through.",Memento

159,doctorsmoothlove,Scientific and psychological thriller. Who knew?,10,8 April 2008,"Perhaps some films are best left misunderstood. It increases the chances that the viewer will wish to watch them multiple times. Memento certainly fits this description. It is as cunning and unpredictable as any thriller I've seen, and it is one of the few films that can accurately claim Hitchcock's legacy. With so few films actually requiring audiences to think, Memento is a wonderful respite for those still concerned with the intellectual appeal of cinema.The film's strongest point is its plot which is both original and endearing. Leonard's investigations occur in color and in reverse chronological order. However, we are first presented with the event occurring in black and white which happens in chronological order. The effects of this plot structuring are exquisite. The film's progression mirrors Leonard's anterograde amnesia. In other words, Nolan tells the film both backwards and forwards simultaneously, thus each depiction of the plot adds believability to the other. Another strong point to the plot is the lack of a new love interest for Leonard. So many would-be-thrillers suffer from the unnecessary relationships which ruin the tension the film attempts to build. Even Hitchcock's films occasionally suffer from this occurrence. I suppose Christopher Nolan deserves even more credit since he wrote the screenplay. Unfortunately, the plot is difficult to follow the first time. Upon future viewings the plot will become clearer and even more satisfying.The other aspects of the film are obviously less pronounced, however, Guy Pearce does a wonderful job portraying Leonard. If the tattoos on his body are not evidence enough, then the realistic facial expressions and his genuine bewilderment is. This is method acting at its finest. Another way his performance is enhanced is the realistic setting design. The audience is not distracted by a fantastical setting which could have been employed. The room is cluttered and untidy as we would think it to be. The hotel manager takes advantage of Leonard's illness and charges him for two rooms, which only further enhances our relation to the movie. One of the definitive reasons that Memento is so entertaining and effective is that Nolan directs a man suffering with an uncommon disease in such as homely way anyone can sympathize with him and understand his plight.While Memento isn't the typical thriller, it breathes fresh air into a genre saturated with repetitive Bourne and Ocean's films. With Memento and The Prestige as successful films (I have not yet seen the later), Warner Brothers made a right decision to hand the Batman franchise to Nolan. I hope that his success will continue to revitalize the Dark Knight, but I doubt he will be able to create as intricate a plot as he did in Memento.",Memento
160,ronakkotian,Wholly original and surprisingly clever!,10,4 October 2020,"Christopher Nolan has made some incredible films in his career, my two favourites being The Dark Knight and Inception. Now, Memento has joined that league.Memento follows Leonard, a man with short-term memory loss, who attempts to find his wife's killer.It's best going into Memento without knowing much about the plot and that's why I've refrained from revealing anything else in my brief summary. This is all I knew before watching and so I'm going to do the same with everyone else. Just knowing this brief plot summary made the experience of watching this film SO MUCH FUN! Seriously, this film took me completely by surprise.What Nolan was able to do with a story like Memento is incredibly clever. The whole narrative structure of this film is what most people will discuss. The film unravels the story in two ways. The colourized scenes play in reverse chronological order and the black and white scenes play the story in forward chronological order. The thing is, this could be done with many movies but it has the MOST purpose in Memento. Knowing that the protagonist suffers from short term memory loss, telling this story through this direction puts us in the shoes of Leonard as we're trying to figure out what happened before. To make a film like this isn't easy but Nolan's excellent screenplay keeps us engaged throughout. Nolan leaves us with many questions as the film plays backwards and it's these questions that keep us guessing and wanting to find out what happened before.If the story wasn't enough, the performances are also terrific. Guy Pearce is absolutely fantastic as Leonard. His way of delivering dialogues, especially the monologues, was excellent. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano also do a great job with their characters.Memento blew my mind. What Christopher Nolan achieved with this film in terms of filmmaking and storytelling is nothing short of astounding. This film just shows how you don't need a large budget to make a good film.

In the movie 'Memento', we get to see how bad it is to suffer from short term memory loss. It also gives us the chance to see how far a patient of such a disease will go to remember what is most important to him. In the vain of 'Pulp Fiction', Memento is a movie that has to be seen to be believed. It is no wonder that this movie is so popular with the movie going public around the world.Leonard Shelby wears expensive, tailored suits, drives a late model Jaguar sedan, but lives in cheap, anonymous motels, paying his way with thick wads of cash. Although he looks like a successful businessman, his only work is the pursuit of vengeance: tracking and punishing the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty of locating his wife's killer is compounded by the fact that Leonard suffers from a rare, untreatable form of 'amnesia'. Although he can recall details of life before his 'accident' Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he is, where he is going, or why.Christopher Nolan has made one great (but confusing) movie. His style in directing and editing 'Memento' is quite unique, as no movie has ever been made quite like it before. The story being told in a backward kind of motion makes the audience have to think hard about what they are watching. It also makes the audience feel for a guy like Leonard, whose condition only gets worse and worse as the movie goes on. I am almost 100% sure that Nolan and his brother Jonathan, made up this story in the realisation that it was meant to be confusing. What is also cleverly done by Nolan is the use of black and white and then colour shots. In my opinion, the variations in these shots are used so it confuses the audience even more.Guy Pearce's role in 'Memento' shows me why he is so successful in Hollywood today. Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man on the hunt for his wife's killer. The only problem is that Shelby is suffering from 'anterior-grade amnesia', a disease that cannot be treated. With 'Lenny', I feel the audience suffers partly the same condition as he does, and partly does not, as we can remember what has happened in the present.Memento's other main stars include corrupt cop 'Teddy' (Joe Pantoliano). A friend said of Pantoliano's performance in Memento, 'he was perfect for the role of 'Teddy', as he comes across as the mysterious bad guy'. I could not agree more. There is also the character of Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who is a lot like Teddy in her own way. What is similar about these characters is the way they use Leonard's condition to advantage their own situations.Other characters include Sammy Jenkis (Stephen Tobolowsky), who is a victim we learn about from an old case when Leonard Shelby was an insurance investigator. There is Leonard's wife, Catherine (C. S. I.'s Jorja Fox) who is another fascinating character. Although we do not hear her say much, she is a vital part of this most confusing story. Add in the funny role of Burt (Mark Boone Jnr.), the motel clerk, who openly admits to Lenny that he is ripping him off, by giving him two rooms, but that he will not remember it happening anyway.Yet in no way do any of the characters in 'Memento' realise they are in a time reversed movie. I am sure that many of the performers would have had to read their scripts many times to understand what was happening from a cinematic point of view. But from an acting prospective, this would have been an easy experience to be part of. Memento also has some interesting devices to tell the story. The way Leonard tries to remember things in the present and the future, via notes tattoos and photographs, making them an important element within the movie. Without them, our hero would not be able to remember anything.Nonetheless, memory is the most vital element in this movie, because without it, people are confused, isolated and abused, which is what happens to our 'hero', Leonard. As Lenny mentions early on in the film, ""Memory's unreliable ... Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good. Ask the police; eyewitness testimony is unreliable ... Memory can change the shape of a room or the colour of a car. It's an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted, and they're irrelevant if you have the facts."" But it has to be ironic that Leonard is the one who narrates 'Memento', when his recollections and memories of events are inaccurate and jaded. There are also some powerful scenes in 'Memento'. The one 'which sticks in my mind the most' has to be where Natalie abuses Leonard, calling his dead wife a 'a', snorting smartly 'that you won't be even able to remember what I have said'.So, if you watch this movie and it confuses you the first or even the second time, I can assure you that is how you are meant to feel, confused. If you hated watching 'Memento' the way Christopher Nolan intended, then I can only recommend that you get a hold of the DVD and watch it in chronological order, as it will really help you. Memento also shows how bad 'mental disease' patients can be abused by healthy people and what lengths sick patients will go to try and keep 'sane'. Also, if a movie makes you think, then in some way it has been successful in doing something that many movies do not do - making you think. Those sorts of cinematic experiences are the ones that we need to cherish for life, as they are few and far between. Memento is one such experience.",Memento

One thing that I kind of felt missing was the ending, I just think we needed to have a clear view on what happened in the first scene of the movie to get some kind of closure.",Memento
164,ruby_fff,It's literally OTNEMEM - check out its official Web site to further your Memento experience,7,12 April 2001,"I usually send in my comments first before I read the other IMDb User Comments. For Memento, pardon the pun, I reversed my practice: I literally read the 100+ comments prior to sending this one in. I have had the same immediate let down feeling towards the way the film ended. Yet I agree with some that it's probably writer-director Christopher Nolan's insight to end it so. I'm glad to know from several user comments that the short-term memory loss situations Lenny and Sammy displayed were clinically authentic. Overall, Memento is this year's filmic experience not to be missed - perhaps NFE (not for everyone), but if you love movies, especially a mind twister, this one is certainly for you.The progression of the film in reverse order did remind me of director David Jones's Harold Pinter's ""Betrayal"" 1983, also begins at the end (of a 7-year affair) and working its way back to the beginning of the affair as the film ends. The editing fete also reminded me of director Stanley Donen's ""Two for the Road"" 1967, which is a must for movie lovers: it's a journey, going back and forth with the two charming leads, Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn as Mark and Joanna in their mid-life marital crises, where sequence of events is presented in fast forward and rewind modes - a unique film experience.German writer-director Tom Tykwer's ""Winter Sleepers"" 1997, has a character similar to Lenny, who has a short-term memory, uses a camera to snap and record things that he saw, then develops the film to look at the captured events on photos. The film deals with pairs of characters, multiple storylines that cross each other, as feelings and reactions are fatefully presented - a theme animatedly reinforced in his subsequent ""Run Lola Run"" 1998, which used the approach of repeating the same story thrice but offering different aspects every time. It was successful in having heart and humanity. In Memento, the fact that Lenny has a short-term memory capacity, feelings are hence devoid. The Sammy Jankis episodes did provoke touches of humanity.Guy Pearce has outdone himself as Lenny here in ""Memento"". It's beyond his already sensitive performance as Captain Boyd, playing opposite Robert Carlyle in director Antonia Bird's ""Ravenous"" 1999, which is another film NFE, no ordinary soldier's tale of 1847 indeed.If you want to see Joe Pantoliano in a more substantial role than being Teddy here, try the Wachowski (""The Matrix"") brothers' ""Bound"" 1996, playing opposite Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon, as the top sleaze (well, not until Pierce Brosnan in John Boorman's John le Carre's ""The Tailor of Panama"" 2001, took top 'honors' as the ultimate sleazy, swindling, deliciously amoral spy Osnard).For Carrie-Anne Moss, as a demure woman, not a word of filth (if you can't stand the 5-mins. worth of swearing coming out of her mouth as Natalie here), try director Lasse Hallstrom's ""Chocolat"". She delivered a just as strong performance as the other woman characters (Juliette Binoche, Lena Olin, Judi Dench) in this fairytale of a story, which also has its moral center (or dilemma) lodged in the character she played opposite veteran actor Alfred Molina.Last year we have Mike Figgis' ""Time Code"", this year we have Christopher Nolan's ""OTNEMEM"".",Memento

Not only that, but he is also half-naked during the entire film as the camera pans up and down his body.  Guy in the shower, Guy on the bed, Guy getting dressed.  Like it or not, you're going to see Guy Pearce's body, dammit.This film is strongly reminiscent of the Seinfeld episode where everything goes backward, the one where Sue Ellen Mischke gets married in India.  I wonder if the screenwriter was inspired by that show.Anyway, Pearce plays a man who has no short-term memory, so he has to write down everything.  This is a thinking person's film, which cleverly challenges your own short-term memory as you try to remember how each vignette ties into the previous one.  It works, but after awhile it becomes formulaic.  Joe Pantoliano's character is utterly unconvincing as a police officer.  He is such a simpering milquetoast, and his friendship with Guy is so weak, that you wonder about his motivation for helping Guy.  It is never clearly demonstrated.Major spoiler alert in this paragraph.  The problem I have with the ending is that it is so unsatisfying.  It does not clearly demonstrate Guy's motivation for `finding new challenges'.  His writing down of Teddy's license plate is so contrived and unlikely, and largely unexplained, that the whole film falls apart.  It is as though Leonard is inventing challenges just to keep himself busy; it is such an empty, unsatisfying conclusion that one wonders if there are a group of screenwriters somewhere whose job it is to create silly movie endings, such as those in `The Ring' and `Donnie Darko'.  A lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.On IMDB's scale, this movie deserves a five.",Memento

169,CinematicInceptions,Surprising in multiple ways. Fabulous without being flashy.,9,5 January 2017,"I was not expecting this movie to have such an emotional theme to it, but I was happy that it did. Most thrillers and stories that center around murders and revenge are not that emotionally compelling. Their appeal tends to come more from the mystery of the story and the shock factor of revelations. Memento is not lacking one bit in this area, but goes a step further by delivering on an emotional level and perhaps even making us question the way we go through life.Leonard's condition is a unique one that the majority of audiences have no experience with, but he's really no different than the rest of us. He just has a diagnosis to highlight it. All of us stumble through life with misconceptions because of the limited information we have. Leonard has to deal with the same thing, just on a heightened level. His solution is good in theory: only rely on facts. But by the end we realize that ""fact"" can be a malleable thing. Once Leonard decides that Teddy is his ""John G."", it does not really matter whether Teddy is his wife's murderer. That's Leonard's reality and he doesn't let himself think twice about it. Self -deception like the kind seen in this film can be beneficial as much as it can be harmful, but it was more powerful and striking to have the story end in tragedy.The backward progression, while it may seem like a gimmick at first glance, was definitely a good move. The nature of the story called for it to be told in reverse. Watching Memento in chronological order would probably make more sense, but it would end up being a rather dry story. Most of the mystery and drama would be lost.Our characters were not the most enjoyable to see on screen, but I think they were created well. Teddy, Leonard, and Natalie are actually pretty normal people without any personal qualities that made me like them. But all three of them had motives, flaws, and emotions like real people do, which made the movie as a whole better. It just wasn't shown in a flashy way that called for any great acting performances or snappy dialogue.This is an excellent pick if you like thrillers and if you like non-linear story telling. If you like guessing the ending of movies and bragging to your friends about how good you are at predicting how things will play out, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. While there is a fabulous twist ending that will drop your jaw without resorting to fanfare, it is not the kind of twist that can be predicted based on what has already been shown. It's a very psychological story, which is what I love about it, but I know some people prefer more straightforward and external story structures. So just be aware of that. One final caution: this is not the type of movie that will gross you out or make your stomach turn with vicious murders and gore, but it could be emotionally upsetting. You will not feel hopeful at the end. All the same, enjoy! Overall Rating: 8.9/10.",Memento

I can't discuss the plot too much because that would give away important details, but suffice it to say it is about a man with memory problems who is out to solve a mystery.

It is an intelligent film, truly original, and it is interesting from beginning to end (or rather from end to beginning). Guy Pearce delivers a brilliant performance and the supporting actors are great as well. Memento is a movie that you will think about after you've left the cinema, whether you liked it or not.

173,chrisbrown6453,"Memento, written and directed by Christopher Nolan, uses unconventional narrative and filmic techniques to explore the disoriented mind of its main character.",7,6 July 2001,"Trying to save his wife as she is brutally attacked by a stranger, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pierce: L.A. Confidential) receives a violent blow on the head and experiences brain damage. The trauma results in anterograde memory-loss, a rare disorder defined by the inability to form new memories. An insurance investigator who once trusted his perceptions in order to distinguish between people's false and legitimate claims, Leonard must now cope with a condition that challenges his ability to perceive reality, and which presses him to trust others. Nevertheless, Leonard is driven by a commitment to capture his wife's murderer, for the last memory he does retain recalls the traumatic incident. Relying entirely on written notes, Polaroid snapshots, and tattoos, which tell him --rather than remind him-- what car he drives, what motel he is staying in, what his new confidant ""Natalie"" (Carrie-Anne Moss: The Matrix; Chocolat) looks like, and how to find ""Teddy"" (Joe Pantoliano: The Matrix), his wife's killer, Leonard's fate is determined byhis written data.Memento clearly establishes the main character's point of view by narrating events as the character perceives them. This is achieved by focusing on the atemporal quality of his experience as he reencounters characters and situations without knowledge --or memory-- of a prior encounter. (That is, since Leonard interprets every encounter as a new one, the viewer often cannot distinguish between a genuinely new encounter and one which the protagonist simply sees as new.) Technically, Memento relies on editing techniques that disorient the viewer with undefinable patterns of flashback and flashforward images. Although often marked by tedious repetition of key scenes, the circular nature of the narration stresses the character's condition and establishes that a lack of memory may result in his inability to apply moral judgment. This raises valuable questions with regards to the role memory plays in the concepts of revenge, motivation and regret. All in all, Memento deconstructs natural perceptions of reality (and entertains new ones) by successfully manipulating its filmatic elements, and by offering a suspenseful story which evolves as a result of its protagonist's abnormal cognitive processes.",Memento

175,ethanbresnett,A remarkable film from a remarkable director.,9,19 September 2020,"Memento presents a scintillating mystery in a truly inventive and unique way. Because of this I'd say it's perhaps one of Nolan's more technically impressive films due to the way that the story was told. His decision to tell story in reverse was truly inspired, and really gives a sense of confusion, of mystery, of suspense that ties in so well with the confusion felt by Leonard. We struggle to piece the puzzle together just as much as he does, and this creates a really unique and interesting bond with our protagonist.The underlying concept is fascinating and was just so well executed. Considering this one Nolan's second film, boy did he come out of the gate swinging. I've yet to see Following or Insomnia, but have seen all of his other films and this is as fantastic as the rest. It hasn't aged at all in its 20 year history, feeling fresh and engaging. This film in particular I would say oozes a very unique sort of style compared to Nolan's others. You can tell that Memento was the product of a smaller, independent studio, without the shine and finish of his later blockbuster filmography. That's not to say that this film is rough at all. It feels very intimate, with really only three or four cast members. Much smaller scale, which personally I loved.Within this limited cast, the performances were all very solid, with Guy Pierce playing this role to perfection. Particularly impressive considering that it was not an easy role to play by any stretch. Carrie Anne-Moss was a great partner for him on screen, with her role being one of the highlights, carrying a lot of intrigue and interest. Her matrix pal Joe Pantoliano was equally great. The three of them were a fantastic trio and worked so well together on screen.Like most Nolan films, Memento will get you thinking. Not much in the film is clear cut, and due to the central premise of anterograde amnesia, there are elements that are up to interpretation. Which is what you want from a Nolan film! If you finish it and know exactly what happens did you really have a good time?I loved this film. A tantalising mystery from start to finish, which is all the more clever and brilliant considering we start at the end and know where we are going to end up.

In his quest, he is aided by two characters who may know more than they let on.  Joe Pantoliano's Teddy and Carrie-Anne Moss' Natalie.  Both have reasons for helping Leonard, but we like Leonard, don't really know who to trust.  As the action progresses backwards, we learn more about Leonard and his condition and we learn more about why things happen to Leonard.  To talk about this film would detract from the fun of watching it unfold, (or is it recede?) in front of you.

177,DavidSim240183,Superb direction. Endless surprises. An utter classic!,10,18 July 2007,"The opening scenes of Memento show a hand holding a photograph. Its one of these photos that instantly develop. The hand shakes it a few times. But oddly, instead of getting clearer, the picture fades. Only for that same photo to go back into a camera. Not out. The whole sequence is played backwards. And sets the tone perfectly for the film you're about to see. Memento may be a bit taxing on the old brain cells but its also one of the cleverest, and most ingenious films to come out of Hollywood in a good long while.Memento is an extremely unusual film because of the approach director Christopher Nolan takes. Its a story that starts at the end and ends at the beginning. In this case we watch a man being killed, and then watch the story work its way back from there. Its an extremely odd approach that shouldn't even begin to work but surprisingly does. It adds whole new dimensions to modern film-noir, and transforms Memento into a true original. As well as a classic.The story revolves around Leonard. A man who has lost his wife. And his identity. Leonard doesn't know who murdered her. Or anything else for that matter. Because a blow to the head has given him an odd sort of amnesia. He can remember everything about his life up until his wife's murder. He's incapable of sustaining short-term memories. He could meet a person and forget the reason for talking to them all within the space of the same conversation.And when you're trying to find your wife's killer, memory loss is not exactly an ally. Instead Leonard has to rely upon tattooing important clues to his body. Or noting judgements and instincts on snapshots of different faces and places.Before you actually sit down to watch Memento, it might be helpful for you to know something beforehand about the film's approach to storytelling. It will make it much easier to follow. Memento is made up of several continuous interconnecting vignettes. It could begin with Leonard walking into a hotel and killing a man. And then backtrack to how Leonard got to that hotel in the first place. This is the dynamic that propels the film, and once you've figured that out, Memento is not (quite) as hard to follow.Christopher Nolan's direction is exceptional. For someone who was only just starting out as a filmmaker, he displays an astonishing knowledge of narrative structure. And because he's dealing with whole new aspects of storytelling, it makes his accomplishments that much more remarkable. And the way he follows the story backwards at little pieces at a time is amazing the way different surprises keep being sprung on us.I'm hesitant to tell you too much because the film dazzles by the different narrative somersaults it constantly pulls off. This is a film that will shock and surprise right up until the very end.Memento is an exhausting film at times. You may feel tempted to turn off the DVD more than once just so your brain can catch up. If you feel the need, by all means do so. Its Nolan's way of making us feel just as confused and as dislocated as poor Leonard. Its a sometimes gruelling experience, but in the long run it works.The film would be nothing without the right actor at the centre of it to pull everything together. And Guy Pearce is perfectly cast in the role. He has an infinite patience, playing a role that must have no doubt been difficult. I don't know if the actual film was shot in sequence, but if it was done backwards then it shows Pearce is an actor with real talent. He was criminally overlooked at Oscar time.There are lots of wonderful gems to pry out of this film. I love the scene that begins with a chase. And Leonard can't remember if he's being chased. Or if he's the one doing the chasing. Or when a character claims to have been beaten up by her boyfriend. She uses Leonard's memory impairment against him. Because the next scene reveals it was he who actually did it.Memento reminds me at times of Groundhog Day. Where that was a man surrounded by a world that constantly resets, this is a man who constantly resets surrounded by a world that always moves on. Its an ingenious concept. The last time I saw a film that made my mind do so many flip-flops and somersaults was Being John Malkovich.At the end (or is it the beginning?) of Memento, you will definitely feel completely worn out. And you may feel like you never want to sit through this film ever again. That's understandable, but Memento is a film that deserves repeat viewings, because it just gets better and better every time you see it. Its a completely original, modern day masterpiece. An all too rare thing nowadays.",Memento

Although he was able to shoot and kill one of his wife's two assailants, the second villain caused him a serious blow to the head, damaging his brain. The police do not believe in a second attacker. As Leonard remembers the past before his wife's murders, he has anterograde, and not retrograde amnesia, and knows how to read, to drive, get gas, handle personal affairs, etc. If Leonard's conversations exceed 5 minutes or so, he will forget what the subject was to begin with. His personal struggles are obviously great. When he awakens, he has to determine where he is and how he got there. When a man chases him, he is at first confused and thinks he is chasing the man and wondering why. He knows the truth when the other man fires a gun at him.To tell the tale, Director Christopher Nolan demonstrates an unusual take: there are two alternate timelines. They comprise a black and white part told chronologically and the color sequence division that is told in reverse (non-linear). They merge in the middle of the film although the black and white scenes continue to nearly the end. Each scene is divided into 5-10 minute segments.The film begins in color with the murder of major character John Edward ""Teddy"" Gammell (Joe Pantoliano) and works backwards to show the events leading up to it. Leonard, in his own mind, believes that Teddy was one of two assailants that killed his wife. But Leonard is looking at the picture from his own (flawed) perspective. Teddy may be a corrupt undercover cop who takes drug money to enrich himself, and even uses Leonard for his own purposes, but he is no murderer or rapist. And the way the film is constructed, we probably have to believe Teddy's comments because there is no other explanation from the director. Nevertheless, Leonard wrote ""Don't believe his lies,"" under Teddy's photograph, and Teddy was doomed.Then there is the woman, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Morse), who also has her own agenda and definitely uses Leonard. Her boyfriend is drug dealer Jimmy Grantz (Larry Holden). Near the end of the movie, in the last black and white segment, Leonard murders (again) Jimmy because he thought that he was the man who supposedly killed his wife. During the confrontation, Leonard receives those two annoying scratches seen throughout much of the film. After that Teddy warned him to leave town, discard Jimmy's expensive suit, and drive his jaguar because he would be a sitting duck for dealers looking for him. Leonard ignores Teddy.The black and white chronological portion explains Leonard's life as an insurance claims investigator. He has authority to handle the case of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), who has claimed short-term memory loss as a result of an automobile accident. After many tests Leonard concludes that Sammy's problem is mental, not physical from the accident, and advises his company to deny the claim. Later to test her husband, his diabetic wife subjects herself to a fatal test. Nevertheless, near the end of the film in a color sequence, Teddy explains to Leonard that Sammy was faking and never had a wife, and that it was Leonard's spouse who was a diabetic. Furthermore Teddy explains that it was he as a cop who was assigned to Leonard's wife's case. The two of them tracked down the thug and killed him. Also, he states that his wife survived the assault, and that Leonard invented Sammy's story as his own! Did Leonard forget to give his wife an insulin injection? Or did he give her too many? Assuming Teddy was telling the truth, why doesn't Leonard remember that his wife was a diabetic? Note that there is a color scene where Leonard lies in bed with his wife. He does appear to give her an injection in her right thigh, and right after pinches it. And near the very end we see tattoos are already on his body with his wife alive. She must have survived the assault.The film ending is in color and shows Leonard driving up to Emma's Tattoo parlor. Guess what he will have tattooed on his body this time!?The acting is top-notch throughout, as is the editing and pacing. The storyline is unique, to say the least, in the way the timelines are presented. Viewers have to pay close attention and trust their own memories when watching this one! I believe that there is a plot hole. Near the very end we see tattoos on Leonard's body with his wife alive. On the left side of his chest, a tattoo reads, ""I've done it."" (So he killed the thug who assaulted his wife.) But why is the particular tattoo missing throughout the movie? Anyway, Joe Pantoliano steals every scene where he appears. By the way, the movie doesn't say, but if this writer were a betting man he would say that Joe Pantoliano's character is called Teddy because of his strong resemblance to Teddy Roosevelt when he was a Rough Rider.

179,SkullScreamerReturns,Tricky reverse mystery,6,19 April 2021,"I'm not the biggest fan of Christopher Nolan but I admit he has his own style, and I can understand if his sometimes mind-boggling ideas are someone's biggest favorites. Memento bears similarity also to some Tarantino films because also that director likes to mess around with non-chronological telling style. Quite early in the film I noticed that the story moves backwards. But there are also flashbacks from other parts of the story, sometimes shown again in important moments.It's definitely interesting film but I think it's more interesting as a concept than a watching experience. Since the ending is told first it lacks a good conclusion. Well, of course the main idea is to try and understand the story from this kind of experimental telling style and it's ok. But I feel like Nolan is trying a little bit too hard to make an intellingent and surprising thriller, and the timeline trickery is there just to confuse the viewer and make the movie appear more artistic than the story underneath actually is.I enjoyed it to some extent and might raise the raiting when watching again later, but it probably won't rise to my real big favorites.If you're a fan of Christopher Nolan, perhaps Tarantino, and muder mystery thrillers, then you need to see this one.",Memento
180,lagudafuad,This is not just a movie it is art,8,7 December 2012,"Memento is not just a movie it is an artwork, an artwork with editing at its best, continuity at its max and a script that just draws you in. The screenplay is masterful as you are watching the movie from back to front; you get to feel like Leonard himself.Memento is written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who adapted it from his younger brother Jonathan Nolan's (Person of Interest creator, writer and executive producer) short story ""Memento Mori"".The brothers started work on the film in 1996 when Jonathan pitched the story to Christopher on a road trip, the two then started to send story and script back and forth as Christopher developed his film from a short story about a man named Earl who is a patient of a mental institution. Earl's wife like Leonard was killed by an anonymous man, and during the attack Earl lost his ability to create new long-term memories and convinces himself through written notes to himself to escape the mental institution and track down and kill his wife murder.The movie starts at the end and runs till we get to see what led to the end. The movie is told in two different parallel series of scenes, one of which is in black and white and it is shown chronologically, and the other is in colored and shown in a reverse order sequence. The two stories meet at the end of the film, and it shows us what led to the beginning of the film.The movie plot is about a man named Leonard (Guy Pearce) who has anterograde amnesia, which makes it difficult for him to retain new explicit memories. To be able to keep tab on his life Leonard developed a system where he uses notes, tattoos and Polaroid photos to be able to track where he is and who he knows and what he is doing or about to do.Leonard's problem started when he got hit in the head when he witnessed his wife being raped and murdered; now Leonard has only one goal in life to track down a certain John G who he believes killed his wife.Rated as one of the best movies in the 2000s, Memento is featured in notable lists of top films. Memento was very successful at the box office making almost 10 times its production cost and placing Nolan's name in the lips of many production studios, inclusive of Warner Bros where Christopher Nolan made The Batman Trilogy and will be working with them for the making of the new Superman film named Man of Steel in 2013.Memento received numerous accolades and got two Academy Awards nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing.

Leonard (Guy Pearce) is a man who is struggling to put his life back together after the brutal rape and murder of his wife. But Leonard's problems are different from those of most people in his situation; he was beaten severely by the same man who killed his wife. The most significant manifestation of Leonard's injuries is that his short-term memory has been destroyed; he is incapable of retaining any new information, and must resort to copious note- taking and Polaroid photographs in order to keep track of what happens to him over the course of a day (he's even tattooed himself with a few crucial bits of information he can't get along without). Leonard retains awareness that his wife was brutally murdered, however, and he's convinced that the culprit still walks the streets. Leonard is obsessed with the notion of taking revenge against the man who has ruined his life, and he sets out to find him, getting help from Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who appears to be a sympathetic barmaid, and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who claims to be Leonard's friend, even though Leonard senses that he cannot be trusted.

183,avik-basu1889,A Cerebral Cinematic Exercise !!!,10,27 July 2015,"'Memento' is a film that takes you on a ride along with its protagonist who has a medical condition which makes him experience short term memory loss constantly. Nolan manages to make this ride incredibly special by using a very interesting and effective method, which was to tweak the screenplay in a way which will ensure that the viewer is allowed as much exposition as the protagonist himself. We are never allowed too much exposition and the result is a fascinating film that messes with the viewer, no matter how many times he/she chooses to watch it.First and foremost, Memento is a technical masterpiece. The non- linear screenplay, the editing, the cinematography and the direction of each and every scene is just pitch perfect. Nolan messes with the viewer in the same way that other characters mess with Lenny to take advantage of him and make use of his medical condition. 'Memento' demands constant and uninterrupted attention from the viewer, otherwise he/she could easily slip into a state of total confusion as the film is pretty much a puzzle which the viewer has to solve along with Lenny. The non- linear screenplay written by Christopher Nolan based on a short story written by his brother includes two major sections going side by side simultaneously. One section shown in black and white runs in chronological order, while the other section shown in colour runs in reverse order, both the sections move towards each other in time- line throughout the film. They meet right at the end to create a shocking climax to the film. A screenplay as complex as this would have been unimaginably difficult to conceive and execute, but Nolan astonishingly managed to write it and his directorial skills made the constant transitions from one section to the other absolutely seamless. It takes a lot of guts to write and direct a film like this, and when it's only your 2nd major film, the stakes get even higher and Nolan passed the test with flying colours.The major theme of the film is memory and the subjective(at times) nature of it. We all have certain memories, whose significance, meanings and implications change with time as we gain maturity or as we become aware of other things. In a way, this subjective nature of memory and the whole concept of choosing to remember certain aspects of an incident to derive a specific meaning out of it is dealt with in the most intense and cerebral way in this film. There are some reviews I have read where the reviewers have complained that maybe the non-linear,complex screenplay of the film is the only thing that keeps 'Memento' from being just a puzzle and a standard, ordinary revenge film. I have two arguments against that complaint. Firstly, this film had to have the complex screenplay as Nolan wanted the viewer to experience the same mental inadequacies that Lenny experiences and he wanted the viewer to feel lost at times during the film just like Lenny. Secondly, the film ends in a way which completely changed my perception of it. The ending makes the whole film a tangential metaphor for general existentialism. The film becomes much deeper by conveying that many people will believe in something just to make their lives worth living and give themselves a motivation to go on living in their quest for what they choose to believe, which can be very relevant from the angle of belief in religion and a higher power.Although Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano come up with good supporting performances, but 'Memento' is Guy Pearce's film. He drives the film forward from the beginning right till the end. He becomes the character Lenny and comes up with a brilliantly convincing performance. He juggles understatement with bursts of intensity beautifully to create the character on screen.'Memento' was the first Nolan masterpiece and this was the film that made his name. It is much deeper than some people think it is. No matter who you are and how many times you've watched this, 'Memento' will always find a way to keep you transfixed with its mystery and subtle reticence and it lingers in the mind for days and encourages discussions due to the openness of the storyline. It is always immensely re-watchable due to its style. This belongs to the Essential Viewing category.",Memento

Would Recommend.This movie is incredibly interesting and keeps you hooked all the way through. That said, I think that the movie's primary strength is its great gimmick. It's a gimmick movie, no doubt about that, but it does actually have enough substance to back it up.Technically speaking, this movie is excellent. The editing in this movie is phenomenal and the way that Nolan uses it to tell the story backwards is really just brilliant. They say that Guy Pearce is never the answer and I would usually agree with the exception of this movie. He plays a genuinely troubled man and I bought him in every scene he was in. You could really feel how his character arc reverses throughout the movie and the movie wouldn't be as good as it is without his amazing performance. Carrie Anne-Mosse was also pretty good as Natalie but I do think that most people could have played her and don't think that Anne-Mosse actually added anything special to the role. Joey Pantolino was actually great as Teddy and really convinced me of his character. All the acting was great in this movie and really helps drive this movie. All the characters in the movie are also great and work as the main force of this movie. I adore the story for this movie. It's intriguing. It's intense. It's a mind {INSERT PROFANITY HERE} if there ever was one. Add that to Nolan's spectacular non-linear storytelling and you have a phenomenal story. I do actually think that the way Nolan presented this story was the primary driving force of it. In what's become typical Nolan fashion, the ending is mysterious and only furthers the genius of this film's script.Memento is a movie that is told in reverse. There is no real way to explain how awesome that is and how well that works other than to write this review in the same way. The driving force of this movie is the gimmick of it and that is okay because Nolan also provided us enough substance and meat to keep the potatoes edible. Guy Pearce gives one of his best performances as Leonard Shelby. The other supporting cast are also pretty good and the help drive this movie. It's mainly down to Nolan's unique script and insane mind that make this movie shine. I can't pick out my obvious flaws other than I can see many people not being satisfied with the ending of this movie. That is understandable because it took my a few hours to compile my thoughts on it. If you can take the mind {INSERT PROFANITY HERE} of Nolan's ingenious writing, you'll probably enjoy this movie.'MEMENTO' was directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Guy Pearce, Carrie Anne-Mossee and Joey Pantolino. It's the story of Leonard Shelby(Guy Pearce), a man with short term memory loss, who attempts to hunt down the man who murdered his wife and gave him his condition.",Memento

The Nolan movie experience certainly requires some atypical viewer adjustments. We are always shown what we need to know, but as with ""The Prestige"" we really don't want to see it. Their formula here combines loss of a spouse with a haunting guilt of culpability. The staggered murder investigation twists are presented through our protagonists' frustrating lack of short term memory. Memento has an artsy look yet an unmistakably gritty feel.

Not only is this my favorite Nolan movie, it's one of my favorite movies of all time.What don't I like, well, I guess there are a few times where you can get confused. And at times the narration may feel unneeded, but those are really only small nitpicks.The best part about this movie is the way it's shown, it's not a straight narrative, there are black and white scenes that go straight, but then the color scenes go backwards, all setting up this mystery. Nolan tried to do that with his first movie, ""Following,"" but this is where he perfected it. The mystery is very well done, and actually gives the movie more re-watch value, I've seen the movie several times and still don't know exactly what happened. The acting is great all around, Teddy ads some really good comedic relief, the cinematography and editing are excellent.There's not much to say without spoiling anything, please if you haven't seen this movie, go see it, it really is a fantastic movie, and in my opinion, Christopher Nolan's best.",Memento

""Memento"" joins the short list I know of, most notably ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Primal Fear"".""Memento"" tells the story of Leonard (Guy Pearce, in his best role since playing Mike in ""Neighbours""...ok he was pretty good in ""LA Confidential"" and ""The Count of Monte Cristo""),a man who suffers from short term memory loss. Leonard was involved in a near fatal murder attempt on he and his wife and now is on a mission to find his would be assassin. Problem is having no short term memory makes things pretty difficult. Leonard overcomes this by tattooing his body with key pieces of information and keeping photographs of key people and places.The movie plays backwards, so we see the ending and then learn the story backwards.

By seeing half of the plot beginning with the chronologically last scene, every scene makes the viewer ask questions of more or less important character: `How did Leonard come there?' `Why is he doing this and that?', and in one of the following (=previous) scenes we get the answers, when we have actually just forgotten the question. Really, Christopher Nolan not only plays with the short-time memory of his main character, but also with ours!Of course, `Memento' is not a `great movie'; it's not revolutionary because it's hard to imitate it well (which is not at all a bad thing). But it's a completely unique movie like `Being John Malkovich' or `The Truman Show'. Strangely, this kind of movies has always been underrated, not by the audience but by critics and the Academy. `Memento' is absolutely constructed; the base idea itself is what rules the whole movie. And  particularly with Guy Pearce, that blonded, mimeless main actor  it remains cold. No warmth.

191,W011y4m5,Cold & mechanical.,5,24 March 2019,"I regrettably have to admit ""Memento"" is easily & without doubt Christopher Nolan's worst film; led by a fascinating concept which is explored masterfully; moulding a story from it which is expertly shot & crafted & the narrative is as clever as you'd expect from this particular filmmaker... BUT it suffers from one MAJOR problem; a total & utter lack of any emotional investment.
Let me explain: typically, audiences follow character's stories as they watch & invest themselves in them as they progress from the beginning to the end; here's the immediate dilemma with ""Memento"" - how on Earth am I meant to care about a character who is literally incapable of progressing in any way?
Our lead is a man who suffers from an inability to create lasting memories & that idea is an undeniably intellectual concept to wrap your head around - not hard to see why it was so appealing to delve into as a writer - but when the character is repeatedly discovering himself & his whereabouts in every consecutive sequence, the 2 hour movie rapidly becomes repetitive & fails to go anywhere remotely interesting...
Every new progression of the plot is predictably led by the regression & reversion of the character to the point where he's back to exactly the same person he was before from the beginning, so there's ultimately no emotional anchor to provide the film with any weight. Hence, the feature starts to feel mechanical & cold, taking one clever step forward & two emotional steps in the opposite direction. By the time the credits roll, you're in no doubt about the inventiveness of those behind it, but it's completely devoid of any aspect which could cause me to give a damn about what's taken place so it's monotonous & inconsequential... Completely dull & overlong.

It's kind of true but I didn't see anything cool or stylish in it. Just because it's in the reverse order, you can not say it is stylish. Do you love Pulp Fiction because it's stylish or because it's in a different structure. No. Similarly, I love memento not because it's different or cool but because it's an incredibly well made film.Type 2 are those calling it pretentious. It's wierd because this is the least pretentious Nolan film. His most pretentious will the The Prestige. The director doesn't call it intelligent, thought provoking or anything, it's the people. Also each and every scene makes some contribution to the story. Nothing is uselessly put there.Type 3 actually have a point. They are those calling it tiring.

His wife was raped and murdered and all he has are fragmented clues about what happened and who's responsible.  His problem is that because his memory last about 2 minutes he repeatedly forgets who he just met, what he just did, where he's just been. Consequently he tattoos apparent facts to his body to remind him of the 'truth' and photographs everyone he engages with as a 'memento' of them and to enable him to identify them later.This is only half the genius of this story, the other half is equally, if not more brilliant; the story is told in reverse. It starts at the end, and makes its way to the beginning, but it's because Shelby doesn't remember anything, and of course, we do, that makes the narrative flow superbly.

You see things from the perspective of our main character who suffers from a bizarre memory loss condition. Rather than explain the plot, I will just say that if you plan on watching this movie just once, get ready to change your plans. You will need to watch it twice to fully GET it. It moves too fast for the viewer and by the time it's over you will tell yourself that you GET it, but you don't.To those who say there are no holes in this film I scoff at you. Why does Leonard have no memory loss in the murder sequence? He remembers long enough to drive all the way to that abandoned building and then wait for the murderer. In other scenes, he forgets what he is doing after two minutes. Maybe he is just psychotic and made the whole condition up in his mind to excuse a rampage? The hypotheses are endless. Personally, I'd rather watch a movie that just makes sense on it's own and no matter what you say, this one doesn't.

Memento is a class of story-telling, a piece of art. It's a film that you want to watch again and again, because is really that good. This film has some kind of glue, once watched about ten minutes or so, you won't stop. Why? Well, firstly, because the way the story is told. I don't want to enter in details; after all, spoilers really can ruin this film at first watch.But I can say that IF the goal of the film is make the viewer really feel the character's mind to the point of being confusing while watching the film, I can say that they did very well the job. It's a great puzzle, and the pieces are given in a way that sometimes you think in a way, but then there is another piece given, and you simply change completely your thoughts. Then fine, you think the story is finally going ahead. But, somehow, there is yet a piece missing in the story, and there is when you realize you got completely involved in the story and your mind starts to become confused. I've never been so excited for a film as much as i did when watching Memento. I've watched films with very powerful twists, and films with a very well told story, but in that film, there is like a combo of these two aspects and sure I've never seen nothing like that. It's the best thriller film that I've watched, enough said.Leonard's quest is so unpredictable, and its even more attenuated with the fact that not only the story has no chronological order, but also with the fact that the story is inter called with another moment of Leonard's life(the sequences which happens in that inter called reality is entirely made in black and white). There is also some of Nolan's trademarks in this film. The slight dark humor in the action scenes and the twists in the end which he became known for are two of them.Once the cinematic puzzle that this film is gets completed, you realize how pessimist and cruel the film is. The ending is unpredictable, and certainly on par with the buildup made, but it don't leaves anything to be thought or whats or ever. There are really no questions to be asked. This is what is so great about it. Despite being apparently a film with lots of layers, the message that it wants to pass is only one – and is very clever. A metaphor about life, and again, not an optimistic one. And as far as the world looks, this metaphor is – how can I say that? It makes no sense! But okay, I'll try. The metaphor is true. Yes, true. Unfortunately. Obviously, I'll not spoil it, otherwise the entire film would be useless and the experience wouldn't be as great as if you know what this metaphor is beforehand, again, and worthy noting to say: don't look for spoilers about this film. It will ruin it.

201,x_manicure_x,Unreliable memories,8,24 August 2021,"""Memento"" proved that a competent director, a revolutionary idea, and a decent cast could sometimes be enough to make a groundbreaking film. The film is essentially a neo-noir thriller played backward. Leonard is looking for the man who raped and killed his wife, but the traumatic events caused him short-term amnesia. Unable to store memories for more than a few minutes, he leaves clues for him to find, like scribbles, tattoos, and polaroid pictures. Every time Leonard loses his memories, he has to guess how things happened by looking through the clues he has.At the beginning of the film, Leonard already found the killer, but cannot remember how. We are then progressively taken back in time and shown the events that lead to each piece of evidence. As the viewer only knows what would happen, but not how it happened, it's easy to feel in Leonard's shoes. Each episode starts where the following scene would end, and despite the fragmented storytelling, everything flows coherently. There is also a parallel timeline (shot in black and white) that proceeds forward in time to converge with the backward timeline in the end.As the story progresses (or I should say, regresses), our view of Leonard and the other characters drastically changes, until we lose our trust in memory and reality. Facts and evidence are the foundations of truth and the only things that lead Leonard's search, but they cannot be reliable as they are subject to the influence of the individual who processed and recorded them. Leonard is so sure about the absolute value of facts and the impermanence of memories, but in the end, memories are the only things that help us define our reality. Wrong assumptions and fabricated evidence are enough to lead his search on the wrong path.The success of ""Memento"" turned Christophe Nolan into one of the most prestigious directors in Hollywood, but at the same time caused his self-pressure to create increasingly revolutionary and conceptually complicated films, mostly with forced and incoherent results.",Memento
202,WalterFrith,Dreamlike memories,10,8 September 2001,"What a superb film.  It's nice to see all the guys from 1997's 'L.A. Confidential' go on to have their own film masterpieces three years in a row.  First Kevin Spacey with 'American Beauty' in 1999, Russell Crowe in 'Gladiator' in 2000 and now Guy Pearce in 'Memento' in 2001.  It's almost impossible to describe this film without giving away the end but its dreamlike power reeled me in and gave me chilling reminders of Coppola's 1974 classic 'The Conversation' in the way some of the macabre elements played out quickly, sharply and figuratively.  Pearce is totally convincing in his role and Joe Pantoliano plays his part with his usual character actor ambiance intact.  With short scenes, pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle, and not revealing its meaning until the final 30 seconds of the film, 'Memento' is the best film of 2001 so far and it better get raves come Oscar time, or else!",Memento
203,smakawhat,Unbelievable piece of writing and storytelling craftsmanship,10,5 June 2001,"A film noir of unbelievable twist and turns!!!  Guy Pearce (from L.A. Confidential) is Leonard Shelby, a man with an odd condition.  He suffers from short term memory loss.  All he remembers is easily passed in obscurity within a few short minutes.  However, he has a fix for this condition by tattooing his body with post it remind letters to remember important things, and taking photos and writing on the back of them.  It's important he does this cause after all, he's out to find out who raped and murdered his wife and get his vengeance.  Even though Leonard can remember everything before his wife's murder about him and everything else, the trauma from the incident has scarred him and put him in this condition. However, we get the complete uneasyness and confusion of Leonard as people enter his life such as a bartender (played by Carrie Ann Moss of Matrix notaritity) and another somewhat perhaps shaddy character known as Lenny portrayed by Joe Pantoliano (Ralph from the Sopranos) may have alterior motives.  Since Leonard will loose what he learns in a short time, you wonder if the other characters are exploiting his condition for their own needs and leading him to the wrong killer.The film with great acting and great characters, excels at one thing that you will notice instantly.  That is its use of story telling and narrative. This film starts off at the end, and then litteraly plays out BACKWARDS as we try to piece togethers actions from litteraly Leonard's point of view. This movie is UNBELIEVABLE with twists and turns, and who's and what's, and the simple fact that you are litteraly in Leonard's shoes.  No movie have I EVER seen has placed the viewer inside the characters mind as this film.And as for the ending, suspense, dry humour, use of grayed film / colour, voice overs, twists, writing.... the people/person who wrote this....

But seeing that so many people are not sure what to believe, kinda makes you feel that the movie has served is purpose as a talking point!For me, actually, the most confusing part is the role of Natalie in the film. 3 different scenes show her in 3 different lights - which one is correct or all 3 are made up?!And the beginning of the film... I thought at first it is kinda boring that they repeat the same scenes (with just a minute of longer action than the previous scene) several times with only a bit of a change...but then, at the end, I realized that the beginning of the film is the most important ( or so I seem to think)All in all, good film! I was hesitant between 7 or 8, but I go with 7. It may be the good thing that we are in the dark just like the main character of the movie, but somehow I did not like that much.

Confidential"" that I actually liked and renewed my faith in film as art and entertainment.Unlike so many of the films coming out of the Hollywood money machine, this film actually started with a very well written script and everything else was built around the script. What a concept! The script had to be thought out really well because of the format of showing the end first and going backwards in segments. Also the use of using black and white for part of the story that moves forward and using color for the main part of the story which is told backwards.There's great dialog in this film and despite the ""noir"" concept, it has quite a sense of humor. At one point Leonard defends his affliction by saying ""memory is unreliable."" Burt tells Leonard ""it's all backwards,"" which is speaking about the format of the film.The cast is universally excellent. Guy Pierce does a west coast accent that had me fooled, and I have lived here all my life. Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano are better than they were in ""The Matrix."" The ending is rather ambiguous. There is debate whether you should not believe Teddy because he lies or if he is telling the truth because he knows that Leonard will not remember anyway. There are some hints where we see a glimpse of Sammy in the mental hospital and then see Leonard in his place. We see a glimpse of Leonard giving his wife an insulin shot, but then he decides that she was not diabetic and he remembers that he was only pinching her. There is a shot of him laying next to his wife, covered in his tattoos full of clues. We don't what is really memory and what is imagination. This is pretty much Leonard's state of mind also.It's a shame that Christopher Nolen has chosen a career in Hollywood after doing this independent masterpiece. Hopefully he will make a whole bunch of money and go back to making entertaining art films.",Memento
206,random_avenger,Memento,8,22 July 2010,"Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man with a tragic past. After a home invasion incident left his wife raped and murdered, he has lived for nothing but revenge. The tricky thing is, the same incident has rendered him incapable of remembering any recent event for longer than a few minutes, so he has to write everything down on paper, photographs or his own skin and always keep these notes with him. Despite his unusual amnesia, he is intent on finding and killing the man responsible for everything. Helping him are his talkative friend Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and a mistreated woman Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss).The special thing about the way Memento is presented is that it's all backwards: starting from the conclusion and advancing to the situations that originally started Leonard's mission. Interspersed with the backwards narrative are chronologically progressing black & white flashbacks of Leonard explaining his situation to someone on the telephone. Like Leonard, the audience keeps learning new things from his past as time goes by, which is why the broken timeline is not just a gimmick but has a purpose in casting light on the nature of Leonard's condition.Even though it could be very easy to lose track on the order in which the scenes are supposed to advance, Nolan's direction keeps the story perfectly understandable for an attentive viewer. Whilst it's true that the characters and the plot would be much less interesting had the story been narrated in normal chronological order, the movie is an enjoyable and unpredictable thriller as it is now. Examining themes like overcoming grief, finding a mission in life and the ultimate meaninglessness of revenge, Memento is a film that can be safely recommended to any thriller fan.",Memento

Everything is showed backwards on the movie, what makes it impossible to take the eyes off the screen during the whole film. End is actually in the first scene and the beginning is in the last one. It's an enchanting innovation that can't be missed at all. Lenny (Guy Pearce) is a desperate man who wants to discover who killed his wife during his house robbery. Because of a blow he received in the head in the attack he has to use notes, pictures and tattoos on his own body to remember what he has just done and to know who people are. Many other characters enter the story what confuses Lenny who don't know if he can trust them or not. We who watch the movie also have to pay close attention to what is happening not to miss the important details that explain the plot.Guy Pearce together with Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano, who play two of those mysterious characters Lenny must investigate about, have great performances in this unforgettable and highly recommended film.

This is a movie that compares well against all the classics. It's so cleverly devised and amazingly scripted that it will hold your attention from the very start and keep you fully engaged in concentration throughout.
It's probably the first film that is told back to front, the film ending with how it should start. This is a concept that, prior to this, had never been attempted before. And there are plenty of twists that will leave you gob-smacked. The story is set in a realisticly tacky, daytime suburban L.A. The cast isn't very commercially popular and it's made on a ver small budget (it was shot over thirteen days) but that's why its so great.

Leonard's special amnesia causes his interactions with people around him to be cut off into a series of short-term games, so he is constantly exploited and cheated.

212,squirrel_burst,"It's more than a movie, it's an experience.",10,1 April 2015,"""Memento"" is brilliant and expertly pieced together. It's more than a movie, it's an experience. How is that possible? Unfortunately it's impossible to describe to you why that is unless you know the premise, so here goes: Our protagonist (Guy Pearce) is a man named Leonard. He is on a seemingly impossible quest for revenge after his wife's rape and murder by an unidentified assailant. The attack left him with a head injury that now prevents him from forming new memories. He knows who he is, he remembers everything up to the moment where he suffered the injury but if he has a conversation that lasts too long, he won't remember how it started. Now, using clues from the night, limited information from the police file that's gone cold, Polaroid photographs, hand-written notes to himself and help from people he has met, Leonard is slowly tracking down the man responsible.Now that you have the premise of the film, there is another vital piece of information that you must know in order to understand what this movie is like. The movie is told in reverse, with the scene that would normally be at the very end of this story being shown at the beginning, and so on. This means that just like the protagonist, you don't know what causes actions or how Leonard go to a spot as its happening. This is where the brilliance of the film comes in. Just like ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", where the drug trip the characters go on, and the experience of watching the movie feel like the same, the condition that Leonard suffers and the experience you will get from watching the movie are the same. It's hard to wrap your brain around this, but even if you're dubious about it working (trust me, it works incredibly well), have you ever seen a movie that tries to pull a trick like this? It's a breath of fresh air.What I love about this movie is that it's not just a gimmicky story; it would still be just as interesting to watch if it was told in the ""normal"" order. It's a story about revenge like no other because it exposes the biggest flaw about going on a quest to get even in a way that no other movie about the subject can. If you were out on the path of vengeance, you might get satisfaction from killing the person that murdered your wife, but that isn't going to get her back. The purpose of revenge then, is revenge itself. You seek retribution in order to give yourself the satisfaction that you have done something. But what happens when you don't even have that? What happens when you find the guy and you take gleeful pleasure in making him suffer so intensely that he prays for death, but once the deed is done you can't even remember it happening? I'm a huge fan of films about payback because there's something primal about them that is satisfying, but they also lend themselves very well to complicated ideas and paradoxes. This is one of the smartest and most original stories of revenge that I've seen.There's even more going on with this movie because it plays wonderfully with the condition that Leonard suffers from (the technical term is anterograde amnesia). As the story unfolds you see that many people sympathize with the man's condition, while others use it to their advantage and ultimately it becomes impossible to know who he can really trust. The further you get into the movie, the more twisted it gets and everything that you think you know gets turned upside down. Once again, it makes you as disoriented as the character in the movie and that's a wonderful, original and confusing feeling. All of a sudden, sequences of mundane exposition become huge plot twists! I found ""Memento"" to be an extremely satisfying experience. It's so twisty, so intelligently written, so well acted and so well directed that it's the kind of movie that you can never forget once you've seen. I absolutely loved it and I'm very curious to see how it plays out a second time around, or if there is a way to view it in the ""correct"" order with some special edition blu-ray or DVD out there. I can't say enough good things about it. If you're interested in movies even a little bit, you should treat yourself by experiencing ""Memento"". (On Blu-ray, June 14, 2012)",Memento
213,Jacques98,Just throw the doughnut away.,2,6 December 2008,"Let me get it out of the way and say that I am a thriller buff. I'm not one of the countless reviewers on this site who watched Memento and didn't understand itI understood the plot perfectlyand I am certainly not one of the countless reviewers who gave this a negative score because they see it as poor cinema. I don't have a pretentious bone in my body.I am writing a negative review of Memento solely because it's exactly like everything I've seen before, and that's something not many people complain about.The main problem I have with the thriller genre is that it repeats itself, in the same way the sci-fi genre repeats itself. When thriller films don't outright copy one another, they always seem to think if they can find some new, original plot they're going to be groundbreaking. The only problem with that last statement is that most thrillers with ""new, original"" plot-lines still simply have the exact same things happening on screen as all the others. The whole wife-is-murdered-I-must-avenger-her plot. Car chases. People talking about the plot. Intense confirmation between bad guy and good guy. You know the drill.While Memento tries very hard to avoid those obvious things, and in the end it somewhat does, it's still nothing you haven't seen before. It plays out exactly like every other thrilleravenge-wife, gather info, kill guy who did itand ends exactly like every other thrillerreversal of expectations. Some of the plot details may be a bit fresh, but when you see the same things that you've seen in every other thriller, who really cares? Memento uses the common mistake thriller writers and directors both make: watching a whole typical movie just to get to the less-typical ending is just boring and forgettable. There is no entertainment value in it. It's the same exact mistake The Usual Suspects made. It's like trying to force yourself to eat a stale long john doughnut just to get to the cream filling. You'll end up throwing the doughnut away.So how great is this ""awesome, unbelievable"" plot twist? Pretty average. It's a plot twist, sure, but with such a pathetic main plot, once again, who really cares they made it a little less pathetic in the last ten minutes? It's still the generic man-must-avenge-wife story.How was the directing? Once again, pretty typical. It just takes some elements of metafiction and puts them on filmso what? Also, the use of black-and-white intertwined is just getting downright cliché, being that most every film with ""amazing directing"" (big emphasis on the quotes) uses it. I will give Christopher Nolan a bit of credit, because he does keep Memento a bit more fast-paced than most thrillers I've seen, but that's about as far as I can say. It still certainly isn't thrilling, and I find that ironic.So what it comes down to is this. If you're a hardcore thriller buff like myself, this is essential for you to see, but that doesn't mean you'll enjoy it. If you're an average movie watcher who just wants something entertaining and smart, look elsewhere. Fast.2/10",Memento

216,williampsamuel,"Strange, convoluted, and quite brilliant",8,6 January 2015,"Christopher Nolan's Memento is not a normal film by any stretch of the imagination. It is one of the most confusing, purposely fragmented, hard to follow stories ever filmed. It is extremely hard to make sense of. But if you can follow it, the rewards are immense.The basic premise is simple enough; a man seeks revenge for the death of his wife. But Leonard (Guy Pierce), the man in question, has no short term memory. And the scenes take place in reverse order, with each scene ending where the last scene started. The beginning is the ending, the ending is the beginning. And if that weren't enough, there's a second sequence of events which take place before the main story and are shown in chronological order, and the film constantly cuts back and forth between them. If you're confused at this point you should be; this is the kind of non-linear storytelling even most comic books won't touch.When I say that Leonard has no short term memory, it means that anything that happens to him will be gone in a matter of minutes: faces, names, where he is, what he's doing. The only memories he has are those from before the injury that gave him his condition, the last of those being the death of his wife and the injury itself. This means that he, and by extension we, don't know anything about what's happening except what's scribbled on pieces of paper or tattooed to his body. And the real kick is that he doesn't know where or when he received any of this information, so there's no real way for him to know what, if anything is true.And because the entire film moves backwards, we don't know how he or any of the other characters arrived at their present situations. We don't really know how long he's been hunting for the killer, why he came to this town, how he met the people who are helping him, or anything else. All we have is what we can infer from the beginning, (which is actually the ending) and I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying that much of that will be completely wrong. The paradox of this movie is that we don't have any idea what's next because we don't know what came before, and what's next is what came before. And if you can make any sense out of what I've just said, good for you because that's more than I can say for myself.Honestly, Memento almost makes Inception seem simple. The whole time you're watching you're aware that it doesn't seem to make any sense and that you don't know what's happening or why. But you keep watching because you want to understand. You're intrigued by Leonard and his quest for vengeance, and you want to know the answers. And whenever a question is answered another is posed, and every revelation throws what you think you know out the window. This movie is truly mind-bending in the very best sense of the word. And when you finally get to the ending (which is the beginning) you will be completely blown away by what you learn, and even more so by what is still in doubt.Like I said, this is a weird one. It's fragmented, scrambled, incredibly complicated and at times borders on incomprehensible. But it raises as many important questions about the nature of memories and the human mind as the best psychology or philosophy lecture. And for the intelligent, strong stomached film-goer, it will all be worth it in the end. I would expect nothing less from Christopher Nolan.",Memento

I don't think either Nolan or Pearce fully understand it - indeed I suspect there's a deliberate intent to confuse! Personally i think it is trying to be a bit too clever, and it doesn't quite succeed in achieving what it sets out to (unless that was purely confusion!) The first hour is so slow and bewildering I found myself starting to pick holes in the plot and continuity, of which there are a great many. Shot over 25 days and with little room for error, I guess the faults are understandable. The problem is the story doesn't hold your attention long enough to mask them.I suspect after a second viewing I may feel more comfortable with it, but I shall need a long time to recover from the numbness caused by the brain-scrambling complexity of this story. I'm tempted to describe it as pretentious, but I don't think that's entirely fair. Yes it's trying to be clever, but I don't think it's trying to deceive. Nolan is a fairly inexperienced director and I think he has much to offer, so I'm going to cut him some slack. Maybe he bit off more than he could chew with Memento, but you can't accuse him of being boring. I shall certainly be paying close attention to his future projects, as well as trying to unearth some of his early stuff.I think this movie should come with an instruction manual, but failing that perhaps it would be better to get the DVD and watch the interview before the movie. I don't think it will spoil it, and may ease some of the pain. Unfortunately I think it's appeal will be severely limited, and many people will - understandably - be irritated by it. It needs working at, which perhaps isn't what movies are about. After all, this is supposed to be the entertainment industry. If you understand and accept that this film is not light entertainment, and will leave you with more questions than answers, then you must watch it. If nothing else it inspires great debate, which is a good sign for the industry as a whole. I will simply sum it up as flawed, but fascinating.",Memento
221,tburke85,Memento Much Better Than Anticipated,8,8 June 2009,"Memento was a much better film than anticipated from acclaimed writer/director Christopher Nolan the man behind films like The Prestige, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and last years blockbuster hit The Dark Knight which was my favorite movie of 2008. In Memento Nolan really establishes himself as an extremely talented filmmaker. Memento has an intricate but not too complicated story and the way the movie plays out with the ending in the beginning and the beginning at the end makes it feel different (in a good way) and original. Its one of those films to watch a couple times to fully understand what it was all about and so that you can pick up on little things you didn't notice the first time around. The surprises in store for anyone who hasn't seen it I wasn't quite expecting myself which made the film very enjoyable to watch at least to me. The three leads in the movie are admirable in their roles including Guy Pearce as Leonard a man with a rare brain disorder after an accident who can't form new memories. Pearce's Leonard is after the one who raped and killed his wife a man's identity he can never know for sure. Pearce is believable in the role and does a great job as the main character. Carrie Anne-Moss does a decent job as Natalie an ally to Leonard who helps in his quest to find his wife's killer but may not be who she appears. Moss is quite good at playing a character you're not sure is trying to help Leonard or just using him. The same can go for Joe Pantoliano whose equally impressive as Teddy a man Leonard isn't sure whether he can fully trust. The rest of the relatively unknown cast also turn in solid performances. The ending is fitting which reveals some secrets while keeping other questions unanswered but that doesn't hurt the movie. Overall Memento was much better than expected because of it's interesting revenge story, complex characters played by talented actors, and surprising plot twists that make for an above average entertaining thriller to watch.",Memento

I didn't even care what happened before because what was happening on screen was so monumentally dull. And the tattoo element? Gimme a break man. It's where the whole thing unraveled for me. The whole premise is ridiculous, and if the premise is nonsense how can an interesting movie result? Right, it can't. It's artsy rubbish, and the conversations are absurd, annoying and completely unrealistic. It's not unique or interesting in any way. It's rather simple, actually. The back and forth of black and white and color only adds to the overall feeling of a director who really has no clear vision of where to take his film. I didn't like the constant narration either. This is a below average film, make no mistake about it. The sort of film people congradulate themselves on for figuring out at the coffee house with their ""film afficianado"" buddies. The acting was flatline and lifeless. All praise heaped on this are unwarranted. I can't see what the fuss is about. It's just a typical Hollywood piece of dirt going backwards instead of forward. Not complicated. It's got all the same elements that are dense in a movie that goes in a linear direction. Redundant. Bland. Unbelievable. It's got everything to make a movie fail. I'm so tired of people getting rich and famous by making garbage like this. This sort of averageness should not be rewarded or praised. What a world.....",Memento
223,Aly200,A Stroke of Genius,9,26 July 2012,"I always enjoy a great mind boggling film;'Memento' is one of the best ever. Christopher Nolan incorporates a sophisticated plot that you never know where you're going throughout the movie unless you pay close attention to the events that occur in the film. What grabs my attention is the mystery of how the plot unfolds surrounding Leonard's explanation of how he came to murder Teddy, but is what he saying really the truth? The answer is that we don't know since there is no reliable narrator to verify our suspicions or tell us what really happened. The reason is because LEONARD IS THE NARRATOR and he wants to believe that his actions are just and that his story about how his wife died and he got his 'condition' is the truth. But that is for the viewer to decide as he or she actually watches the film.",Memento
224,dpolwatte,Memento (2000) : Anything serving as a reminder or warning. [Dictionary.com],9,5 December 2018,"Memento (2000) by Christopher Nolan is one of the breakthrough films of his career and may be one of the greatest films ever made.Now that the audiences know this what can a Sri Lankan film fan like me can give new to the readers.Memento is a 2000 american neo-noir psychological thriller film after Nolan's ""Following (1998)"" which was kind of the same film making which later becomes his world renowned iconic film making style.Like many of initial films Memento explores the dark human conditions and it's cold heartedness with psychopathy infused. And also he brings his great editing and story telling techniques to the film in a grand scale.This is a most talked about film and needs multiple viewings, Now with my busy schedules I only watched it once and I'm like really confused but awed by it's film making competence.The story is about a guy called Leonard as a result of a past trauma, suffers from anterograde amnesia, the inability to form new memories and suffers short-term memory loss approximately every five minutes. He is searching for the persons who attacked him and killed his wife, using an intricate system of Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track information he cannot remember. Memento is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist). The two sequences ""meet"" at the end of the film, producing one complete and cohesive narrative.As a SL film for me Memento is unique noir classic with it's unique confusing narrative style which later becomes nolanites favourite in his films with haunting music, context, acting and depth. This becomes one of the best films ever put to screen in terms of crime and human condition with unique atmosphere.",Memento

Only one problem: Leonard suffers from anterograde amnesia, which means his mind can't record anything new, pretty much.The movie sort of tells itselft backwards. You start from the ending, without much information, and the plot builds itself as the movie continues. It's interesting and well-done. Though this is a slow-paced movie, your curiosity will lead you through its entirety without leaving you bored or anything; you simply want answers and you'll get them.If you pay attention, you'll start feeling like Leonard. Things happen, then they sort of repeat, but you will start questioning if you saw it right, or if it really was like that before, or if you really saw a 1 or an I, things like that.

Christopher Nolan's Memento delivers in spades!The story of a man searching for his wife's killer but unable to retain any short term memories is obviously intriguing. Nolan adds twists by telling the story in reverse and having our ""hero"" aid his memory with tattoos and instant photos.By the end of the film the viewer's head is spinning and we don't know what to make of the previous 90 minutes. Thank God for rewind buttons on DVD remotes!The film is about memory. Nolan brilliantly plays with the viewer's own memory. At first we feel sympathy for Leonard, trying to piece together enough information from his disabled memory to get revenge on his wife's murderer. At the conclusion we realise that in the course of the film we may have played tricks on our own memories. Were the assumptions we made in following the story completely wrong? Were our sympathies misplaced?A lot of the film hangs on the performance of Guy Pearce in the main character and he is brilliant. Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are also excellent in the main supporting roles. Quite simply, one of the best films of the last ten years. You have to watch it!",Memento

""If self-deception can make me happy, I choose to live so."" We must give ourselves a reason to survive, otherwise we will be schizophrenic. But those things we insist on may only be illusions in our own illusions. When I woke up, I looked at the ceiling and asked myself: Who am I and why am I here.

Natalie is woman that under all circumstances met Leonard and used him to help her deal with her problems and in return did a simple thing for him.

230,Old Joe,Some memories are best forgotten. You have to appreciate how original a movie Memento' really is!,10,6 February 2003,"Losing your memory would have to go close to one of the worst experience anyone could ever suffer from. In the movie Memento', we get to see how bad it is to suffer from short term memory loss. It also gives us the chance to see how far a patient of such a disease will go to remember what is most important to him. In the vain of Pulp Fiction', Memento is a movie that has to be seen to be believed. It is no wonder that this movie is so popular with the movie going public around the world. Leonard Shelby wears expensive, tailored suits, drives a late model Jaguar sedan, but lives in cheap, anonymous motels, paying his way with thick wads of cash. Although he looks like a successful businessman, his only work is the pursuit of vengeance: tracking and punishing the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty of locating his wife's killer is compounded by the fact that Leonard suffers from a rare, untreatable form of amnesia'. Although he can recall details of life before his accident' Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he is, where he is going, or why.Christopher Nolan has made one great (but confusing) movie. His style in directing and editing Memento' is quite unique, as no movie has ever been made quite like it before. The story being told in a backward kind of motion makes the audience have to think hard about what they are watching. It also makes the audience feel for a guy like Leonard, whose condition only gets worse and worse as the movie goes on. I am almost 100% sure that Nolan and his brother Jonathan, made up this story in the realisation that it was meant to be confusing. What is also cleverly done by Nolan is the use of black and white and then colour shots. In my opinion, the variations in these shots are used so it confuses the audience even more. 
Guy Pearce's role in Memento' shows me why he is so successful in Hollywood today. Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man on the hunt for his wife's killer. The only problem is that Shelby is suffering from anterior-grade amnesia', a disease that cannot be treated. With Lenny', I feel the audience suffers partly the same condition as he does, and partly does not, as we can remember what has happened in the present. Memento's other main stars include corrupt cop Teddy' (Joe Pantoliano). A friend said of Pantoliano's performance in Memento, he was perfect for the role of Teddy', as he comes across as the mysterious bad guy'. I could not agree more. There is also the character of Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who is a lot like Teddy in her own way. What is similar about these characters is the way they use Leonard's condition to advantage their own situations.
Other characters include Sammy Jenkis (Stephen Tobolowsky), who is a victim we learn about from an old case when Leonard Shelby was an insurance investigator. There is Leonard's wife, Catherine (C.S.I.'s Jorja Fox) who is another fascinating character. Although we do not hear her say much, she is a vital part of this most confusing story. Add in the funny role of Burt (Mark Boone Jnr.), the motel clerk, who openly admits to Lenny that he is ripping him off, by giving him two rooms, but that he will not remember it happening anyway.Yet in no way do any of the characters in Memento' realise they are in a time reversed movie. I am sure that many of the performers would have had to read their scripts many times to understand what was happening from a cinematic point of view. But from an acting prospective, this would have been an easy experience to be part of. Memento also has some interesting devices to tell the story. The way Leonard tries to remember things in the present and the future, via notes tattoos and photographs, making them an important element within the movie. Without them, our hero would not be able to remember anything. Nonetheless, memory is the most vital element in this movie, because without it, people are confused, isolated and abused, which is what happens to our hero', Leonard.  As Lenny mentions early on in the film, ""Memory's unreliable ... Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good. Ask the police; eyewitness testimony is unreliable ... Memory can change the shape of a room or the colour of a car. It's an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted, and they're irrelevant if you have the facts.""  But it has to be ironic that Leonard is the one who narrates Memento', when his recollections and memories of events are inaccurate and jaded. There are also some powerful scenes in Memento'. The one which sticks in my mind the most' has to be where Natalie abuses Leonard, calling his dead wife a whore', snorting smartly that you won't be even able to remember what I have said'.  So, if you watch this movie and it confuses you the first or even the second time, I can assure you that is how you are meant to feel, confused. If you hated watching Memento' the way Christopher Nolan intended, then I can only recommend that you get a hold of the DVD and watch it in chronological order, as it will really help you. Memento also shows how bad mental disease' patients can be abused by healthy people and what lengths sick patients will go to try and keep sane'. Also, if a movie makes you think, then in some way it has been successful in doing something that many movies do not do  making you think. Those sorts of cinematic experiences are the ones that we need to cherish for life, as they are few and far between. Memento is one such experience. CMRS gives Memento': 5 (Brilliant Movie)",Memento

The #10 position in the all-time list is a joke, and it proves that just because a movie has an unusual narrative style, people are always going to give it 10s. There has to be a good story. Not that MEMENTO has a bad story, it's just that it cheats in the end. The entire film, I'm wondering and hoping this character will find his wife's murderer, I'm accepting the storytelling style... and in the end the movie falls flat on its face. What happened to Carrie-Anne Moss? There is no resolution for this character, who is obviously meant to be important for the film. And what was with the ""Sammy"" subplot? Like much else in the film, it doesn't serve much purpose or lead anywhere. Also the black and white scenes are pointless and confusing as hell. In what space in time do they occur? The present, the past? The future, maybe? But maybe I should just watch the movie again. I still recommend it though, if you wanna see something intriguing.",Memento

The ratings of some other movies lose their meaning. They cause some other movies lose their worth. Memento has one of the most smart, brilliant and complicated scripts of all time and also the story editing of the film is the same, it must be very hard to make, as known, the story begins from the end and retrogresses, in terms of direction, it is well, but no more than that, so a good movie, a good crime thriller. The tone of the movie is 'independentish'. I don't say this in a good way or in a bad way, but it just looked me interesting. Even if I could not understand it exactly, there is also a twist at the end. I recently saw The Machinist which I can call Christian Bale's Memento, it was a pretty good movie, but there were plot holes, but there is not in Memento, so I appreciate the effort, but it is neither one of my favorite movies nor a great movie. If its rating had been 7.7 or let's say 8.0, it would have been welcome. Probably it is because the script was brilliant, I agree, but as a movie, generally 8.6 is extremely over.",Memento

It was pretty good back then, but I remember being a bit confused. Now that I've gotten used to Nolan's style, the movie was easier to digest.So, the movie works pretty good if you don't care about what happens after or what happened before the movie. Which might be the point, considering the characters problem.The style of unveiling the movie in a reverse chronology, with a parallel black and white forward moving storyline, that brings both time lines together, is trademark Nolan. Unfortunately, another trademark of Nolan is using one or two characters to unload tons of dialogue as exposition to explain everything that has happened or is about to happen. It's strange, because it feels like Nolan understands that his audience doesn't need to be spoon fed every explanation, but then he relents at some point during every movie and has one person or two explain every minute detail lol, which basically is redundant. Which is what happens in the last 15 to 20 minutes, and really is annoying.Also, there are a couple of missing explanations, like why does Leonard have a significant scratch on his face. It's prominently displayed from beginning to end, but by the end of the movie, it's left unexplained. Secondly, there's a really glaring unexplained point. Throughout the movie, you see Leonard driving a sports car, which you find out over the course of the movie, is how it came into his position and how it appeared in that condition when you see him at the beginning. But you never find out how it got so dirty or scuffed up. Towards the end, the car is driven up by the owner in pristine condition. It's also driven off by Leonard in pristine condition. But when he shows up at his first stop after, the motel, it's all scuffed up. What happened?! Seems like something was left out.The character of Natalie is also not very well explained. What is her motivation for wanting Dodd hurt or killed? Are we to assume she knows her boyfriend was killed by Leonard (which was see near the end), and that was the motivation?Oh, and lastly, the memory wipe seems inconsistent. There doesn't appear to be any time length that he forgets information. For example, in some seasons, he seems to reset after only a short time, but in other scenes, like near the end, he kept the memory for a longer time (like 'Terry' revealing his name as John G, so Leonard later writes down Terry's license plate as the one of his wife's killer).

This hit leaves permanent damage to a part of the brain so that it can not store newer memories in the long term, and can only remember current moments in the short term. However, he does his best to gather information with notes everywhere, photos, and even tattoos to investigate the crime and find the criminals. A rather simple scenario, without action or suspense, with only a few actors and seemingly low cost, but the plot was presented backwards to the people. Starting from the end of the plot until it reaches an earlier point where everything is explained, and which obviously because the protagonist does not remember, he does not know what things have happened and what he has done after the accident.

However, any skepticism about this movie's style being over material is wiped out after the first viewing, if you really get it in the first viewing(which also proves you are cleverer than average). To say that the story in this movie flows backwards is a bit inaccurate because the story is an exploration of the origins of every chapter's confusion and conflicts. Have you ever tried to solve a puzzle because you experienced some terrible trauma? If yes, then Memento could be a very personal experience for you as you relate more and more to the main protagonist. Suppose we are given the tools of Leonard, should we be more competent in making the investigation? Or, are we asking ourselves what's justice and what it takes to be an ethical person? Thinking deep into these questions really made this movie a horror one.Each time a new character pops up in the screen, you would be puzzled by his/her reason to be present, in later segment of the movie you would know what a big crude lie he/she made for Leonard. You see? It's not up to us to decide we are ethical or not given this scenario. You could start like Teddy who wanted to help to end Leonard's misery by helping him and end like Teddy who's tired of Leonard's revenge game and begin to take advantage of that. You could also start like Natalie who's good at manipulating people's emotions, and then found a guy like Leonard a most valuable asset. The problem is anyone who encountered Leonard's condition will automatically become part of his dysfunction. The problem is, no one deserves to live with his condition, yet no one likes to share his burden and take care of his problem. That could be very morally challenging, especially if you had any family/friend who's not so normal.Proverbs 4:23, ""Above all else, guard your heart; for it is the wellspring of life."" Memento explores this script backwards, in which situations Leonard twisted himself again and again in pursuit of vengeance. Many people considered the movie a great plot hole because if Leonard really can't remember anything after the assault, how come he remembered he has the condition and the cops wouldn't help investigating the case? In the end, however, this is answered by Teddy that Leonard just remembered those he wanted to remember, which proves Leonard himself might just be a fraud, who's ""physically capable of making new memories"" but would rather choose to lie to himself. You may pity with him because like an autistic person he is suffering. But, it's Leonard who caged himself in the middle of the misery, and wouldn't let himself go. The horrifying message is that there is already no truth for Leonard because everything he thinks that matters would be forgotten in next minute, yet the only truth left for the audience is that with submarine motivations everyone lies just like Leonard and Teddy. However, thanks to the Bible which tells us people CAN choose to lie or to tell the truth(even mentally-challenged person like Leonard). Notably, Memento doesn't follow popular philosophies and wasn't so ignorant about that fact.9/10, very impressive and compelling, needed instructions for young audiences.",Memento
251,ryan_kuhn,"""Now... where was I?""",9,13 February 2005,"Christopher Nolan gives us two things to think about with Memento. One is what would it be like if you couldn't remember what you did 5 minutes ago. Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby who lost his ability to hold on to short term memory after an altercation in his home, where his wife was murdered. Ever since then, Shelby has been trying to track down the murder of his wife, armed with a Poleroid Camera and a pen to tattoo his body with important notes, jotting down notes before he forgets what to write down. Nolan also complicates matters (or challenges the audience) by telling the story backwards, we see the last scene first, and the first scene of the movie, if told linearly, last. This adds mystery to an intriguing story, as we find out things about the characters after we see how they react. Between the scenes, we watch Shelby talk on the phone, to who we don't know, but it fill us in on his disorder and how much he remembers before his accident. Leonard Shelby lives like he died one day, and he sleeps walk through the rest of his life. Joe Pantoliano plays an auto mechanic who may or may not be helping Shelby through his ordeals, and Carrie-Anne Moss plays a woman who may or may not be helping Shelby as well. Much like a Tarantino film, the time warping used by Memento is a gimmick that actually enhances the story. While we see what happened last first, the story, what we are shown, works linearly, the climax of the story would be the first scene in the movie, but here, it's last and fits in much better. The filler material that we see between action sequences adds depth to the emotional torture Shelby goes through. Pearce plays Shelby very well, acting confused when he should be confused, the film never takes shortcuts. For once, the audience knows just as much about everything as the main character does, putting the audience on an even level as the character, we're not going to hear him say something just out of the blue. We all try to put the pieces together, and that puts us in the movie. Just like the Seinfeld episode that was backwards, you have to pay attention, we know where we are going, now, where were we?",Memento
252,MamadNobari97,A mindblowing movie,9,12 October 2019,"This movie is very unique and Nolan is a master at making superb films. The editing is so good don't know why it didn't win an Oscar for it. The acting is very good from all the characters and definitely from Carrie-Anne Moss. That scene with her getting into her car is the best scene of the movie.Only problem I have with this movie is that the ending twist wasn't shocking at all, like, I don't mean it wasn't shocking shocking but that the narrative of the movie was in a way that in the end you still don't know if this is the real twist or Teddy is lying and it's not true and there's gonna be another twist. That's what I felt when I reached that scene, I thought it's another one of ""those"" sequences and there's gonna be another ""before"" scene but then I checked the run time and it was 5 mins to the end of the movie and I was like ""oh I guess this is it, this is the final twist and the truth about the whole story.""But that's just how I felt, it's not something inherently wrong with the movie.

I knew right away this artist was going to be special and he has not disappointed to date. This is one of the very best films in the crime / thriller genre. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, settings, editing, score, cinematography and acting. Pearce, Moss and Pantoliano deliver superb performances. Pearce commands the screen. His narration intensifies the mystery as the journey unfolds. The score also plays just as an important role as the characters as it adds to the thrilling and intense tone of the film. The plot revolves around a man named Leonard who is trying to track down the person who raped and murdered his wife. Leonard's main obstacle is he suffers from a rare untreatable form of memory loss. The only way for him to remember anything, even from minutes earlier, is through tatoos and instant photographs. Leonard is accompanied in his quest for vengeance by a man named Teddy who only adds to the mystery. The plot is clever, psychological, gripping, thrilling, violent, duplicitous, phenomenal, brilliant and has a cathartic ending. The plot is conveyed in reverse chronology which I've never seen before and left this viewer guessing until the very end which is actually the beginning.

257,patryk-czekaj,A fresh and intriguing idea in a confusing mind game,8,2 July 2012,"Memento, based on a short story by Jonathan Nolan and directed by his brother Christopher, is an essentially unconventional crime thriller, which due to its own nonlinear narrative technique and purposely confusing storyline, makes it somehow hard to categorize as such or as any other specific genre.Leonard Shelby (by any means don't call him Lenny), played persuasively by Guy Pearce, is a once successful insurance agent, who witnessed the rape and murder of his wife in his own home. What's more, the assassin has left him with an untreatable illness known as short-term memory loss. The last thing that Leonard is able to remember is the death of his wife, and thus, he is now on a deadly and vicious hunt for the man who took the love of his life and left him handicapped. On his journey he meets a few mysteriously suspicious people (especially Nathalie and Teddy), who sometimes want to take advantage of 'this thing that he has'. His brain isn't able to work in a proper manner, so in order to understand where he lives, who he meets, what he did, and what's the real purpose of his actions, he takes photos of people and locations and even tattoos important notes all over his body. When someone tries to discourage him by saying 'you aren't going to remember your revenge' he convincingly states: 'my wife deserves the revenge whether I remember it or not' and 'the world doesn't disappear when you close your eyes'.In the movie the viewer encounters two interconnected stories, one told forward (in black and white) and the other backwards (in colors). The former goes on as we see Leonard talking on the phone with an unknown person, while he reminisces about a man named Sammy Jankis, who had to deal with a similar memory loss problem. The latter shows all the events that lead up to the first scene (shot overlooking a negative of a dead person and a killing prior to that), actually revealing all the missing elements. Even though with every consecutive sequence the story starts to take shape and becomes less and less complicated, it still is confusing. But that's good, because the viewer has to assume that this is the sole purpose of the movie, and re- watching it or reading various interpretations online won't support us with any new hints, only random divagations and probably more confusion on the way. That's why I think the movie leaves the best impression when seen only once.Considering the fact that the narrative technique is straightly nonlinear, Leonard still operates on a daily basis in the regular timeline known to human mind. He isn't able to form any new memories, so the fact that the viewer observes all the events in a totally different order doesn't necessarily help the main character.As we move on with the often perplexing storyline we stumble onto a maze, which sort of produces another maze, and, in the process, intentionally creates a puzzle within a puzzle (with the peculiar interest in riddles and perplexing plots it's easy to see why Nolan went on to direct Inception in 2010). Memento is said to be one of the most scientifically accurate movies that deal with the problem of memory loss. In psychological evaluation, it not only realistically explains all the symptoms of this illness, but also presents one man's struggle to go on living his life no matter whether he will remember it or not. He just needs to have a certain goal that will make it all worthwhile. And the surprising ending, which I won't spoil here, gives him exactly wanted he wanted, and, in a deeper sense, all his actions seem to be justified in the thrilling finale.",Memento
258,lagriff05,Problematic.,7,26 August 2009,"This is just...I don't even know. I watched this years ago and was really blown away by its odd structure, but really it's rather simple once you get a grip on it - heinously simple, even. It's told backwards in a linear line and interspersed with black and white shots of the lead actor telling us the back story, so what? This movie is given a lot of credit for being complex, but it's not that mind boggling when you think about it. And the ending just feels like a huge slap in the face, especially after all that build up and guessing...it's deceitful! And a lot of the first half of this is just too dull at times - especially the bits where the lead character is telling you about his client in the past who had a similar condition. It just feels too forced; they could have done it in a better and more interesting way. But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a good movie anyway. The deceit of the ending has its purpose and everything is fulfilled in the end; I just can't help feeling a little odd about it anyway. The strength of this movie just lies in the suspense that comes with it. Deceitful or not, it keeps you watching and guessing until the end. Sigh, this is a really dividing movie, as you can tell. You just don't know what to think about it, and I guess that's another good thing about it. Memento is a perplexing case and I would recommend it if you like thrillers - although you could always do better, this one definitely stands out.",Memento
259,Come-and-Review,"Clever, dark and distressing",10,20 June 2015,"That is what we can call the ""Nolan effect"". Every time I saw a Nolan movie for the first time I was catched by a feeling of anxiety, almost afraid of what could happen, but also amused by the smartness of the story, except for Interstellar, which is to me so far the less violent of Nolan's works.Memento has all of these things - a smartly delivered plot, with quite mature contents and a deal of distression - at an exponentially higher level than the other movies. Not only the darkest and most bloody to me, but also the most cleverly shown: with the trick of how we see the sujet, we truly see the movie from Leonard Shelby's perspective, although knowing a little more than himself. What I found interesting was also that even if the ending in the Sujet wasn't chronologically the end, it actually did deliver a 'finale' feeling, which is remarkable. Being the first Nolan film to get some notoriety, it doesn't have stunning views as the others which are covered by the good acting of all the actors: Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss (otherwise seen in 'the Matrix'), Joe Pantoliano and even Stephen Tobolowsky's silent, almost cameo appearance worked well. The music, composed by a composer I never heard before, David Julyan, managed to bring in the right atmosphere.Homever, remember that even if it has minimal to no gore, this movie is very intense. Some of the flashbacks related to the wife's gruesome murder are disturbing, (MINIMAL SPOILERS BEGIN) and around the middle the plot's on going makes viewers start to expect that Leonard has an even darker backstory that luckily is not what we discover in the movie. (MINIMAL SPOIELRS END) Although also the actual outcome is quite dark. So I suggest a quite deal of courage to watch this movie. Again, this movie is the most intense Nolan movie from his career. On a scale from 1 to 100, If Memento is ranked 100, the dark knight is ranked 45, inception 35, and interstellar 10.",Memento

Based on a short story brother by Jonanthan Nolan, the film is both inventive and compelling as it tells it's story in small chapters moving backwards through the narrative. This editing style is unique to the point that you really feel as though you are witnessing something that has never been done before. The story itself is very simple, the execution is a work of sheer excellence. Guy Pearce is Leonard Shelby, a man who through personal tragedy has lost the ability to create new memories beyond ten minutes and has to to keep detailed records of everything he does in order to function. Early on we learn the catalyst for Leoonard's memory dysfunction was the murder of his wife. Through tattooed notes inked over most of his body, Leonard is slowly gathering clues as to who her killer may be. Christopher Nolan's film is an intimate experience that stays thoroughly focused as the details gradually unravel. In many ways it's the closest equivalent to a compelling page turner as you find yourself eagerly awaiting the next chapter and slice of information. That intimate focus really allows the viewer to become involved in the mystery and gives you ample opportunity within to play detective yourself.

264,sandnair87,Nolan's Brain-Wringing Memento will Not Be Easily Forgotten!,9,30 April 2015,"Many psychological thrillers rely on twists to deliver their climactic pay-off. But director Christopher Nolan's brain-wringing psycho noir Memento isn't just a movie with a twist - It is a twist! Essentially, Memento is a straightforward revenge flick with the central protagonist out to track down the man who raped and murdered his wife. But this standard plot comes with an ingenious twist, as we soon find out that our befuddled hero is on a voyage of self- discovery like no other. Matters are complicated by the fact that the person investigating the killing Leonard Shelby (an outstanding Guy Pearce, eliciting sympathy and hinting at the rage behind his obsession, while also leavening the character with moments of humor) has the memory of a goldfish – a rare form of amnesia leaving him with no short-term memory. Forced to record everything with copious notes, Polaroid photographs and even tattoos, Leonard's obsession leads him into a world where no one can be trusted. This coupled with Christopher Nolan's audacious conceit that necessitates the plot to run backwards, makes Memento a dazzling, highly original 'anti-thriller'. Thus, we begin with the climactic murder then regress through the events that led up to it to wind up, well, at the beginning!Memento is a mesmerizing mind-bender, a diabolical and absorbing experience that requires a lot of concentration, but the stunning final scene is ample reward. Christopher Nolan builds a mousetrap of a neo-noir, using the tricky gimmick of a complex, purposefully disorienting narrative that puts us in the scrambled mind of its protagonist. As the strangely captivating screenplay unfolds in scenes of reverse order, he gives us a taste of Leonard's frustrating existence: events unfolding for the audience in the same way they unfold for Pearce's character. We're thrown out of time and robbed of the comfort of a (chrono)logical unspooling of information. Nolan cranks up the suspense, keeps the story sharp and pacey, and isn't afraid to layer in a little ultra-black humor. The impact is insidious - chances are your brain will be replaying this fiendish puzzle of a film for months to come.Christopher Nolan's cinematic gaze into an abyss of madness, obsession, identity and wrath remains a compelling puzzle long after its revelations have rolled out. Of all the ironies which fill the film, the most complementary may be that this is film which will not soon be forgotten.",Memento

266,budmassey,A monumentally over-rated wankfest.,1,5 September 2001,"After all this time, I am still not sure why I hate this movie so much. Perhaps it is because so much undeserved praise was heaped on this pretentious and presumptuous MTV video with aspirations to being a ""serious"" movie. It meanders, sometimes careens, from one gratuitous plot twist to the next, yet in reality very little actually happens. In the end, this is not a bad approach if we are going to get character development instead. Alas, none is here. The characters might as well have had their profiles tattooed on them, like the main character does, because they are no less obvious and devoid of subtlety. Memento confuses plot intricacy for story, of which there is precious little here. Granted the story had to be sparse to further the self-conscious conceit that ties up this formulaic and trite little package with a bow. Now don't get me wrong. Any film that causes us to reconsider what we think we know and to see things in ways to which we are not accustomed is great. But that must not be confused with clumsy subterfuges designed to suggest one thing and mean another. That's just plain silly and cheap, a mindless maze that wanders aimlessly until the author runs out of gas. That's what we have here.Guy Pearce, the Other Australian Actor, is good, reminding me at times of Brad Pitt before he demonstrated so convincingly time and again his epic lack of talent. Unlike Brad, though, Guy is talented. Perhaps too talented for such a claustrophobic little film. And what's up with Joe Pantoliano? Let's see, maybe we can give just him a sandwich board to carry around announcing his ulterior motive in every scene. He is the most typecast actor around, and he could phone in a performance with more mystery and finesse. Still without Guy and Joe, formidable talents in better vehicles, this film would be desolate. Oh, there's lots of little black and white vignettes, and the story is told backwards which has been universally acclaimed as genius, but which, at least for me, smacks of artifice and cliché.Look beyond the gimmickry, and you have a film that aches for a purpose, a theme, a message. What it has instead is a sort of Michael Mann vapidity that even throws in the car and the suit. Holy Don Johnson, Batman.I cannot begin to tell you how over-rated this movie is.

That's because the less you know about it, the more fun - and frustrating - the film will be to watch. I highly recommend this, it's one of the best of 2000 and simply too original to miss.Since we are never quite sure what just happened, we not only understand what Leonard's going through, we literally go through the exact same thing. The motivations and intentions of the characters Leonard meets are never quite clear to us and we're never sure if anyone really means what he or she says. This and the power of the final scene (which, had it been the first scene, would have reduced the film's impact enormously) is what makes the plot structure more than a gimmick - it's essential to the power of the story to tell it in this order.Speaking of fantastic acting - with this and his vital supporting role in ""L.A. Confidential"" under his belt, the real mystery is why Guy Pearce isn't one of the biggest stars in Hollywood today. I honestly couldn't see anyone else playing Leonard Shelby. He might come off a bit wooden at first, but it's really just the way his character is written - he believably portrays paranoia and confusion later (or should that be earlier?) on in the film. Carrie-Ann Moss is wonderfully convincing and cold and Joe Pantoliano is just one of those actors who can't seem to screw up a single line on dialogue. I wouldn't want to change a single casting choice.Change the scenes to run in chronological order and there's still Nolan's witty script, fantastic acting and characterization, and slick visuals to enjoy, but the film's true power is really in its structure.It's also a movie which needs several viewings to be completely understood, but its plot is far from incomprehensible - as soon as you understand the system by which the scenes have been arranged, you just need to put the pieces together. The answers are all there for those who look for them. The use of black-and-white photography for some scenes is very helpful and a nice touch.The new millennium has just started and, as if from out of nowhere, comes English director Christopher Nolan with his confusing, frustrating, groundbreaking, atmospheric and 100% original masterpiece, Memento. It's a film that will quickly grow a huge cult following for its ingenious plot structure and editing, and deservedly so.

Compliments also go to Guy Pearce, for creating a compelling character I believe psychiatrists will discuss for years to come.

274,schroeder-gustavo,Great Original Thriller,8,5 June 2015,"Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors working today. I have yet to see two of his earlier films but I can say that until this day he has yet to disappoint. Memento is oozing with originality and demands to be seen more than once, which brings me to one of the ""flaws"" of the movie. The thing about the film is that when you finish it, you will want to watch it again to put the pieces of the puzzle together, but once you do that is pretty much it. A second viewing of the film does not enrich the experience, the characters don't get better like in better Nolan films like The Dark Knight and really all you do is understand the plot better. Another flaw the movie has is I wish they would have explained the nature of Pierce's condition a little bit more thoroughly.

275,Pavel-8,One of the best ever.,10,12 March 2003,"**Warning!  Mild Spoilers Ahead!**After watching this slick and unique thriller, I was partially confused and entirely satisfied.  The concept of telling part of the story backwards, while not completely original, brought a freshness to the movie and provided that rare and enjoyable thinking theater experience.  Days, weeks, months, even years after I first saw it, I still discuss it w/ friends as we argue about what really happened.  The acting was stellar.  Carrie-Anne Moss surprised as a foul-mouthed vixen with questionable motives.  Guy Pearce displayed his confusion and intentions subtly and effectively.  Joe Pantoliano was his usual solid self as the shady Teddy.  And the supporting cast filled their roles admirably. 
Plus, the film was technically superior.  The timing of the jumps back and forth in time was perfect.  What makes the film is the script and the direction.  This would not have been an easy story to tell in chronological order, let alone in this manner.  Christopher Nolan has the story completely under his control the entire time, providing a tight and taut film experience.Bottom line: Flat-out brilliant film-making and story-telling.

The reverse chronological order makes it a challenging experience. This is really a film that gives you much substance for discussion, because you might not really understand all about it. Whether or not full understanding is possible at all is a question I haven't answered for myself. Did his wife actually die? Was it himself who killed her? Who can he really trust?

It starts at the end, and ends at the start. More and more of the story is reveled from the story as it goes on. That is one of the most original ways of telling a story ever. Acting is nice also. The dialogue is very good. Throughout time will change. A situation will be happening that you don't totally understand. We get to see different sides of characters unfold that we didn't see because the person we see this movie through forgot. This makes it a mystery to be solved at the beginning.

281,cdjh-81125,There's No Other Movie Like This,10,10 June 2016,Memento is a movie that is actually quite hard to review because it is so unique and different but I'm going to try to do it anyway. First of all this movie is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan he adds such suspense and mystery to every shot and scene in this movie. The movie is one that intentionally played in reverse by starting of a scene in a certain situation and the next scene will take place before that explaining how he got into that situation it's works perfectly for Memento as it is a perfect way to put the viewer in Leonard situation and reflect how much his condition holds him back. Guy Pearce in my opinion is a good actor who can really do wonders when given the right script and wonders is exactly what he did here as this today remains his best and most complex performance because through his performance you are able to feel sorry for him while still being able to be untrustworthy. Carrie Ann Moss is also very good in this movie as like Leonard you don't know how to trust her and she is the polar opposite of Leonard selfish and manipulative. The screenplay in this move is one of the best ever written in my opinion as there's just no other movie like this and every scene has a new mystery to it. Memento is in my top 20 movies of all time at is really should just how good a written and director Christopher Nolan is continuing to keep up this standard over 15 years later. 100%-A+,Memento

It is a challenge to the viewer, and provokes great doubt in one's own thought processes. It is about a man named Lenny played well by Guy Pearce. He witnesses his wife's murder, however, this fact evolves throughout the film. Lenny has to continually photograph his own life with a Polaroid camera in order to elicit his own memory traces. This is due to the fact that he suffers from anterograde amnesia from the concussion he received during the trauma to his wife. The cinematography is remarkable in that it transitions repeatedly from black and white to color. Neurologically, it is an accurate portrayal of this infirmity. Artistically, it is absorbing to the point that it deserves great praise. The director shows intense insight. The actors all give a convincing performance, and I can highly recommend this movie which is now out on DVD.

285,iamtherobotman,Needless backward storytelling,3,8 March 2018,"So I just recently watched this having been told it was a 'complex' thriller.Imagine my disappointment when I discovered it was only 'complex' due to the editing.The story itself is actually extremely simplistic and were it just edited in sequence there would be no complication about it. The way the editing is done just needlessly complicates it.We see him shoot someone, it cuts to him meeting someone else, we see that scene play out then it replays the scene but from further back in time, then cuts back to the shooting then cuts back to the meeting from a different angle to then return to the moments before the shooting to then switch back to a moment we haven't seen before until it returns to that scene after showing us the ending of the previous meeting which came after the shooting but before the events leading up to the shooting and after the scene we hadn't seen before.
It then jumps to the scene we hadn't seen before to then come back to the meeting of the shooting before they introduce another scene which shows the reason for the shooting which took place before the meeting we didn't see until the car was stolen...yes there's a stolen car, then the shooting is confused with the meeting before the meeting we haven't seen which led to the car being shot up and the guy chasing him after he'd had his meeting.With me so far?The meeting was set up by the guy who was not in the film but was spoken about when he injected his wife with insulin, the shooting happened again though it only actually happened once but the meeting took longer than expected before the insulin injection which killed the wife, or did it? The car which was stolen was not stolen but was stolen, the shooter had a car but decided to kill them anyway and they all lived happily ever after in a tattoo parlour.Yeah just pseudo intellectual rubbish really. Tried to be far too clever for its own good and it didn't really work i'm afraid to say.

Leonard said something like, ""I guess for when I've done it."" Then later, towards the very end, I noticed the ""I did it"" tattoo on his chest, around that same spot, in a brief shot with his wife. I assumed it meant that Leonard had already killed the man who raped his wife (as Teddy had told him), but I checked the trivia section and the person who posted the trivia seemed to think that ""I did it"" referred to Leonard killing his wife.

287,ajdagreat,"love the movie, hate the hype",10,29 November 2001,"Every time a very good modern movie comes around, it automatically joins the top-ranked of movies at IMDB. ""Memento"" is the prime example of this practice, since at the time I'm writing this it's #9 on the list, beating out so many classics it's not even funny. Yes, I really enjoyed this movie...but #9 of all time? I think not. In fact, 30 of the top 100 movies on the IMDB's top 250 list are made 1990 or later. I think that's just ridiculous. Come on, people! Don't you watch the classics?But indeed, ""Memento"" may deserve to be in the top 100 more than ""Moulin Rouge"" or ""Toy Story 2."" ""Memento"" is a movie that really takes some thought. I didn't quite grasp the plot the first 1 and 1/2 times I saw it, so I looked on the Internet for some interpretation. SPOILERS BEGINI still don't understand a few things though, a few minor details. Was Natalie really beaten up by Dodd, or did she just lie to Leonard because she wanted Dodd killed? Is Teddy a crooked cop mixed up in drugs, or did he just want an easy way to kill Jimmy the drug dealer?As for the message in ""Memento"", I recall reading ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" waaaaaay back in high school (last year). One of the key messages in that book was, well, that it's a sin to kill a mockingbird. Why? Because mockingbirds are innocent and have no means of defending themselves. Atticus teaches this lesson to Scout to tell her not to exploit the weak and innocent. That is seen later in the book because that is exactly what Bob Ewell is doing to Tom Robinson.In my opinion, ""Memento"" has a similar moral. I can't think of a single character who didn't exploit Leonard's weakness somewhere during the movie. Teddy did it. Natalie did it. The hotel guy did it. Even that guy sitting at the bar who spit in his drink did it. And then finally, in the last scene of the movie, Leonard does it to himself. He exploits his own weakness. He lies to himself. Now that is deep. SPOILERS ENDYes, it's the best movie that's been made in a while, but as they say, they don't make 'em like they used to.

288,C22Man,As Hollow as it is Pretentious,2,17 July 2016,"Memento is a film that I will never be able to understand the hype around. A curious but completely uninvolving piece from a director often criticised for being all brain and no heart (maybe the signs for that began earlier than most think). The whole draw of the film was its backwards moving narrative which reveals the details of the story in reverse order. I can only ask, what happens when that isn't enough? Take that away and this is a lacklustre, rambling, confused film that is trying to bite off more than it can chew. No matter how much you try to get away from it, the film is based entirely around a gimmick. Sure it's an inventive one, but you take that away and you're left with a bland murder mystery that plays out with equally dull individuals. Our lead character Leonard suffers from a form of amnesia, were he can't create new memories, and is trying to figure out who killed his wife by using clues that he has already created. This structure itself is just a mess. We see Leonard write on polaroid's and try to recall events, we see a scene play out, then another scene happen which is connected to the beginning of what we just saw and so on. I'm not exaggerating, over two thirds of the film are exactly that. It gets tiresome about half an hour in. There's no suspense or mystery because we've just seen what will happen, so what's there to be invested in? How he got there isn't of any interest.The film is ice cold. Too distant. Far out of reach. Way too impersonal. There is no way the audience can get connected to anything that takes place. The film makes no attempt to get us to sympathise with Leonard bar his mental obstacle, which isn't enough, and the rest of the characters are just sleazebags or wholly unpleasant. The actions of the characters make little sense, even once you find out their true motivation. Teddy's role is one which should have been mysterious and gripping, but it started off as baffling and ended up making no sense whatsoever by the time the film concludes. I actually realised that I wouldn't have cared at all about anything that takes place in the film if it had been told in chronological order. The further it progressed (or is it regressed?), the more detached and bored I felt. In Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano you have some fine actors that are completely wasted in parts that don't allow them to do anything of interest. All of them are shackled to the plot and restrained as a result. I feel for Pearce the most, he's playing a character so thinly sketched and loaded with quirks that there's virtually nothing he can do with the role. It's here that the entire narrative device falls down too. If it is trying to put us in his shoes then it fails because we feel nothing for the character. Beyond that Leonard is simply a muddled lead, and not just because of amnesia. He has tattoos all over his body that offer him information which he doesn't remember getting and yet he trusts what is written completely. If he has no short-term memory then how can he believe any of the details to be correct? That's not even nit-picking, that's a major flaw that isn't explained. There are a host of plot holes like that based around the entire memory loss area. This is clearly Nolan's attempt to craft a twisting film that can measure up to the ones made by the likes of Kubrick and Hitchcock. Something deeply psychological and with a noir twinge, with the reverse chronology being an added bonus. His first problem is that he doesn't create suspense properly. Partly because we're already a step ahead of the characters, partly because he's given us characters that we cannot gain a connection to. Then you have the writing. The dialogue is painfully simple at times, just lacking any dynamism or sharpness that could hold our attention. It's as if Nolan thinks the characters have to spell out what already a simple plot because we're too stupid to get it. I have little problems with his camera-work and the shooting style is vibrant, but it's clear that this is his debut and it's one he fails to get a grasp of. Maybe he was trying to be too ambitious by going straight for such a story first time round, I'm not too sure.The film ends with a twist that is so nonsensical on a grand scale that I can't help but feel angered that I sat through the entire thing. All of that for such a lousy payoff. What is key to note is that there is no substance to anything. It is a very basic mystery wrapped up in a gimmick that will make people think it's doing something unique and propelled by characters that are as one-note as possible. It is borderline pretentious. It's almost like people think that because the narrative style is unique that the film must be exceptional. Well the main thing stopping that is that it's not remotely entertaining or interesting to watch. It doesn't matter how clever a film is, if it's a dull mess then it's a dull mess.",Memento
289,KFL,Superb examination of the role of memory,10,25 March 2002,"Having seen this movie twice, I have come to appreciate that it is very carefully constructed, and has something important to say about both the importance of memory, and the dangers inherent in the kind of thumbnail encapsulations of others that Leonard is forced to rely upon.Spoilers follow...please read no further if you haven't seen the movie.Roger Ebert and others have complained that Leonard's very awareness of his own condition is a contradiction:  He should not be able to even remember that he has short-term memory loss. But Leonard is, in fact, able to gradually assimilate information over time--partly through repetition. He tells us this much himself, at one point. In fact, it is this conditioning that holds the key to understanding the central surprises of the movie. Leonard has ""conditioned"" himself to ""remember""--but this artificial ""memory"" is flawed:  he doesn't want to face the fact that he himself was responsible for his wife's death, for example, and so he misremembers the insulin episode as having happened to Sammy. (Leonard presumably would have been nonplussed had he been asked how he knew about Sammy's wife's death: Sammy certainly couldn't have told him.) We see this ""conditioning""--this propensity to remember, selectively, what he wants to remember--most forcefully (and perhaps a bit heavy-handedly) at the end, when he writes down Teddy's license plate number, effectively making him the next ""John G.""Leonard's inability to remember implies an inability to forget what went before--and so highlights, by its absence, the healing power of time--which is, after all, only the memories intervening between the present and some past event. For Leonard, there are no such memories, hence time has, in a sense, stopped for him. He himself recognizes that he has no chance to heal.Contrast this with the situation in the 1993 Harold Ramis Twilight Zonish-comedy ""Groundhog Day"". Here the situation is reversed:  Phil Connors is the only one with any recollection of a series of Groundhog Days. It is almost as if Phil lives in a world populated by Leonards. Just as others use Leonard for their own purposes, so Phil, with his unique ability to remember, is able to use and abuse others. More importantly, Phil is able to heal, able to remake himself into something new and better, precisely the way that Leonard cannot.Despite a few minor snags in the storyline (and Leonard's awareness of his own condition is not one of them), this is a very well-crafted tale that repays repeated viewings and reflection.9/10",Memento
290,w00f,A Truly Subversive Movie,8,22 September 2003,"Memento is a very interesting film.  The story is actually nothing special, save for the device of the lead character's memory condition providing a good reason for the mystery in a mystery story to come at the beginning of a film rather than the end.  The director does an excellent job of stringing together a story backwards through time.There are no great performances in this film; the acting is adequate.  I loved it in the end though, but probably for an unusual reason.This film plays, in the end, on the viewer's own short-term memory.  Most people don't pay all that much attention to a movie.  We're all used to lots of action.  Our minds wrap around the big things in a film.  We've been conditioned to remember the sex, violence, explosions -- things that have big impacts on the consciousness.This film has almost none of that at all, however.  The story is held together by little details.  If one can hold onto the memories of the details long enough, then one can also figure out the ""end"" of the story about halfway through the film.  If one cannot, then one has actually become Leonard, the lead actor... lost in disjointed time that moves in fits and starts, like constantly awakening from dreams.I enjoyed this movie (and I did enjoy it a great deal) because it is the living embodiment of ""art imitates life.""  The audience is Leonard, the director is Teddy, and the film itself is, when all is said and done, a depiction of how most of us actually experience life, and certainly how we experience the film itself.Ask yourself what you remember of the big, loud films that get the big box office every time -- The Matrix, X-Men, any of the Star Wars films.

I couldn't take my eyes off it. Completely engrossing tale, told completely backwards.The effect really puts you into the world of Leonard Shelby, the main character. An insurance adjuster who has been inflicted with short-term memory loss during a brutal attack that killed his wife. His world is one where he cannot understand what's happening around him because he can't remember what just happened 5 minutes ago. He is forced to take polaroids and write notes on the photographs to keep people and events straight. Watching the movie leaves the same sensation, as you don't know what happened just before. You actually have to continually think through the movie to understand the perspective of what you are currently watching. The experience was unlike anything I had experienced before, but I enjoyed it immensely. Bear in mind, though, you will have to see the movie more than once to put it all together.Guy Pearce was superb, and seemed to be enjoying himself with the character.If you're looking for something very unique, and intellectually challenging, you will be highly rewarded by watching this movie.

292,Lucabrasisleeps,Christopher Nolan is a magician,10,21 November 2008,"Christopher Nolan is a magician. No other way to put it.This movie ended up on my top ten list when I saw it a few years ago. It is one of the most original thrillers to have come from America and it supposedly became popular solely on the basis of word of mouth.Leonard Shelby(Guy Pearce in an excellent performance) is a man who has short term memory loss. He is a man on a mission. He is determined to find out who killed his wife. He has various ways to remind himself of small facts - writing them on notes and sticking them on the wall, tattooing facts on his body and so on. The story also involves two other characters - Natalie and a man named Teddy who seems to have a shady past. There is also the story of Sammy Jenkis which is told in bits and pieces by Leonard in disjointed scenes. Sammy also had the same problem which led to Sammy being placed in a mental institution.The main feature of this movie is that it goes backwards. Which means that the scene that follows is actually the incident which happens prior to the current situation. This is quite demanding for the viewer and people with short attention spans may not appreciate this movie so much. Repeated viewings may be required to actually understand what is going on in the movie.What I liked about the movie was the fact that despite the complex and confusing style, it is ultimately a movie which is not inaccessible. It is no art film which might bore viewers to tears. It is a fast moving thriller which can keep a viewer hooked and this is what separates Memento from other such complex thrillers. Most importantly, it is the little facts and clues that are the most interesting. The loose ends are tied up expertly at the end with such brilliance that I am still at awe at the execution even several years after watching this movie.Overall, it is in fact quite depressing. There is not one likable character in this movie, except for Leonard, and we see how his medical condition is used by people to serve their own interests. It presents a bleak view of human nature, in many ways.As far as the performances are concerned, Guy Pearce is fabulous as the determined but confused Leonard Shelby. Carrie Anne moss is brilliant as the mysterious Natalie who may have other motives in helping Leonard. She has the right kind of mix of beauty and mysteriousness which make her perfect for the role. Joe Pantaliano as Teddy makes a big impact in this movie. His dry humour and screen presence make this role one of my favourite performances on film.Altogether, it is one of the best films of recent years and it is exactly the kind of movie I like.10/10",Memento
293,Kubris,Now- where was I,9,5 September 2011,"I first watched Memento in late June. I really liked it. But I couldn't grasp the words to describe it. Memento belongs to the category of film I call ""Cannot comprehend with one viewing"". So here I am, the last day of summer after seeing it again, and now I can.Memento is incredible. It has to be the most small-scale mystery-crime-thriller I've seen, with a total of 3 major characters, but it's quietly brilliant. If it was a normal film, told front to back, it would be above average, but only just. Luckily it's not.The best part of Memento, the thing that makes it stand out, is it's format. When you first watch, it takes a while for anything to start making sense, and it actually hurt my head trying to figure out the timeframe. I won't say how it plays out, but it's outstandingly unique. And for some reason, like the protagonist Leonard, you can't remember what just happened. Even now, I totally forget the beginning- wait the end- no, the beginning of the film. I just can't remember.A special note- the opening credits are the best part of the film. When you catch on to what's happening, you'll gasp. It's explosive and brilliant.The three main characters are excellent. They are layered, well- played, and keep you guessing. Leonard is our protagonist, played by Guy Pearce in a big change from his other major role in L.A. Confidential. He cannot make new memories, which is why the film is presented so uniquely. He is generally disciplined, and conflicted about everything not tattooed to his body or in his photos. Guy Pearce is excellent as this walking uncertainty. His narrations are blank, like his general perception. It helps that he just looks the part. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are excellent as Natalie and Teddy, the support who aren't what they seem to appear to look like. Sound confusing? It is, until we find out more and more about them. Their personalities- or what they look like- are really good.Another note- music is minimal, but great. It really captures the small scope, while being stirring.The plot is good, but is much better because of the presentation and editing that keeps the scenes from looking choppy. There's a neat twist that changes our perspective, and Memento simply has to be seen again or you'll miss out on key things. Also, you'll totally forget your first viewing.One last note- it's really cool when the film changes from black and white to colour. Leaonard literally shakes colour into the film.In short you have to see this. It's original and unique, presented very well, and offers an intriguing tale from a cool perspective. I could easily see someone saying this is their favourite film ever. I could even be yours.9.2/10",Memento

I'm of the relatively rare opinion – at least if IMDb ratings are anything to go by – that this is Nolan's best film to date. Despite his popular output, this film wins in terms of pure originality.Memento is based on a short story – Memento Mori – written by Nolan's brother, Jonathan Nolan. There are similarities (the dead wife, the amnesia) between the story and the film, but whereas the short story seems to function as an essay on concepts of amnesia and time, Christopher Nolan adapted these ideas in the form of a thriller, though it's anything but straightforwardliterally. Leonard (Guy Pearce) suffers from Anterograde Amnesia which means he cannot form new memories. Basically, it's short-term memory loss. He'll be aware of who he is and where he is for about 15 minutes (30 if he's lucky) after which he'll blank out, forget who he's talking to, what he's doing, etc. He's been suffering from this ever since his wife was raped and killed by two men in his home. He was able to kill one of them that night, but received a blow to the head from the other, resulting in his condition. His life since then has consisted of one thing: find the second man and kill him. To combat his condition, he takes photographs of important things in his life (his car, his motel) and has crucial information tattooed on his body. He receives 'assistance' from two other characters during his journey who may or may not have ulterior motives.What's impressive is that besides being a very well made revenge thriller, the film also has plenty of time to ask the kind of philosophical questions the short story asks: what is the point of revenge if Leonard will forget he avenged his wife anyway? Do things like truth and facts apply to Leonard's condition, as in how can he truly know certain things for sure? How does the concept of time apply to someone like Leonard? What kind of life is there for Leonard besides avenging his wife? The film functions both as thriller and commentary on the drama underlying Leonard's condition.In the end, what solidifies this film as a classic in the thriller genre and modern cinema in its entirety is its structure. The film has two types of scenes: color and black-and-white, and it constantly alternates between these two types. Also, the B-W scenes are chronologically correct (1-2-3), but the scenes in color are placed in reverse (Z-Y-X). Mind you: the don't literally play backwards, but are placed in reverse. So the structure can be described as followed: Z-1-Y-2-X-3, etc.). This might sound confusing, but it will make more and more sense as you watch it. One of the best things about it, is that the beginning of one color scene is also the end of the next color scene. So, you're constantly struggling to remember what came after, trying to connect the dots. The wonderful thing about it is that, like Leonard, you are also struggling from (an (artificial sense of) short-term memory loss, as you never know what came before. Many scenes begin with a confused Leonard not knowing where he is, which is also the position the viewer occupies (at least for first-time viewers). Crucially, instead of merely being a story about amnesia in filmic form, the film succeeds greatly in utilizing the possibilities of its own medium to great effect, by using editing to put the audience in the position of someone suffering from short-term memory loss, never really knowing what came before.Claims about a plothole have been circulating on the internet. The question that has been asked multiple times is how Leonard is able to know he has Anterograde Amnesia when he's unable to create new memories. I for one have no idea, but I guess we have to implicitly assume it's on one of his notes or tattoos. But honestly, when a thriller is so original and downright exciting as Memento, who even cares? Would you rather have a mediocre, factually correct thriller or one with (maybe) one or two plot holes, but executed so well it actually does what its genre says it should, thrill? One made so well it made you leap out of your seat? Because that is exactly what happened to me when I first watched it in my teens. I was so blown away and ecstatic I had to pause it midway so I could run up to my parents and extol to them the virtues of Memento. If that doesn't motivate you to watch it, then I don't know what will.",Memento

299,m_madhu,Extraordinarily smart and unique ....,10,14 November 2001,"a truly unique movie experience, quite unlike any experienced before. memento is a triumph in daring cinema, going by its incredibly high rank at imdb. memento is definitely one of the best movies of the 90s. the storytelling is so incredible that the viewer is enthralled and engaged right through. there is no let up and the amazing reverse time-line technique is simply brilliant, thus recreating the plot in a whole new way ... as some parts get explained while others get more intriguing as the movie goes on.
its one of those incredible movies where the power of the screenplay is so massive that everything else gets side-tracked. the acting was competent, the dialogs too but the wonderment caused by the terrific plot overshadows everything else. guy pearce as the man who has no short-term memory is adequate, the director makes the character so utterly believable. i think the entire credit should go to the director christofer nolan, despite being his first full-length feature, he shows tremendous conviction and understanding of the medium and its techniques, he seems to know exactly what to do to keep the audience on the edge of the seat always wondering .. what next? (or what before? haha) the one most striking aspect was the use of black and white to depict scenes in the distant past so as to lend clarity, without this smart move, the movie would have become totally incomprehensible. but as it is, its a terrific movie and worthy of all the high praise it has been receiving.however, on an aside, i find that new movies tend to get rather very high scores which might not be justified in the overall scheme of things, i honestly am not too sure how well these movies will stand up after 2-3 decades. only time will tell.but for now, lets just enjoy in the sheer thrill of mementoan extraordinary 10!!",Memento

I, for one, thought this cannot work in any shape or form. Upon viewing this movie, I believed I would be able to read through the plot and have everything (and anything) worked out in a flash, thus strengthening my notion that this 'back-to-front' concept is nonsense. How wrong was I? Memento is a film that makes you to go into the difficult and turbulent mind of a man trying his damnedest to seek revenge upon his wife's killer, but because of a condition which prevents him for remembering very recent events, finds it extremely difficult to do so; Guy Pearce is nothing short of brilliant as Lenoard, and certainly proves how versatile an actor he is. The perception of Memento is such, after only a few minutes of watching a particular scene, we are forced to reevaluate events witnessed. Its this strong aspect of the film that makes it so groundbreaking and legendary.The final scene in Memento will leave the viewer trying hard to think what situation was what and how a certain situation occurred. Personally, I'm not sure why a certain event happened, but then again that is the whole point. Recording a film in reverse would normally be a complete waste of time, but watching Memento certainly discourages that thought. Excellent.",Memento

Ok if he did have this condition to where he can only remember 5 or 10 mins at a time since his attack, HOW DOES HE KNOW TO WRITE STUFF DOWN!!!??? Makes zero sense! And the whole tattooing stuff on his body is beyond anything I've ever seen in science fiction. It's a shock or ""cool"" factor, that he tattoos this stuff on his body, so it will give the writers a few mins of dialog in the movie, showing it done and talking about it. And the whole backward thing..... Doing days backwards in time.... No, dumb, idiotic and really adds very little. Yes I understood the movie, the thing I don't understand is how people constantly rate this a 10???? Plus if the guy was really a cop, even a dirty one, would he continue to let this maniac kill people over and over and over? If he did kill all these people wouldn't SOMEONE have turned him in????
Why doesn't he have a tape recorder?????? Maybe I missed it but the first tattoo I'd get is... YOU CAN'T RMEEMBER ANYTHING, PRESS PLAY ON RECORDER! but even then it doesn't make sense because he only remembers 5 or 10 mins at a time.

The story is what stands out, it's very unique and the way it is presented is great although it is rather slow throughout. For me it was a bit boring as it was straight dialogue for two hours, but it did all lead to a dramatic ending which was quite satisfying yet a bit confusing. Most Christopher Nolan movies are quite confusing though so I did expect this when coming into it and I did understand what happened I don't feel like I was truly able to take in so much knowledge in at once and it left me a bit baffled. The acting was pretty good, nothing stood out to me neither did the music used and it wasn't that tense but the idea as a whole was great and that is pretty much the only reason I give this higher than a five, the story. I wish it were showed in a different way or just readjusted to better suit the high percentage of slightly idiotic people watching the movie, which I feel like I fall under that category after watching this.

No disrespect to Nolan's first piece in The Following, but this is the film that truly jumpstarted his marvelous career. Nolan created this original & nifty narrative, with a creative structure that was so mysterious & witty; with every layer that got peeled back, it got more and more intriguing. Chris Nolan has this knack of always keeping his movies entertaining, with great pacing. One of the best thing's he does is create such a mysterious story, that it has such tremendous rewatch value, that only makes you appreciate the movie that much more. The film is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed throughout; a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse.I'm not the biggest fan of Guy Pearce to begin with, maybe because I never really gave him a fair chance, with watching his movies like, Iron Man 3 & Bedtime Stories, but he really changed my mind here. He puts on a fantastic performance! To back up his performance, was a beautiful script written by Chris Nolan himself. With such an intelligent, and memorable script, Nolan was up for an Academy Award in 2002 for Best Original Screenplay, but came up short to Julian Fellowes who wrote Gosford Park. There was not one boring piece of dialogue within the film, while having it's fair share of powerful quotes.Overall, I'm definitely going to have to rewatch this again to pick up some missing pieces, but this is an absolute must watch!",Memento

But then I got to thinking, assuming he was told about his memory loss after the accident, how could he remember that he had this problem?  To me, that flaw could derail the film but like Alfred Hitchcock's MacGuffin, I just let it go.  The reason for the film's success is that by telling the story backwards, we are just like Leonard, we learn everything when he does and there is no way for us to piece things together.  This makes it practically impossible to figure things out.  In ""The Lady in the Lake"", director Robert Montgomery tried to make the audience feel like the main character, Philip Marlowe, by showing everything from Marlowe's point of view.  It didn't work mainly because it was too weird to have everyone in the movie treating the audience like a character.  ""Memento"" succeeds where Montgomery failed.  As for the acting, Pearce plays Leonard a little too intense, probably the way someone would really act but at times too much for the screen.  Carrie-Anne Moss does nothing to distinguish herself and her berating of Leonard was embarrassing to watch.  Joe Pantoliano as the mysterious Teddy, has his best performance to date.

316,blazesnakes9,"A smart, unique mystery thriller",10,26 October 2014,"Leonard Shelby, (Guy Pearce), is a insurance investigator. He suffers from a condition that isn't short-term memory loss. Right before he lost his memory, his wife was killed by someone. He doesn't know who. But, he wants revenge. With the help of his memory condition and the notes tattooed on his arms, legs and body, Leonard is determined to figure out who killed his wife.That's the set-up for Memento. This is a well made neo-noir thriller that plays with us by seeing through the eyes of a man who's determination only makes his investigation more superior. The movie is told through two story-lines. One story-line is told in black and white and the other is told in color. Director Christopher Nolan, who also serves as a screenwriter for this movie, challenges us to follow this mystery through two story-lines. The black and white scenes illustrates the story in chronological order. The color scenes takes place in reverse. As we watch this story unfold, Nolan reveals more and more of the mystery as he lets us get to know the facts before shifting gears.Most thrillers today are jam-packed with predictable story-lines and endings. Memento is the complete opposite. This movie doesn't do any of those. Instead, what we have here is a complicated story about a complicated man. A man who's grief and guilt drives him through his investigation. That why Leonard is so important in this movie. Rather than showing us a straight-forward mystery with the clues being brought up in a linear story, Memento reveals clues from a non-linear story. This is the kind of movie that tells us a story that is based on a Hitchcockian level, but only in the 21st century. Without giving away too much of the ending, the conclusion is very effective in both wit and suspense.The original story for this movie came from Christopher Nolan's younger brother, Johnathan. The movie is full of great performances by Guy Pearce and also from Joe Pantoliano. Pearce has been involved in the neo-noir genre before with L.A. Confidential. Unlike his role in that movie, Pearce brings out the grief in some of the movie's quiet scenes. There's are several moments during the movie where he lets us sympathizes with him while he copes with his condition. I thought that in those scenes, the movie stops short to shows us how Leonard feels about not remembering who he is and what he is. At that point, I felt pretty bad that he has to live with this condition and also solve his wife's murder.I have seen good neo-noirs in my life. But, Memento is a rarity. You don't see movies like these being made everyday. As the audience, we are taken into the mind of a very confusing man. And when we learn about the facts, we sometimes feel as if we ourselves are spinning our heads because we can't keep up with this plot. That is what I like about movies. A lot of the great thrillers that we've seen over the years have made us think about ourselves as ordinary everyday people. It's movies like Memento that makes us think differently with ourselves so that we are caught up at the moment. This is a top-notch thriller that really deserves credibility for its story structure and the editing. This is a must-see. ★★★★ 4 stars.",Memento

(Part 1 of 2)",1,20 March 2002,"Fusing elements from such cool plot twisting films like ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Fight Club"", ""Memento"" was a groundbreaking exercise in narrative presentation. Leonard Shelby, a former insurance investigator turned vigilante avenger was hell bent on finding and killing the man who left him seriously injured and his wife, dead. But due to his aforesaid injury, this poor bloke now suffers from permanent brain damage with symptomatic short term amnesia(memory loss). Apart from whatever happened before his injury, our main man would not be able to remember whatever transpired beyond his last fifteen minutes. So how is a physically and emotionally damaged man gonna do what he set out to do? Oh, did I mention that this film begins with the end of the story and ends, at the beginning? Go figure.Due to the film's reverse-chronological structure, the equally  paralysed audience shared the protagonist's compulsion to concentrate on any vital developments which may help unravel the mystery. This thus made the viewing experience highly participative. Of course, there were more to this film than above gimmick, or it would not have sustained the audience's interest, nor explain their willingness to engage in such a cerebral exercise. Apart from the occasional jokes on his mental handicap and the gradual unveiling of his investigative efforts, we also saw Leonard Shelby as a man, remembering his woman. Along the way, we witnessed his idiosyncratic attempts in dealing with his loss, in searching for a closure. Through these introspective scenes, we were offered a glimpse into the psyche of anyone who have lost people dear in their lives. Such unexpected insights from an already inventive crime thriller, bring to fore Memento's true ambition. It does not want to be just a film with A Beautiful Mind(pun intended), but also one with A Beautiful Heart(ditto). To which I feel it almost succeeded in accomplishing. Keyword here is ""ALMOST"".
Before any fanatic supporters of ""Memento"" out there decide to silence my lone dissent, allow me to acknowledge that being such a fiendishly innovative film, ""Memento"" deserves the feverish cult following it inspired.
But I can only go so far in my praise as there is something missing. I will explain my position and more in the concluding ""Part 2"" of my commentary. Till then, watch this space.",Memento
324,Sinnerman,"""Fact may be Stranger than Fiction."" (Part 2 of 2)",1,20 March 2002,"In Part 1 of my commentary(posted earlier in IMDB), I wrote that ""Memento"" almost fulfilled its ambition of ""not only being a film with A Beautiful Mind(pun intended), but also one with A Beautiful Heart(ditto).""
And I stressed on the word, ""almost"". In this concluding part of my commentary on this film, I shall proceed to explain my position in making that statement(as promised).********************************************NOTE:PLEASE STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM BUT INTEND TO. IT IS NEVER MY POLICY TO REVEAL PLOT TWISTS AS IT IS PLAIN EVIL TO DO SO. AS I AM NOT SURE WHETHER WHATEVER I REVEAL BELOW WILL OR WILL NOT SPOIL YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE FILM, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.********************************************Not wanting to reveal major plot revelation for this mind-altering plot twister, I can only say that this ""ALMOST"" aspect of the film meant the difference between it becoming my all time No.1 favourite film to just one I respected for its sheer ingenuity. What truly bothered me about the film, especially after repeat viewing was the dubious intention of the writer/ director(Christopher Nolan I presume).
At first the film looked and felt like its predecessor(e.g. The Usual Suspects, Shallow Grave etc) - smart, intellectual and armed with a modern day cynicism. It maintains a respectful emotional distance from its audience as this is ethical(don't ask me why) and a reasonable price for being the uber-cool pic that it is. Memento would thus have been fantastic if it stayed that way.But Nolan got greedy, he misrepresented the film with hints that it could be more than the sum of its parts, that it could transcend its genre origins and segue into a realm of cinema reserved by a select few films(e.g. ""Magnolia"", ""Dancer in the Dark""). A film which demanded not only intellectual subscription but a level of emotional investment or even wild abandonment that ensure people like me will embrace it fully, should the investment pay off.I got hooked by this heightened anticipation and was almost ready to kiss the feet of Mr Nolan by film's half-time. However, the way he chose to end the film rubbed me the wrong way in more ways than I care to describe. At the last minute, he chose to cling on to his ""uber-cool film"" safety net, suddenly  distancing itself from the emotional guise built up throughout the film. The final revelation? The joke is on me. The audience were being talked down at and made fun of for having feelings, for showing empathy, for being human. There is nothing clever in that.There goes, this may be my longest piece ever for ""a film I struggled to love but may never"". Its been months since I last saw Memento. With each passing day, I hold ""Memento"" in higher esteem as an visionary film from a cinematic standpoint. But with each passing day, I become increasingly disappointed with its sinister agenda of tainting all values that I hold true. Alas, this to me is thus, ""The film that could have been"".",Memento
325,magellan333,Brilliant and overlooked,9,27 April 2008,"I had never heard of this movie until a month ago when a friend recommended it. Memento's reverse concept is most intriguing and very well done. As you watch the film work its way backwards, one interesting plot twist and turn is developed after another. The film maintains a gritty quality throughout that really enhances the viewing experience. Guy Pearce is awesome as a man with ""this condition"" and the supporting cast performs magnificently as well.

But if anything we will understand easily is:But what a great drama.Nolan completely glorifies his name with this film as one of the most innovative and brilliant directors of the 21st century. A unique drama that we will probably have to wait a long time to feel the sensation of incognito and suspense with a new movie, but if anything I can to assure, this is one of those films that put our brains to work hard, however, do not make us feel silly, it does not bore us, it does not tell us in our faces '' You can not understand. '' This film challenges us to follow in detail a complex theme where it follows an incomparable time line like never before, the main character suffers from a strange illness that prevents him from being able to remember things in the short term, all this happens after a serious accident where he loses everything, now, seeks the redemption and vengeance he so desires to find the culprit of his misfortunes.Here, the way we are told the story is simply incredible. With the main theme in mind being the '' Amnesia ''. Nolan makes us feel as if we ourselves were suffering from this disease, with each clue and every sequence, it seems that we forget something, it seems that it is us who try to seek revenge, it is something incredible, where it puts us inside the flesh of someone with a terrible curse, forget everything and remember nothing.

330,rebecca-ry,Genius,8,25 July 2012,"'Memento' is quite a confusing film which takes a little bit of time to make sense. It can be quite difficult to understand initially because the film doesn't play out in the correct order, you're finding out different pieces of the story at different times and you slowly begin to understand what's going on.It's very clever; to film this and break it up to portray it in a mixed up order must be really difficult and Christopher Nolan has done a great job. The script is really good; a film like this can make it really easy to make mistakes and he's done a great job in making sure the story makes sense. The story itself is really interesting and the way in which it has been filmed reflects Leonard's mindset. The acting performances (of which there is really only three) are pretty good. Guy Pearce performs really well in this; his character involves a wide range of emotions and he portrays most of them really well, sometimes his dialogue can be a bit wooden but it never lasts long enough to have a negative effect on the film. Joe Pantoliano also does a good job here - he plays his ambiguous character really well. The worst performance of the three is Carrie-Anne Moss; she doesn't really have an impact on the film and some scenes where her character plays a crucial role in a scene she fails to evoke enough emotion to convince viewers. The film overall is really good, you never quite manage to determine the ending until it actually occurs and the ending is excellent. There are a lot of films where half-way through you can guess the ending correctly but this is not the case with 'Memento', really worth a watch especially if you have seen any of Christopher Nolan's previous films.",Memento
331,loufalce,I'm still trying to figure it out- but wow!,8,26 April 2007,"Brilliant modern ""film noir"" of a man suffering from a rare form of memory loss trying to figure out a murder. The unusual structure of this film still has me puzzled, but in a most posititive way. The acting is excellent in a low key way, and the atmosphere- mostly set in a cheap motel and restaurant all contribute something to the story. In fact they almost seem like players themselves.The shoestring budget only adds to the realism. Brilliant use and distortion of time seem to capture the thoughts going through the mind of the hero as he tries to figure out exactly what has happened.Also excellent and noteworthy are the transitions from black and white to color.This is not a movie for the short attention span crowd. You will have to see it at least twice to figure it out, but the resulting experience will be one that is hard to forget.Compare that to the hard sell, high concept films currently littering the multiplexes. A rare treat, especially for film buffs.",Memento
332,williambendavis-933-218958,"Brilliant, unique, and riveting throughout",9,14 December 2014,"Memento is quite unlike any other film I've ever seen. It's about a guy who cannot create new memories trying to find his wife's killer. That alone is an interesting enough premise. But Christopher Nolan decided to take it even further by making the film go backwards. The film starts with the end, and goes to the beginning. So, right from the start, you know what the end result is, yet, you really don't know what happened. It manages to keep the viewer guessing and asking questions, despite already have given away the ending. That is some truly genius writing and directing on Nolan's part, once again demonstrating his immense talent. Every scene is positively dripping with mystery and suspense, and I can't remember the last time I was so riveted to the screen. This is probably Nolan's best film to date, and I strongly suggest you seek it out.",Memento
333,chthon2,"Stunning Work, Nolan is Amazing",9,29 January 2003,"Memento is about Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man who lost his short term memory after being jumped from behind while attacking his wife's rapists/murderers.  He spends his life as a drifter, trying to hunt down the man responsible (I'm pretty sure he shot the first of the two rapists - I can't remember now).  Because of his condition, he must carry a series of sticky notes and photos to remind himself of where he is and what he's doing; his life is heavily based on routine.Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) is apparently Leonard's somewhat annoying friend.  He tries to help Leonard track this man down, while simultaneously looking out for him, warning him to stay away from Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss), who he says is only trouble.  She says the exact opposite.The trick to this movie is, aside from black-and-white interludes of Leonard on the phone with a stranger, the whole thing goes backwards; i.e., the beginning of each scene coincides with the end of the scene which you will see next.  Chris Nolan wrote and directed this little gem; I don't think anyone but the guy who wrote it could grasp it enough to bring it to life.As far as the plot and dialogue goes, it is actually original enough to where it could be good without the backwards progression - i've never seen such a crime-thriller with a character with such a condition.  But the fact that Nolan shot this backwards, and made it work, makes this not good, but great.  This is a thinking movie - if you just got off Friday from a long week at work and want to relax with a movie, don't rent this.  Memento would be best on weekends when you and preferably a group of people have time to watch it over and try to figure it out.Added bonus on the DVD - there's a second version of the movie that plays forward, so you can see the scenes in chronological order.And kudos to the cast, especially Pantoliano.  He tends to steal the show in his scenes.",Memento
334,emryse,Taking Full Advantage of it's Premise,8,9 August 2021,"Memento is a film that takes it's premise, a man with no short term memory, and runs with it as far as possible. Giving us endless twists and turns Memento is a great film and an amazing debut for Christopher Nolan, similar to Nolan's later films it's very high concept but it manages to stand up and, in my opinion, even exceed his later movies such as Interstellar and Inception. To go into any detail with the film would require spoilers and while some would be very minor after watching the film I think the best way to experience it is with no prior knowledge at all. When watching you're constantly required to be trying to figure out and understand what's going on and there is no better feeling than when the penny drops and you come to a new realization within the plot. There was really only one part of this film I didn't enjoy which was Leonard (the main character's) short term memory, sometimes felt like it was being used for convenience and that he would only forget when it was helpful to the plot, a minor gripe but still notable none the less. My one last thing to say about this film is you should watch it all in one sitting, I had to watch the first half on one day and the second half two days later and being dropped in halfway through it takes a while to get to grips with where you are in the plot again. Still a strong 8/10 that I'll probably watch a second time.",Memento
335,princebansal1982,Greatest MindScrew Ever,5,19 May 2011,"Christopher Nolan is one of the best young directors and I have loved Prestige, Dark Knight and Inception. Still I consider Memento to be his best film. Sure Inception had my brain buzzing, Dark Knight gave us Joker, and Prestige was a delight, still I think Memento is his best film.Memento has two time-lines, one in black and white and one in color, and they are alternated throughout the film. In no other movie has use of time-lines or alternating visual themes have been more justified. Even when I saw the movie for the first time, mu brain was working overtime, but after watching the movie I was aware that I had watched a really amazing film. But it was the second time around that I was able to connect all the dots and grasp the genius behind the movie.Many critics criticize Nolan's movies saying that his movies don't have an emotional core. I think that is totally wrong. Maybe they are criticizing just because it is their job to find faults. Nolan is one the finest directors and he chooses the finest actors. Actors like DiCaprio, Cotillard, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, Edward Norton etc are the finest actors around and they wouldn't have starred in his movies if they though they would not be allowed to show their skills to full extent. Besides the twisting plots Nolan's movies have strong emotional core, whether it is a bewildered Leonard Shelby of Memento or Cobb of Inception we can see them fighting the world and fighting themselves at the same time. They are distant but we can stil connect with them.What I loved the most about the movie was that everything was not cut and clear, even after you have seen it twice a certain uncertainty remains which is deliberate on part of Nolan as we are sharing that uncertainty with the movie's protagonist Leonard Shelby.One of my top movies and should be seen at least twice (maybe more even for some) to be appreciated fully.",Memento

Even he could not remember something happened minutes before. He had to use his way to find the murder.I was attracted immediately by the movie because of its uncommon story-telling way. Watching this movie was not an easy job. You had to think again and again to judge what was truth or not. If you take a nap while watching, maybe you will not understand fully the movie.It was a pity that Christopher Nolan did not win the Oscar award for The Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.An excellent suspense movie you should not miss. 8/10",Memento

The film is a puzzle very clever and original that will have you guessing from start to finish, and beyond. The story and direction are the best, the way that Christopher Nolan account and directs the film is amazing.Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby, a man who lost his short-term memory in a robbery where his wife was raped and murdered, now he is looking for the killer, despite his mental disability that makes you lose memory after every conversation he has. Simple as that. You do not need to know more.The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put on the skin of Leonard Shelby, wonderfully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives a performance equally mysterious and complex.This movie is well done all the way around - the direction, the editing, and especially that the original story is superb, everything is different from what we have seen. From start to finish the film grabs you physically and mentally, to one of the best endings ever made.",Memento

Teddy police help Lanny find another murderer, John G, and avenge it, but Lenny doesn't remember him avenging himself. Teddy saw that Lenny couldn't remember, so he used Lenny to help himself. In fact, the hero has been deceiving himself after watching the movie. This sudden consciousness delights the listener mentally. The same story, but different people still have different expressions.

It was also structured and presented in a way that was clear and easy to figure out what was going on. Notably, the cinematography e.g. use of light, was brilliant.However, the actual story is boring & seems to go at a snail pace. It really starts to drag around halfway through. On this note, I think Chris should be careful not to get overly caught up in the concept that he neglects the nature of the story - which I think was happening here. For example, I think he could have done more with the main character; and made the events in his life more dramatic / interesting.Overall, if you like Chris Nolan, then I think it's worth a watch.",Memento
341,joshuafagan-64214,Unforgettable,10,19 January 2016,"Stone cold perfect. When I finished watching this movie, I wrote down those words, so I wouldn't forget them when I did this review. No other three words could more accurately describe this movie. It may not be the flashiest, most spectacle-filled movie ever made, but it is one that leaves you thinking, That is great art. This may not be the absolute greatest movie Chris Nolan has ever made, but it is the most restrained, organized, and complete.The basic story: a man with anterograde amnesia (a condition where you can't make new memories) is trying to track down the man who killed his wife. On its face, this is a simple revenge story. But this movie is far more than its face.Color and black-and-white sequences are interspersed. The color sequences go in reverse chronological order from the end, whereas the black-and-white sequences go in normal chronological order fro0m the beginning. This may seem complicated, but it's really not. There not only was not a better way to tell this story, there was not another way to tell this story at all. It is not a gimmick, as its deriders have called it; it was the only way to go.When the two sequences come together at the end of the 120-minute running time, you will be shocked and amazed. I was. This is not the kind of twist that can be easily spoiled. I suppose you could look it up, but even if you did, it wouldn't mean all that much to you. It's something- like the Eiffel Tower or the Pyramids- that must be experienced.This is the Nolan film that caught the world's attention. This is the Nolan film that exploded into the stratosphere. In film critic circles, it was all, 'Have you seen Memento?' After this, he got funding and ran with it. In a way, Inception and Interstellar and all those Batmans were made because of this film. There are not many examples of good artists winning out and being allowed to produce more good art.Technically, this film is part of the stellar 2001 crop of films, despite the fact that it came out in 2000 in Venice. This is kind of annoying, but it does give me an opportunity to show how broken the Oscars are. Both this film and Amelie were nominated for Best Original Screenplay. I would have been fine with either one winning. But neither of them won, an honor that goes to Gosford Park, a film I had never even heard of until I researched this.The words 'psychological horror' are tossed around a lot these days. I'm willing to bet one out of every three or four horror movies that classify itself as psychological horrors. Hah. Hah, hah, hah. Those are psychological horror films in the same way that M. Night Shyamalan's pathetic Avatar: The Last Airbender adaptation is an epic.This, my good friends and loyal readers, is a true psychological horror movie. It is not a horror movie in terms of tropes or the traditional definition of the genre, but it terrifies me more than any amount of blood and guts and jump scares or shaky cam could in a million years. I feel true fear whenever I watch this because it understands what fear is. Fear is not a physical thing, like a rock or brick or castle. It is immaterial. Like the wind, it takes not shape or form or identity. It is a response to danger and confusion. The more someone understands that, the more their film can manipulate it. And Chris Nolan- as well as his brother Johnathan, who wrote the story that inspired this film- understands that.Let me say that the film looks gorgeous. There are few things that look sharper than modern black-and-white filming (I would love to see that black-and-white cut of MM:FR) and the color scenes are sweeping and elegant and mysterious. Wally Pfister is a master of unshowy but well-done cinematography. His camera-work makes you see what Nolan wants you to see. It is sharp and dreamy yet focused. He is to Chris Nolan what John Williams is to Steven Spielberg. None of Nolan's films would be as good as they are without his camera.The music is not outlandish or bombastic, but subtle and story-serving: perfect for a film like this. The acting is not amazing, but it is rock-solid and far better than could be expected given the film's budget. The screenplay is amazing in every way possible. You want tight? It's tight. You want innovative? It's innovative. You want twist-filled? It's twist-filled. If I made a list of the greatest screenplays of all time, this would be close to the top.I honestly struggle to come up with something bad about the film. There are nineteen films I like better this, but none of them have as few issues as this one. This is Nolan at his best and sharpest. All of his strengths are at their highest, and all of his weaknesses are at their lowest.If you want to get up feeling refreshed and happy, this isn't the movie to pop in. It is Nolan's most R-rated movie by far, and the ending (which I will not dare spoil for you) is a downer to be sure. But if you want to be hypnotically immersed in a masterwork by possibly the most talented auteur working today, watch it.This is one of those films that blows you away even when you expect it to be great.

Movies like The Matrix can only show how shocked Neo is when he learns that he has actually been living in the Matrix, but there was nothing the director could have done to make the audience feel as confused as Neo.Memento though really does screw with your head, but not to an extent where you are unable to finally figure out what's going on.You need to either pay attention, or give Memento a little thought after the credits have rolled, and everything clicks together.There will never be a movie like it.",Memento

347,commandercool88,"Deeply compelling, Brilliantly rich",10,27 July 2008,"Mind-bending. Time-altering. Disorienting. Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' is a dark and bleak experience, an ingenious picture that stares into the soul of a man filled with vengeance and anger. A movie that begs to be seen more than once, 'Memento' is as confusing as it is thoughtful, as bizarre as it is brilliant. An engrossing story that pulls us into the driver's seat and never takes its foot off the gas, this is modern film-making at its best. And once again, Nolan proves why he is one of the best filmmakers of our time.'Memento' doesn't wait to build the tension before showing us what ultimately happens in the end. It's how the movies begins. The fragmented storytelling keeps the film a perplexing mystery, we see what Guy Pearce sees, one confusing episode after another. It keeps us on the edge of our seat, certain of how everything is wrapped up but without any knowledge of the twists and turns that bring us to this very unsettling circumstance. Christopher Nolan's inspired vision is impeccable, but it is Dody Dorn's editing that makes 'Memento' the non-linear masterpiece that it is instead of one jumbled piece of incoherence.Guy Pearce finds himself in a wonderfully complex role, a haunted man who has many different layers but can't retain short-term memory for more than a few minutes. He delivers a brilliant performance, and most importantly, makes it absolutely believable. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano turn in great supporting roles as their own characters have secrets that unravel before our eyes. 'Memento' is often a frustrating viewing experience, but a mind-blowing one at that. You can't possibly pick up on all the subtleties and details during a single sitting, which makes 'Memento' a rich and rewarding movie many times through.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",Memento

352,Det_McNulty,Cryptic Storytelling That Somehow Works,8,9 October 2008,"Little known director Christopher Nolan almost instantaneously claimed his place as one of modern cinema's most innovative directors when he released Memento to almost unanimous recognition. It caught the attention of many critics and filmmakers alike, establishing itself as something in the realms of ""cinematic literature."" It was a work that marked the appeal of new-wave noir, more commonly known as neo-noir. Not only this, but its alternate take on nonlinear narrative storytelling was a breath of fresh-air to the overuse of non-linear concepts that had aroused during the 1990s.Starring Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano, Memento tells the story of Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce), a man suffering from short-term memory loss following the murder of his wife. Following his wife's tragic death, Leonard begins seeking revenge on whoever murdered his wife, slowly piecing together clues with the help of a mysterious ""detective"" figure, named Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). Due to the memory condition he suffers from, Leonard has great difficulty collecting information and relies on tattoos and constant note taking to record his findings. Soon after, another questionable character is introduced, this being Natalie (Carrie Anne Moss), and like with Teddy her origins are practically unknown. A web of ambiguity and distrust soon entangles Leonard, never knowing if either Teddy or Natalie are genuine.The narrative carefully revolves around these three central characters, playing out incidents in seemingly alternate realities and reverse chronology. It is the editing that enables the viewer to experience a similar sensation as Leonard, by essentially jumbling scenes, splicing colour footage of his investigation alongside black and white moments where Leonard is discussing an insurance case of a man who also claimed to suffer from short-term memory loss. It is these moments specifically, which reveal the characteristics and idiosyncrasies of Leonard, essentially painting the man's past. Memento cannot be classed as a mystery, such a term sounds far too throwaway; rather, it is more a vengeance/chase flick, but even placing it in such a category seems somewhat derogatory.As noir goes, Memento does incorporate many of the distinctive elements; including voice-over, noticeable use of shadow, nihilistic themes and low-key lighting. The characters are very noir, as each one has a certain shady quality to their personality and hints at having ulterior motives. It is these things that make the film so thrilling, even on any revisit. Still, there are a few gripes I have, such as the reverse narrative being somewhat of a gimmicky disguise for a simple plot. Additionally, the plot becomes almost too convoluted at times, with a sense of repetition resulting in moments of complete perplexity. Then again, the perplexity is arguably a great feature for it allows the viewer becomes increasingly more agitated, and almost begs for your concentration.The multiple narrative techniques used in Memento allow the intrigue to expand as the story progresses, and in a relentless manner that does not eschew till the climatic moments. As films about memory go, this is definitely one of the best depictions of memory trauma and obsession in recent years. It pulls all the necessary gears that craft an absorbing cinematic venture, and not only that but it explores the psyche of a man whose perception of reality has been completely disfigured. Combining the thoughts and actions through a voice-over and reverse narrative is an exceptionally difficult thing to conquer through writing; therefore the screenplay deserves much credit. In fact, the story was adapted from a novella by Christopher Nolan's brother Jonathan, entitled Memento Mori that was essentially an essay on memory and the individual's perception of reality.An important element of Memento is the idea of recollection and how we often subconsciously chose the way we recollect one moment from the next. During the film, there is a scene where Leonard expresses how humans cannot rely on memory. In addition, paradoxes such as the notion of Leonard not remembering to forget his wife are in effect an example of what would cure his grief. Performance wise, the film is pretty much incredible, with the exception of some moments of sketchy wit uttered by the actors. It is Guy Pearce who steals the show though, proving that he can hold a film together, in what is his best performance since 1997's L.A. Confidential. As a viewer, I could feel great empathy for his character, acknowledging the difficulties associated with memory loss and the way in which one conceals memories through tragedy. This is a contemporary work not to be missed and remains the most important role of Nolan's ever growing career. In my opinion, he has come close to surpassing the film with his excellent takes on the Batman saga, but that is a different story entirely.",Memento

354,PeterJackson,Think!,9,19 January 2001,"What can I say? I must congratulate Christopher Nolan for what may be the most interesting film of the year. Did I say ""interesting""? You can also add ""chilling"", absorbing"", ""surprising"", etc. to that. An incredible work of art and actually a thriller that makes you THINK. Most films have you guessing over ""who did it?"", but this film goes much further than that. It's an exploration of the human mind, of people's motivations too.Maybe it's a bit too difficult to follow sometimes. There are moments that you really have a hard time remembering what has happened the minutes before. Maybe that's not exactly what you'd expect of a thriller. But after all, I think that's just what the director tried to accomplish here: by telling the story backwards (you have to see it to believe it!), you have just as much trouble following as the main character Leonard, who suffers from some sort of amnesia. (and has no short term memory) And it might as well be that this is one of those rare films that you HAVE to see more than once. Not like THE SIXTH SENSE, where the ending puts everything in a different perspective, but like ... well, like ... I don't know. I think you have to see it for yourself to be able to draw your conclusions. One might forget that right in the middle of all this, is an actor (Guy Pearce) who delivers a truly stunning performance. Pearce starred in PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT and in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and this is another great film he adds to that list. He might not be as big as his L.A. CONFIDENTIAL co-star Russell Crowe, but in his own way, this Guy is going to make it. And let us not forget that MATRIX stars Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantaliano (another underestimated actor) deliver great performances too. They all make this film not only worth seeing, but also worth thinking about. 9/10 (maybe 10/10 after a second viewing)",Memento
355,thewillt08,A Risk That Paid Off,8,18 June 2013,"Every now and then you come across a movie where you are almost literally glued to the screen. This is basically what happened when I watched Memento. I went into this movie dry. I didn't know much about it other than it is about a man with memory loss and he tries to avenge his wife. That is basically the story but it sort of plays backwards. I watched this movie on recommendation by a few friends and when I heard Christopher Nolan was involved I was sold. Without further ado here is Memento.Like I said the story is kind of backwards. The movie starts with a lot of confusion but as the scenes progress a few questions get answered with even more questions. The big overall question is, who killed Leonard wife and who is responsible for the situation he is in? Leonard is a husband out for revenge but has severe short term memory loss. We are introduced to a lot in the first few scenes including Trinity form the Matrix and the bald guy from Baby's Day Out. As the story unfoldswe understand their importance and the story slowly starts to makesense. The only flaw I see in the movie is that it really drags and thebeginning is very slow. I wanted to watch the entire movie but it took me a little while to get into it and really into the story. To make it even worse I paused it to go to the bathroom and before I did I thought the movie would be wrapping up soon. Little did I know I was only about an hour into it with a little over an hour left. I did enjoy the movie once I got into it but it felt like I was watching it for six hours. The characters themselves were nothing short of hit or miss. The unpredictability of them was what I enjoyed the most. Leonard was a little bland but it made sense because he was always confused. Obviously he was confused because he suffers from memory loss so his simplicity was expected. He has tattoos all over his body and writes things down on pictures so he remembers what happened the day before. It is really a brilliant idea and we see the severity of his obsession on finding the man responsible for everything. Natalie started out as a really strong character I really enjoyed but there was one scene where I really didn't expect her to do what she did. That was where she takes advantage of Lenny. It was really unexpected but I thought that whole scene was great and it made the story that much clearer. My favorite character in the entire movie is Teddy. I love the actor, I think he is very underrated but fits best as a secondary role rather than a star. His actions are unclear because on the back of his photo it says ""don't believe his lies"" so his intentions are unclear. It is another huge question throughout the movie. He randomly appears everywhere always advising Lenny to leave town. He is always involved in some way and he does an amazing job in dragging me into the story. Once I got into the story I was stuck in place and I wasn't going anywhere. Throughout the story there are a bunch of scenes in black and white where Leonard is on the phone telling a story about Sammy. The big question in my mind is how it was relevant to the story but I liked those scenes a lot better than any others. Maybe I liked the psychological aspect of memory loss and in these scenes we dive deep into the condition and the character of Leonard himself. This is where he shows his colors as a normal person and the type of man he was. If you see this movie and are bored with the chain of events and how it constantly backtracks take my advice, stick with it. The ending to this movie is mind blowing and what I really love about movies. Movies can play with your mind and make you believe one thing so strongly then completely switch it up in a matter of minutes. The final scenes to this movie answer everything and it all makes sense. We see the true intentions of each character and we get resolution in the story and it was very satisfying. I was thinking how I would have liked to see everything in order but if I did I probably would have hated the movie. Overall, Memento is a unique movie with an interesting enough premise to make me sit though the drag of the first act. I loved the black and white affect and the writing of the story. Christopher Nolan was involved so I had high hopes and he did not disappoint. The characters were good for the most part. I would have liked to see a little more form a few but the movie dragged enough as it was. The second act was a lot better than the first and the third blew me away. The acting was good for the most part, no Oscar worthy performances but it did get the job done. The ending did save this movie from being a wreck because if that failed then all the events prior would have been for nothing and a waste of time. Memento gets the WillyT Recommendation for its uniqueness and originality. The risk taken in the movie did pull off and is something I could easily watch again and probably should so I can make sense if it completely.",Memento

Christopher Nolan beautifully interlaces human anti-trust into the script and reveals scene by scene an ugly and distorted mess that our lead guy Shelby had to endure due to his condition. Some of the madness that happens is due to Shelby's memory loss and the rest is pretty much his so called friends (who he slowly finds out like 'Teddy') are not to be trusted at all. For my first viewing I was amazed, usually it takes more than one viewing to pick it all up and understand it but I stuck my face in front of my TV for an hour and a half and paid very close attention to the scene development (which I think was just a superb idea of genius on director Nolans behalf). I would recommend this movie to anyone alive and breathing, it definitely has a ton of symbolism and best yet, its a thinking-persons movie. A+ 9/10 stars should suffice. Unlike Leonard Shelby in the movie, we the viewer have to use OUR memories in order to piece everything together, brilliant.",Memento
357,midas-jacobs,Very creative,10,2 August 2015,"Memento is a movie about Leonard (Guy Pearce). He suffers from some kind of short-term memory, but not really, because he can remember everything till the day that his wive gets murdered and raped. He himself gets a head injury, due this he gets his short- terms memory. He remembers everything by taking pictures and by putting down a little description. Leonard also puts down tattoos on his body with very important text on. These texts are clues that he found out about the murder of his wife. with these techniques he tries to track down the murderer of his wife and kill him.The directing of the movie is, as always with Nolan, amazing. I don't have anything more to say about it, only that the fighting scene in the bathroom is a bit to closed up.Not the scene with the flashback of the murder. But for the rest (not sure if you say it like that in English, not native) the directing was good.the acting was also very well. Really liked Guy Pearce in this movie, I personally think that this is one of his best role. Carrie- Anne Moss played one of my favorite characters. I really liked the way she played with Leonards short-term memory. This really made me hate her, but it was just so well acted. Joe Pantoliano as Teddy was a fun character, and he stays mysterious throughout a big part of the movie. Some things that I liked about the movie were that you really had to pay attention during the movie. I also liked that the movie was very well created. With this I mean that you get some scenes then you get some gray and white scenes and then there are scenes that are about what happened before the first scenes and so on and so on. But the ending is just mind blowing and was my favorite part of the movie. This is because it is so well written and clever.

The story is nothing new, however the way the story is told is so refreshing that the story doesn't matter any more. Instead of telling the story from a the start, the director Christopher Nolan decided to tell the story backwards and through the eyes of Leonard Shelby. In that way he manage to get our attention because we see the story as Shelby see it and as Shelby, we don't have a clue to what happened before and we have to watch the film close in order to get all the details, and yet by the end I was left with the feeling that I missed something and questioned my own memory and was doubting whether I understood the film and really saw everything.So here is a film who deals with the subject of memory and truth and eventually make the audience doubt his own memory and what he perceive as the truth. The whole film is like a puzzle and the end doesn't give you the satisfaction of solving it.On the contrary. By the end you get another version to the events which seems as possible as what we saw before.Technically speaking this is simply a superb film. If I understand correctly Nolan has shoot the movie the way it is been told(ie: backwards) which means that someone had to follow every detail so it will be accurate. I don't think I have seen any mistakes in the details. But technicality is not the only thing that stand out in this movie. The acting is brilliant. Guy Pearce shows that LA Confidential was not a one time achievement and Joe Pantoliano as Teddy is in good form and give the right balance to Pearce's character. I also liked the way San-Francisco is portrayed here,not as a big city with a lot of people but rather like a city in the middle of nowhere.I highly recommend this film to anyone who find himself bored from films which carry so much cliché and want to see something original. In this film they will find originality which at the same time keep us interested in what's going on.Simply go and see.",Memento

He cannot write dialogue and his philosophy is very very basic, but as a 20 year old sooooo out there. I've revisited a lot of his films, Batman, my favourite superhero being one of them.

362,leftistcritic,Nolan explores the depths of memory,10,1 April 2019,"Last night I watched this film, after re-watching If Beale Street Could Talk, which was a sharp departure from the aforementioned film. Explored is the similar theme of memory and remembering, one which often comes up in shows like Mr. Robot, which is ending this year and Terry Gilliam's strange dystopian film, Twelve Monkeys, in 1995. The plot is simple: the protagonist, Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce, has lost his short-term memory and is trying to find the killer of his wife, Catherine Shelby (played by Jorja Fox). As he tells the audience, he lost his memory as he was knocked out after he shot his wife's killer, so he remembers ""important facts"" on Polaroids he takes and on tattoos across his body. Certain characters literally take advantage of this condition like a local bartender, Natalie, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, to kill/intimidate her boyfriend, Dodd, played by Callum Keith Rennie, and the head of a local hotel, Burt, played by Mark Boone Junior, the latter whom charges him for two separate rooms because he ""won't remember."" However, the story posed by John Edward ""Teddy"" Gammell, played by Joe Pantoliano, who claims to be an undercover cop which is investigating local gangs, including James F. ""Jimmy"" Grantz, played by Larry Holden. In the story Teddy tells, the protagonist killed his own wife, whom had diabetes, with injection of insulin, and now goes around from town to town killing people whom he claims are the ""killer"" of his wife! If this is the case, however, why does Teddy allow it to happen? Has the protagonist conditioned himself, as he claims happened with the case of Samuel R. ""Sammy"" Jankis (played by Stephen Tobolowsky) and Mrs. Jankis (played by Harriet Sansom Harris)? Or is that just a fabrication in his mind?By the end of the film, the viewer is still relatively confused. Whom can be trusted? Teddy or the protagonist? We still don't know. We know no more than the story provides us. It is almost an obvious bet that every character is lying to the audience, deceiving each other in some way or another. But that makes the film interesting. In this way it is similar to Happy Accidents (2000) in that we don't know whether Sam Deed (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is telling the truth about his travel from the future to the present, or if he is just a con man trying to make ends meet. This is why neurologists praise this film, as do film critics as it is a film that keeps you thinking.I could be like soloyoda in their April 2001 review of this film but I think summarizing part of the plotline is worth doing, especially since there is no ""happy ending"" to this film, or no spoilers in the sense that they will ruin the movie's enjoyment. This film is much more than what that review calls ""a highly intelligence and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards,"" although that is abundantly true without question. I would add that this film is interesting in that is not a straight narrative from beginning to end, but jumps around. In some ways this makes it resemble Pulp Fiction (1994), although that film is, in and of itself, its own animal. Additionally, I would say this film (Nolan's second film he directed after Following in 1998) differs from Nolan's other films, although it shares some similarities, in terms of a focus on memory and remembering, with Inception (2010) and Interstellar (2014).With that, I bring this review to a close and feel that it fully deserves a 10 out of 10, a rating I give out sparingly, only to the films I like the most.",Memento

The main character is an amnesiac investigator searching for the killer of his wife. He utilizes tattoos and notes to follow a trail of evidence, even when he can't remember how he gained the evidence. The plot has enough twists and turns and surprise endings to be part of an amusement park. Just when you think your getting a hold of what is going on, everything swings into another direction. The reverse chronology of the main plot line makes things interesting to say the least.Guy Pearce does a convincing portrayal of Leonard (the amnesiac), and pretty much all the other actors are fitting in their respective parts. The music is excellent and used very effectively. The individual segments (roughly 5 minutes each) are well executed. There is even some well-placed humor thrown in.The flaw that prevents me from awarding Memento a 10 is also its main strength: the plot. While the plot is excellently crafted and executed, it is just too convoluted. Maybe thats partly because of the reverse chronology, but it feels really unstable and is hard to follow at times. The complexity adds a lot to the meaning as a whole, but prevents casual viewing.Nevertheless, this is essential viewing. The material is of the highest quality and the subject is fascinating. So many questions are spawned about the uses and abuses of amnesia, and just memory in general. It is one of those films that your going to think about all the time.",Memento

I'm not saying that all psychological thrillers do that; I'm simply stating that no psychological thriller will ever come close to as Memento, except the Sixth Sense. I was impressed how Christopher Nolan decided to make his own psychological thriller so he can mess with the viewer's minds.
This is one of those movies where every detail of the movie counts that you can't cook or do chores, because then you would be lost and confused. We don't know much about this person, but we do get a little brief background information about him. But from the evidence that I gathered throughout I sympathize with his character because he's looking for his wife while at the same time suffering from short-term memory loss. And because of his condition I feel pity for him as the people he interacts with treat him differently. But at the same time his past life he's a jerk if you think about it and so it brings me the question of should I feel his pain or not? I'm going to end my review here because it's really hard not to give anything away with people who haven't seen this movie and I want people to experience this masterpiece without spoilers.

366,darkjosh,Unforgettable,10,24 April 2001,"Guy Pearce is a showcase of paranoia and confusion in Memento, director Christopher Nolan's dizzying onscreen jigsaw puzzle that plunges the audience into a mesmerizing web of intrigue, obsession, and deceit.Memento is a film noir that offers a strikingly original premise.  Guy Pearce stars as Leonard Shelby, an ex-insurance investigator whose wife was murdered while he lay unconscious from a head injury.  The injury, as it turns out, is catastrophic: he can no longer form new memories and only remembers everything before the attack.  The story makes for a bevy of confusion as the viewer frantically tries to size up each character, along with Pearce attempting to do the same.To say more of the plot would be doing the film a disservice.  It's a rare cinematic experience where you actually struggle with a character and question everything that you've just seen.  Engrossing from its beginning, it never fails to stun in its complexity - not only running itself backwards (we begin the movie at the end and work backwards to a jolting, brilliant beginning) - but also including flashbacks and a separate scene in which Pearce explains his condition, both running tantamount with the main story. Nolan has crafted a unique cerebral teaser in Memento that asks the viewer to partake in the chaotic madness and continues to haunt and ask questions after its brilliant finale, not only about what has just happened onscreen but also questions the concept of memory and what we choose to believe has happened in the past even if our memory isn't totally clear.Technically, the film stays true to the film noir genre: desolate, bleak, dark, and colorless.  The cinematography is handled with jagged splicing and the visual style employed is central conveying the jumbled, boggled mind of Pearce's character.  We think we see things, clues are embedded in split second frames assailed at the viewer in bursts of haze.Guy Pearce gives us his best performance in Shelby, seamlessly getting lost in the profundity of his character's obsessive-compulsive pit.  His quiet, understated performance is tragic, heartfelt, entrancing, menacing, and fascinating in his calculating coldness and tender remembrances.  Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano both turn in twisted and wonderfully ambiguous performances as people involved in Pearce's quest for revenge. Surprisingly, we never see the pair onscreen even though the two supporting actors previously worked on The Matrix.In a time where CGI and special effects seem to be ruling in theaters, Memento reminds us what truly makes a fantastic and truly memorable cinematic experience: innovative storytelling and interesting, sympathetic characters.  We needn't see explosions to be entertained, or cars chasing each other at ridiculous speeds, or extraneous gunplay.  Not only does the masterpiece that is  Memento manage to pull out the rug from its audience and be incredibly intelligent, it manages to raise questions where other films might simply be content to provide two hours of mindless diversion. Memento is anything but mindless and will have you guessing hours after the credits have rolled and is one of the year's best films.10 out 10",Memento

In another way the ""condition"" as he refers to every 5 minutes is some way a payback due to one of his insurance investigations that resembled a case of another person who suffered this condition. It's amazing to see a man doing everything in his power above his limits trying to keep everything in prospective even though he forgets about it a few minutes after.Guy Pearce was great in this movie as Leonard, who lets people know the problem he has yet doesn't want anybody to pity him so he stays strong in his struggle. It's great to see Guy has come so far ever since he left the Australian series Neighbours.I rate this movie 8/10, the plot was great, but it did confuse me. His wife is raped and murdered, he is out looking for a guy he doesn't even know, but how did the other characters get involved?My favourite lines in this movie were : Natalie: ""So what's the last thing you remember?"" Leonard: ""My wife...."" Natalie: ""That's sweet"" Leonard: ""...dying..."".......",Memento

This is both disturbing, hilarious, violent and thoughtful.Leanord (aka Sammy Jenkins- in my view, anyway) is a psychological wreck. He writes notes and gives himself tattoos to keep memories and 'play detective' for the ultimate reason: to avenge the rape and murder of his wife.Surprisingly, it sounds a lot worse than it is.

374,rowanmaillot,Just saw- One of my favorite movies of all time,10,7 February 2020,"This is based on a novel by Jonathon Nolan (Chris Nolan's brother) and starring Australian actor Guy Pearce. Huge spoilers ahead: This movie works backwards, I feel like the movie wouldn't have made a-lot of sense without me knowing going in that the story would be told backwards, but I just saw this 7/02/2020 and boy oh boy is this a masterpiece.
Basically, Leonard Shelby has this incident when his wife is getting raped and murdered by two brutal attackers, Leonard hears her screams from the bathroom rushes in and tries to fight them off, but ends up getting his head smashed into a glass mirror, and then supposedly they leave. The story is that Leonard's wife survives, she is diagnosed with diabetes and he keeps injecting her with a needle but he forgets (due to his amnesia) that he is overdosing her with the drug, and she ends up dying of an overdose. Altogether, the story is original, unique and anything you would hope for in a psychological thriller.Even though the story is quite dark, there is a humour to it. For example, character Teddy is hilarious, making jokes about Leonard's condition. Overall, this is my favorite psychological thriller by far! Grade: A+",Memento
375,jonathandoe_se7en,Really makes you think...,8,2 June 2001,"Whilst watching Memento's first few minutes, I remember thinking ""my god this is going to be tedious"". As the story kept showing us a scene, then showing the scene that led to the scene, but after about ten minutes I didn't notice at all. I was hooked.Memento was British Director Christopher Nolan's follow up to his low budget Début ""Following"" and I must say he looks like a director to watch. The handling of the tricky flashback structure and tightly woven plot means you're guessing right to the end (or should that be the begining). Telling the story like this really helps us identify with the main character Leonard (Guy Pearce), we never are sure of our actions, never knowing who we can trust, we just have to stick with what Leonard believes as to being right.The performance were great, especially Joe Pantoliano as Leonard's only friend ""Teddy"". He really manages to step out from the shadow of the lead and give his character a much-needed depth. Carrie-Anne Moss did not fair as well, I thought her character tended to be a little irritating, not to mention intelligent for a woman who works in a biker bar. But this is Pearce's film and he does a fantastic job realising such a complex character, giving him a constant sense of fear, cool and uncertainty.I won't say much about the plot because the less you know the better, it's much more rewarding to gather the pieces together and in some way making the viewer part of the movies. So don't let what people have been referring to as a gimmicky plot put you off, check out this grown-up thriller immediately.(***** Out of *****)",Memento

When you first watch the movie you aren't sure what's going on (confusion is the intent to kind of give the viewer Leonard's perspective), you believe it's a mystery and are trying to piece things together, but in all actuality, it's not a mystery and there is nothing to really piece together, which is fine, just don't kid yourself that it's some type of mind bender that you as a viewer must figure out. Spoilers At the end of the day, Leonard is constructing these endeavors to give his life meaning...that's the big ahhah moment! So the whole time you're trying to figure out what's going on, the answer is; Leonard is just giving himself something to do. Not that big of a deal. Not a biggie, but the scene where Leonard found out that the Motel Clerk was ripping him off was kind of lame. Wouldn't that be something worth writing down, rather then chuckling about?

He just can't make new memories. So, he uses notes, tattoos and Polaroid cameras to make new memories. One thing is that, the story runs backwards, jumping back and forth after every scene, which creates a suspense. Guy pearce has done a good acting, neither too bland nor too overreacting.The problem with it is that, it couldn't explain how can he remember that he is amnesiac. It's a major plot hole.

380,RolloTomasi,"Write yourself a note: ""See Memento""",10,25 April 2001,"`Memento' is the first film of 2001 that matters. Hopefully it won't be the last. It's about a guy who loses his short-term memory after sustaining a head injury trying to prevent his wife's murder. He remembers who he is, his entire life before it happened. His lone objective is to find the man responsible for the last new memory he ever made: the death of his wife. He believes he can do this because memory is unreliable anyway. The facts are not. In order to continue knowing the facts, he writes himself notes. He writes notes on Polaroid photos. He has some of these notes made into tatoos (and you thought your mom was bad for leaving those annoying reminder notes all over the house).The film's subject is memory, but it also proves to be a monumental test of the audience's memory. Mr. Nolan takes conventional film storytelling apart in a way no one has ever seen. In doing so he breathes new life into the entire film medium. `Memento' is any dedicated film-goer's Ultimate Challenge. Anyone who fully grasps everything that goes on in this thing on first viewing deserves the Handsome Reward. Don't plan on propping up your feet and relaxing if you go see this. Prepare to actually use your noggin or come away lost.Beginning a film at the end is a convention that's almost over-used by directors these days, but never has a film begun at the last scene, then the next to the last scene, and on and on. The final scene is the very beginning of the story. You ask, well where's the suspense then? Just see it. Nolan isn't just trying to be clever either (but ends up being very VERY clever anyway). Telling it backwards is his way of putting us in Leonard's head. Any time a scene begins, we have no idea what's going on (again, not new to the film medium). We have to figure it out as it goes, the same way Leonard Shelby (`L.A. Confidential's Guy Pearce) has to.For two hours the film gets more and more captivating, but also more and more mentally taxing. It's a real test of a person's capacity to pay attention to details and, well, to remember things. Not everyone is going to be looking for this kind of experience in the movie they bought a ticket for, which is fine. But I think anyone (except children of course) can get something out of it.The story Nolan just happens to tell backwards isn't any more complex than a good thriller should be, that is, after your mind takes it apart and reconstructs it. This will be a must-own DVD when it comes out. At least then I'll have the option, just once, of starting at the end and watching it in chronological order by the miracle of the back' and next' buttons. By then I'm sure I'll have seen it a few more times. Grade: A",Memento

Perhaps years of reading 'twist in the tale' novels by people like Jeffrey Deaver has made me more immured from excitement of this type of thing, I don't know. I didn't guess the ending, but then like an episode of Taggart, it didn't reveal sufficient plot details along the way to enable you to do this. On the other hand the punchline didn't knock me off my feet either. The best I can say about the story is that it was better than The Usual Suspects (and I did guess the end in that). I was disappointed that the writer or director felt the need to include a scene where a drink exposes just how goldfish-like the hero's memory is. We'd already established that and the scene added nothing to the story other than a eewww moment, but other than that, every little rewind of the story and extra exposure of the plot fitted and worked well. Still, at the end of it all, I couldn't help feeling so what? Guy Pearce filled a character without any depth with real depth. Partially helped by a great physique and some intriguing tattoos, although we knew almost nothing of his character other than his plight, you were driven to watch as he made an otherwise unbelievable character perfectly believable. Ultimately though, just because we believe he could be real, that isn't the same as caring what might happen to him and for all it's clever twisting, take away the superb performance of Guy Pearce and we're left with a rather gimmicky plot rather than a classic film.",Memento

383,Manthorpe,Perfection in film.,10,5 February 2004,"Leonard Shelby suffers from a brain injury he received when he tried to stop a pair of burglars that had broken into his house and raped and killed his wife one fateful night. He cannot form new memories. He can remember everything clearly before the accident, but nothing afterwards. He must figure out a way to live his life with this condition and to catch the person or persons responsible. Can he do it, and if he does, how will he remember it?First off, I would like to say that Memento is probably my favorite movie of all time as of yet, and not without reason. It's probably the movie with the most reply value that I can even imagine. Every time I watch it, I notice something new or come up with a new theory on things. The acting is as good as it gets and all the characters were cast perfectly. Guy Pearce is one of my favorite actors simply because of this movie and L.A. Confidential alone. Joe P. plays the perfect good cop/bad cop and Carrie Ann Moss is very convincing as the revenge riddled, manipulative woman.
Everything about Memento is flawless. The script, acting, dialog, camera work, editing, direction, story.everything. This is as good as it gets folks..to such a degree that I seriously almost feel sorry for the people who don't get this movie or understand it, as they're missing something so spectacular. Some people have even gone as far to say that the movie contains plot holes. I beg to differ and must presume that these such persons aren't too quick. There's a method to the madness. Of course the movie has holes in it which open up almost endless possibilities, but that is a reflection of the fact that Leonard did not have all the details either. His file for instance. We are left with fragments of ""memories"" just like Leonard, and are forced to actually think and try to figure it out with him. Some people don't like to think I guess, or are completely incapable. Maybe it would have been better for them if Lawrence Fishburne rambled on about all of the details for about 45 minutes with sunglasses on, all while pooching his lips out. The fact that we don't know all of the details and that the story's origin and ending do have infinite possibilities is one of the reasons that I love this film so much and is why it's so great. Brilliant, simply brilliant. Had it been done accidentally or out of tactlessness then I would think the exact opposite, but that is certainly not the case here.Sometimes a `gimmick', like filming a movie to be watched out of chronological order, can be pretentious and unnecessary, as we see in movies like 21 Grams. However, Memento's story was meant to be told this way. It's another technique that adds to the audience's lack of knowledge about what has happened in the past, exactly like Leonard's. These techniques all contribute to getting the audience to care about Leonard, and it works. Although the film is viewed backwards, all of the scenes slightly overlap each other so it's easy to follow. The director has used two different types of scenes here as well. We have the color, reverse sequence scenes that show what Leonard has been through.and we have seemingly chronological black and white scenes in which we are given tidbits of information about Leonard and his condition as he talks to an anonymous person on the telephone. Truly masterful work. This movie will leave you thinking about it for a very long time. I still like to think about the possibilities...Flawless. 10.5/10  people should be strapped in a chair and hooked to a plethysmograph and forced to watch it over and over and over..",Memento
384,starlit-sky,The Most Original Movie Of The Year So Far,10,17 June 2001,"Memento, for one thing, is a very ORIGINAL movie. It is impressive how the story is told which makes it so original. It is quite astonishing to see such an innovative method of story telling after all these years of movie making. The movie just makes you believe that there is no end of human creativity and imagination.Story is told backwards from the perspective of the protagonist who cannot remember what happened 30 seconds before due to an incident in which his wife was raped and killed. The story of the movie is his attempts to find his wife's killer. It is very interesting to watch the story going backwards. The director, in my opinion, makes a flawless job of telling the story backwards; it is just ingenious. The success of the movie is mostly based on the screenplay, which is written very cleverly. In each scene, you see what happened before and try to make a connection to what you saw in the previous scene, which, in fact, comes afterwards in real time. As you reach the end of the movie, you come to know the reasons that triggered the events in the beginning, I mean at the end. The most important elements in the story telling are the writings on the protagonist's body, notes at the back of the pictures he takes in order to remember the characters and the little notes he writes on papers. As the movie goes on, you see when and for what reason he took the notes on the back of the pictures and tattooed some of them on his body. The movie also kind of makes you ask the question whether one can rely on the notes he takes as the incidents happen and whether one can rely on these notes' corresponding to the true incidents in reality. Protagonist claims that he can, answering, ""yes"" to that question but I thought the otherwise. This is not a easy movie to understand. I am going to rent it when it comes out because there are some things that I didn't understand. In the end, like me, you may find yourself asking whether there was a character named Sammy in reality, who killed his wife, what was his real job or even who was Teddy. But these questions don't take any excitement from the movie. This is a very, very good movie. I strongly believe that this movie deserves at least a couple of Oscar nominations (I know there are probably very good productions to come before the year), including ""The Best Original Screenplay"", ""Best Director"" or even ""Best Editing"".",Memento

Leonard Shelby is a man who's out for vengeance. His wife was murdered and suffered a head injury to save her from her death. This head trauma resulted in him not being able to make new memories, while still recalling past occurrences prior to his accident. He lives in a hotel room, trying to figure out how to find his wife's killer). To remember, Leonard writes down notes and takes pictures. As this plays out, we ponder if this condition is psychological or solely just a physical consequence of his state of mind.I'm not going to spoil anything, but I will say that by the end, we figure out the truth behind his wife's death and who real killed her.

The incredible experiences in which Matthew McConaughey's Cooper ('Interstellar'), Leonardo DiCaprio's Cobb ('Inception') and Guy Pearce's Leonard ('Memento') find themselves often accentuate their inability to appear convincing, real, and therefore human. I understand that when a protagonist is designed with no short-term memory (as 'Memento''s is), painting a vivid narrative portrait of him is no easy task; knowing this didn't improve my experience of the film, though. Although I didn't relate to or care for Leonard or indeed any of the other characters of 'Memento', I still gave it a favourable rating, and this is why: The narrative style employed by Nolan in this film truly is something to behold, and it is imposed in a manner which prevents it from being arbitrary or superficial. I'll say no more, as interpreting and coming to terms with the storytelling of 'Memento' was quite rewarding, and I implore you not to check any synopses prior to viewing the film. Whilst the technical aspects of the title are great (I'm chiefly thinking of the editing), I repeat my point about not really being able to invest in the content of Nolan's world. Perhaps I'm a philistine for preferring other ""lost identity"" titles such as Denis Villeneuve's 'Enemy' and Brad Anderson's 'The Machinist', but Nolan certainly makes 'Memento' a unique experience.",Memento
393,adeckofcards,Memories of a crime,9,3 June 2020,"In his first work ('Following'), Christopher Nolan showed his interest in covering psychological issues and telling them through a non-linear narrative. But it is in his second feature film ('Memento'), where he launches his great bet.
The story introduces us to a man who, after an incident, where his wife was murdered, loses the ability to create new memories and must write notes to remember facts, people and places.
To tell this story, Nolan uses a double narrative making this probably his best and smartest script. The first narrative path starts from a fact and goes backwards telling how it got there, this allows the viewer to be on a par with the character, since you do not know what happened before what we are seeing, as if we also had no memory.
The second narrative path is linear, going from back to front. These two narrative pathways intertwine in a fluid and coherent way, making a story that seems complicated very understandable.

396,Jeremy Bristol,The structure,7,23 February 2002,"I've read a lot of reviews of Memento that say the reverse structure shows how it feels to be like Leonard.  After the first scene, it doesn't!  If he has no memory, then he can't backtrack, now can he?  He can't figure out what we end up seeing by the end of the movie.  He would move forward, aimlessly (and once he takes his picture at the beginning and writes out that he's finally done it, then he will no longer have the mystery the ""ending"" of the movie claims he desires).  There are different types of narrative structures, and they each have their uses and limitations.  Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" is told from an anonymous and distant point of view, because if it was in first person or even third person limited, the story of a town who each year select a victim to be stoned wouldn't be believeable.  Just as that is true, stories like Steinbeck's ""The Chrysanthemums"" need to be closer to the main character but still not in their voice.  Then there are stories, such as Welty's ""Why I Live in the P.O."" which are told by the main character, yet reveals that character's limited perspective and biases.Perhaps Nolan would have done better to have stuck with a structure that truly stayed with how the character thought, though quite frankly, I don't think it's possible for a movie to truly express that kind of condition, because we are not afflicted and anything shown--forwards or backwards or sideways--will be remembered.  Perhaps he really should have written it in a more omniscient style, showing how the other characters react to him as opposed to the other way around.  After all, with the exception of the forward-moving black and white sequences, he always acted exactly the same (until the speeches at the end), which makes it a little boring and repetetitive to follow him constantly.",Memento

It was silly. The idea of Polaroid photos and daft little notes was just stupid. I couldn't remember anything that had happened, didn't want to, and it almost made me demented.

""Memento"" is one of those movies that require repeated viewings. Not just to understand the smaller points/facts that you may not have caught in the first viewing; but simply to experience this mind-blowing puzzle of a movie over and over again! It is highly addictive and it did leave me with a number of questions in my head (apart from the ending). The only way to answer these questions was to watch it again! And it seemed just as enjoyable as it did in the first viewing! This is one of the best examples of modern noir, and quite possibly the best film released that year! It must have taken an awful lot of thinking to structure the film in the manner shown. This is a very different form of story-telling and it works to the best effect!Guy Pearce is great as the confused man who lives only on the basis of some pictures, scribblings and tattoos, 'cause he is suffering from short-term memory loss. Now is that bad or is that bad! Imagine yourself in one situation or place, not remembering how you got to that place in the first place! Not recalling who you spoke to..maybe ten minutes back! Step into Guy's shoes while you watch the movie and you will realize the horror of his situation! Of the supporting cast, Joe Pantoliano delivers a fantastic performance as Teddy. Carrie-Anne Moss looks beautiful and does justice to her role.

But, experimental films often fail to engage because the experiment overwhelms the story or there is no real story to tell.  Timecode is a good example of an experiment that failed.  Memento, on the other hand, is an experiment that succeeds brilliantly.  As you can tell within the first few minutes of the film, this movie tells the story in reverse.  It's almost like they took a conventional movie, cut it into scenes, and played the scenes in reverse order.  This works because you are seeing the world from the eyes of someone who has no short term memory.  As such, this could have been a gimmik.  Instead, it's a tool for telling a complex and fascinating story.  I found myself re-watching many scenes to figure out what had happened and what I had missed, only adding to the experience of the film.  Beware, if you are a lazy, don't bother.

Essentially the film runs, for lack of a better phrase, backward. Now in any other flick this would seem a bit gimmicky. A way to hide the fact that the movie essentially doesn't have much going for it other than its quarky narrative structure. Though Memento just happens to feature a protagonist that suffers short term memory loss. So our hero is constantly feeling disjointed, not knowing how exactly how he got where he is or what exactly his next move should be. Its one thing to use this condition as a plot device, its an all together different thing to try and put the audience in the shoes of said protagonist. Are you a bit confused while watching Memento, at times yes...but so is the hero. I find this to be a rather brilliant gimmick, if you add this to all the other brilliant exercises in rock solid film making you get one heck of a neo-noir masterpiece.",Memento
415,crazyrabbits,Truly a great film; a definite must-see...,10,2 July 2006,"It's actually quite rare to see a full-blown character drama in this day and age, but that's exactly what ""Memento"", the 2001 film by Christopher Nolan, really is. I actually didn't want to write a review on this film for quite some time, because it was hard to grasp all the layers of the film, and believe me, there are many. Needless to say, though, this is one of my all-time favorite films, and it is truly a novel experience in film-making.If you haven't seen the film, the plot goes like this: Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pierce) is an amnesiac. Ever since an intruder broke into his home and murdered his wife (played by Jorja Fox), knocking him unconscious in the process (or so he would like to believe), Leonard is cursed with a fragmented and quickly-disappearing memory. He can remember everything that happened prior to the event, but everything that happens afterwards quickly fades away, unless Leonard writes a note about it. Throughout the course of the film, Leonard interacts with a variety of individuals in the search for the man who killed his wife, and in addition, an extraneous plot (from the audience's perspective for most of the film, anyway) occurs with Leonard remembering flashbacks about an insurance salesman named Sammy Jenkins.It's hard to understand the film, especially since it progresses in a non-linear fashion. The movie runs ""backwards"", in that it shows a scene, then the scene prior to that one, then the scene prior to that one, and so on. It is difficult for the audience to understand what is going on, but it's possible that we are feeling the same way as Leonard: confused and disoriented. Even by the end of the film, some things still don't make sense, requiring multiple viewing to understand the motivations of all the characters and how they relate to Leonard.Personally, I don't think Christopher Nolan could have picked a better cast of actors. Guy Pearce does an incredible job of portraying a helpless and confused man who is never quite sure of what's going on, but by the end of the film, the audience realizes just how out of it Leonard really is. I also thought Carrie-Anne Moss did a great job as Natalie, Leonard's lover with suspicious motives, and Joe Pantoliano as Teddy, a cop who is playing Leonard to his advantage.It's a testament to this film that it works as well playing in a forward pattern (as seen on the Special Edition DVD) as it does when shown in non-chronological order, because it still manages to surprise the audience, and also shows how the other characters in the film manipulate Leonard for their own means.The audience is right there along with Leonard as he struggles to figure out what the tattoos on his body mean, who his friends are, and how he can solve the mystery of his wife's killer. The only trick is that the ""B-plot"" of Sammy Jenkins, and Jenkins' wife forcing Sammy to do a test on her, is the real cause of Leonard's condition, and is subtly hinted at throughout the film. This puts Leonard in a new light and forces the audience to re-evaluate their opinion of him.The directing and action are second to none. I think that Christopher Nolan realized that to tell a good story, you need a good plot, good interaction between the characters, and that you need to keep the audience guessing, something that is sadly lacking in many films nowadays.It is true that if Leonard has a memory condition that causes him to forget things, he wouldn't be able to know that he has a problem, but I didn't notice that until the third time I viewed this film, and by that time it was just a minor distraction. Unless you have hours to try and dissect this film looking for anything that isn't true to real life, there aren't any real plot holes or inconsistencies in the film.Bottom Line: Without a doubt, this is one of the best movies I've seen. It's hard to explain, but if you see it a couple times, you will understand what the film is all about. Rent this when you have a chance.",Memento
416,Clintekabor,Memories can be distorted,9,3 March 2021,"Memento is a very unique thriller. It's very clever, intelligent, original, absorbing, and I'm guessing you wouldn't have seen anything quite like it.It demonstrates a very powerful message which is that we all tell lies to ourselves.The films structure is told in a non-linear fashion involving two timelines. Ultimately we begin at the end of the story, and work our way back to the beginning.It's filmed in both colour and black and white sequences with the latter showing the events of Leonard's story in an easier to understand chronological order.At first it might seem quite difficult to follow and, while as a viewer you are puzzled from the outset, we start to realise that we are meant to feel confused as disoriented as if were are the one who is in Leonards shoes.We have the same feelings, thoughts, and ideas as our main protagonist. Which means most of the film is also a mystery to us, and we are left with trying to put together the scattered pieces of Leonard's past.We learn that Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is unable to create new memories. He has short-term memory loss and received this 'condition' after he was hit over the head from a break in at his home which led to the rape and murder of his wife.He recalls a case from his Insurance industry days regarding another person with the same 'condition' named Sammy Jankis who he initially believed was faking his condition as Sammy had an inability to learn new things through repetition. And so he recollects techniques such as sticky notes, polaroid photographs and tattoos to help form his lost memory.Leonard is manipulated and used by many people throughout the film that you can't help but feel a great sympathy for his life story and what he has to go through. There is no one he can trust but himself.There is so many twists and turns that Memento keeps you guessing, and you mind constantly racing for answers. You will be stunned by the ending when it's secrets are finally revealed.Guy Pearce was phenomenal, and this was easily his most memorable role to date. He was assisted by having such a diverse, and powerful role but he really makes it his own. You really see and believe him to be Leonard Shelby.This is a film that you need to be switched on, and focused to understand all the little details that make the film wrap tightly together, similar to The Machinist starring Christian Bale.Take away all other background noise, and immerse yourself in the story, and I guarantee that you will have a very unforgettable experience.9/10",Memento

Pulp Fiction at least could string its ""backward"" story together coherently and every single character was interesting and ""human"".

The only remote bright spot I found with this movie was the performance of Joe Pantoliano and he couldn't even salvage this wreck. Pretty sad when a supporting character injects more interest in your movie than any of your main ones! The continuity (yes even is reverse) constantly contradicts itself, and is so much more over complicated than need be, that you just say ""oh the hell with it"" about halfway through...that is if you haven't fallen asleep yet. I honestly am dumbfounded as to why this movie is so popular, and even more baffled as to what it's doing on the IMDb's top 250. The only thing I can figure is either a lot of people will vote ""10"" on anything that Christopher Nolan does; anything that could be considered ""alternative or indie"" or that there's a trend occurring that anything that might be different from your standard movie ""must be cool."" Thank goodness Nolan redeemed himself with ""Batman Begins"" & ""The Dark Knight"" or I would seriously consider boycotting his future work.Absolute garbage abound with lousy writing, unconvincing and lousy acting and unengaging dull characters (except Pantoliano).

It's still with me.  Pearce gives an Oscar-worthy performance as a man with short-term memory loss, who needs a polaroid camera and the written word to constantly remind himself of what and who he is.  Themes of revenge, of guilt, and of hatred are so beautifully intermeshed with some of the most under-appreciated actors in Hollywood today- Carrie-Anne Moss, anyone?- that one leaves the theatre THINKING- this is a THINKING movie (don't get scared), that makes you question every memory you ever had, every experience you ever experienced, and the very life, the reality, you live in.  In that way, I guess, it's like The Matrix, besides the fact that two of the actors who are in that film are also in this one.I also equate this movie to ""Gladiator"", in the sense that, despite it's early February-2001 release, Pearce's performance is so astoundingly thought-provoking and well-acted that an Oscar-nomination is most likely a SLAM-DUNK for next year's Oscars.",Memento

Our story starts at the end of the story and moves back (forward?) to the beginning, along the way we meet a cast of eclectic characters including nominal police officer Teddy Gammell, a bartender called Natalie and a host of peripheral characters.Since Leonard can't form deep memories, he uses tattoos to remember names and opinions on those he meets. Teddy isn't to be believed at all while Natalie helps him out of pity, for example. Inevitable, however, those around him take advantage of this situation by using him for their own ends. Natalie drives Leonard into a frenzy where he strikes her then waits outside for 20 minutes and reconstructs the incident into a situation to suit her own purposes, sending Leonard on a goose chase. Brilliant! Through the flashbacks we also see a couple afflicted with the same disease, where the husband cannot learn through practice but is denied a claim until his wife repeatedly asks him for a diabetes shot, which he repeats over and over and over until she passes away. We start seeing this couple as an extension of Leonard's own, especially when we see him giving her the same kind of shot! In the end, both halves of the movie collide and we witness the burglary, the assault on both of them and Teddy's role in the whole thing.

There's a series of decisions Leonard makes in that scene which he knows he'll forget, and those decisions are recognizably human, and there's some terrific reverberation, particularly to a scene in which Natalie goes out to a car to wait.  Obviously I'm being obtuse, but those who have seen the movie will know what I'm speaking of, and probably agree.

It is the most beautiful, poetic, and strangely told thriller I've ever come across. Some people are probably not going to like ""Memento"" because of its overwhelming complexity. But the fact that it is so hard to follow is part of the point. Nolan made an effort to allow an audience to be able to tap into the mind of a person with short-term memory loss and be just as confused as Leonard Shelby, the protagonist with the strange condition. He does this, as everybody knows, by telling the film backwards, though all the clues are laid out for you and characters are introduced to you like you're watching a regular movie. Amazing. And of course, an amazing concept like this calls for equally amazing actors to carry the story. And they more than rise to the occasion. No one could've done a better job than Guy Pearce. He is simply spectacular. As is Joe Pantoliano, who brings a charismatic comic relief to the piece (which is certainly needed).

It's very hard to talk about this film without spoiling it but it's way better if you watch the film without knowing anything about it. So therefore this review will be short and a ""spoiler-free review"".I loved how in the film we see and feel things the way Leonard does. When we have a question about what exactly is happening or who this person is, we are actually left the same as Leonard, WE GET CONFUSED because his condition is like that, he doesn't remember who the person is or how he ended up to where he is now and here comes the reverse way that the story was being told by because when a certain scene comes we ask ourselves the same questions as Leonard. So in the end, THE AUDIENCE IS LEONARD.The directing was absolutely incredible, now it's obviously not like ""Inception"" or ""The Prestige"" because first, it was made in ""2000"", second is that the film's budget proved that you don't need to have a huge budget to make a good film. But, all you need are a talented cast & crew and most importantly, A ""GOOD"" SCRIPT. And that's what makes Memento a must-watch.Guy Pearce was amazing in this film. In my opinion, this is one of the most underrated performances ever. Carrie-Anne Moss was amazing as well and really surprised me because I never thought she would impress me like that especially in this film and with her complex character.In the end, Memento doesn't have that great set design or cinematography or a music score or the other ""filmmaking elements"" that would make it perfect. But, it has a very great screenplay and a creative/talented cast & crew that made this film a must-watch. If you haven't seen Memento you are missing so much. It's a classic and ""Highly recommended"".My rating is 9/10",Memento
429,xiaoli7377,Unique and Brilliant,10,3 September 2020,"""Memento"" is one of those films that the less you know about before you watch it, the more enjoyment you will get out of it during your first viewing. And it's also one that requires multiple viewings in order to understand its deeper themes, subtle hints, and to connect the dots between segments. The story is tightly knit together and masterfully revealed, leaving the viewer engaged and thinking throughout the entire run time.All you need to know about the movie's plot: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is a man who suffers from anterograde amnesia, meaning that he can't produce new memories and has to rely on notes and photographs that he makes for himself to remember things. The movie is told backwards, meaning we begin the story right when it ends, and more and more of the mystery of what led to that ending is unraveled as we experience different scenes and meet different characters involved. We are constantly left questioning previously revealed information. The fun thing about the movie is that there are still multiple interpretations out there about what exactly the truth is, as Christopher Nolan has never revealed the answer.It's really great storytelling, and it really pulls the viewer into its world and constantly leaves them thinking about the larger implications of short, seemingly unconnected events. It's not as action heavy as Nolan's later work, but it's one of the most unique and intriguing mystery movies that I've ever seen. Go into this one as blind as possible. Watch it multiple times. Discuss this film with others who have seen it. It deserves the highest praise and will go down as one of my personal favorite films of all time.",Memento

431,EThompsonUMD,Original and intriguing film noir revision.,9,2 October 2001,"Revising such film noir conventions as a story told through the unreliable point of view and voice-over narration of a morally flawed investigator-protagonist, the pervasive infusion of a dark past into the narrative present, and the use of a femme fatale as an embodiment of evil allure, Memento is perhaps the most original and intriguing revision of the genre since Welles' Touch of Evil.As almost every commentator has noted, the most startling (or 'gimmicky') feature of Memento - and one with obvious roots in the film noir tradition - is its inverted/contorted plot structure. The film loops backwards episodically to present a series of revelations about the main character, Lenny (Guy Pearce), about the motives of his antagonists 'Teddy' (Joe Pantolino) and 'Natalie' (Carrie Ann Moss), and about the nature of Lenny's memory-loss condition. His condition 'isn't amnesia' (or so Lenny tells everyone he meets) but rather such severe short term memory loss that he is unable to assimilate and retain experience - in other words, to make new memories. Consequently, Lenny's identity, or more precisely his self-knowledge, is arrested at the moment he received a blow to his head while trying to stop intruders from raping his wife.Everything that has happened thereafter has no subjective reality for Lenny, only whatever 'objective' reality he can forge using instant photos, notes to himself, and - for the really important stuff - tattoos. But matters are even more complex and paradoxical than this setup might lead one to expect. Gradually, the viewer learns that even the clear memories that Lenny claims to have from before the assault are, like dreams, colored by protective distortions and selectivity. Moreover the so-called facts he has assembled in his investigation and that he defensively claims are more reliable than memory turn out to be irretrievably entangled in subjective motives: his own, Teddy's, and Natalie's. Thus the viewer's initial sympathy for Lenny as a justifiable victim/avenger transforms to horror as Lenny's true current identity becomes clear.Importantly, Memento's regressive plot structure is punctuated and counter-pointed by a series of noirish black and white flashbacks in which Lenny relates to an anonymous phone caller the story of Sammy Jankis, another sufferer of short term memory loss who, ironically, was Lenny's big case in his pre-trauma life as an insurance investigator. Unlike the main narrative, the Sammy sequences are told in chronological order, strategically intersecting and organizing the narrative as it wends its way backwards to the moment when Lenny decides to set in motion the data trail that will lead to the murder we see him commit in the film's opening sequence. In addition, Lenny's reconstruction of the Sammy sequences is itself dreamlike and unreliable since he attributes to Sammy characteristics that (if we can believe Teddy, an utterly corrupt cop) are Lenny's own.In addition to providing plot exposition and a recurring visual/narrative reference point, the Sammy sequences also bring into clear thematic focus the existential implications of memory loss. Like Sammy's, Lenny's 'condition' is a reduction to the most minimal and absurd level of the human mental processes for constructing meaning (in life, in film) out of fragmentary phenomena and evanescent recollections. In an age of Alzheimer's, deconstruction, and ego-fictions, most viewers will all-too-easily identify with Lenny's painfully hopeless and terrifyingly arbitrary quest to hold reality steady as is it fizzles and flits away.",Memento

Well, it's unlikely you won't be able to work it out but try to appreciate the difficulty.Doing a review for this and not spoiling it is about as safe as playing hop scotch on a mine field; but if you won't get too upset about knowing the gist of the film then continue reading now.A guy has bad memory. Tries to find wife's killer. Leaves himself messages. Simple really. No of course it isn't and as if him having a bad memory and constantly repeating himself is difficult enough, the story is told backwards while another story of the same person plays chronologically forward until the two finally meet.And to add to the pressure of your head possibly exploding with confusion and high expectations (it is 27th on IMDb), fear not. The Dark Knight Director Christopher Nolan is at helm, along with Guy Pearce and support from Carrie-Anne Moss - try to forget the fact she was in two of the most disappointing sequels ever.All of them make this fall nothing short of sheer genius, despite not having any knockout performances. However that doesn't mean Guy Pearce isn't convincing as the poor chappy suffering anterograde amnesia (thank you Wikipedia). He deserved a lot more credit for playing such a difficult role without making the lead seem irritating or unbelievable.Ending on a sad note, unless it is watched on a yearly basis it probably won't be the chin-scratcher it was when you first ever saw it, so do make the most of it even if means you have scream at a feather dropping because it interrupted your viewing.",Memento

I had to see a movie that could do that.This movie progresses backward and forward at the same time. It actually takes a little time to understand what order these events are occurring, but after a while, we get the hang of it. The story kept me at the edge of my seat. It was original. What amazed me most was the fact that there were no consistency errors. It was a little fun piecing the story together.I had just seen Guy Pearce's performance in the Count of Monte Cristo, so I had no doubts about his acting, as he could act, and act well. Carrie-Anne Moss surprised me in this role. The other movie I saw her in was the Matrix, where she was this cool, calm, action hero. In Memento, she was the opposite... Almost trailer trash (if NOT trailer trash)! Then there was Joe Pantoliano, also in the Matrix, did have a deceitful role here (just like Cypher). He DID play with the main character's head a little bit.Christopher Nolan did very well writing this film. He made a story that will keep the viewer's interest 100%, he made a few plot twists, and in all, a great movie.If you have not seen Memento yet, you are missing out on an incredible movie.

The movie goes backwards in time and it works well, going backwards is not done often, but for this movie it was necessary - if it was aired in the correct order, Memento would have been less remarkable.

I've seen just about all of the 'classics' (""Citizen Kane"", ""Gone With The Wind"", ""Casablanca"", ""Psycho"", ""The Godfather"", ""2001 : A Space Odyssey"" etc. etc.). I've seen almost every single movie that has ever gotten a Best Picture Oscar, along with a seemingly endless amount of obscure, but great, movies.This is my favorite movie of all time. I never thought I would see a movie that would come out this recently that would make me say that. This movie is truly, truly brilliant.When it comes to movies, I am very critical. I don't just automatically say ""Oh, I'd give that movie an eight or a nine"". For me, a really good movie gets about a seven. If it is exceptionally good, eight. I gave ""Memento"" a perfect 10. This is a perfect movie.I won't bother going into explaining the plot - you can read that anywhere. What I wanted to stress here is that this movie is so perfectly timeless. It will never be outdated. Better yet, it will also never be boring to talk about. There is such a large amount of psychology involved in this movie that it is impossible to catch it all by watching it once. Also, for that matter, ""Memento"" manages to take on different meanings when watched from the end to the beginning (which is proper chronological order). Suddenly lines that you didn't even think of as being significant are extremely crucial. So, to watch it once is to deny yourself of a large part of the movie.That's because ""Memento"" isn't just a movie. It's a puzzle. You are required as the audience to fully realize what was just shown to you. You will be told about 80% of it by the movie (though not always in an obvious way) - but there will be some pieces that you will have to think about and realize afterwards. Of course this isn't the first movie to ever be like that, but ""Memento"" stretches the limits.Also, every scene in ""Memento"" is essential to the grand scheme of things. If any of the scenes were left out, it would leave a hole in the plot.I have heard the backwards storyline of ""Memento"" described as ""gimmicky"". However, if you truly understand the main character's condition, you realize that it is the perfect way to take the audience into his mind.It's been almost a year since I first saw this movie, and I still find myself discovering tiny little facts that just make the movie even MORE interesting. When you have seen a movie about ten or fifteen times, rate it as being a ""10"", call it your ""favorite of all time"", and can STILL discover new interesting things about it almost a year later, then it is safe to call that movie brilliant.",Memento

But here's my initial impressions.I'm a sucker for any film which explores memory and how it makes us what we are. (Blade Runner, Groundhog Day and The Usual Suspects come to mind. What, you wonder why I mentioned Groundhog Day? It's a truly great film, and in a sense, it's like Memento inverted. Bill Murray is the only who can remember he's stuck in a time loop; everyone else forgets.) Memento does a particularly good job, since it forces you to remember events in a new way: backwards. It also makes you wonder about who has control of the narrative. Just because we are shown events doesn't mean they actually happened.
For instance (SPOILER ALERT), Teddy tries to convince Lenny that his wife needed insulin injections. We see a flashback of Lenny pressing a syringe into his wife's thigh. But then we see another quick flashback of the same scene, only Lenny is pinching her thigh this time. Lenny is thrown off, calling into question the stability of his long term memory. And we the viewers question which story is ""true"".Heady stuff indeed. But that's one of the problems I have with Memento. It's too much like a game using people as pawns. The characters were hard to empathize with, partly because they were so hard to figure out, and partly because there was something inhuman about them. One exception is Sammy's wife, the only person I could truly feel for in the film (but did she even exist?) For a while, I could feel sorry for Lenny's loss of his wife and his memory, but his thuggish behavior and calculated plotting became increasingly psychopathic. I, for one, cannot sympathize with murderers.So, I highly recommend Memento, but it certainly does not belong on the IMDB Top 10.",Memento

Not since Bryan Singer and Christopher McQuarrie hit us with ""The Usual Suspects"" have I seen a thriller this refreshing. The plot unfolds in reverse with ingenuity and seamless precision.  Much as McQuarrie relied on Verbal Kint's monologue to carry the viewer from scene to scene, Nolan allows an ongoing telephone conversation to grease his transitions.  A case can be made that Nolan is even more successful.  The film's over arching themes of denial, and the difficulty of living a life that acknowledges a past, present, and future, keep the conversations going well after the movie ends. 
Guy Pearce is outstanding and with this role, should begin to be noticed for the versatile actor he is.  Even though Carrie-Anne Moss turns in a credible performance, she will never get out from under ""Trinity"" in what may end up being sixteen sequels to ""The Matrix"".  Surprisingly, Joe Pantoliano plays the same character he has been playing for 13 years and as is often the case, does it well.  Remember what your momma told you about practice?Hopefully this is just the beginning for Nolan, yet his next project is an action film with big Al Pacino and (gasp) Robin Williams.

I've just seen it a second time, and it struck me just how much Leonard emphasizes the role of what cognitive psychology calls ""procedural memory"" (and which Leonard quite reasonably calls ""habit"" or ""instinct"") in explaining why he's as functional as he is.  Procedural memory is spared in even the worst cases of anterograde amnesia caused by medial temporal lobe (hippocampus, etc.) damage.  And there are cases of people with amnesia as bad as Leonard's who are not institutionalized, but who live at home with their spouses and a system of notes and reminders (emphasis on ""system"").POSSIBLE SPOILER . . I also want to chime in on one of the plot points that is much debated.  Near the end of the movie, Teddy tells Leonard that he's lying to himself about something crucial (and, in fact, transferring the memory of what happened to him so that he remembers it happening to someone else.  You know what I'm talking about, right?)  Most people I've talked to regard the question of whether Teddy is lying about this as ambiguous. It's not.  Sure, people misremember things that are too painful to remember accurately, as Teddy claims Leonard has done.  But you have to remember first, before you can misremember.

459,adam-may-bower,Overrated,5,2 June 2018,"'Memento' is simply overrated due to its overly complex plot and non-linear structure. While I certainly love films that have depth in them, with multiple possible interpretations, and unconventional structures, 'Memento' was far too excessive for its own good. While it had the potential to be a fantastic film, Christopher Nolan ultimately made this film too complicated to be enjoyed. I kept telling myself that the highly-anticipated plot twist in the end will make the rest of film make sense, and thus become a great film, but I was extremely let down by the climax, as there simply isn't one. The ""reveal"" is never really stated to be true, and it's deliberately up to the audience to decide whether there even was a plot twist which I personally think spoils the entire film. But it's really in the structure of the film that ruins it, by being non-linear to a ridiculous extent.

460,diztorted,The exquisiteness of film,10,9 June 2001,"This is a film that is difficult to review as it is to see it, since anything you might say could spoil part of it. But believe me, no matter how much you try to imagine what you are about to see before you see it, you´ll never ger near by far. I had read many reviews, magazines, sites and still, so I thought I was prepared to see this film with no problem, but I was wrong, this film shocked me until the end of my spine.A film so unique that is able to create a new genre on its own, but I still don´t know how to name it, maybe I lack the imagination for it, but that is what the film is flooded by. This film is not only an achievement in story telling but also in atmosphere, mood and pace; it never lets go. It is engaging from beginning to end, one blink and you lose part of it; but believe me also in this, you won´t be able to blink once you set eyes on it, and on the extreme you might even forget you were breathing while watching it.In difference to other films I´ve seen throughout my entire life, this film got me in a way I can´t even mention. I still am figuring in my mind one way to solve Leonard´s problem, asking myself and getting in order what I just saw. It is certainly a film that is not possible to see just once and forget about it. I can´t wait to see it again; to witness and hope Leonard would find a way to solve the case.It also leaves you wondering, if Leonard´s ""condition"" was either a bless or a curse. Imagine what would it be like to commit acts you won´t remember you did, what would it be like to have no record of time, and be able lo live the same thing over and over without feeling how time eats you as you get older; also what would it be like to nurture a feeling you have inside for the rest of your life and nothing else really matters. You´ll feel that way once you see Memento.It is certainly not an easy movie to see, it makes you part of the environment, you will have to set your brain in motion in order to comprehend what is going on, but I assure you, you won´t be the same person as you were before you see it.",Memento

Guy Pearce is fantastic as Lenny, the tattooed ""detective"" searching for his wife's murderer - his only hindrance is his short term memory loss. Notes, tattoo's, polaroids are scattered around him - and they are all the memory he has.A friend of mine said The Usual Suspects is the better film. I really don't think so. Yes, Suspects is extremely good, one of the best films of the 90's - but once the films has ended, it has ended. We know the twist, we know what has happened. Memento's non linear narrative means that the viewer can watch the film over and over again, and still discover new things. I watched Memento when it came out in 2000 - and up until this day, I watch it and find things I missed out before. It also lets us come up with our own conclusions, unlike Suspects. Both amazing films, but Memento pips it for pure style and narrative structure.Nolan, even though this was his second feature after Following, he already cemented himself as a great director. The film flows so well, the performances are spot on, with Pearce, Moss and Joe shining. The music is downbeat, and ties in well. Here's hoping Nolan's new film, Batman Begins can match this!

466,snow0r,Fantastic,9,14 March 2006,"Memento sees Guy Pearce play Leonard Shelby, a man with no short term memory, on a search for his wife's killer in a film which is intelligent, engaging, well thought out, and sometimes, even funny. Memento demands your full concentration, and its backwards development is a stroke of genius, placing you in the same situation as Leonard; you see what he sees, and aside from small clues, very little else. This way of engaging its audience is what makes Memento special, as it draws you into the plot and Leonard's complex situation without leaving you lost amidst the chronology or bogged down in little clues. This is also helped by Guy Pearce's performance; he remains likable for most of the film, his little jokes and his honesty helping you side with him, but he also shows evidence of a darker side, especially towards the end (the beginning?), as Teddy (Pantoliano) plants the seed of doubt in his mind.Basically, Memento is a very good film, an intelligent, engaging storyline that keeps you interested even after it ends.",Memento

Memory defines who I am, the purpose of life, and the meaning of life. It's really terrifying, even if Lenny accidentally commits a regret for life, he can only make up another story as a reason to survive. The most horrible thing is not that we will build countless lies to satisfy the truth that we believe more, but that the memories we believe are just the 'facts' that we have processed. In any case, we always need a goal to drive us to survive, but when that 'memory' is just to satisfy the story that we built, when everything is not reliable, then what else can we believe?",Memento
468,hprill,Wow. Truly Hitchcockian. Brilliant.,10,30 July 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Don't read too much about this film - the more you know the less you'll enjoy it. It's all about not knowing too much, you know.I thought this was the kind of man-who-lost-his-memory tries to find out what happened. I was *very* wrong. Instead, this is man-who-forgets-everything-after-a-few-minutes tries to find and kill the man who killed his wife. The problem is that, having no short-term memory, he has to rely entirely on his notes and polaroids. Still, he succeeds, and in the first second of the movie, actually while the titles are still running, shoots the man.The remaining two hours are a reconstruction of what happened before. This story is told backwards, so as to make sure the audience never knows more than the man without memory knew at this point. Throughout the whole film you never stop wondering just what happened before, and when that little extra bit of information finally arrives, you're either even more puzzled, completely surprised or you'll find everything is logical. But still you'll want to know what happened before...Even at the end, when most things seem to be clear, I couldn't stop going through the film over and over again, trying to reconstruct the events. So even after you know what happened, you may want to watch this film again -- I surely did.Excellent script, excellent acting. Guy Pearce as the man without short-term memory is just brilliant in all his naiveness, obsessiveness and vulnerability. Even better (I think) was Joe Pantoliano as ""Don't believe in his lies"" Teddy. He was just perfect in all his sleaziness, adding wonderfully to Pearce's paranoia.I was a bit disappointed by Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie; somehow her character did not seem fully developed. I'm not sure if this was due to the script or just not very enthusiastic acting. The scene where she gets hit seemed particularly weak, she just didn't ring true in that situation.Editing and photography was perfect, too. The two timeframes (one moving backwards, in color, and one moving forwards, in black and white) may confuse some viewers at first, but as soon as you get the concept, this is no longer a problem and you'll constantly want to know what happened before.Never since Hitchcock has a movie so perfectly covered a peculiar mental state combined with an obsession ('Vertigo' and 'Spellbound', perhaps also 'Frenzy', come to mind); hardly ever has this be done with such an intriguing technique. The humour, which is mostly deadpan, is also very reminiscent of Hitchcock. Yet this is no pseudo-hommage à la Brian de Palma; this is a very original film.Again: don't read too much about the plot of this movie before watching it, because the plot is really finding out the plot, and once you've done that, you'll never be able to watch the film again with the same eyes. You *will* want to watch it again however, just to find out what you missed the first time.Never had such an easy 10/10. This is going to become a classic.",Memento
469,emguy,"Cleverly done, but not 9th greatest",7,20 October 2001,"As I write this, Memento holds IMDB's 9th spot on the IMDB Top 250 list. This movie is NOT the 9th-greatest film ever made. It's a gimmick film, cleverly done with nice atmospherics and several plot surprises, but still a gimmick film. This seems like a case of ""IMDB Syndrome"" -- a tendency to vote at the extremes for recent movies, especially the gimmicky or culty movies. IMO, the voting on any movie in IMDB is not to be taken too seriously until at least two years after the movie's release.The movie's not bad, basically a brief scene at the beginning with a chain of flashbacks until the movie stops. Though the setting is different, the premise is very much like the Gene Wolfe novel, Soldier of the Mist.Few questions are answered (deliberately it would seem), so if you like nice tidy endings, this isn't the movie for you. If you like movies that require that you pay attention at every moment and that make you reconstruct storylines in your head while you watch, you'll probably like this.The movie did a good job of presenting the POV of someone whose memory is perpetually slipping away, and who can never be sure of what's going on around him.Eventually, the series of flashbacks was starting to get a little old, and I found myself thinking, ""Isn't it about time for you guys to wrap this up?""

470,filmbuff-05706,Look Forward To Seeing This Story Told Backwards.,10,28 October 2020,"Nolan does not insult the viewer's intelligence, instead he challenges it, and as a result he creates a unique masterpiece. For those who tire of remakes, reboots, and sequels, and seek a powerful example of creativity, Memento is not to be missed.Memento is, in my view, Christopher Nolan's best work and one of the best movies I have ever seen. I say this a lot, but I do not mean it lightly when I do. Memento is more than a movie, a way to kill 113 minutes. It is an experience.Due to it's complex nature, I do not recommend seeing it after a stressful day or while being tired. Memento requires(and earns) your undivided attention. Luckily, the story is so compelling that it sucks you into Leonard's world anyways.I have nothing but praise for Memento. I needed subtitles to understand the dialogue(a common complaint I have), but reading the dialogue was also a huge help for me to comprehend the plot more, so that is more of an additional plus rather than a flaw.In fact, some scenes were so impressive and some clever lines were so funny that I found myself repeating many parts over again. Even early in his career, Nolan proved to be a master of cinematic storytelling, both as a writer and director.Memento was one of Nolan's first movies, and it pre-dates his classics like The Dark Knight and Inception. Even then, 20 years ago, he proved that he had skill- with phenomenal storytelling, great film-making, sympathetic characters, and a compelling plot. The movie runs for 113 minutes, and not a single one made me lose interest.Apart from the fascinating plot, Memento also has great acting- from Guy Pearce, who plays Leonard, and the 2 main people who help him with his mystery, who are played by Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss.Memento is a cinematic puzzle, and we are the ones putting it together. It may not all make sense when you are done, but you get what you need and repeated viewings will clear it up.We also see clips in black and white. They are told in order, however they don't make sense until we get the ""end"", and they are key events for the plot to wrap up with a bow.For example, Leonard in one scene finds an empty alcohol bottle. He questions if it is his- but he has no hangover. We then find out in the next scene that it belongs to another man who will lead him closer to solving the case.If that sounds really complex, then prepare yourself for this- it's told backwards. Since Leonard's memory is backwards, Nolan tells the story in reverse order. One moment something seems odd to Leonard, and therefore to us, but then it is explained to the audience in the next scene.Who can he trust? What did he learn from them? He doesn't know. And as such, we don't either. All we, Leonard and the audience, can do, is take it one scene at a time and gather the clues. Sometimes that really messes with your head, but that is part of the aforementioned genius.Memento follows a man named Leonard, who lost his memory after his wife was raped and killed. He wants to kill the murderer as revenge, but every few minutes, and every time he wakes up, his memory is lost. To help him recall key information on his case, he either tattoos them all over himself, or he writes it down in a notepad.If you were to ask me who some of my favorite directors are, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, John Hughes, Rob Reiner, and such would be named. Christopher Nolan is another name I would add now. While I am no stranger to his work, Memento is the hallmark of his career, and a testament to his genius.",Memento

No, people aren't walking and driving cars backwards, but they show about five minute segments, starting with the end, and then overlapping a little, going backwards in time.  There's a reason for this, because the storyline is about a man who is trying to find his wife's killer.  The problem, however, is  that since the murder, he has ZERO short term memory, so he needs to snap photographs and jot notes to himself to help him the next day, or even the next five minutes.  Sounds like a movie to miss, but it actually was done pretty well, and worth it if you like flicks that make you pay attention. (Unfortunately, most movies DON'T!)  B",Memento
472,andy-933-696608,Remember Sammy Jenkis.,10,16 January 2011,"Whenever we open our eyes, we see the world. We often acknowledge it through our conscious experience, and at times it fascinates us to the point of contemplating the experience. When we choose to close our eyes, then do we see nothing but absolute darkness. At times it can be even more confusing as we wonder if the world is still there when we close our eyes once more. Everything we perceive has some significance to it, and the lesson of Memento pertains to the knowledge of such a concept. Does it really matter whether or not we know, or is it simply the significance of that action that matters? Life at times can be overwhelming, and in order to continue we need a sense of purpose to keep going. At times we lose track of the truth behind our own motives.Lenard Shelby (Pearce) is an antegrade amnesiac, meaning he can't retain any new memories. After witnessing the murder of his wife, and suffering brain damage at the hands of a masked attacker, Leonard has been searching for his wife's killer. There is never a mention of a time frame, merely a lone contemplation of timelessness as Leonard puts the pieces in what little order he can find. His reminder consist of tattooed facts and photographs containing scribbled notes. In his quest he often narrates his pain and longing for clearness, even so as much as breaking down his vulnerability to into a simple matter of knowledge.From the reverse order, we are introduced to Teddy (Pantoliano) a sniveling detective like side-kick that aides Leonard, more or less to his own personal benefit, which is never hidden of course, and Natalie (Moss) a mysterious and equally questionable femme fatale. With both Teddy and Natalie harboring their own motives, the plot becomes more mysterious, despite our own knowledge of the conclusion. Teddy gives Leonard supposed leads, while Natalie bestows pity upon the wounded investigator, claiming more innocence and affection as she uses Leonard for her own purposes. Our curiosity remains strong though, as we follow Leonard in a backwards journey, where the truth can only be traced through memory, and the leap of faith he takes in searching for clarity.It seems confusing at first, as the story begins at the very ending, spoiling the conclusion. However, the climax remains to be told as the story progresses and Leonard grows into the detective we first saw smeared in his victim's blood, retracting a gun as if it were a light saber, and gazing upon the justice he executed. It is a journey through time that although it plays in reverse, it introduces the characters brilliantly, as if it were in chronological order. At first, the impressions we'll have of them will be based on certainy, using the memories we acquired from the previous clip. However, as the story progresses, the tables turn and the notion of memory to which this film entails comes alive. Despite being mentally handicapped, Leonard disciplines himself through habit and routine, hoping that he never ends up like Sammy Jenkis.Who is Sammy Jenkis? Well that name never goes unmentioned every time Leonard explains the fragility of his condition. Like Leonard, Sammy (Tobolowsky) suffered from short-term memory loss, falling rather than rising above the very nightmare that Leonard still faces. Dedication and mastery are but merely temporary shields for Leonard's mind. One moment of focus can easily disappear within an instant, leaving Leonard blank and with little to protect himself, and never knowing who or what to trust. In fact the uncertainty that plagues Leonard is further captured in the musical composition by David Julyan as his score further represents in his own words, ""yearning and loss."" It feels sad, but even more strange as this feeling of pain is never truly understood, thus representing the torment of Leonard's own uncertainty and torment.Memento is Christopher Nolan's second feature film, just two years after the success of Following, and bordering on similar issues. Like Following, Memento explores the human mind within the context of memory and the dependency we place on it. With comparison to more factual matters, memory is never truly reliable, nor is it ever fully comprehendible. Through the film, much is left out, with Leonards' wife never being identified, or the time frame of the film remaining mysterious. It adds a timeless aspect of torment for the protagonist, yet with more to ponder at the conclusion of the film which leaves it at an ambiguous note of resolution. Leonard Shelby is indeed an interesting character, and through his determination his mind is explored through constant flashbacks, as well the sad voice-over narration he gives in understanding his journey, those he can trust, and the meaning of his actions. The film presents this question within the first ten minutes. Natalie tells him that he even if he succeeds, he won't be able to remember, This dark truth can only diminish hope for meaning in a world we all risk our lives to experience. The question of knowing whether there is meaning in our actions, although left open, leans more towards a more positive outlook, thus illuminating the skill of Chris Nolan as he delivers a film that is clever in its dialogue, entertaining in its story, and philosophically moving in the questions it poses. The only way something can have meaning is through our actions. What does it matter whether we know or not? ""The world doesn't just disappear when you close your eyes, does it?",Memento

It was ingenious that while the central character had his puzzle to figure out, we as an audience were given one that paralleled his.But the further Memento progressed, the more I felt that I neither liked nor related to any of the characters, who become more one-dimensional the further back in time we encounter them, and that then becomes who they really are. It's not a film I would have cared to see had it been chronological.Take Groundhog Day, make it the others in the film who know what's going on, then change it from a comedy to a moody thriller with a bunch of sleazeballs, and you have Memento. It gives the impression not only that nothing is as it seems, but that no one can be trusted, and everyone is parasitic when given the opportunity. It's sad that so many people have praised it, given it's jaundiced view of humanity.Yes, it's a milestone, a new Third Man for the new century. I recommend it only as a study in film-making and storytelling. You may smile at the tricks in the unfolding of the magic. But if you have the simple desire to see real, complex characters -- with both good sides and human failings -- they won't turn up in Memento.By the end - or beginning, as it were -- the completion of the puzzle only creates an ugly, slimy picture.

Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man that has a short-term memory loss, he can´t remember things that happened only moments ago. That´s why he takes pictures of everyone he gets involved with, and make tattoos all over his body, so that he can remember who he can trust. He does this because his wife has been murdered, and he is determined to track down the killer for vengeance...As hinted above, the story in ""Memento"" is told backwards, it begins with the ending and ends with the beginning. It might sound that you can get lost rather easy here, but luckily the whole concept is easier than it sounds to follow. And what a brilliant one it is.Newcomer Christopher Nolan is clearly a director to watch in the future, he has created one of the most original movies in a very long time, and it´s a very good one too. The acting is also great, Guy Pearce is remarkably good in the leading role. This man is clearly smart when it comes to picking jobs. Carrie-Anne Moss is as brilliant as she is beautiful and Joe Pantoliano more and more stands out as one of the most underrated actors today.""Memento"" has an intriguing story, and the whole backwards-concept makes it even more enjoyable.

477,judemcrobbie,A Piece of Art.,10,14 March 2021,"The non linear structure helps us empathise with Leonard as how he doesn't remember these bits because of his lost memories, we don't know them as we work out way through the movie. It's also an incredibly intriguing narrative as it flips the classic mystery/whodunnit plot line on its head and instead of finding out who did it, we find out what they did making for a gripping and enticing watch.
How each scene sets up so brilliantly as it keeps asking new questions whilst answering the new ones.
Probably some of Nolan's best writing in any of his movies, especially considering he has some bad exposition dumps in other of his movies but in this he has it embedded seemlessly especially how characters ask questions which are for exposition but it's actual questions they'd ask about his condition and it'll make it humorous. Furthermore the humour in this movie is mostly derived from his lack of memory and his friends taking the mick.
Each scene is an almost microcosm of the movie how Leonard goes through all his usual progressions, from charming and charismatic at the start to the anger and rage at the end. Guy Pierce does this tremendously as he shows all of these and then more. Because of this Leonard is one of the most confusing protagonists, which ties into the theme of confusion through the movie.

In Memento these peculiarities catch the spectators towards a mind-blowing labyrinth, fitter to a puzzle-master than common people. The editing is (I suppose) unique in cinema history and fortunately very little directors tried to double this trick for their movies; nevertheless, on the other hand, the stratagem of short-term memory was abused in 2000s' cinema and that's a pity.Carrie-Ann Moss is a gem. Her character Natalie is a mine of perfidy; her solely eyes sting as needles and show how failing can be a friendship (Teddy and the porter too !!), taking easily advantage from a weak person.

This movie kept me guessing at every turn and the final twist at the ending (or should I say beginning??) when everything came together was brilliant , moving, and refreshingly original. This whole movie gets major points in my book for being so original. From the opening sequence to the final credits, the viewer can't guess what is going to happen next. In fact, it is so hard to orient oneself in the movie that some people may be turned off by it. However, I enjoyed it thoroughly. The director/writer Chris Nolan should be given a lot of credit for his great work. A must see movie that one must see several times to really understand the truth (if it can even be found). There were some plot holes I noticed like how does he remember that he has a memory problem? And what exactly are the rules/time limit for how long he can keep his short term memory? These two things were never clear to me. Perhaps after repeated viewings I will find the answer to these questions?!?FINAL VERDICT: Good original screenplay, great directing, good acting, plenty of suspense, great plot twists, and high production values make this a great all around movie. FINAL RATING: 9/10 Excellent original movie with few flaws that stands up to repeated viewings and breaks all genre boundaries.",Memento

490,jackharding89-1,Nolan's dizzyingly highbrow noir smash remains beyond compare,10,22 August 2008,"In his debut feature Following, Christopher Nolan demonstrated a lucid fondness for film noir sensibility. Using fractured time sequences, delirious flashbacks and a reflective narration to illustrate an anti-hero's perilous obsession with following strangers, Following incorporated a variety of props, things and fragments of décor in the noir iconography that were underscored, naturally, by the film's 16mm black-and-white stock. These narrative and visual ambiguities would serve Nolan well in Memento. The cerebral psycho' thriller that would (1) defy the conventions of narrative cinema, (2) throw up a marvellous prism of manifold meanings and interpretations and (3) become a full-fledged classic of modern cinema.With its wrong-way-round narrative structure, Memento is a maze-like, many-mirrored movie that's designed to absolutely stump the viewer. It's an often dark, sometimes light affair without a sense of time or place and without an air of fidelity or even resolution.Beginning with the end, Memento, put simply, is a revenge tale in reverse that maps out onetime claims investigator Leonard Shelby's (Guy Pearce) path to kill the man who brutally raped and murdered his wife. The plot is not configured in this manner to merely show-off, though. There is a reason. For during the attack, Leonard suffered a costly blow to the head which rid him of his ability to make new memories. Don't confuse this with amnesia, though. He remembers everything prior to the incident, just nothing after. Imagine something along the lines of short-term memory loss. Alas, Leonard's forced to place what little trust he has in pictures of people and places as well as personal notes and tattoos that serve as reminders with regard to his progression in his manhunt.Leonard's disability is pretty much beyond comprehension. Nolan demands via the fragmentally restricted narrative that we attempt to twig it on some level though. Which is why the plot make-up serves as kind of empathizer between us and Leonard. We're deliberately made to feel as confused as he is, so much so to the point that you'll begin to question your own views regarding every motive, detail, scene and character, Leonard included.Opening with an extreme close up of a Polaroid un-developing, Memento's pattern of narrative progression is best described in terms of the film being divided into two main visual and stylistic categories.The colour sequences take a subjective view on Leonard's quest as we witness the events that lead to the incident in the opening scene in reverse order. Each of these sequences, however, are spliced with objective, documentary-like monochrome sequences of Leonard discussing the details of his condition, his investigation and experience with a former client who suffered from a condition similar to his. These black and white scenes would appear to be in chronological order but at what point in the tale are they taking place? After the events in colour? Before? During? It's purpose in time does become apparent towards the end, well it's really the beginning but whatever- the final transition from chrome to colour is quite sublime.The beginning of each coloured segment, then, acts as the end of the next. So every time a colour sequence is interrupted by a black and white one, the following colour sequence will map-out how Leonard got to the start of the colour sequence you saw last. Sounds confusing and believe me- it is, but you can't help but marvel at the film's ingenious scope and after a half hour or so, you'll all but get the hang of it.Underpinning the film, in true noir style, is Pearce's unreliable yet commonsensical narration which guides us through the ground-breaking noir labyrinth with a cool and sometimes satirical tone. On his backwards journey, we encounter a variety of dodgy characters who appear to be out to support Leonard just as much as con him. From shady cop Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) to barmaid Natalie right down to motel clerk Burt, everyone appears to be out to exploit Leonard's condition on some level to reek their own benefits, Leonard included.Sprinkled with sardonic moments and noir-esquire wit, the ambiguous script and performances further invite viewers to piece together a puzzle they may never be able to fully solve. And for this air of blissful uncertainty, Nolan has Pearce and Pantoliano to thank a great deal. How do you play a character with no memory? No ark? Spontaneously, I guess. Whatever the Aussie's methods- his performance within the role of Leonard is unforgettable. A poor choice of words, perhaps, but it's an appropriate lexicon when looking at Pearce's emotionally tangled performance. Honesty within dishonesty, idiocy within intelligence, Pearce's chameleonic quality means sheer purpose in a three-piece-suit which breathes new life to the cinematic anti-hero. As for Pantaliano, the casting of the coveted actor renowned with antagonistic roles is one of the film's numerous masterstrokes. Comical, deviant, sarcastic, cunning- Pantaliano's Teddy is an ideal metaphor for ambivalence- he's as much the anti-villain as Leonard is the 'hero.Adapted from brother Jonathan's short story Memento Mori, Christopher Nolan's Memento could've been far too clever for its own good. That's a fact. But it isn't. OK, it throws up all kinds of riddles at the end, many of which will invite numerous answers and interpretations. This, though, is the mark of any good thriller- film noir or not. You know the kind of film that after watching, you just can't help but watch again? That's Memento. The kind of film you'll find yourself yapping about to friends, colleagues and complete strangers for months on end? Memento. The film that whenever you hear its name, you'll be quick to join the conversation, offering your opinions and views. You see where I'm going with this. Christopher Nolan's irresistible indie labyrinth is a bona-fide masterpiece of modern cinema that proves impossible to forget. It's a film like no other that remains, in my opinion, unparallelled in terms of style and originality since its release some 8 years ago.",Memento

The last memory you have is of your wife being raped and stabbed by a mysterious man. This is the interesting premise for Memento, the first truly great film of the 21st century.The film opens with Lenny, holding a Polaroid of a dead man- the person Lenny has just shot for the murder of his wife. The film works backwards from this point giving the audience the discovery of finding out how he got to that conclusion. This unusual narrative device both emulates Lenny's sense of confusion and challenges the audience simultaneously. While the audience is thinking, director Christopher Nolan throws complex ideas at the audience about death, memory and unfailing commitment, which both reflect and contrast with the main character's experiences. By the time the viewer reaches the `beginning' of Lenny's tale we feel mentally drained. Nolan exploits this by throwing up one of the darkest twists in recent memory.Guy Pearce is revelatory as Leonard and instantly exudes an air of charm, desperation and menace to the character. Excellent support comes from Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss shocks you to the core as the enigmatic Natalie- easily her best performance on screen to date.

Shouldn't we live our lives like that? Should we not, like Leonard in the movie, reexamine our whole situation, each morning after waking up?When Leonard fights his incapacitated short-memory, to catch the killer of his wife and avenge her, he has found a simple, straightforward meaning to his life, easily filling each new moment of his days - and there are many. Upon completion, what can he possibly do to keep such a sense of purpose? It's pretty much a no-win situation.But the movie is fascinating, mainly because of it staying, as Kurt Vonnegut called it in 'Slaughterhouse 5', ""unstuck in time"". This opens for a refreshing narration, keeping your eyes open and your mind awake. It is done with great skill, too, so that it almost becomes natural, as if time is supposed to work like this.My problem is with the characters. In this staccato form, they do not really get any depth, are not explored to the extent where I feel I know what makes them tick. The characters become like the plot itself: cut up in tiny pieces, and scrambled.That would be Ok, too, if it were not for the ending (which I will not give away here). The ending - well, the beginning, sort of - loses credibility by the fact that we have gotten to know too little about the main characters, to anchor it in. Not as bad as a deus ex machina intervention in the last minute, but still. I don't feel the ending to be what Aristotle meant by 'necessary', and I don't know enough about the characters to say what would have been such an ending.Unfortunately, this shortcoming makes the film less memorable than it otherwise deserves to be.",Memento

Once again, in a film industry that too often forgets that only hype doesn't make a good movie, it's nice to see that some director has the courage to try something different, something that might not make a huge commercial success but will feel fresh when the big names will feel tiresome and dated.The technique of starting the movie near the end, then flashing back, then back again was recently used in Fight Club, but Memento takes it to a whole new level. Although the film does remind of Fincher's violent satire at times, including for the use of a visual twist, it is clearly no clone. Where Fight Club is psycho-political bite, Memento is full paranoia through an extremely complicated yet gripping storyline that requires tremendous attention to the details. I won't give much of the plot away; it suffice to say that the movie explores the psychological sphere of a man looking for someone who did wrong to his family. Only problem, he suffered major damage in the event and can't make any new memories. How can he find who's looking for? Can he trust the people around him? And can he really trust his own data? Not only Memento will surprise you, confuse you, and even make you smile, but will raise questions about the true nature of our mind, about time, and about how we judge people.In a year that saw Russell Crowe's name in every magazine, Guy Pearce proves he's definitely worth the same attention.

496,jaesboxer,One of the best thrillers of all time.,10,4 October 2005,"I was one of very few mainstream viewers who saw Memento in the theatres. Later, when it was out on DVD, it became such a sleeper hit, spread by word of mouth, that practically everybody I knew had seen it. The words ""short-term memory"" loss became a key gimick in film and television. The concept of a movie, flowing out of sequence, generally unused since Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, now came back with a vengeance, forming such films as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Memento truly deserves to be called one of the greatest thrillers ever made. The concept of a man who cannot make new memories trying to locate his wife's murderer is a brilliant, but the impetus used by putting it in reverse is shattering. We experience the world of Leonard Shelby, whose short-term memory was destroyed in the same incident that saw the murder and rape of his wife, as he searches for the murderer, the mysterious John G. Tattooed with key information, Leonard is the centre of a drama involving three people: himself, Natalie, and Teddy. The story begins at the end, with LEonard finding Teddy to in fact be the John G. he has been searching for, and murdering him. Thus, Leonard is the romantic hero out for revenge. But as the story unfolds, new faces are revealed. The notes which he lives his life by, written on the backs of photographs, have their genesis one after the other, characterizing who he trusts and who he doesn't. A mark on Teddy's photo, reading ""Do not believe his lies,"" renders everything Teddy says, in Leonard's mind, false. Thus, for much of the film, we feel close to Leonard, sympathise with him, distrust Teddy, and see Natalie as the kind lover and helper. But as facts are revealed, these things begin to change. Natalie is revealed as a truly sinister character, using Leonard's condition to get rid of her enemies. Teddy's advice begins to sound practical, and true. Yet only in the final scene are we shown Leonard's real face: the bloodthirsty killer whose memory creates a vacuum into which all guilt and responsibility vanish, and who, never being able to fulfill his vengeance, and unable to heal by time, is driven by the soul purpose of destruction, by an enigma he created himself. In the final scene, we are left with a genuine feeling of unease. Why? Because we have attached ourselves to these characters as what they were revealed as at the beginning, we have sympathised with them, and never knowing where they came from, were content to assume by the present. But in the end, we find ourselves close to a psychotic, a murderer, a sociopath whose memory destroys all fulfillment and remorse, in other words, a mad man.",Memento

501,roger-pettit1,"An absorbing, complex film noir that is marred by pretentiousness",6,21 June 2012,"If ever a film could be described as too clever by half it is ""Memento"". An undoubtedly entertaining thriller about revenge, it is a technically accomplished film noir that is over- reliant on its dominating gimmick: its reverse storytelling structure. That gimmick cannot, however, conceal the impression that, while it is a good film, ""Memento"" is really no better than many other films of its kind. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, and based on a short story by Jonathan Nolan (any relation, I wonder?), ""Memento"" has all the accoutrements of classic film noir: a seedy California setting; seemingly lonely and emotionally disturbed characters; motels that exploit their customers; and murder as a pivotal part of the plot. It tells the story of Leonard (Guy Pearce), whose wife called him Lenny but who likes to be addressed by everyone else by his full first name. Leonard is an ex-insurance fraud investigator. He has short-term memory difficulties - he knows who he is and can recall everything about his life before the incident in which his wife was killed. However, he has been unable to make any new memories since that traumatic event. His failure to prevent the rape and murder of his wife, and a knock on the head that he sustained during that incident, have induced in him a sort of reverse amnesia and left him with a single-minded determination for revenge. Hampered by his inability to retain new information, Leonard resorts to having his body tattooed (by himself in some instances; by a professional tattooist in others) with vital pieces of information that will assist him in the search for his wife's killer. He also takes Polaroid photos and writes notes to himself as a means of recording other important details that will help him, e.g. the location of the motel at which he is staying. Leonard is aided (or perhaps thwarted?) in his efforts by Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), a barmaid with a dodgy boyfriend, and by the mysterious Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). Natalie is the classic femme fatale beloved of all such films!So, the basic plot - the need to avenge a terrible crime - is not particularly original. But the memory issue is. That, however, pales into insignificance when set beside the highly unusual structure of the narrative of the film. Time appears to move backwards and forwards in chunks in almost equal measure in a complex presentation of the chronology of events that is sometimes difficult to follow. The viewer needs all his wits and attentive powers about him to work out exactly what is going on and when. There is the added complication of a seemingly unimportant sub-plot concerning someone whom Leonard was investigating for possible insurance fraud before his wife's demise and who was apparently suffering the same memory difficulties that now plague Leonard. ""Memento"" is an absorbing and entertaining film. It is beautifully acted by all concerned. Guy Pearce is superb as Leonard. He appears in virtually every scene in the film. His performance is such that the viewer cares about him and his crusade to avenge his wife's death. The film is well directed. And it is skilfully edited, something that is crucial to the plausibility of the plot, given the film's unusual structure. The problem is though that ""Memento"" is at times overrun by a sense of cleverness, knowingness and pretentiousness. I have no idea why, for instance, a number of crucial scenes (they usually involve Leonard on the telephone to an unidentified policeman who seems to be providing him with unreliable information) are filmed in monochrome. And while the reverse chronology of the film is unusual it does not really enhance what I think is one of the main messages of the film: which is that memory is a tantalisingly fragile aspect of human life, and that what and whom we trust are governed by all sorts of things beyond our control. So what we have here is an entertaining and fascinating film noir that, for all its technical accomplishment and wizardry, is just that: an enjoyable, but ultimately forgettable, movie. 6/10.",Memento
502,Tarx309,One of Nolan's best,10,18 October 2016,"Having been meaning to watch this movie for along time, I finally got round to it. However after I had finished watching it for the first time I felt a great need to watch it again, and so I ended up watching the entire movie two nights in a row. This was for two reasons: firstly, because the narrative of the movie is very confusing and you have to concentrate very hard just to understand what the heck is going on in most of the scenes, so naturally I knew that if I were to watch it again I would be able to follow it and enjoy it much more; and secondly because the movie was just so, so good the first time around I really, really wanted to see it again. I've been a fan of Nolan's films for a long time now (ever since I first saw Batman Begins) and this was almost the last of his movies that I had left to watch. I love his unique style of directing and have greatly enjoyed all of his films - Memento being no exception.Like Inception or Interstellar, the plot can be hard to follow and it all only makes sense once you have seen and understood the ending. The narrative is especially unique - the movie is told in two different timelines, one in colour, one in black and white. The black and white timeline is chronological (just like any other movie), but the main timeline, the one in colour, is told non- chronologically, in that the audience sees all the events happening backwards, making the audience have to concentrate very hard to follow the story. The film leads towards the collision of the two timelines - where the chronological storyline meets with the non- chronological storyline - in which the climax of the story takes place. It's a daunting idea for a movie, and can be difficult to follow at times, but Nolan pulls it off delightfully. Like his other movies, the directing and writing (both done by Nolan) are excellent. The way he shoots the movie is very unique and the way it is edited gives it a very distinctive feel. It's an intense movie, and does well to keep the layer of mystery present throughout, as the audience never quite knows what could happen next. The performances are also a strong point. Guy Pearce, as the lead, portrays his character in a realistic and suitably depressing manner, and I honestly cannot fault his performance. There aren't many supporting characters, and the only ones that get much screen time are Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano's characters. Both give good performances and most importantly fit their roles. The casting is impeccable, but ultimately Guy Pearce steals the show. This is an incredible movie and anyone who is a fan of unique styles and movies is sure to love this as much as I did. It's a movie which I cannot fault, and by far the best movie I've seen in a long time. 10/10 - would undoubtedly recommend.",Memento

507,toast-15,ever heard of a journal?,6,1 September 2011,"At first, a rather likable but pitiful guy seems to engage the viewer and you want to be interested in his plight but you soon realize that the lead character is not really a protagonist. And about 1/3 of the way in, you start questioning why this mentally handicapped individual doesn't take better notes. Why not a journal or tape recorder, even a camcorder? He leaves himself pictures of people and things with 1 sentence notes that he sometimes describes as ""fact"" but are little more than here-say or supposition. Now this would be fine for someone who just needs to jog their memory but for someone with no short term memory at all the scenario is ludicrous. For example, instead of simply stating ""don't trust so and so"", a journal entry or tape recorded message fully stating why not to trust someone would be perfectly understandable but it isn't done. At one point, this person who is completely reliant on pens has no pen or any other writing utensil. In fact, he sees the person he is conversing with hiding all of the pens and he doesn't question that? OK, I need to suspend my disbelief. It does become apparent at the very end, that there is no ""wife killer"" and he really isn't all that innocent in his wife's current condition. He seems to dispatch anyone who confronts him with truth or reality yet he welcomes those who would use him for their own means. Killing is killing to him I guess; and reasons can be manipulated to achieve the end result as long as the end result is another death. Shoddy notes are just a means to an end. One gets the impression that he might enjoy killing, and manipulating his memory is just as good an excuse as any in his demented mind. In the end, the only one being taken for a ride is the viewer.",Memento

First of all, the major and most engaging attribute to the movie was the non-linear, backwards time-line that the movie was based on.  It really was the only successful way to present all the facts in the movie but still keep up on the whole memory loss factor.  It was really cool though because it was so confusing.  It wasn't really that confusing but it was enough for (sorry for breaking the golden rule) me to speak out in the theater to my buddy and ask him for some concise guidance.  But with the backwards plot, there was a telephone discussion between the main character and a soon-to-be-known other character.    In short, Memento was a fascinating movie that took a seemingly simple plot (SEEMINGLY!) and turned it into a truly unique and rewarding movie theater experience.",Memento

516,epsilon3,Don't Answer the Phone!,10,13 May 2002,"If I had to choose one word to sum up this movie it'd be 'ingenious.'
Leonard Shelby has a rare memory disorder - he can't remember anything since he had a blow on the head after fighting with his wife's killer. He knows everything about himself up to that point, but new memories gradually fade and are quickly lost. He'll be talking to someone but will forget how the conversation started. He'll wake up in a hotel room completely ignorant of how he got there. Since his last memory is of his dying wife, he lives in grief and his only goal in life is to catch and kill John G - his wife's murderer.The film opens with the final scene in the plot and gradually takes you back through the story so that you only know why events take place after they've occurred. This means that you instantly empathize with Leonard - there's no way you couldn't as like him, you don't 'remember' what's gone before. It's a rare breed - a movie that manages to transfer you into the mind of the main character using the film making technique rather than the plot. Like it or not, while watching it YOU TOO have a memory disorder and are forced to see the world through Leonard's eyes - truly ingenious.As it goes on, you gradually realise that all isn't it seems and nobody is as they appear. I'm not going to give anything else away as it'll spoil it, but suffice it to say that it has a great twisting story, excellent acting and is shot beautifully in a minimalist noirish kind of way.It's a film that needs multiple viewings - I certainly had to watch it two or three times before I understood exactly what's going on, but when all the pieces finally fit together it's a great feeling. The region 2 DVD has a hidden feature that allows one to watch the film rearranged in the correct order (it even has the credits running backwards at the beginning etc) which means that when you've finally worked it all out, you can check that your deductions are correct and that you properly understood. This is a brilliant feature and certainly adds to the film's longevity.There are very few films that offer an experience as engrossing as this, although it's not for everyone. If you're the kind of person that likes to work things out for yourself using the available evidence (just like Leonard) then this is for you. If you like your movies to be clear cut and easy to understand on the original viewing, this may not be to your taste.For me, it's one of the greatest films of recent years and comes wholeheartedly recommended.",Memento

521,alafolle,Just enjoy the movie!,9,12 December 2001,"""Memento"" is not really one of the ten greatest films of all time, but that's hardly an insult.  It's a very intelligent, stylish neo-noir film with a creative concept and solid execution.  The concept is actually quite simple, but effective-- the backward narrative allows us to slowly uncover the mysterious beginning.  And, much like the protagonist, we are never actually certain what is really going on.  ""Memento"" isn't as complex and innovative as some would have you believe, but it certainly deserves its hype more than, say, ""Being John Malkovich"".  The brilliance of the film actually lies in how beautifully and thoroughly the narrative conveys the basic theme-- memory is subjective.  We all make sense of our lives through little mementoes and fragments of memories, believing in whatever stories we have told ourselves to give meaning to those memories... stories which may be completely inaccurate.  Lenny is just an extreme case of a condition that we all experience.***Mild spoilers***The ending of the film only furthers this notion.  Some reviewers have complained about plot holes, and the uncertainty over whether the background story told by Teddy near the end is accurate.  And yet this is precisely the point.  All memories have gaps.  All events in real life have plot holes to those who experience them-- we don't have access to a narrator providing explanatory voice-overs.  And all of us center our lives around a set of questionable assumptions.  Does it really matter if Lenny got the right guy... or if his wife was really murdered... or if Sammy really existed?  Of course not. All that matters, and all that you ultimately have, are a few little crumbs of hard evidence and your own interpretation.

523,jeev7882,Memento is quite simply the best thriller of all time. This is a completely original backwards thriller with outstanding performances from its entire cast and a screenplay that is unmatched by any other movi,10,22 August 2002,"Note: This is a very difficult movie to review without making it a spoiler, but there is nothing in the following review that will ruin the movie for anyone who has not yet seen it.I had no idea of what this movie was going to be like when I walked into the theatre, but I was hooked from beginning to end. First, the performances by Matrix veterans Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are masterful. Their characters play the audience just like they play Leonard, and that is what makes them so compelling. Pantoliano especially shines here in a performance similar to some of Joe Pesci's academy award caliber work. But the real prize goes to Guy Pearce who really puts himself on the map with a surprisingly sympathetic performance as a man out to get revenge for the murder of his wife. Pearce should have been recognized after his performance in the critically acclaimed L.A. Confidential, but he still remained in the dark due to the box office mediocrity of that film. Here we get to see his true potential in a role that should at least nab him a best actor Oscar nomination if not a win.Additional praise MUST be given to Christopher Nolan who both wrote and directed this film, which was spawned from a short story written by his brother, Jonathan Nolan. Christopher's first film, a black and white piece called `The Following' (another must see film), displayed that he was a director with infinite potential. With Memento Nolan not only shows that he is for real, but also establishes himself as one of the premiere screenwriters and directors of the new generation.We see Nolan's effect from the first scene of the movie: a brilliant shot of a Polaroid fading instead of developing. But this is just a taste of things to come in this backwards movie. After it is completely faded, the picture pops back into Leonard's camera and the entire opening scene plays backwards ending with Leonard shooting Teddy in the head. Throughout the rest of the movie, Nolan uses his color scenes to represent elements starting from the `end' and going backwards in time and he uses black and white to start at the `beginning' and go forward in time. Confused yet? Well, if that's not enough, the black and white scenes and the color scenes actually merge into one in the end of the movie so the final scene can finally piece together this intriguing and complex puzzle. Additionally, the color scenes overlap with each other and we have more and more revealed to us with each scene. This is technically the opposite of Leonard's experience, yet at the same times it allows us to feel exactly how Leonard feels because we are slowly given information until the end when everything comes together.
I realize that what I said above may have been more than confusing, but that is how this movie plays out. Most viewers will need to see it at least twice to get the full experience of what Memento has to offer, and most viewers will also want to watch it a third, fourth, fifth, etc. time. This movie truly gets better with each viewing because you pick up new elements along the way each time. Personally, I picked up more on the `Sammy Jenkis' story. Sammy was a man that Leonard liked to talk about because also had a short-term memory problem. I did not fully understand the meaning behind this story until I saw it my second time, but Sammy Jenkis is just the tip of the iceberg. You won't be disappointed in the least bit unless you only see this movie once.",Memento
524,someguy889,Shamelessly Twisting,8,7 June 2004,"Memento, an independent thriller starring Guy Pearce, Carrie Ann-Moss, and Joe Palantino and directed by Christopher Nolan, has earned a lot of praise recently and is extremely high on the IMDB Top 250 list. This is not a real-life gritty movie, nor it is fantastical. It is not your average Film Noir type thriller, nor is it your average 'twist at the end' thriller. This is one of the most confusing movies ever made, and to say that it's not in chronological order would be putting it lightly. But, if you like movies with lots of twists and lots of psychological turns, then this is one of the best out there. It follows a man with short-term memory loss, played by Pearce. He reminds himself of who/what/where/when/why he is with photographs. But as his past and mission emerges, and the pieces fit more and more together, this movie just gets better and better. This is a very good movie, and as I said, if you like puzzles, you can't get much better than this. My grade: 8/10",Memento
525,Sonic_Ocean,Is ignorance truly bliss?,10,19 May 2013,"The first time I watched Pulp Fiction, it took me a bit of time to fully grasp its nonlinear storytelling by trying to figure out when each event occurred to be able to know the occurrence of events chronologically. Now having watched Memento, I have come to realize that despite Pulp Fiction's unique narrative, Tarantino made a story that is still easy to grasp.At first I didn't get the memo that Memento presents its story in reverse chronological order, and having figured that out in a few scenes in, it felt like I was falling behind in a race, struggling to catch up. And not only that, but the flashbacks scenes are shown in regular chronological order to make the pace even more insanely hectic for me. I think it is safe to say that everyone can benefit from watching this movie more than once to piece everything together, if one loses track the first time watching it. My first viewing, to say the least, was mindboggling, but thanks to subtitles and having a bit of patience with my second viewing, I managed to tie up a lot of loose ends that were beginning to drive me crazy.And that's one of the things that makes Nolan such a talented director. When you watch Memento, you have to literally change the way you watch movies to grasp it. It is not a stylistic choice just for the sake of being innovative. Nolan utilizes this reverse storytelling technique to execute the drama in a very unique way, having the same effect as putting a puzzle together to know what the full picture looks like. As we go back into the past, that is when we discover the answer to the mysteries of what is really going on underneath it all, as opposed to a conventional movie where we get the bigger picture of the situation as the story progresses in regular chronological order, followed by a conclusion. Whereas the ending of Pulp Fiction occurs during the middle of all the chaos, we get our true conclusion to Memento at the beginning where everything started. Whereas we know the destiny of every character with Pulp Fiction, there is a bit of uncertainty as to what will happen next for the protagonist.What I love about Memento is that it perfectly encapsulates the strange feeling of deja vu. While the protagonist is unaware of everything that happens to him, we the viewer begin to see the full picture in the last scene in the movie and we come to a shocking revelation of the events we just witnessed. I don't want to elaborate more and run the risk of potentially spoiling anything, but all I can say is that this is one of the most innovative mystery thrillers concocted by Nolan, and the subtle film noir influences gives it an extra charm. Watching this movie, you wouldn't predict he would he even direct the batman movies and that shows not only Nolan's diversity but also his versatility as a director.",Memento

530,mr composer,Great movie that should be seen at least twice,10,24 October 2001,"This movie is so complex and well-planned that it actually made my head spin after seeing it twice.  It's not the information - it's the way you receive it.  Leonard is a man incapable of making new memories due to an injury he sustained in trying to foil the rape and murder of his wife.  Christopher Nolan puts you in his head with his rewind editing. You see a scene, but like Leonard you don't know what happened the scene before.  So you don't know what is really happening.  You don't know who the other characters really are.  You have the watch the next scene (i.e. what happened earlier) to piece the film together.  It is this format of time that forces your own mind to get a little dizzy trying to keep up.I say see this twice because it takes that to fully grab the movie.  From my own experience, I got the overall gist of it the first time, but I spent so much time trying to piece the movie together that I missed some important, obvious details.  It takes a second viewing (once you're not as confused as Leonard is) to catch these details and grasp a more full understanding of it.The scenes pasted together going backward is the big thing making this movie special.  If it were conventional in its use of time, Leonard would be nobody we could relate to.  But by going back in time in increments at a time, we experience the movie with an even greater suspense, while getting a firsthand lesson in what it's like to have no short-term memory.  It's brilliant enough to come up with this concept to tell the story, but the details within each scenes, and set of scenes, make this an outstanding script and direction by Christopher Nolan.

Still, it is not a movie you can just passively watch; it does take some effort on the part of the viewer to understand what is happening.Some have criticized this film as having glaring plot holes.  I disagree. Leonard's problem is not what it seems and the answers to many of these ""plot holes"" are right there in the film.  Watching this film once is not enough.

This device is intriguing, and was enough to keep my interest for the first fifteen minutes or so. But once I realized that it wasn't going to stop until the movie was over, I began to go slowly insane.
Also, the structure implicitly asks you to take it for granted that when you reach to the end, everything is going to make sense in terms of character and motivation. Without going into any details, let me just tell you that it doesn't. The acting was good, and the writing, in terms of dialogue, was competent.

It's narrative structure and oblique, but well thought out plot are so labyrinthine and so compelling that you have to go back.  If only to figure out if you figured it out right the first time you saw it.The plot concerns a man who has suffered a brain injury that results in him not being able to form new memories.  Consequently he goes through life in cycles of wondering where he is and how he got there.  He can't remember new people.  The last memory he has is of his wife being raped and murdered. This and the fact he doesn't have anything else to lose have spurred him on to find his wife's killer and seek bloody revenge.  He overcomes his handicap with the use of copious notes and polaroid photos to substitute for his missing memory.  For the really important stuff, only tattoos will do.This is complex enough.  Added to that however is that the director has edited the action so the narrative proceed backwards, from Larry killing his wife's killer back through the events leading up to this moment.  You may need to take a notepad into the cinema yourself just to keep up.This film fits into the category of ""wow, that was good, what exactly happened again?"" into which you can fit the Usual Suspects and most of the work of David Lynch.  It's one of those films that require thinking about. You are a detective sifting through your memories of the film to find solid facts to grip hold of in order to make sense of it.  The truth is very slippery though...Guy Pearce as Larry is excellent.  How he prepared for this role I do not know.  His motivation at any given instant is confused to say the least. What does a person do when he finds a note written to himself from one of his past cycles of forgetfulness urging him to do something homicidal?  That he portrays this character very believeably is an achievement in itself.  He draws you into the character and makes him sympathetic despite being confused and driven to revenge.  You want to work out what this man is thinking.  Pearce lets you into Lenny's mind with an acting performance that should have merited and Oscar nomination at least.I'm not convinced that this film is as good as it could have been, but it's pretty damn close.  It ended when I wasn't expecting it to, and thus left to ponder what resolution there had been instead of providing an easy resolution on the screen.  That isn't a bad thing at all, but it did leave me with a big sense that something was missing.Please go and see this film, if only for the sheer novelty of the plot and the attempt to break the narrative conventions of cinema in such an interesting way.",Memento
537,CHendri887,"Interesting, well-done.",7,22 April 2001,"The positives:  The way the film was cut, from end to beginning.  Definitely interesting watching this film in that manner.  Really liked the beginning of these scenes where Guy Pearce's character would ""wake up"", so to speak, and try to orient himself to the world around him.  Made me feel like I was in his shoes.  I liked the acting, for the most part.  Sort of low key, but believable.  Guy Pearce, Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Patiliano all play their parts well.  I liked the ending (or, in this film, the beginning).  It was really not what I expected.  Kind of spooky.  I liked pondering about the dilema Guy Pearce's character was in, but only for a little while, because it's really quite horrifying, I think.  The negatives:  Sometimes I felt the way the film was cut, from end to beginning, got a little annoying, tiresome.  And something that really bothered me: whenever Guy Pearce's character would describe his condition to someone, he would always use the adjective ""you.""  Like, ""You wake up and you don't know where you are...""  To me, this was very disconcerting.  For a while I couldn't figure out who he was talking about, but then I realized it was himself.  ""I"" would have been a more powerful choice for these descriptions, I think.  ""I wake up and I don't know where I am...""",Memento

The screenplay, the acting, the story...amazing.POSSIBLE SPOILERS The basic idea of this movie is that Guy Pearce's character can't remember anything since an attack in which his wife was killed. We see two lines of action, one in color, one in black and white. The color one moves backward. What we see first is the end of the story. The other one moves forward. It is the beginning of the story. When they meet at the end of the film, black and white turns to color and everything makes sense.Part of the genius of doing the movie backwards is that we, the audience, don't know any more than Guy Pearce's character does, since what happened in the prior scene hasn't actually happened yet.The only criticism I can possibly think of this movie is that it's difficult to follow.

Part of the story is told backwards but the brilliance isn't just that goes backwards. Each scene tells you something new about the story that leads you to think one thing.

Yes, it was an extremely entertaining, original and well-done all around film. The acting was first rate, the story decent, and the film makers did a great job putting it all together.However, I may be crazy, and I'm sure the ""film snobs"" will grit their teeth at this, but at the end of the day, isn't Memento just a gimmick? A water cooler novelty? I mean, basically they took a slightly above average plot and did something new, and granted inventive, by editing the film structure in reverse. For the most part, the movie is pretty much shown from end to beginning. Yes, they did enough to make things make sense in between, but essentially it was an exercise in ""hey, let's make a movie, and then edit it so everyone will talk about that reverse movie"".I don't care what anyone says. That's the bottom line, period. I've talked with plenty of fellow movie buffs who I consider to be reasonably intelligent, and some are even the snob-types mentioned above. And none of us can figure out what all the fuss is about. Maybe we ain't that smart.I hate to get into comparisons, because it's difficult to compare different types of movies. But be honest, if you can tell me with a straight face that Memento is an overall better film than ""Apocalypse Now"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Fight Club"", ""Jaws"", ""Chinatown"", ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"", ""American Beauty"", ""Silence of the Lambs"" and a large chunk of the other 230 films ranked below it, than you just need to sit back, take a deep breath, reel in that massive ""I'm a nonconformist art-house movie aficionado"" thing and get a reality check.

548,alishahmohd,Amazing concept and execution.,10,15 May 2014,"Memento has been out for over a decade, unfortunately I never to got to see this brilliant flick until a few months ago. I had no idea what I had been missing, I had read before about this movie and the concept seemed confusing to me and I had no idea how it would work. But when I actually got around to watching, I was absolutely mesmerized and I was glued to my seat from the beginning to the end. Part of me is glad that I watched this film so late because back in 2000 I was too young to understand what this film was trying to accomplish.Memento is an extremely unique film. When you watch a film you always are eager to see what happens next, you may have an idea about what may happen next, but you are still interested in seeing it. This film is the opposite, it makes you anticipate or interpret what had happened earlier. This movie moves in a reverse chronological order. It was done to make us see the movie from Leonard (Guy Pearce)'s perspective, as his character is suffering from Short Term Memory loss and has no idea what he is doing in a couple of minutes and has no idea what he did before. In normal films there is a room for interpretation because they are in a chronological order, this film however leaves you in a black hole and the further you get into the movie, the more you will be able to connect the missing movies.The film has two different sequences one sequence is thew story unfolding in reverse order, the other scenes are the black and white documentary scenes which are slow but give the film a realistic feel and make you understand what is in the mind of Leonard Shelby. And by the end both these sequences intersect.That is what is so brilliant about Memento, it makes you heavily think, invests you in the movie, makes you solve a puzzle, much like the puzzle the main character Leonard's is trying to solve. And by the end you will be able to join most of the missing pieces together. The movie also ends on a brilliant note as it leaves you thinking and leaves a lot of room for interpretation, about what happened. This will make you want to talk about this movie and thinking about it even after you have watched it. The replay value is also good, some scenes are so fantastic that you can watch again and again mainly the Teddy scenes which have excellent and funny dialog. The movie can also be watched from different perspectives, you can watch the movie in it's normal chronological order, which is not recommended because it ruins the fun. And you can also watch this movie based on the interpretation that Leonard's is trying to solve an unsolvable puzzle and that he is deluded person trying to escape reality. The storyline is not that amazing but it is the way it is told, like a puzzle is what makes it so great. The whole storyline remains a mystery till most of the movie unfolds. Acting wise this film is fantastic. Guy Pearce is fantastic in his role as Leonard Shellby, not only he is excellent to watch all the scenes, and he gets all the screen time and makes most of it. Leon's character was also brilliantly return how do you make a character with short term memory loss work, you give him notes photographs and tattoos to remember things so that he is not completely handicapped. Carrie Annie Moss gets little screen time but she does a great job in the amount of screen time she gets , many of her scenes with Pierce are actually fantastic. That leaves Joe Pantoliano who is fantastic in his role as teddy, his dialog delivery and humor is fantastic and he is extremely charismatic every-time he is on the screen he demands your attention. Some of his dialogs are the best in the entire movie. The soundtrack and the music also perfectly match the neo-noir atmosphere and environment of this filmThis is one of the older films of Christopher Nolan, and only shows how great his style is and how brilliant is direction. This movie which one of the earliest films Nolan made gives Nolan's other blockbuster films, the Dark Knight trilogy and Inception a great run for it's money. Do yourself a favor and watch Memento is a fantastic film and that will mesmerize, and once it is over you still be talking about and thinking about it fro a long time, that's how brilliant this film is.Overall Rating 10/10.",Memento

Memento is a clever, and compelling film that keeps you guessing throughout, still full of tension and intrigue, despite its peculiar structure, it manages to maintain your interest, but could perhaps be a little clever for its own good for some viewers. But if cerebral movies are your thing, then it's well worth checking out, plus the photography and direction is excellent, and Guy Pierce proves once again what a convincing actor he can be. What makes Memento stand out though is that it doesn't appear to take itself too seriously and get bogged down - it maintains a good sense of black humor throughout - and though it's quite hard on the brain cells, and you may wonder how it's all feasible, the very idea behind it is interesting enough to make the film work very well.",Memento

He is able to remember everything up to the injury, but is left unable to process new information into memory.  I made an attempt to find if such a condition really exists, and I believe it does. I do not think the following constitutes a spoiler, but if you are worried about it, just stop here and see the movie twice.It may be that you too will give it a very high rating on first viewing if I tell you that the director-script writer (Christopher Nolan) and the editor have made the film as if they suffered from the same brain damage as the lead character.  His inability to store new information means that there is no sequence in his mind as he is reminded of what he has never remembered by the notes and Polaroid photographs he has taken to substitute for the memory he has does not have.   He boasts that he has an orderly system, but it doesn't always work.The casting is great. Guy Pearce carries a lot of authority and charm, and Carrie Anne Moss is very good as his helper.",Memento
557,Twillhead,The Blessings of Continuity . . .,8,9 September 2001,"... and the bewildering nightmare of life without it--therein lies the crux of `Memento', a quietly brilliant film by Christopher Nolan. The film's opening credits, set over the image of a Polaroid photograph in the reverse process of developing itself, indicates the way the story will unfold--backwards. The cast is filled with first-rate actors, headed by Guy Pearce in a mesmerizing performance as Leonard Shelby--driven, tormented, with a sallow, haunted visage that is maintained throughout the film--who suffers from a rare medical condition which has robbed him of short-term memory. He is on a relentless quest to find and kill the man who attacked and murdered his wife, and who is responsible for Leonard's memory malfunction. The ""rub"" is that Leonard can't possibly remember the identity of the assailant. Leonard is only able to track him down by the use of Polaroid photos scribbled with reminders, a few odd post-it notes, and, most chillingly, by tattooing clues to his body, including a constant reminder of the reason for his mission, emblazoned backwards across his chest, readable only by use of a mirror. (An aside: `We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are', says Leonard at the end of the film--but the film's question to the audience seems to be: what does that mirror reflect? And can we always believe in the truth of that reflection?) While some may find the vigilante aspect of the main character abhorrent, the audience's empathy for Leonard is gained by the poignancy of his plight. In one heart-wrenching scene, Leonard, while burning some of his wife's belongings, wonders if he has ever similarly disposed of her things before and thinks: `I can't remember to forget you.' `Memento' is an astonishing homily about guilt and vengeance (and is vengeance ever really attainable?), manipulation and betrayal, and the lies we often force ourselves to believe when we fall into our own self-inflicted episodes of short-term memory.  NOTE: Those with short-attention spans need not apply! This film demands from its audience absolute attention from beginning to end.",Memento
558,averjee,Terrific!!!,10,7 May 2001,"Very clever, spooky thriller that is actually run backwards, so that each event that takes place on screen actually unfolded prior to what you just saw.  The director- Chris Nolan (INSOMNIA) - uses this device to unwrap a mystery: our protagonist is looking for a killer, but he is afflicted by a strange condition that prevents him from retaining information for mor ethan a few minutes at a time. He can't remember where he's been or what he's just done, so the backwards-plot angle makes the viewer oddly in sync with the protaginist - we don't what he's just done, either.  Ambiguous until the end, this is a masterful detective story - every detail is imbued with significance, though we often don't realize it until later.  The lead character is played by Guy Pearce, the fiercely honorable and intelligent cop in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL - here, he has the same kind of mission for justice thing going, but he's flying blind here, unable to remember or trust anyone and ultimately unsure even of his own motives.

The odd part is that the twist should be a total give-away the whole time.  You'll feel fooled by the shock at the end and demand to know everything that you had just seen all over again.This is exactly why this premise works.  Instead of telling the story sequentially, Memento takes you through the bassackwards world of Lenny, learning for the first time things that have happened already.  It leads to some great moments, like when he is being chased/chasing Dodd.  Don't know what I mean?  Go see the movie!The ending is the story though, so it isn't like a gimmick, it is entirely essential.  The trick ending to the Sixth Sense could have not been and most of the entire plot would remain the same.

Memento is a film that can fall into all three of these categories. This is NOT a roll into the cinema or when it comes out on DVD/Video get the popcorn in and let the film just wash over you. On the contrary, this is a film that demands effort from its viewers and if you are prepared to give that effort then you get an awful lot back in return.Previous comments have detailed the story and all i would like to add is that this film is a great combination of good direction, great acting (especially Pierce), a good script and a GREAT idea. All great films have all of these attributes, so does Memento.I just have one request, when this film is released on DVD please make it have an option whereby you can watch the film sequentially in a chronological order. Would it improve the film? probably not, but it would allow you to see a) how clever the idea was in the first place  b) how good the editing was and c) how good the performances were.P.s. if anybody knows where i can get the soundtrack or the music used in the film please email me!",Memento

You are meant to form your own conclusions, and that is exactly what the director was trying to point out, that there is no real truth, just a mixture of preceptions and memories. OK, fair enough ! SO there are alot of images thrown about to make you think one thing then another, and enough evidence given to suggest quite alot of different things. Did he kill his wife? Was Sammy a projection of himself? Did Teddy deserve to die? etc etcI'm going to close the lid on this for myself right now anyway, by saying that its just one of those things that you are not meant to figure out. You are not given enough evidence to form a conclusion, especially as alot of the film is seen through the eyes of someone with a severe mental condition and thus unreliable. In Scotland we have a verdict between guilty and not-guilty, known as 'that bastard verdict', 'Not Proven', and I'll have to leave it at that.

Memento tells the story of Leonard, a man suffering from short-term memory loss after a tragic incident in which his wife was raped and killed. To cope with his condition, Leonard takes Polaroid pictures, writes himself notes and tattoos himself with reminders and instructions that help him on his quest to find and kill the man who killed his wife. What is so remarkable about Memento, other than the unique plot line, is that the story is told in reverse. The movie begins with Leonard killing a man named Teddy and concludes with the events that happened days beforehand.I've never seen a movie quite like this! Just the fact that it unfolds in reverse is amazing to me. It created a level of suspense unlike anything else. I actually only intended to watch about 30 minutes of it before bed and watch the rest the next day. I couldn't turn it off though! It kept me on pins and needles as I waited to find out some unknown truth about Leonard and his condition. Memento did not disappoint!Other than the riveting plot and structure of the movie, the way it was shot was brilliant. Segments in color were interspersed with black and white segments in which we see Leonard in a hotel room on the phone telling someone about his condition. It gave an intimate look into the psyche of this very damaged man. Guy Pearce was perfection! I was thoroughly impressed with his acting in Memento.I would definitely recommend this film!

It takes a little while before you realised that the fact that it has made you think as much as it has, is what truly makes it great and therefore because of this it really was an exceptional film.The perspective of this film is the component that makes it stand out above others, the idea of the film starting at the end of the story and then slowly going back through the storyline to where it began is something I've never seen done, in such intensity before, other start at the end and then explain how they got there but this film is well and truly backwards. The use of narration was pivotal in this film, if you didn't have it the storyline would be far to complex and un-understandable to even the most observant of viewers, the narration therefore takes us through each action that is completed, and more importantly is used to emphasise the extent of the memory loss that occurs in the film.Although most questions were answered during this film, I found myself sometimes wondering if I had missed something, some small detail that would have made an action make sense, that I just didn't notice, but the storyline still made sense despite its complexity. The only question I was really left with was, what happens now? Does the vicious cycle just continue on forever, will there ever be an end? However you have to realise that that is the point in the film, your left with as few answers as the main character, and thats what makes it such an interesting journey.Acting in this film was generally good, nothing too special as its this idea of the complexity of the storyline that carries the film forward, but needless to say the relatively small cast pulls the job off well, but I found myself never sure what I was supposed to think of a character, this seems to be the point in the film though.In general I enjoyed this film and really enjoyed the strange perspective used, that is not really evident in other movies.",Memento

(Yes, this is the same New Jersey that lies just west of New York City). It's my fear that this thing will disappear the way some wonderful films of the past have - like ""The Hit"" or ""House of Games"".This movie has to be seen to be believed - or understood. It immediately takes its place among, yet stands above, films like Pulp Fiction and Nashville. Please understand that I'm not saying those films are similar to Memento. I honestly cannot recall (no pun intended) any film that does what this one does. Rather, it is that rare work that can truly be called inimitable. Unique. No one will ever make a film like this one again. What's the point? It has now been done. Did anyone ever try to paint a better mural of the bombing of Guernica? Or a more essential Campbell Soup can? I don't think so. And no one will try to improve on what this film shows and does - to its characters and to us. So see it if you love movies.",Memento

But it is a frustrating and non-rewarding movie that cheats the audience at every step:  a fictitious illness, characters that do things more to startle the audience rather than for a realistic reason, and an ending that is way too predictable and really silly at the same time.

There will not be a better movie this decade than Memento. Brilliantly crafted, you will walk out of the theatre mesmerized, enchanted, and horrified all at the same time.Guy Pearce is wonderful as Leonard Shelby, a man who loses his ability to make short-term memories when he is brutally attacked. The real prize performance, however, goes to Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix) as a cop who is Leonard's only friend. Anything less than an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor will not do him justice. His performance only gets better at the end of the movie when you finally realize his purpose.Carrie-Anne Moss (also of The Matrix) is also very good as Natalie. A memorable scene comes when she tells Lenny that she's going to use him, and that he won't be able to do a thing about it. Then she does.Overall, on a scale of 10, Memento deserves an 11.

569,fineanimal,"Great film, but the DVD is hurting.",8,31 August 2002,"Enough reasonable (and a few truly dismal) reviews of Mememto already exist on the IMDB, so I can only add my vote that Memento is a film worth seeing. Whether or not it deserves to be called one the ""greatest films of all time"" is irrelevant, since that is a subjective honor anyway. It's high ranking is almost certainly due to a rapid flood of votes following its recent release (I mean, come on--Lord of the Rings ranks even higher than Casablanca, Star Wars and Citizen Kane!). The point is that, objectively speaking, Memento is a truly original, unique, and well made film, and there is some truly fascinating and thoughtful dialogue and narrative here. For that reason alone any film lover should check it out.I must add, however, that the DVD features an Independent Film Channel interview with Writer/Director Christopher Nolan that is one of the most visually irritating pieces I have ever seen. The interview randomly skips frames, causing subtle but silly jumps that remind me of the lousy black & white film the castaways on Gilligan's Island once made (""I'd walk out on that picture even on an airplane!""). Presumably, someone thought this was an artistic touch, but the end result is that it just looks dumb, and I had to *turn the video off on a DVD* in order to enjoy or get anything positive out of the interview!

Guy Pearce plays Leonard, a man who suffers from a rare condition as a result of an injury sustained when his wife was murdered, leaving him unable to remember events for more than a few minutes. Despite his condition, Leonard is determined to find his wife's killer.Of course, the main character has almost no idea what he's doing or why, his sense of time and place fractured by his inability to remember. In order to convey something of Leonard's state of mind, Christopher Nolan confuses us with scenes overlapping, seeming to repeat. It takes us a while to realise that we started at the end and events are unfolding in reverse, revealing other events that lead up to what we just saw. It's quite simply a wonderful sleight of hand from Nolan, creating something disturbing and compelling. We are deliberately surprised, confounded and uncertain.Guy Pearce is tremendous in the central role. We root for him, wanting him to find his wife's killer, as he struggles against his repeated memory loss. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are excellent as the friends he can never remember.The film edges backwards to it's shocking climax.

572,MovieSoup,One of Nolan's best,9,17 September 2017,"Memento is a classic film with a plot that is mysterious, fast paced, intricate and brilliant. I will try to not give too much of this plot away but I will start of by saying what everyone else is saying which is ""GO SEE THIS FILM"". Honestly it is that good.To start we get the main character Leonard, who has short term memory loss, committing the murder of his wife's killer. This scene has beautiful pacing to it perfectly explaining Leonard's condition by using only visual means. He is taking a picture of the dead man at his feet and is shaking the Polaroid picture. As he shakes the picture slowly fades from a clear picture to a blank one. This perfectly explains Lenny's mental condition of not being able to retain memories. It sets the film off perfectly and introduces the audience to Lenny and what he will do to overcome his condition and find his wife's killer.After this the story works backward from the point where Lenny kills to how he got to this moment. The pacing and editing of this film is so unique that you are actually in the same position Lenny is as you do not know what has happened at which points in the story until the story cuts back to show you how Lenny got there in the first place. That sounds like a mindfu*k and it is exactly the way Christopher Nolan wants you to feel. Christopher Nolan is, in my opinion, the greatest director of the 2000's. His camera work is very detailed where it needs to be and you can just tell that he approaches every kind of film with caring and intelligence. Than is not to say that other directors don't but I personally find whatever Nolan puts his talents too succeeds. Dunkirk, The dark knight trilogy, inception, interstellar etc. are all timeless films that give a sense of excitement and enjoyment to me whenever I watch them. Memento's story is great and you can read into so many things with this film but let's now focus on the actors. With all the dialog and misinformation that Lenny receives during the film it would be hard for any actor to go from playing guy who has discovered something to a guy who has no idea where he is. Luckily Guy Pearce is a talented actor and plays this role perfectly, you really believe in his performance and you are completely immersed in this film and the emotional way Pearce portrays Lenny.Carrie-Anne Moss is also great in this as Natalie. She manipulates Lenny for most of the film and does such a great job of switching from one emotion to the next. In one half of the scene she is screaming at Lenny in frustration and the next minute pleading with him to help her. It's just a great performance, nothing more I can say.Joe Pantoliano was okay in this film. While he is believable as Teddy (the cop who helps out Lenny) and has some great dialog given to him he just wasn't as good as he could be. Whilst watching I was reminded of the role he played in the Matrix and that did at times take me out of the narrative a bit. Don't get me wrong he is a great actor and plays Teddy competently however I thought that the real performances were Moss and Pearce.The music in this film is very generic however it is used to great effect to emote the scene we are watching. As I have always said, there is nothing wrong with generic score music so long as it is used correctly. The music in this film does what it is supposed to, creates atmosphere in the suspenseful parts. Music does not have to be the main focus and it isn't in this film. The main focus is plot and pacing in memento. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have written a great movie here. The actors pulled together and there are great bits of dialog and action. The pacing and editing is gorgeous and flows really well constructing a narrative but backwards. Honestly this is a great film, on of Nolan's best, and I implore you to see it.",Memento

574,spinin,"I don't expect a sequel called ""Memen... two"" - my friend came up with that one!",10,19 April 2001,"At the heart of ""Memento"" is the question: What can you do with your life when you have no short-term memory? You have no ability to create new memories and every few minutes you start off fresh, having absolutely no idea what just occurred. Anything important that happens in your life will be quickly forgotten and practically non-existent. How can you live the rest of your life with any meaning or motivation?This is the challenge that Leonard, the hero of ""Memento,"" faces. He is played by Guy Pearce who starred in another small movie I recently discovered called ""Ravenous,"" an unbelievably surprising flick that cleverly combined several movie genres with new spins. He has picked another great role to play here. Leonard lost his short-term memory when he tried to defend his wife from an attacker that invaded their home. She was killed and he was left with a scar for life, determined to find the killer and get revenge. The two other main characters he is in contact with are Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss). Both played in ""The Matrix."" Teddy seems suspicious, but who knows? Natalie seems all right, but can you really trust anyone? The paranoia and confusion are evident. Leonard trusts only the facts he has discovered himself. In order to remember them, he takes Polaroids, writes brief notes, and tattoos the really important stuff all over his body. It's insane. However, he has the motivation to make this system work and that is his quest to find his wife's killer.The plot is not as important as how the film is made and how it involves us. The very first shot of the movie, played in reverse as a photograph disappears, is strikingly appealing. ""Memento"" itself is told backwards, not in reverse, but rather scene followed by a scene that logically precedes it and explains what we saw a few minutes ago. At the same time, another story is being told in black and white in chronological order, giving us something else to keep track of. Telling the story in reverse is such a simple plot device, but it is the key. By doing that, we have short-term memory as well and we see everything from Leonard's point of view. We don't know where we start out and we try to make sense of everything around us. It's not exactly like we have short-term memory, but we're just as confused as the main character.""Memento"" starts out at the end, and so we see the conclusion of everything that will eventually be revealed as the movie proceeds. How can this movie end in an interesting way then? Trust me it does. By telling it in reverse, the movie requires us to pay attention and makes each scene important and involving even though we get further away from the actual outcome. There are some great moments. At one point, Leonard snaps in and sees a bottle of some alcohol in his hand, but says that he doesn't feel drunk. What's going on then? Later (or earlier), he forgets what is going on in the middle of a foot-chase. He first thinks that he is chasing a guy, but when the guy turns around and starts shooting at him, he calmly corrects himself and starts running.I've seen stories told backwards before in episodes of Seinfeld and the X-Files. Seinfeld was clever, but that's all that was to the story since it was not very funny. The X-Files episode was actually much better, but the only reason that was done was so that the character could go back and get a second chance to correct a wrong. Interesting, but corny. ""Memento"" is ingenious and dark; a film-noir told in reverse. My friends thanked me for dragging them out to see this movie. There's not much beyond the plot and the style and in a way, the style detracts from us becoming too emotionally involved with the characters and the story. We're too busy juggling everything else. I didn't like that, but that's the point. It's new, it's interesting, it's clever, and it's edited seamlessly for an exciting two hours. The bottom line is that Leonard knows his life is messed-up, but he's just trying to do something about it. An excellent movie. I give it a perfect 10.",Memento
575,timtindy,Pretentious gimmick,1,21 May 2001,"Memento is one of those ""films"" that ""film scholars"" are supposed to like. Make that REALLY like.  You see, it's one of those movies that require you to think really hard about what is happening.  It is more of an exercise than a movie.  It isn't fun at all to watch or experience.  What it really is, unfortunately, is a waste of time.  It relies on a single gimmick that I figured out 10 minutes into the movie.  Without the gimmick the movie has NOTHING going for it.

577,allanradman,A Hitchcock wannabe,6,5 December 2001,"Strange movie with some twists - ala Hitchcock.  But it was a bit  wierd. Story would go forwards and backwards.  The ""mementos"" were just not that realistic to be believed.  It seemed the guy lost his short term memory for most things but not where he put his little memos.  He always managed to find those - even the new ones.  An amazing feat for someone with zero short term memory.  And throughout the film he would constantly make notes and read the notes - but he never seemed to be bothered with the thousands of tatoos he had.  He belonged in a lunatic asylum.  I never would have guessed a film about some chowderhead writing and reading sticky notes would've been so popular.  Should've been called the sticky note boy. 6/10",Memento
578,jasonbourneagain,***Spoilers!!!*** Memento Raises More Questions Than It Answers,8,27 July 2005,"I liked this movie in that it starts off at the end and goes backward. The main character, Leonard Shelby, cannot form new memories and experiences because they are forgotten in a few minutes. Yet he wants revenge for the death of his wife and has gotten the message tattooed to his chest, so it becomes his prime directive whenever he wakes up or forgets what he's going to do.The color scenes in this movie tell the story of Leonard in reverse chronological order. Interspersed within the film are black and white scenes which tell the story of Leonard, a man named Sammy Jankis, and present the mystery of who Lenny is talking to on the phone in chronological order.This is done brilliantly by director Christopher Nolan and his crew in order to confuse and disorient his audience by only giving bits and pieces of the story until they can piece the whole story together. It's an engrossing story as we are put in the shoes of Leonard Shelby to empathize with his memory problem.The movie has a smart premise and execution, but questions pop up that cannot be readily answered. There are plot holes and goofs in the movie, both deliberate (likely put in to show that Leonard's memory is faulty) and not, which tear down the movie somewhat for me. The story and Leonard Shelby's condition does not hold up under scrutiny.The biggest plot hole is Leonard is able to remember that he has a short-term memory problem. Apparently, he has conditioned himself to look at his ""remember Sammy Jankis"" tattoo on his hand and this brings the long-term memory back of his condition. Jankis was a con man who tried to extort money from Leonard's insurance company with a short-term memory loss scam which Leonard exposed.(EDIT: I'll concede this point. The movie does explain how Leonard is able to do this. It just wasn't obvious to me when I watched the movie the first time.)Another problem I had was why didn't Teddy just break into the trunk of Leonard's car or trick Leonard, take the money and run? He had several opportunities to do it and is sitting inside the car when Leonard's not there in one scene. The car even has its window missing.Next, there are minor goofs or mistakes in the story. Sharp eyed viewers have spotted this. Leonard says that he has no short-term memory and cannot remember anything after the accident to Burt. Yet he can remember his wife dying and the actual attack where he loses his memory. Also, he called him Burt in one scene and there was no way he could have known his name. There is fact 6. Leonard couldn't have known which fact number to put down for the license plate when he wrote it. These aren't as serious, but they can add up and spoil a movie.Finally, the key message in this movie is memory is not always reliable and we are shown evidence of this -- the license plate having an 'I' and then it changes to a '1' and even the tattoo is wrong as it has a '1', the picture of Jimmy changing from clean shaved to mustache, the ""I've done it"" tattoo, etc. These could be mistakes, too, but I think they are deliberate in order to show Leonard's memory is not reliable.To enjoy this movie, one has to accept the plot holes and goofs in the movie. I had to discuss this movie with friends after the first viewing and then watched it twice on DVD to get all the nuances.The movie does succeed in explaining the complex story line. It's presented in an interesting manner with a bit more information told to us each time as the movie moves both backward and forward in time. Guy Pearce, Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano do an excellent job of convincing us of Leonard's condition and relationships and becoming sympathetic to it. It's the plot holes and actual goofs in the story which take it down for me.(EDIT: The movie is a puzzle for the viewer to figure out as to what happened and why. Director Christopher Nolan explains that the answer is within the movie. His answer is 1) He's misdirecting us saying Leonard as having anterograde amnesia or And. He only THINKS he has it. In other words, it's a serious PSYCHOLOGICAL disorder. The guy has let his wanting revenge for his wife's death turn him into a sociopath and killer. He uses the And to fulfill this need. When he actually does complete his task, he makes up LIES in order to put his world back in order again. Thus, he continues to believe he has And and continues to hunt for his wife's killer. It's a puzzle that can never be solved. After figuring out Nolan's answer or ""trick"" to this movie, I gave it a higher rating from 7.5 to 8.5. It makes for a more satisfactory experience. How sick is Lenny when he thinks his wife is dead, so he ends up killing his wife in real time because she keeps wanting insulin injections. His psychological disorder made him believe in his memory loss so much that he could not snap out of it. This allows him to continue getting revenge and killing as the riddle he has tattooed on himself can never be solved when he can conveniently forget it in his own mind. Still, the movie is left open-ended and the viewer is left to figure it out for themselves. There have been an alternative theory created to explain it. Perhaps the truth about Memento can be found in a line from the movie -- ""So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?"")",Memento

580,Oliveraandreasson,"Genius writing and directing, as to be expected from C. Nolan.",9,11 January 2020,"This movie is absolutely genius and although I love it, there are some negatives that I will quickly run through.First off, the cinematography and visuals are very boring and not at all memorable (apart from the photographs and the parts in black and white). I understand that this is partly because of the budget but also because it fits the narrative of the film really well, but this doesn't take away from the fact that they are uninspiring and frankly quite boring. The score and sound design were not particularily great either, I can't even seem to remember if there was any music at all. My third and final complaint is about the acting. While the actors sometimes shined and truly showed the pain and tragedy of memory loss, most often the performances were quite bland and not something I will remember about this film.The story, writing, and directing, however, was absolutely brilliant. In true Nolan fashion, he has created a wonderfully complex, interesting and truly unique story that is told in a very original and captivating way. It gives you something to think about, and the way it is all connected as well as how it gives us information and reveals, is extremely rewarding.

Wow!,10,20 June 2007,"***Warning: Major spoilers ahead***An original idea cleverly executed!I don't want to dwell in the analysis of facts and coherence: the last images of ""Memento"" (or where they the first ones?) leave few possible, coherent or logical explanations, as we see Lenny's tattoos when his wife is still alive: was the character of Jorja Fox his second wife, and then whatever became of her? Did he kill her? Or perhaps his only wife survived the attack and Lenny's tattooed himself to create a puzzle and distract himself from the tragedy of memory loss...Too complicated. Lenny's amnesia could be simulated, and in fact sometimes he seems to forget to play the amnesic (what an irony!). This would explain a lot. But, like in ""The Prestige"", do we really need an explanation? What if the illusion is more interesting? In fact, Nolan has set us up with false memories and a puzzle where the search for coherence is the McGuffin that drives another search: that of meaning for our lives, identity for ourselves, and all those little daily routines or sentimental rituals that define us. What makes you who you are? Your car? Your dress? Your money? Your home? Your hotel? Your job? Your restaurant? Your disease? Your actions? Your friends? Your lovers? Your family? Your lies? Your crimes? Your death? Your memory?The presence of two ""Matrix"" actors (Moss and Pantoliano, the girl and the villain) is an interesting coincidence. Both films are about invented or fictitious lives: one created from inside the person, and the other crafted from outside the individual.After ""Memento"", I'm interested in everything Nolan has done or will do in the future: even if he films a three hour prequel to ""My stepmother is an alien"", I will watch it with enthusiasm: I know that he will turn it into something interesting. He already did that in ""Batman Begins"".Unforgettable memento of the unlimited possibilities of cinema.10 out of 10 for Christopher Nolan, and also for John Nolan (author of the narration that inspired the film).",Memento
582,CCS-CRITIC,Excellent brain teaser,8,16 April 2003,"8/10This movie is very clever and very original. Memento is a story of a man who loses his wife in a rape attack inside their home, pledging that he will track down a murderer for revenge and peace of mind. The main problem is that Lenny (Guy Peirce), after the attack, was left with a problem in that he cannot retain any long term memories. Well that's one brief summary of how to look at it, but there are others. Indeed this film is excellent and played with my emotions, emotions of sympathy, anger and questioning my own morals and judgements. Peirce is exceptional as the lead, and the characters that come into contact with him also give fine performances (notably Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano). Focusing on the problem of losing a memory after approximately 15 minutes, we begin to appreciate just how frustrating Lennys plight is. The film is beautifully shot alternating between colour and black and white (there is a logical reason), and as suggested the movie is thought provoking and intelligent. However, on my first viewing I must admit I thought it was distinctly average. Yes, its one of these films where I would urge you to watch twice, possibly three times, as I like many only appreciated it after a number of viewings. Highly innovative movie.",Memento

I have to believe that my actions still have meaning... even if I can't remember them. I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world's still there.""

585,suffer-smart-magnet,Intellectually Challenging,8,24 August 2002,"Memento is a thought-provoking and potentially uncomfortable discovery into people through the main character Leonard.SideNote: The biggest complaint my friends had about the film is that they couldn't grasp the multitude of time shifts that occur in the movie. These are key to understanding the plot and the motivations and mind-set of Leonard. I didn't have any difficulty in this area, perhaps because I am described as observant and attentive. By the time the third shift happened, I was ready for it, and by the end of the movie, was relishing each shift. In case its not obvious, if you can't handle these shifts, you will not do well in understanding the movie. :End SideNoteLeonard can't fix his life. He asserts that he is seeking revenge for his wife's murder, but that is a smokescreen to him dealing with the person he's become, and the life he's living. He can't let go of the notion that his wife is just around the corner, 'just gone to the bathroom'. This haunts him. If he could just wake up one day knowing that his wife was gone, he could let go. He destroys evidence and kills people, but when he wakes up, his purpose in life will still be to find John G., as tatooed on his body.The uncomfortable truth uncovered through Leonard is the limitations, frailties, and desperation we all contain. Leonard's memory problem sets the backdrop, and his dealing with it is where you will start questioning things. While you can mentally seperate yourself from the character in the beginning because you don't share his particular ailment, in relection you will see the connections to all people.My reaction to Leonard's character changed with my changing perception of his motivations, as well as how conscious he was of his actions. Victim? Murderer? Confused and desperate? Its all there.I enjoyed Memento, and I intend to watch this movie again. There are many levels here, and I want to pick up on more.

We can almost figure out step to step, from Teddy is the bad guy to Natalie is using Leonard to achieve her own purposes, to Leonard murdered Jimmy for god knows what reasons, to Teddy is a cop that is helping Leonard all along and Natalie is punishing Leonard by tricking him into killing Dodd because she knows Leonard has killed Jimmy, to knowing that Leonard made this whole bunch of nonsense up to give his life a purpose. The movie gives you a chronic panic that diffuses slowly in your heart, making you fear about the real world, and even doubting your own memory.I couldn't tell you how scared I was when Natalie make Leonard punch herself and slip into the car and wait, then come back to the room pretending to be injured by Dodd, then Leonard turns furious and come after Dodd for revenge, but in a following scene Leonard think to himself: ""I am chasing him. No, he is chasing me."" And Dodd came after Leonard with a gun, because Natalie told Dodd that Leonard was the guy that ran away with a stack of cash and drugs because she wanted to solve Leonard and Dodd together, wishing both of them to be dead. But the misunderstanding between Dodd and Leonard made by Natalie is half true because Teddy, the bad cop, did gave him half the cash after he sold the drug himself. This might be what Leonard himself called ""poetic justice"".Sammy Jankis was the character that gave me the most tremendous shock. He was a real person, but he was not the one that injected his wife with too many insulin to cause her death, Leonard was the one. Leonard had to create a false life for himself because in real life he killed his wife by injecting her insulin for three times. When realizing that, I couldn't help feeling more depressed.Most importantly, this film shows how fatal is this to be completely ignorant of common psychology. Natalie told Leonard when she tried to get him punching her: ""How blissful ignorant you are!"" Sammy also was so frustrated that she tested her husband with such fatal tool, which caused her own life and Leonard's life too. But from the start, if they get a therapist then everything it gonna be fine. Leonard's wife don't have to die, Leonard don't have to punch Jimmy and wear his suit from the start, and Teddy wouldn't have to die. Leonard suffered from the damage of hippocampus, he could have accepted a hippocampus transplant and retrieve his memory, but somehow his brilliant mind didn't reach that thought. This tragedy wouldn't have happened if they trust science a little more, because neuroscience was advanced enough to cure Leonard in the time of film: 2000.",Memento

589,Dave-330,This IS one of the greats.,10,7 July 2003,"Now I am not the type of person who writes a glowing review about any old movie, because usually those that I like get enough acclaim and more that I don't get too much acclaim.  This is my exception to the rule.  This movie is about as good as film gets.  This is not your everyday run of the mill, same old, same old JLo film or something, this is an original, thoughtful, intelligent film.  Those that have read or heard that it is ""backward"" or ""confusing"" pay attention while I explain the unexplainable:  when the movie is in color, the plot is from the back and is progressing to the middle, thus the first five minutes of the film occur at the end of the sequence of events.  Then the next five minutes are in black and white and are the beginning of the story arc (there are additional flashbacks of Leonard's memories, but those are fairly easy to follow).  Then it goes back to the next color scene which is the one chronologically in front of the opening scene, then another black and white which is the next scene from the beginning.  The film actually comes together with the final black and white scene becoming color and then there is the conclusion, but both parts are actually the middle: so scene 23, then 1, then 22, then 2, and so on.Now to the actual merits of the film:  Guy Pearce carried ""LA Confidential"" on his shoulders (with the help of some fine actors) and has amazingly gotten bigger shoulders because this is his film.  Throughout the whole movie Pearce is front and center, the focal point.  Everything revolves around him and he gives a great performance, without overacting once.  The rest of the cast do a passable job.Aside from Pearce's performance and the ""gimmick"", there is still an amazing script, cinematography, and director which I am going to lump together and label as ""The Nolan factor.""  Nolan's other recent effort ""Insomnia"" has received lukewarm reviews, but I like his work.  It is not style for the sake of style or to cover-up plot holes, it is style with substance and that is something few film-makers can achieve.To tell you how engrossed I was with this film when I first saw it on cable (and I was sure I would hate it), I literally received a phone call about 30 minutes into the film that was from my mother and I was so into the film I realized she had been talking to me for a couple of minutes and was asking what was wrong, and all I could say was ""Can I call you back in like an hour, I am watching this movie?"" and as soon as she said ""Yes."" I hung up the phone, having not one time taken my eyes off of the television.If you are up for it, it is an experience, but make sure you have a little over an hour and a half set aside and are ready to think... and you may think about unplugging the phone, so you can avoid a lecture about phone etiquette.  This film is one of my 10 favorite films and deserves a 10 out of 10.",Memento
590,dbn3,"Interesting Concept, Flawed Execution (5/10)",6,1 February 2002,"(I saw this on DVD, YMMV)Summary:Leonard Shelby is a man who has no short term memory since being injured defending his wife an attack that resulted in her rape and murder.  For some reason that is not really clear, the police have never caught the attackers, so Leonard has vowed to hunt down and kill them.  However, he cannot remember a thing that has happened since the day he lost his short-term memory and ten minutes ago.  Therefore, he is constantly having no memory of why he is doing things and uses a series of pictures and notes to help sort it out.To give the same feeling to the audience, the director shows the scenes in reverse order.  The opening scene of the movie essentially has Leonard looking at a picture of Teddy with the words ""kill him"" written underneath in his handwriting.  Leonard proceeds to kill Teddy.  Just as that is all Leonard has to go on, that is all the audience has.  Then the movie backs up a little bit and shows Leonard gleaning the last bit of information that convinces him Teddy is the killer and we see him actually writing ""kill him"" on Teddy's picture.  This backing up continues until we find out the real secrets in the movie.The Good:Guy Pierce gives a very good performance as Leonard.  The transitions between the scenes are very smooth.  There is just enough overlap at the start and end of each scene that the transitions are very easy to follow.  In addition, there is a small part of the film that runs forward in time, mostly Leonard telling a backstory to someone on the phone. These are easily distinguished by being shot in black and white, while the rest of the film is in color.The Bad:There is an unrelenting lust for death that drives Leonard.  No one, not even Teddy who might be a cop, discusses the idea of vigilantism.  That Leonard should hunt down and kill whoever he thinks might be the killer, the justice system be damned, is never questioned.  It is the mindless writing of a bad action movie at work here.Although the reverse order presentation is easy to follow, it began to wear thin.  Perhaps it is because, and other reviewers have mentioned, that this story told in chronological order would be weak, at best.  The film relies too much on this one trick of storytelling without anything else to really back it up.The clincher that something is desperately wrong is the pat summation speech at the end of the film.  Throughout the film, the reliance is on how Leonard is going to remember some particular fact, but we are only given the quickest glances of the actual results of Leonard's investigations.  In an attempt to make a rather dull story seem mysterious, the makers have told us so little about the story that they make up for the error with ""the speech that explains everything.""5/10",Memento

However, the man has a memory condition by which he cannot remember anything for longer than 15 minutes, so he constantly takes Polaroids, writes notes, and even gets tattoos to remember important information.  To place the audience inside this man's head, the filmmakers tell the story backwards so that we, too, never know what just happened.  It is a brilliant use of this device, for it's not just a gimmick -- it's the main way the movie achieves subjectivity with its main character.

599,geniuskentyk-1,Christopher Nolan keeps up his wonderful track record!,9,11 September 2010,"Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) has a problem; he has anterograde amnesia, which means he can't produce new memories. The cause of this is from an accident, one which viewers will be able to find out about near the middle of the film. Leonard can remember everything before his accident, but anything after he can't remember; he can only go on for an uncertain amount of time until his brain restarts, making him lose memory of what just happened.Leonard's problem allows director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Inception, The Prestige) to create something truly unique with the film by presenting it in a reverse-chronological order. 'Memento' is presented in two different ways throughout; the parts presented in color are played forward, but are ordered chronologically backwards; the parts presented in black-and-white are played forward, and are also ordered in chronologically forward. Some may get slightly confused by this style, but it shouldn't take long until the concept catches on and is understandable.'Memento's' backwards-storytelling style is what keeps the film interesting. The viewer only knows as much as Leonard knows, at the beginning, but we gradually know more than him as the film comes to a close (though, we don't know that much more than him). When new scenes come up, they're usually funny and entertaining because it makes us wonder how Leonard got himself into that situation; of course, we find this out when the next scene comes up, which ends with the beginning of the previous scene.The film's unique style forces viewers to constantly think, question, and assume about many different things within it, which is good. 'Memento' forces viewers to pay attention on what's happening on screen, as well as what those scenes could mean or be leading to.Throughout the film, Leonard has relationships with different characters, and we never know who is Leonard's ally or enemy, not what their motives are until the end. Leonard has a close friend, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who helps Leonard in his path to find and kill a specific person, but is Teddy really trying to help him or not? Leonard also develops a close relationship with a woman named Natalie (Carrie-Anne moss), whom is also trying to help Leonard find and kill a specific person, but who is Natalie? What's her motive, and is she truly helping him? Leonard believes someone's trying to make him kill the wrong person, but since we only know as much as he does, we never know if Teddy is that person, or if Natalie is that person, of if neither of them are the ones trying to lead Leonard in the wrong direction. This confusion and possibility keeps the film entertaining, and opinions regarding Teddy and Natalie will surely switch multiple times throughout the film.When the film ends (which is technically the beginning), many things are explained. However, these explanations are open to interpretations; just because the film answered certain questions asked throughout, it doesn't mean those specific answers are the right answer. The ending of 'Memento' makes you think about possible scenarios that could have happened before the events of the film, and how those could be important to the film. 'Memento', by the end of the film, is pretty straightforward, but like Inception, the film is left open to interpretation.Director-writer Christopher Nolan does an excellent job at setting up the film's premise and style. 'Memento' is actually adapted from the short story, 'Memento Mori', which was written by Nolan's younger brother, Jonathan Nolan. Christopher Nolan is always skilled in his psychological-thriller type films, and his skill is definitely not missing from 'Memento', which is one of his early films.PS: 'Memento' might take some viewers mutiple viewings in order to like. Personally, I didn't like the film the first time I saw it. The second time around, however, I loved it! Some might like the film the first time, like some people I know.",Memento

I was intrigued from the opening credits until the very end.  This movie does, however, make you think quite a bit.  It captures your attention by the way that it puts you practically in Leonard's condition by telling the story backwards.  When I saw that someone had been killed in the beginning (or the end of the story, rather), I thought to myself that it was no fun because I already knew who the bad guy was.  But that was the exact OPPOSITE of what I came to believe after the next two hours.  Although this movie does leave quite a few unanswered questions, this feeling of wonder as the movie ends is almost comforting, because you can make up your own ending to the story and what YOU think actually happened.  I recommend that anyone who has seen this movie visit the website at otnemem.com.  You will find out even more information to pique your curiosity.
Now for the **SPOILERS**.I have been thinking about this movie and what happened in it during the past 24 hours and think I understand, but maybe could use a bit of help from anyone else willing to offer it.  In my opinion, Leonard and his wife were attacked in their home and Leonard was left with his condition.  He tattooed ""remember Sammy Jankis"" as a reminder to himself to pass of his own situation as someone else's.  This is a memory that he always remembered to share with others due to this reminder.  The diabetes situation was actually his own and his wife died from an insulin overdose.  He set off to find his wife's ""murderer"" so he could erase guilt of causing her death from the insulin (I'm unsure about if he would even feel guilt because of his condition).  I believe that Teddy and Jimmy were in the drug business together and Teddy set Jimmy up to be killed by Leonard.  Natalie found out and helped Leonard onto the trail of Teddy (more than he had already helped himself).  I'm still a bit fuzzy on the whole Dodd situation. 
***Questions: There was one scene in the movie where they showed Sammy in the mental institution, and, maybe it was just me, but for a BRIEF SECOND I could SWEAR that they imposed Leonard sitting in the institute just where Sammy had been sitting.  From what it says on the website, Leonard was in a mental institution.  Did anyone else see this?Another thing that I think I saw near the end of the movie... the polariod that Leonard received under the door of the hotel showed him smiling and pointing at a spot on his chest.  For a brief second as he was flashing back to thoughts of his wife, she was curled up on his chest and the tattoo ""I DID IT"" could be seen in that very spot.  Did anyone else see THIS? 
Bottom line: Great movie, very original, and way intriguing. 9/10",Memento
605,The Truth,"Clever, but lacks some depth.",8,18 June 2001,"The most memorable, remarkable thing in Memento is obviously its structure. The story of the film is told backwards, scene by scene. This unorthodox choice of narrative form has two purposes: firstly, it creates unique twists by showing an character act, and only afterwards revealing the (usually ambiguous) motives behind the action. Secondly, the narration helps us to identify with the main character, Leonard Shelby; Shelby's brain is damaged, and he therefore loses his short-memory several times a day. Like Leonard, the audience doesn't know what happened to him before his latest fit of amnesia. Also, like Leonard, the audience does know what happened to him before the assault that caused the injury. So we know that his wife was killed, and that revenge is the only thing that keeps him going.As a structural exercise, Memento works perfectly. The backward narrative may at first seem like a gimmick, but soon one can see what a great way of telling a thriller story this is. What happens on the screen can never be taken in face value, since we never know the history behind the latest occurence. Because we know the ending we think we know the whole story, but the story reveals itself to be far more complicated than we thought. Every new revelation puts the things we previously saw into new light, right up until the very clever ending (which chronologically begins the story). Like many recent thrillers, the film ends with a surprise twist, but unlike in most of these thrillers, Memento's surprise ending doesn't render the rest of the plot illogical (à la Fight Club). The director Christopher Nolan made this exact mistake in his previous film, so it's good to see he has learned something.Sadly, exceptional story structure and an unique main character are not enough to bring true depth to the film. The basic story, if told chronologically, is intriguing, but not in any way exceptional. Guy Pearce does a great job portraying Leonard Shelby; still, his character faces such an extraordinary situation, that the audience can hardly sympathize or understand him. The overall feeling of the film is cold. Also, Mementos script touches some interesting issues concerning the nature of memory, but the inertia of the plot itself soon wipes over these larger themes.Despite the criticism, I think Memento still is an original and mind-boggling puzzle, well worth tackling. Great brain food, but not much else.",Memento

It was the best decision I made all summer.I won't go into details on the plot of the film (there's plenty of others on here already) but I will say this: Memento is the most original, intelligent film I have seen in a long long time.  The 'reverse' narrative might not be for everyone (if you found it too difficult to follow you are obviously too stupid to be watching films like this) but it was a new idea that worked perfectly with the story line involved.When I started to watch it I saw Teddy had been shot and realised the plot was to unfold from there; I thought: ""Hmmm, interesting idea - but it won't keep me interested"".  How wrong I was.  The movie flows perfectly throughout and the writing and directing ensures you are permanently engrossed from start to finish.  The beginning creates the illusion that you know what is coming, but this is quashed as the plot starts to unfold and you realise that even though you have seen the outcome: you have no idea what is coming next.  I felt that without the slightly weak end to the film (well, beginning of the story :-)) this would have made it into my all-time greats list.  As it is, I gave it a 'very good' rating of 8/10.However, seeing as this particular style of non-linear narrative is unlikely to be reproduced often, Memento could well go down in history as one of the 'classics'.",Memento

I only wish we had more films like this among ""mainstream"" cinema, not only huge budget action flicks. This film is one of a kind, one that actually makes you think outside the box, even after it's over, producing waves that go a long way. It's also that kind of movie that, every time you watch it, there's something new to discover. The great special thing about it is the reversed order of events, meant to make us feel as disoriented as Leonard. We are dared to put the pieces together and try to make some sense out of that fragmented story, but easy answers are never given.As always happens to great movies like this, lots of theories surround what is supposed to be the ""truth"". But, similar to real life, there simply isn't one and only truth, there are points of view, and our own choices. As for Lenny's story, we have some facts (but even facts can turn into memories, if we dig deep enough), and what was once taken as a central belief can be twisted upside down. To me, one of the great things about it is the final monologue, showing how much of what we tell ourselves can be a most conventional lie. We lie to ourselves not only for our own benefit over others, but especially in order to survive. To survive a truth that is so much greater than us that it contains the power to annihilate our existence. And if we believe what Teddy says to Lenny in the final (but first) scene, we may have a lot figured out about what Lenny is all about.

It presents the story through half scenes shown in a mixed chronological order so that the trick to follow it is to ""remember"" (get it?) everything and put the pieces together in a way that it makes sense.
The thing is, maybe you're not up to play a memory game for two hours, maybe you just want to watch a movie, and if you don't play along you end up just watching stuff happen.
This chronology puzzle can be entertaining at first but it quickly becomes monotonous and boring, it's two hours of nealy identical scenarios and dialogs repeated over and over again, and by the time you have all the pieces to put everything together, you simply don't care anymore because all you want is for the movie to end.Lastly, the protagonist's condition on which the story relies on is too far-fetched for my suspension of disbelief to handle (don't worry, not a spoiler): a person with brain trauma that left him with an impaired short them memory and is unable to make new memories. Someone with such condition should be barely able to function in every day life without a care-taker, but being independent to such degree?

From the opening sequence, the viewer dives into a world of mystery and leaves much of the interpretation up to the spectators. In a year featuring dud after dud, a film like this restored my hope in entertaining film-making. Christopher Nolan (the director and screenwriter), along with the editor and actors deserve all the kudos for giving the public a film, which is entertaining and actually requires effort. When so many movies (""Jurassic Park III"", ""Tomcats"", etc.)  are having the audience leave their brain at the door, this is one notable exception. The performances are all first-rate, but the story is the star here. The film plays with narrative structure and has many scenes, moments and images which refer back to others.

Since his hero is also the narrator, it's a tricky narrative; but Nolan complicates things even further by unfolding the story backwards. The result is clever but it's also taxing: your mind has to work harder than it necessarily should. Once the novelty wears off, there are plenty of dead spots and impatience sets in--you want to get to the beginning to get a feeling of completion. The result is like watching a big-screen version of `Columbo' where you know the killer at the onset and watch Peter Falk figure out whodunit and why. If that's your cup of tea, this is for you.

627,Redfoot9681,A+,10,12 November 2001,"Every once-in-a-while a film comes along that simply blows the viewer's mind. The Usual Suspects, A Simple Plan, and Magnolia are a few that did so for me. I can now add Memento to that distinguished list.Memento is a dictionary-definition of top drawer filmmaking. Director Christopher Nolan, basing the story from his brother's idea, has put together the most intricate web of a movie that I have seen in some time, and my hunch is that it was not easy. The entire story is told backwards, with the opening scene actually being the conclusion to the story. This is the first film I have ever seen with a surprise beginning.The story of revenge is really nothing new. It is Nolan's twist in his filmmaking that makes it all seem fresh.Guy Pearce portrays Leonard, a man who suffers from the effects of anterograde amnesia, a disorder in which the victim can only remember events from a certain point forward (usually the event that caused the amnesia). The last thing he remembers is his wife being assaulted and killed. Now he is out to find the killers and get his revenge.Because of Leonard's disorder, he must try and accomplish his revenge with notes and tattoos to remind himself of key facts. No easy task, but he is set in his ways, and wants justice.Nolan puts the viewer directly in Leonard's shoes, making it easy for us to sympathize with him. This was crucial for the story to work, and Nolan accomplished it effortlessly.Pearce, who has always favored roles along the lines of this one, plays Leonard flawlessly, with a fierce and determined look, and also that of desperation. The screenplay makes full use of him, and my hunch is that Pearce will have the character of Leonard engrained in him for the rest of his career. Excellent supporting roles are provided by Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano. Who should Leonard trust?This is dramatic cinema at its best, and in my opinion one of the top three films of the year. This is the kind of movie you find yourself discussing with strangers in line at the grocery store.Do yourself a favor and see the finest, most engrossing film to come along in the past few years.A+",Memento

The supporting cast is amazing, the always terrific Joe Pantoliano for one, who just has this knack for playing likable sleaze, and Carrie-Anne Moss, known best for her role in the Matrix films, is also pitch perfect in a Noir film that redefines the genre for the new century. It can be hard to follow if you're not paying attention, but in the end the eccentricity of how the tale is told makes more and more sense as, just like Leonard, you never know how he got to the point where he is.

The problem is, he has no short term memory, and has no idea of who his allies are and who is trying to manipulate him. The story is told backwards, with the film beginning at the end, and ending at the start. Unfortunately the novelty wears off after about ten minutes and the film becomes excruciating to sit through, and soon the characters become boring and the plot uninvolving.
Memento reeks of a script that tries too hard to be fresh and original.

If you have problems with understanding the previous sentence, you are going to have even more trouble with understanding the film. Its basic idea is turning the action around. Not in a mechanical way, fortunately. ""Memento"" is a pack of scenes that end in the moment the previous scenes started in.The main character is an ex-detective from an insurance company (Guy Pearce). His wife, as everything seems so, has been brutally raped and murdered while he himself was hit in his head. The effect of damage is the so-called short memory loss. Our hero remembers exactly who he was before that tragical incident, but he doesn't remember who he talked to and what about five minutes ago. That is why he has to write everything down. He collects Polaroid pictures of the people he meets. He fills his pockets with some quick notes. He even treats his own body as a big organizer and he tattoos his chest with the main memorized clue: ""John G. murdered your wife"".This film has its own style and class. The idea itself about a guy who doesn't remember his experiences from a second ago is great. The ""reverse gear"" narration used here seems to be both logical and functional solution. Sometimes it is quite funny. For example, when the character doesn't know whether he chases someone or he is being chased.",Memento

638,damfaz,An emotional brain puzzle,10,14 June 2020,"Memento is one of my favourite movies because it is a very difficult brain puzzle written and filmed in an excellent way. It is a psychological thriller which lays the groundwork for Nolan's upcoming movies like Inception. I loved the noir plot, its development and above all the time structure of Memento.It follows two different alternated temporal lines: the black and white sequences follow a chronological order, while the color ones go backwards in time. In the end, they converge to the same point. The choice of inverting the time is a very smart trick used by Nolan to establish a big empathy between us and Leonard. He doesn't remember nothing which happened in the short-term past, he doesn't recognize people who he already talked to and he's never sure about who to trust and who not: we feel the same for the whole duration of the movie, so basically we live in Leonard's mind. The only difference between us and Leonard is that we can reconstruct events from the scenes we watch, and so we can easily understand that other characters, such as Natalie, take advantage of his disorder.However, we have to wait the end of the movie to get out of Leonard's mind and open our eyes about what really happened. Teddy explains the truth behind the rape of Leonard's wife, the insulin thing and above all that Leonard will have the necessity to solve this impossible puzzle for the rest of his life because he can't accept where things really stand: his wife was actually killed by Leonard himself. Rather than accepting it, he prefers to blame Teddy, so he builds up a puzzle to capture and kill him one day (the beginning of the movie).In addition to what I've just explained, I've enjoyed the movie because it is plenty of food of thought. For instance, characters talk about the inaccuracy of the memory a lot of times: ""Memory can change the shape of a room [...], memories can be distorted, they're just an interpretation. And they're irrelevant if you have the facts."" But which facts? Facts are not polaroids nor notes without any context, and this movie highlights this aspect. The truth is always something relative: it depends on memories, emotional involvement, and even if we refuse it, it highly depends on the people around us.To sum up, Leonard's actual problem is not about memory or finding the truth. As Teddy told him ""You don't want the truth"".",Memento

This approach just forces you to pay absolute attention which you aren't regressive about because there's nothing you want more than to just know.

UNdevelop before our very eyes, gradually fading back into a pale, white nothing, before quickly sliding back inside the camera, as though it never existed. It's an impressive, incredibly evocative opening shot, one that deftly establishes the central reversed-time ""gimmick"" of Christopher Nolan's breakthrough film Memento, but the various ways that Nolan experiments with and develops this structure over the course of the film makes it transcend and become so much more than just another high-concept premise, instead, utilizing it to its full potential to create what is easily one of the best, most mind-blowing movies I've seen in my life.First off, yes, the plot of this film is rather complicated, and the way it unfolds in reverse order in nothing but quick, five minute fragments (alongside the parallel scenes that proceed in normal order) makes it all much, much harder to follow anyway; unless you're some kind of brilliant film savant, it will be impossible for you to absorb every little detail & nuance upon first watch, as the film practically demands for you to see it at least twice, preferably right after you've watched it the first time. However, rather than being annoyed at the Byzantine storytelling of Memento, I appreciate the confusion inherent in experiencing it, as this feeling is necessary for us to be able to sympathize with Guy Pearce's ""Lenny"", the ultimate unreliable narrator, a man caught in a Sisyphean nightmare of an existence, albeit one that we come to learn is partly of his own making, as, at times, he chooses to rewrite the past to his own tragic whims, becoming his own worst enemy, his very own ""John G"".But, besides its various narrative contortions, another thing I really enjoy about Memento is just how emotional it really is; at least half of its appeal comes from the extensive efforts Nolan takes to make us emotionally empathize with Lenny, as we watch him struggle to make meaning out of his situation, burn the last batch of his late wife's belongings, and reminisce often about her lingering memory, showing himself to be a man haunted & trapped by the spectors of the past (represented literally by the ever-growing number of ""clues"" he obsessively tattoos onto his body). It's the way these calm, beautiful, melancholic moments alternate with the frantic, confused portions of Memento that round it out to be a truly full package of cinema, and help it transcend its potentially gimmick-y nature to become something much, much more.

648,troubledyouth66,Not Bad...but not OKAY either...,3,22 May 2013,"My take, omg i don't know wtf this movies about. It lost me at the end. What if teddy ended up being the murderer and like the guy he was chasing the cop. May be solve the problem with the non-sequential themes. Harder to read then a frank miller comic book without the rest of the series imho.These are one of those movies that could be good, if they do it right. Is there a book or guide to this movie? The reason why it failed is because in my book the characters got all mixed up. They lost coordination on how to make the movie interesting. If you were to watch 12 monkeys, it would be interesting because the key points, if you watch pulp fiction it would be interesting. This movie would be an interesting comic orientated mobster movie thriller full of suspense or thought provoking if they didn't add sooo many characters. Jesus, who is the guy at the end?!? Why isn't Teddy the killer? I figured the doctor was in his position as an amnesiac, okay. But umm did he just fly into France from Hollywood is my question. The movie is way too thought provoking with too many characters, and some people don't have the time to watch a guy try and remember something until the quarter end of the movie where it takes a back seat in interest. Its as if the user is tricked into actually liking the movie. Horrible. TBH no one would care about a throw in character who is suddenly the killer of his wife, who is now....alive. Whom he kills cus hes an idiot. Okay. Maybe they grew old together. Makes sense, except it would be more interesting if i knew his wife was diabetic, and he kills his wife while in the hospital after the accident. Maybe he could have killed his wife, or maybe he could have had like a son or daughter instead whom he killed. Maybe his wife should have survived and his daughter was the unfortunate casualty. Maybe he went to the town of his killer and made friends with the residence, true...okay but then his killer shows up and the guy he was chasing or chasing him is out of the picture. I would expect even, teddy to actually be lying, while the guy he was chasing be a cop. Sure, throw in the obvious...but what if teddy had a motive to kill him at the end. What if teddy was insured and had him kill the cop, whom he finally realized he killed. What if Teddy was the 'second' guy. Maybe cripple his mind a little psychologically. Was the movie trying to be like funny or something? I don't think so. I like the mood of the film though, it was very light so they went in that direction but i would like to see a light funny comedy thriller with dark humor, very artsy makes you feel really small in a big world. Except this comedy thriller needs murder, it just does..and lots of it. Good idea, not so good outcome. What exactly were they trying to do here is my question. Need's work.",Memento
649,stewartmatt99,Nolan blows our minds in this thriller,9,2 September 2010,"Leornard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is determined to avenge his wife's rape and murder; however, since the the rape Leornard has had short term memory loss, making the investigation of who killed his wife very difficult. So, in order for him to find the killer, he has to constantly take pictures of people and leave a note about the person. As the movie progresses, you are taken back in time and being revealed more and more about the truth of Leornard's wife's murder, all while flashing back and forth from a phone call Leornard is having with an unknown stranger about a man who shares the same condition as him.I believe that it is fair to say that Christopher Nolan truly is a movie making genius, and is one of the best Directors today. He has made five films that I have seen: Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Inception, The Prestige, and Memento. If you have not seen one of these films I suggest you go to a movie rental store and rent one. I constantly hear people arguing about what Christopher Nolan's masterpiece is, but personally I think we should more focus on his career, because he has yet to make a bad film. Or really he has not made a film that is not critically acclaimed. So far he has had an absolutely brilliant career, as both a writer, and director.Now, to focus on the film. Memento has one of the most unique approaches I have ever seen. It is not everyday that you watch a movie that starts at the end, and then goes backwards from there. And I definitely did not think that starting at the end of a movie, I would be surprised. But like The Prestige, I was somewhat confused at times in the film, especially about how it was going to end, and yet again Christopher Nolan blows my mind with an unbelievably creative ending. His direction was very possibly worthy of an Oscar nomination, and if not that at least some recognition.I think it is fair to say that Guy Pearce is not one of the better actors of our time. Espececially since the most recent movie I have seen him in was 'Bedtime Stories'. With that said I thought that he did a superb job with this role. The acting by everyone one else was not necessarily anything special, but it was done well enough for the movie to still be far above excellent. The film's script was also very good, like all of Nolan's films.Overall, Memento is another one of Christopher Nolan's surprise ending thrillers. While I did not think the ending was quite as strong as the ending for The Prestige, it still blew my mind, and I certainly did not guess it, which is really all I can ask for. As this film came to a close I really could say that I was ""surprised"" by the ending, or actually more so by the beginning.",Memento
650,ericjcant-1,Powerfully dark and beautiful film. Looks into the void of a life only half lived.,10,8 December 2020,"Memento is a spectral masterpiece of relentless and poignant visual story telling. It unwinds a fascinating story, walking a fine line between crime-noir and psychological drama, yet with a self-awareness that somewhat reminds me of Bergman's sincerity. That might sound a bit gratuitous to some, but making a film like this, where the script is so strong, requires a solid director who not only facilitates the story correctly, but preserves the presence of the mood and not sanitizing it. Guy Pearce's delivery of the first person narrative is spot-on in tone and with a strangely fascinating pragmatic determinism as we start to understand Leonard's strange existence. I think this story is told perfectly through Nolan's lens, and with a premise that is compelling from its first dark note. I have to give Nolan credit for not making this film something that wraps up a comfortably resolved climax with a bow on top. There are questions that cannot and should not be answered, and this is partially why it leaves the viewer with such a strong and eerie impact. There are only portions of the mystery that can be resolved due to Leonard's condition. Leonard is a character the viewer feels compelled to immediately sympathize with, and integrity that is unquestionable. You cannot help but to empathize with the excellent narrative and put yourself in Leonard's shoes. But the card that Leonard has been dealt is such a dark echo of functional existence. No matter how bad you want clean cut answers, the bigger picture has too many holes, and the extent of the criminal deeds of every character in this film is suspect. We cannot help but to empathize with Leonard because we know just by his running narrative as we hear his thoughts that his sincerity and resoluteness is unshakeable, but it is never quite clear how far he has been willing to go see justice incurred. Memento doesn't leave us hanging, but the unanswered questions make for a beautifully dark movie that it pulls you into a sea of uncertain reality. It's not that often that you come across movies with a grip that is as alluring as it is spooky.
I have to mention that it is perfectly acted by Guy Pearce and Carrie Anne Moss. And Joe Pantoliano could not have been a better choice.
This is a movie that actually better on a second or third watch, because once you have drawn your conclusions, there are plenty of questions to play with, and the mood is so thick you can cut it with a knife!",Memento

Personally, it didn't even look interesting on a surface level, but I decided to watch it anyway because of the rave reviews. Now after watching this I have to ask, what kind of drugs are people on to find this borefest interesting? By the end of the movie I got no fulfillment at all, I didn't walk away with a message or even entertained whatsoever. There is just no progression in the film. You start in the beginning, in the middle of the movie you still feel like you're in the beginning, and in the last ten minutes you feel like you're going somewhere, but you literally end up in the beginning. Maybe that's what the director was going for because by the end of the movie I felt like I had the same condition as the main character, but there's something called trying to be too deep, which is what is going on here. I put so much faith in Christopher Nolan because of the Dark Knight trilogy but I don't know what he was thinking with this one.",Memento

I did find a few -- thanks! -- but mostly I'm struck by the observation that many people who seemingly didn't follow the plot nonetheless LOVE this film. It's really so good that you don't have to ""get it"" to admire the hell out of it.And, naturally, a good number of those who misunderstand the plot and/or underestimate the story's integrity HATE it. The sneers directed at a legitimate masterpiece (and the many viewers who rate it one) are, in a word, pathetic...**Spoilers****Spoilers**Memento is absolutely not about a plucky protagonist earnestly trying to find an anonymous assailant and avenge his wife's death. It's about our boy Lenny fumbling through an impossibly complicated psychological maze until, in a moment of perfect clarity, he concocts a happy ending for himself. It's also about a fascinated Teddy toying for a while with a dangerous freak but ultimately failing to foresee how a human mind might turn its own fatal flaw into an awesome weapon. If you consider Lenny's likely fate after the last scene -- how he will interpret his tatoos and unburned polaroids for the rest of his life (presumably back in the mental hospital) it's clear that Leonard managed to resolve (for himself) the crushing and seemingly impossible dilemma of his own guilt.",Memento

There is a sustained eerie feeling throughout as you never know exactly how long it has been since the central crime was committed (and there is a great reason for this).

So i'll keep it as brief as i can (I've got enormous respect for this movie, and i just saw it so i want to talk about it!!) but I'll tell you this. Every self-respecting fan of films has to see Memento. It's just of of those movies you have to see. To name a few of recent memory: The Usual suspects, Magnolia, The Sixth Sense and Go. All films that are very original and fresh in their own way and Memento is very deserved a part of that list. Why Memento is such a fresh movie, and so original in its ways is that the entire storyline is told backwards. So the movie starts with the ending, and end with the beginning (were all the answers are given). I will not give away anything about the plot or anything but i can say that it has an awesome ""what was that again"", ""excuse me"" and ""i don't believe this"" ending.

Unable to form new memories, he must find his wife's killer, relying on notes jotted down on Polaroid pictures and tattoos scrawled across his body as a source of memory.This is easily one of the best neo-noir movies ever made, complicated but not too confusing, and boasts an innovative premise: it starts from the end, and works back to the beginning. There are two story lines: the main one is in color and progresses backwards, and another one in black and white that moves forward. The black and white thread ends where the color one begins. This devilishly twisted approach creates an intriguing setup and works magnificently through the movie. Clues pop up in both story lines and questions are asked, themes interspersing the movie that all culminate with a stunning twist ending that will have you questioning your surroundings for a while afterwards.Fine acting keeps the movie grounded and totally believable. Guy Pearce excels as Leonard, the former insurance investigator who's life is shattered. You understand his desperation to find his wife's killer, his frustration at his condition, and his paranoia that sifts through the film: is he being manipulated? Who does he trust? Joe Pantoliano does a great job portraying a shady character who may or may not be an ally to Leonard. And Carrie-Ann-Moss depicts an externally friendly woman whose aura of hospitality masks sinister intents.Not to give it all away, but unlike M. Night. Shymalan's work, you can predict the ending. It just takes a good eye for clues and an ability to remember them despite the advances in the plot. I was shocked by the ending, but the second time I watched it I realized I could have pieced it together by myself.One of Christopher Nolan's finest works, hands down.

665,rosaishere,Utterly insane story + fragmented time line = one of the most amazing thrillers ever,10,20 May 2005,"Without a doubt I have never watched a film that has engaged me more than Memento. The story is utterly insane, the time line is all over the place  yet it proves to be one of the most effective and entertaining thrillers available to date. The film starts off with a bizarre shooting of an unknown individual being shown in reverse. As soon as the credits finish the film starts off from the ending. We soon learn that the shooter Leonard (Guy Pearce) suffered a large blow to the head on the same night his wife was raped and murdered. Everything leading up to the murder he can remember, but anything afterwards he can't remember. This is a superb spin on the clichéd amnesia thrillers, where in this case, the hero cannot form new memories as opposed to not being able to recollect old ones. Leonard is out to solve his wives' murder, but in doing so he must use a series of tattoos and photos to collect evidence and solve the mystery. Along the way he appears to be manipulated by a cop who seems to have a strange interest in him (Joe Pantoliano) and a mysterious bartender who seems to know more than she's leading on (Carrie-Anne Moss). But the real challenge is in judging, who is genuine and who is false?The inspiring thing about this film, is that it's told in reverse; the events are told roughly in five minute intervals playing back from the end and working towards the beginning. By the time the film finishes you will be questioning yourself as to the truth about Lenny. This is one of the most original characteristics about this film; it is all open to personal interpretation. You seem to find yourself pausing the film every few minutes just to try and comprehend exactly what is happening. Definitely a web of mystery worth solving.When you finally reach the end of this masterpiece, and the ending has been revealed you will be very satisfied. The only thing I can recommend afterwards is purchase the DVD! Behold there is an option to watch the film in the correct order, much less taxing on the brain.

This is one of those films that people will tell you is very confusing and difficult to follow. Remember the Usual Suspects? People will go on and on about that film.

I haven't rewatched it. Am I some kind of wunderkind? Not by the longest shot. Have I missed some hidden depths? Its about the nature of memory and how we construct ourselves, right? Even in the shallow end of the gene pool we spotted that one.Memento is a wonderful film that rewards attention. The film unfolds its mysteries as you watch.

Your effort will be rewarded with a story that leaves you thinking for days about the relativity of truth, what actually defines a ""fact"", and the power of the human mind to create it's own reality.On the downside, I found a bit of the dialogue hoaky.

None of the characters are particulary anything other than Guy Pearce- mianly becuase Pearce's character ""sees"" all the other characters and doesn't know anything real about them so neither do you.All that said, the arrangment of this film is what sets it apart and makes it not something dull and boring. Other films have used this technique but the technique does work in this case and it adds a level of interest to the film that the story itself does not wholly deserve.BTW, most of the ""talking"" about the film afterwards has to do with the open questions left by the film's plot.

Confused, but it would then start to come together little by little.Acting was very good, although filming had a few goofs.  Overall it got the job done though.  Very clever to tip the viewer by using color and b/w as to which way the story was running (b/w = forward, color = backwards).  Story starts at the beginning (b/w) and runs to the middle, and in color running backwards toward the middle.  When the middle is reached the movie is over.I was surprised to read negative reviews.  Maybe they should watch it again. 40%+ of the 54,000 that rated the movie gave it a 10 out of 10.  #13 of all time from that many people might suggest that a second look might be in order by the ones that didn't like it.For a movie that took a little over a month to shoot and cost only $5m to make that blows most all the main stream much more costly movies out of the water is something worth noting by Hollywood.

He's got a short-term memory condition. The film is well edited in the way you follow the story with more meaning to it. The film is presented backwards. It truly fits the story, great overall cinematography. Lenny's life is pretty much twisted, as his memory is weak and he has to depend on his notes and tattoos. It's hard to talk about this film with detail, as it will spoil the film. It must be seen. One of the best written films ever. I reckon it by far deserves Oscar nominations on more aspects. The acting was well done, and every other aspect in editing was excellent. Memento should have deserved a Best Picture nomination. I don't know why it didn't. It only got 2 nominations, when it well deserved more. I don't get how the Academy Awards is run.

I spent several days thinking about it, reading reviews of it, and generally obsessing on it, and then I gave into temptation and went to see it again.The second time, I thought maybe it didn't seem quite as good, because I was not emotionally overwhelmed. But in retrospect this lessened emotional impact allowed me to more fully appreciate the movie's technical perfection--I am intellectually overwhelmed. I remain convinced that it is brilliant, and think I have somewhat more insight into what has led me to that conclusion.A third viewing is definitely in order.",Memento

It is ahead of Apocalypse Now, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Dr. Strangelove, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Lawrence of Arabia, The Graduate, Raging Bull, The Sting, The Empire Strikes Back, The Wizard of Oz, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Deer Hunter, Gone With the Wind, every Hitchcock movie, every Woody Allen movie, and every Kurosawa movie, except Seven Samurai, just to name a few.To hear the people on this board tell it, Memento is the 21st century's Godfather or Citizen Kane. I rented this film because of all the high praise it received. What I was treated to was an average film with only one outstanding performance (Joe Pantoliano), enough plot holes to drive a Jaguar through, and a gigantic gimmick that is as essential to the film as the shark is to Jaws.The movie is chopped into a number of scenes and shown in reverse. If one were to re-edit the film and show it front to back, it would be devoid of suspense. All the ""cerebral puzzles"" etc. would be gone. Even in its weird order, it's not all that deep. The director uses the sequencing and the protagonists's disorder to keep the viewer guessing. It's all a big trick, and by the end, the viewer is just relieved that it is over.There may be real people who suffer from this inability to create new memories, but I highly doubt they are able to function effectively as Pearce's character did. Nor do they have a network of friends who help them function and fail to get them professional help, especially when they are on a homicidal vendetta.Do not waste your time here.

This goes on for about 80% of the movie in an desperate attempt to create ""suspense""...but it gets tiresome. The end admittedly had a moderate surprising twist...however, from a certain point of view, the end was also predictable and, somehow, disappointing. The only positive thing about the movie is a good performance by Carrie Ann Moss, however the main character did not convince me, neither did the plot. (If there was one, besides of a repetitive line-up of the character's confusion and attempts by him to puzzle together memories.)

The lower life forms, such as NASCAR/Wrestling fans and bowlers need not apply --- go see The Flintstones, Part 8 in 3D.  I have never had the pleasure of watching a film which progressed completely backwards in time & frame sequence.  You could literally watch this film from the last scene to the first and it would make sense, maybe even more sense, except of course that you would watch the true ending first and spoil it for yourself.  What's really cool is that there's a slight narrative story within the story that is moving forward --- it's really ingenious.This is a classic in the making; completely original in all aspects.  This is something that I'm sure Hitchcock would have liked to do if he or anybody had thought of it before.  There are plot holes, but incredibly, you don't notice them badly and they don't have to be resolved to enjoy the film.  The script even mentions at least one, and you have to stop and think for a moment to find the others --- if Leonard can make no new memories, what good is a revenge killing if he won't remember the satisfaction of it, or even if he has even exacted revenge already --- in fact, what good is doing anything other than just existing and waiting for a cure, but then you wouldn't have a movie, eh?  These questions were posed by the story which inspired the film and of course were omitted for sake of argument and they do not spoil the continuity one bit.  The introduction of certain elements of the plot are not mentioned and left up to the viewer to decipher, and another big hole --- if Leonard can't remember anything, how does he remember how to drive a car, how does he even know that the Polaroids he takes are in his pocket, and how does he know about anything he has done more than 30 minutes ago which are essential to functioning in life in general?  There are also elements of certain characters that fail to resolve themselves, but you can live with them as well --- what you get in return is a heckuva neo-Noir flick that deserves your attention.If you will suspend belief as you should when you see any film and manage to hold on for the first 30 minutes until the plot thickens, you will get an incredible payoff.  In fact, this will be a film that you will want to watch again the very moment it ends to take stock of what just happened and the time frames and appreciate the mastery of the plot & screenplay fully and even discuss what you just saw with someone, as you may have a time figuring out what you just saw!  The filmmakers left a little of the story in your hands to allow you to decide what you just saw, but not so much (like ""K-PAX"") that you feel like you were left with an incomplete storyline.Thumbs straight up on this one, and you MUST get the DVD version to really appreciate this film.",Memento

The movie works backwards in time. The movie working backwards mirrors our hero's inability to make sense of what he is doing, without crib notes from the past, that tell him (maybe) who is who, and what is what. Except, as we(those of us with short term memory) see what is revealed we can put the information together, unlike our hapless hero. In the end we know a lot more, but are left to argue with our movie going buddies about how much we do know and how much was part of a deliberate Rashomon like prism of reality set up by the screen play.
It's probably a great movie to see again just to see the clues that we missed because we didn't know (yet) what to look for.

What makes this different from your average revenge film is that Lenny (Guy Pearce) has a ""condition"" which means that since the incident (involving his wife's apparent rape and murder) he only has a two minute memory span.  Nolan's stroke of genius is that he offers us such a disjointed narrative that his audience can't help but identify with Lenny's disorientation!Throughout the film, like Lenny, we attempt to piece together some sense of chronology and most importantly we can't be sure of whom Lenny should trust. The main support roles, Carrie Anne Moss as the femme fatale and Joe Pantoliano as the private detective-type, are both notable for their moral ambiguities.Not only is the plot structure a refreshing and rewarding experience, the performances are certainly up to scratch with Guy Pearce giving another fine display in the lead role, proving that LA Confidential wasn't just a flash in the pan.",Memento

It's a movie that falls just short of being a classic, but nonetheless one that you will likely remember for some time. The reverse unfolding of the plot was not extremely difficult to follow and didn't force the viewer to continually question the significance of each scene. In other words, it was a user friendly film and the director did not find it necessary to continually confound the viewer with scenes that had to be replayed several times before they became understandable.

Unlike normal movies which move forward, you don't have to remember every little bit of what happened before all the time. But here, since you see everything backward, you have to keep in your mind what's going to happen so you can make sense of things that *have* happened. At a point, I got worried, because I knew the end was near and I hoped it didn't have a bad ending to ruin a perfectly good movie. But oh, the end is great. By the end, you'll be throughly confused, or pleased if you think you've got it figured out. Don't see it alone; you're going to want people to talk about it with afterward. We think we've got it figured out. But not completely. I'd need to see it again in more detail, and it may even be helpful to view the movie *forwards*.There is the plot at hand, and there is the pervasive meditation on the nature of memory. Memories change. What is real? Truth, lies, all blend into one.Part of the movie does move forward, though, in scenes intercut between the reverse vignettes. It's brilliant, really, having Leonard telling his story to someone on the phone, conveniently telling us as well, so we are educated about his condition and what he's done about it.Notably, the story is told backwards. Much has been made of the fact that a *Seinfeld* episode did it, and so did Harold Pinter's *Betrayal*, and I'm sure others as well, but here there is a very damn good reason for it. By watching the events in reverse, *we* are in Leonard's shoes. We feel the same disorientation, the same confusion. He can't remember what he's done, and we can't see the next few minutes of the reel. This leads to some absolutely hilarious jokes, as well as some cleverly ironic twists.Teddy (Joe Pantaliano of *Matrix* fame) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss, also of *Matrix* fame), apparently. There are very few characters in the film, but the few there are are very important.*Memento* is about Leonard Shelby (played beautifully by Guy Pearce, of *L.A. Confidential* fame), a man who is trying to find the man that raped and murdered his wife. There's just one problem: trying to stop it, he took a blow to the head, and now he has a unique amnesia where he cannot for new memories. He can remember everything before the incident, but every fifteen minutes, his short-term memory is wiped clean. He must take pictures, leave himself notes, give himself tattoos.

Put it this way, my kids had to wait until 9 o'clock at night to eat dinner because I refused to get up from this flick :^)  By the time the last half hour of the movie was wrapping up I was literally glued to my seat.  Bathroom breaks be damned, I cannot remember the last time my jaw dropped at the end of a movie due to the fact that I had absolutely no idea what the end was going to be.  I loved it!!  I sat in stunned silence for a few minutes gleefully replaying the events of the movie in my mind.This definitely pushed past ""Pulp Fiction"" as my top ""I wanna see this over and over again"" movie.  ""Pulp Fiction"" is the only movie that I can even think of to ""compare"" to this movie and that's not even fair because ""Pulp Fiction"" was cool because it was a normally sequenced movie that was basically rearranged out of sequence just to f*ck with your head, and we loved it.  We know what's going on in ""PF"", it's just all scrambled up. Well ""Memento"" is out of sequence, totally backwards, because of Leonard Shelby's lack of short term memory.  We (and Leonard) have to relive each step of his life through the use of Polaroid pictures and the ever present Teddy (the wonderful Joe Pantoliano).  Guy Pearce (Leonard Shelby), who was superb in ""L.A. Confidential,"" could have just traipsed, befuddled, through his trek and made this a drag, but instead I was as anxious as he was to bring himself some closure.  This could have just been a run of the mill whodunit that relied on flashbacks.

Set aside two hours, unplug the phone, make sure all pets/kids/spouses are fed, extinguish all smoking materials, and prepare to be riveted.....and perhaps Christopher Nolan did this on purpose (and did it so well), the irony is, Leonard Shelby has to go over and over the same things, repeating himself, having information repeated to him, but I want to see this movie again, so does that mean that we are stuck in Leonard's endless loop of a life once we see this movie?

697,karthik-globalsoul,A momento if you understand memento,9,29 March 2008,"(Karthik Narayan) Before we start, note the spelling  its M-E-M-E-N-T-O and not MOMENTO, as I had thought! Now let's start this movie review: Imagine having a jigsaw puzzle in hand, and you don't have a clue what completes it. You don't have all the pieces required to finish it. There is no picture in your mind, and you are left to search for your answers. What do you do? To what sounds like a treasure hunt and a jigsaw puzzle combined, add a strong flavor of revenge and you get a masterly movie all set before your home screens! All you need to do is get the DVD and watch it. Maybe over and over again, like I have been doing The movie begins with the end and the end marks the beginning of the story (did I say that right?). Yes, that is how this movie unravels itself. The plot thickens as you move backwards (pun intended) and when all the pieces are slowly knitted together, the beginning (or is it the ending) is quite beautiful.The alternating between the Black/White and the color every ten minutes or so makes it all the more compelling to watch. And how do you watch this movie? Ideally it should be shown from back to front to understand.This isn't a murder mystery movie  its more of a thriller that takes so many twists and turns as you move towards the beginning (Oh no, not again. Somebody stop me) that you never get enough of watching it once.The movie doesn't end telling you what to make of it. You have to draw your own conclusions and decipher your own riddles. When the movie brilliantly closes with the credits, it leaves you wondering about reality and what you had been watching all along.As you still can't get over Guy Pearce's (the protagonist, Leonard) handsome looks, also note that he has a blank look on his face most of the time. That says it all  he looks helpless. You don't know how to react to his confused state of mind  you get stuck between 3 things  whether to slap him and bring him to shape; or feel pity for him hoping he would recover. The other thing that keeps us interested is how to crack the case. How would he find revenge, and how would he remember it? All confusions and the ""don't trust anybody"" funda psychologically affects us as well as we are left with no choice but to not trust what we see and hear of other characters.Christopher Nolan has directed the movie excellently, with an adapted screenplay based on the short story by Jonathan Nolan (are they related?), that keeps us all on the edge of our seats. This movie carries more mystery and as each piece falls in place.But the first half of the movie makes no sense at all; you really get things moving along only after the removal of the tattoos on Guy's body. Overall, this is not a movie which you will appreciate if you want to watch a fun movie. It needs your attention and you get engrossed in the thick of action.There are some scenes which could have been done away with, for example, the hotel scene where Pearce calls for an escort, but it all adds up to the confusion, so I am not to complain.Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie still carries her looks of Matrix, and though there isn't a meaty role in the movie for her, so she does well.Joe Pantoliano as Teddy steals most of the scenes with his corny jokes and at one point of time, you can't help loving his casual approach to the whole thing.The acting is brilliant, the settings and camera work are good. The music by David Julyan is racy and keeps the pulse ticking faster with every scene. I'm sure I would be hearing a lot of and from him.Simply for creativity and keeping the adrenaline and brain cells ticking all the time, this movie deserves great accolades. This is an all time classic that I would recommend to test your thought process. If I were to put up an all time list of best movies, this would definitely find its place in the top 25.

700,mattwilde123,Memento,10,6 March 2017,"'Memento' is director Christopher Nolan's tribute to classic film noir tales of revenge and mystery. By adding a new twist to traditional conventions, Nolan is able to consume and grip the viewer throughout the entire film and for years after. The aspect that differentiates this neo-noir from its competitors today is its jumbled and complex narrative which continually moves backwards in time. The viewers first see the main character complete his revenge murder (a triumphant scene we usually associate with the ending of film noirs). We then begin to see events unfold backwards and the reason for this becomes clear.Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) and his wife are attacked in their home. His wife is murdered but Guy Pearce is left with a brain condition that disables him from creating anymore short-term memory. Constantly being reminded of the horror of the situation, he is relentlessly spurred on to get his revenge on his wife's killer. As the viewer progresses through the film, they begin to feel more and more like Lenny. The audience have no idea of what has happened prior to the scene currently showing and so we are left feeling the same confusion as our protagonist. To cope with his condition, he maintains a system of notes, photographs, and tattoos to record information about himself and others, including his wife's killer. He is aided in his investigation by ""Teddy"" (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), neither of whom he can really trust (both of the latter actors starred together in 'The Matrix (1999)' in which Pantoliano was not to be trusted, disorientating the informed viewer more).The film's events unfold in two separate, alternating narratives—one in colour, and the other in black and white. Leonard's investigation is depicted in five-minute colour sequences that are in reverse chronological order, however, the short black and white scenes are shown in chronological order and show Leonard on the phone to a mysterious stranger having a conversation that the viewers cannot understand (these sequences are more direct references to the film noir genre that Christopher Nolan is embracing). This style of directing makes the audience completely empathise with Leonard's situation as you never know more than he does, but also it creates huge comedic and emotional moments which rely heavily on the notion of dramatic irony.With Nolan's use of hand-held camera work, an overtone of pink colouring, and sharp editing (the only transition effects in use are occasional fade outs) the viewer is made to feel disorientated and is therefore able to empathise more with Leonard's character. The original idea was a short story by Nolan's brother, Jonathan who also helped with the screenplay. The dialogue in the film is its best feature with its insightful, powerful and heart-wrenching speeches about the nature of memory. As we learn how we rely upon memory for our sense of reality, we begin to question reality itself. The idea of faith and constant references to the bible can make the entire film a metaphor for people's faith in Christianity or any other religion at that.",Memento

The people who made this film created a challenging and very entertaining movie, and it put my brain through its paces.Although the acting is good across the board, and you have to think hard, which is reassuring in the face of all the audience-spoonfeeding that's out there, I can't help but feel that played forwards it's a run of the mill story that happens to have a twist if you watch it backwards. If they'd worked on it a little more so that the reverse-viewing was a complement to the film rather than the main selling point, this would have been a masterpiece.I know it's trendy to leave questions unanswered in films these days, but there are some details that remain heavy-handedly glossed over (who the hell IS Dodd?) and others that make little sense no matter how much you replay the film forwards in your head.However, I got the impression that the people who made this film, from the writer through to the editors, were content to rest on the laurels that their novelty-factor gave them, and worked an OK film onto the backwards presentation framework rather than a great one.This film was indeed an interesting one, borrowing the narrative technique of reverse presentation pioneered by Pinter and giving it some good old turn-of-the-millennium grit.There are no spoilers in this review.",Memento
707,Nedla24,incredibly disappointing,6,5 October 2001,"This movie is so wonderful conceptually that I almost feel bad about writing a bad revue of it.  The backwards timeline to reveal memories is a very interesting idea, and throughout most of the movie it is handled beautifully.  Also the plot twists are all sharp and interesting, save the end twist which destroys any chance for catharsis on the audience's part. 
But more than the ending of this movie bothered me.  Guy Pearce is a horrid horrid actor.  He is able to look brooding and that's about it.  Perhaps with a more skilled actor (Edward Norton would have been perfect) this movie might have actually achieved some emotional power.  But Pearce is only capable of looking brooding and cold.  He brings no emotional depth, which is why the ending didn't work because ultimately the audience doesn't care about his character.  Also the writing takes a turn for the worse around the middle of the movie.  The prime example of this is Guy Pearce's incredibly trite ""the bed is cold"" speech which begins with boring sensory detail and delves into painfully bad rhetorical questions.  Ultimately, this movie fails to bring a payoff to the audience.  It starts off as a beautiful film noir that melts into your mouth like a piece of dark chocolate.  but the bitter aftertaste will get you.",Memento

While this is clearly what makes it such an important movie, nearly every other aspect of the film makes it one of the best films I have ever seen. The acting, especially from Guy Pierce, is phenomenal. You feel for the characters even when you don't know much about them, mainly because they don't know much about themselves. From the opening sequence, the movie hooks you in and never lets go. The story moves along quickly, and keeps you guessing from beginning to end. There is suspense, drama, violence, and even some comedy. But the thing that holds this film together is Christopher Nolan's precise direction, which keeps the viewer intrigued but unable to look away.

714,brendanmcc02,Impressive Feature from Nolan,9,12 September 2020,"When a world has incredible detail, we are often enraptured because it (in some cases) closely resembles our reality.The opposite is the case in Memento; we are dropped into scenes with no prior context. This is a result of the reverse-narrative structure, so as an audience we know the outcome of the scene but not the process, or even how the events came to fruition.I really appreciated this decision by Nolan, because it doesn't just allow the audience to sympathise - or even empathise with the protagonist, it literally places them in the protagonists head. This is an extremely difficult task for someone with short-term memory, and Nolan achieves this effectively, at least in my opinion.But what's most interesting is how Nolan maintains his audience's interest in the film. He does this by having the audience consistently asking questions - one of the common ones being: how did he get here? This sense of mystery propels the film forward (or should I say backward?), maintaing the audience's valuable attention.One of the many results of a reserve-narrative structure is that it results in an incredibly subjective experience. Nolan utilises the film's subjectivity, to help convey his ideas. One idea showcased is the futility of Leonard's actions: if he doesn't remember what he's done, what's the point of, well, doing anything? Leonard is, albeit briefly, challenged by this argument; however he counters this by realising that his actions will have an impact on an objective reality - a reality that transcends the boundaries set by his condition.While I was impressed by Nolan's utilisation of subjectivity as a method for conveying ideas, I did feel that it could've been done more effectively. For example: it would've been fascinating to see the film step fully out of Leonard's head and to show the objective consequences of his actions. This would've greatly furthered the idea that Nolan was trying to convey, that being: Leonard's actions have consequences for others, even if he doesn't remember them.Despite the slight flaws in its expression of ideas, Memento is still a profound experience. The fact that the film is compelling with a reverse-narrative structure, and to also employ that narrative structure to convey ideas is truly an incredible cinematic achievement.",Memento
715,JasonL,another puzzle-movie,8,15 May 2003,"This movie is exactly like a puzzle. It is narrated section by section, but the time order of the sections are reversed, so you know the last thing first, and the first thing last. You keep wondering what the hell has happened. Technically it is great. It is like an experiment. In the beginning there is a section shown reversed, you may ask what if the whole movie shown reversed, then the movie answers the question itself.Guy Pearce (LA Confidential) played a guy who has no short-term memory (forget things after several minutes). Carrie-Ann Moss (Trinity of The Matrix) played a bitch. Both give very strong performance.
The movie has some philosophical implications about human nature. It has some common points with Dark City, The Usual Suspects, Rosamon, Waking Life, eXistenZ, The Matrix and Vanilla Sky, which all blend reality with non-reality and are all concerned with the question ""what is real"" or ""what makes a person a person"".Without memory we are not the person we were.Guy Pearce sets up objects for himself, otherwise he loses meaning of life.

716,monty-57,So What?!? The Characters are Pure Cardboard,1,21 November 2001,"I saw this film after hearing all the hype while on my last trip back to the States. It turns out that it's much ado about nothing. I was not impressed. In fact, I was almost depressed that something so evidently sub-par was being touted as nothing short of a revelation.So what if the film has an unusual non-linear narrative structure??? So what if it's stylish, hip and has great cinematography? I don't care for the characters one bit! They're pure cardboard, impossible to relate to, sketchy at best - even Guy Pearce's character. They exist solely as pegs for a context which is not all that interesting in and of itself - in fact, it's downright pedestrian. A guy's wife is raped and killed and he goes after the killer when he wakes up - how many times has that one been used? The whole thing is contrived and stinks of an exercise - it's just soulless mental masturbation, and anyone getting off on it is really selling themselves short! Even the much-talked about backwards narrative structure isn't all that new. It's been done before in a film by David Hugh Jones called BETRAYAL, with Jeremy Irons, Patricia Hodge and Ben Kingsley. Even though the story is quite different from this film, BETRAYAL has everything this film lacks - strong characterizations and people that you actually care about. In BETRAYAL, you anxiously await the next flashback because you are genuinely concerned about the characters' fate. MEMENTO, with each flashback, just gets more and more annoying. It WAS slightly intriguing to see Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss (refugees from THE MATRIX) in this together, as it is another play on ""What is really real?"" but this is hardly a benefit. However, I don't blame the actors one bit - they were just not given much to work with.Incidentally, Guy Pearce IS someone to watch. It'd be interesting to see him and Brad Pitt together in a film - they'd be very believable as brothers.",Memento
717,LoveCoates,"Not so much a movie as an intellectual display...Films should be made for audiences, not for filmmakers",1,16 December 2001,"Sigh.Let me first point out the tremendous amount of good in this film.First, Christopher Nolan and young filmmakers like him are to be commended and supported for stretching cinematic conventions and taking chances with the medium. Memento is certainly an important film, a very innovative move from the older flashback structure that has gotten to be somewhat overused. What a refreshing directorial debut, to the point that I think it rivals Orson Welles's famous directorial debut. Kudos to Chris Nolan!Also, there is Guy Pearce. He is outstanding in what must have been an extremely challenging role, and I cannot praise him enough. He succeeds in making us feel sympathetic for a character we never really understand, and that is indeed difficult. To me, this performance is head and shoulders above most if not all lead male performances of the same year.Skip the bad, onto the ugly.Some have tried to give the rest of this film the benefit of the doubt. I cannot. This is another one of those annoying intellectual-exercises-disguised-as-motion-picture a la American Beauty whose popularity I can only ascribe to their sheer complexity. The latter tried to use a complex theme to pass for worth; this one tries a complex structure.Unfortunately, the foundation of a good movie will always be a good, cogent story with strong, well-developed characters (at least in my opinion). Memento has neither. Told forwards, the plot (or non-plot) would be mediocre, even boring. As it is, told backwards, it just makes no sense. I'm not sure it would make sense told regularly. Inventiveness is great, but it is not enough to make a film one of the greatest films of all time (ahem, Citizen Kane). I would put Memento up there with Kane as one of the greatest DIRECTORIAL EFFORTS of all time. But simply put, great direction alone does not equal great film. There are also such things as writing and character, which have been lost in the age of the auteur.I cannot be the first to have noticed the plot's crucial non-sequitor. If the main character couldn't remember anything after the incident, he wouldn't be able to remember that he has a memory problem. However, he constantly tells people this, and it proves to be of central importance to the plot (which is full of other holes). He also has nothing that he would see every morning to remind him. I understand that in real life, this condition does allow you to remember some things, but the film makes it clear that the main character remembers nothing. I'm not merely picking at the film, for this plot hole actually is the plot. And I'm not quite sure how Chris Nolan or anybody involved with the film managed to miss it. Maybe they didn't care? That's likely, because this film does center more around slick direction than great writing.There is a saying that applies: to break the rules, you need to know them. This movie could have been brilliant if Christopher Nolan had taken the time to write a wonderful movie in real time. THEN, had he decided to tell it backwards, the effect, if done right, would have been awesome. However, I left this film just as confused as I was throughout. Even the endless speech at the end that was (I think?) supposed to tie everything up did not help, not to mention the fact that the ""long explanation by an authority"" is a trite, amateur denouement to begin with. It hasn't really worked since Psycho -- which, lord have mercy, is apparently a lesser film than Memento according to IMDB voters -- since the Psycho ending speech was merely tying up loose ends that the audience already knew rather than rewriting the film in seconds like this one does.Frankly, I'm sick of movies that cater either to the box office (Titanic, Gladiator), or critics (American Beauty & now Memento), and somehow end up being branded as great. Movies should be watchable and entertaining, not simply there to win awards so that film nerds can pat each other on the back congratulating their brilliance.If you want writing, character, plot, direction AND complexity, see The Shawshank Redemption or All About Eve. Memento is not the movie for you, and so far its the most overrated movie of the century.",Memento
718,famsmith,The Convenience of Memory Loss.,9,17 September 2001,"Typically I choose not to comment on the story and instead focus on the craft of a film.  However, in Memeneto the essence, the distinctiveness, the brilliance, the virtue is in the story itself.  This is the first film in quite some time that I can honestly say I enjoyed purely for the sake of the story- the film itself.  The film has a real starkness to it making the noir comparison obvious, inevitable and quickly a cliche.  The device used in this film is not as straightforward as most people have initially described and it is certainly not a gimmick.  When I think of gimmicks I think of filmic devices, techniques, or methods that are employed only to befuddle the audience and to show off the filmmaker's ability. Therefore this film's device is not gimmicky, the story would be just as interesting without the device.  Of course as some people have already observed this film is not only an implausible one, but an imperfect one, but surely we have made bigger concessions for films in the past.  At the heart of the story is the main character Lenny and his inability to as he puts it to make any new memories. This problem though often comical proves to be simultaneously Lenny's tragedy (making Lenny a very ironic character).  Along with the chaos of a daily life in which he can not remember anything longer than several minutes Lenny is determined to exact his revenge by bringing his wife's killer/rapist because as he puts his inability to remember the act is irrelevant because his wife deserves justice.  Caught up in Lenny's world or perhaps Lenny in theirs are several different characters.  The motel worker that feels sympathy for Lenny, but not enough to keep him from charging him for an extra room because as he puts it business is slow and Lenny won't remember anyway.  The bartender (Natalie) who is caught up in a drug racket and is as quick to use Lenny and mock him as she is to help him.  Their is a particularly frustrating scene which illustrates this, in which Lenny is trying to find a pen so he can remember what she has said.  And of course Teddy who more than anyone pops in and out of Lenny's life.  Unfortunately Teddy is as close to a friend as Lenny gets to have in this story.  A truly interesting aspect of the story is the even more fragmented phone conversations Lenny has in which he reveals Sammy Jankus, a character who Lenny investigated who suffered from almost exactly the same condition Lenny does the only difference is he could not condition his instincts (according to himself Lenny can). As the story of Sammy unfolds we see a subplot that is as intriguing as anyone I can remember in recent film and as integral to understanding Lenny as Freud thinks our dreams are to understanding ourselves.  Unlocking the mystery of Sammy and why it is so important for Lenny to remember him sheds light on the whole situation.  In what is without a doubt the most important scene in understanding Sammy in the film and subsequently understanding Lenny we see that Sammy of course without being aware of it kills his wife as she reminds him at least three times over that she needs her insulin shot and as a result of the failed test she goes into a coma and dies.  So in understanding this scene we fully realize Sammy's problem.  Sammy who ends up in a mental institution and doesn't even realize that his wife is dead, loved his wife very much, but is incapable of saving her because of his mental infirmity.  Lenny's problem is the same, but reversed. Lenny loved his wife very much, but was incapable of saving her and as a result he develops almost the exact same infirmity as Sammy.  Whether Lenny's brain damage is a result of physical trauma (the blow to the head) or the psychological trauma of not being able to deal with the tragedy is arbitrary the condition remains the same.  Still at this point we have yet to fully realize the significance of the connection between Sammy and Lenny.  The connection is fully illuminated for us at the end if we are only paying close enough attention.  When Lenny goes to meet John G. or rather Jimmy Grantz (who Teddy has set up for a fall) Lenny asks, ""You Jimmy Grantz?""  Jimmy dryly replies, ""You expectin any other Jimmies out here memory man? (An obvious reference to Lenny's condition, but the only one in their conversation.)  After Lenny has done away with Jimmy he begins to feel guilty and thinks that perhaps he has killed the wrong man.  And here is the kicker he makes a statement that essentially says that he (Jimmy) knew about Sammy, how did he know about Sammy?  He even brings it up to Teddy when he arrives on the scene, but the fact is Jimmy never said anything to Lenny about Sammy or Sammy's condition, the only reference he made was to Lenny's condition. Sammy regardless of whether he is real or not is Lenny's alter ego, a personality that he has constructed and conditioned himself to remember so that he can deal with the situation.  The dream about Sammy's inability to save his wife when she puts him to the test is really a dream about Lenny's own guilt.  As Teddy points out later it is quite irrelevant whether Lenny's wife was a diabetic or not although she may have been.  The important points are (Most of which Teddy makes to Lenny) he doesn't know who he is only who he was, that Sammy in his condition will never be able to reconcile the guilt he feels over his wife's death, and that Lenny's memory while failing him in the short term has permanently failed him, in the long term it has shielded him- for what is there for Lenny to do once he has exacted revenge and brought this animal who killed his wife to justice?  Tragically and perversely what Lenny has conditioned himself to is revenge.  Revenge is what gives his life meaning, hope, purpose.  The revenge is never as sweet as he imagines and Lenny goes on conditioning and even manipulating his own mind so that he may remember those things he wishes to and forget those which he does not want to remember.  Never is this more obvious or conscious than at the end when Lenny's latent desire fully manifests itself.  In this final scene not only has he become aware of what he has been doing, not only has he accepted it, but he in fact rather enjoys it.  Why else would he choose to completely ignore it?  A man that truly wants to solve his wife's murder- to bring her killer to justice doesn't choose to completely rule out the possibility that he may have already done so, and at least makes a note of it so he can seriously investigate. Lenny if he really wanted to bring the killer to justice and resolve the situation would have raised those questions in a way that made sense and sought to answer them.  Lenny wants to be the searcher, the mourner, the vengeful husband he likes playing that role and telling those stories, it is only this that could fulfill him. Teddy says towards the end (at which point in filmic time he is still alive although in our memories if they have served us correctly tell us he is a dead man.) says, ""Lenny you're not a killer that's why you're so good at it.""  Don't be fooled.  Remember he wanted to forget.  Does Lenny truly feel guilty later?  Sure, but rather conveniently he can't remember why.",Memento
719,kaos-23,"Outstanding, gripping, compelling, thought-provoking",10,6 November 2004,"This is a fascinating film that really lives up to the hype. It raises all sorts of questions about personal identity, memory, guilt, truth, and time: for example, if you commit a murder but do not remember committing it, are you still guilty? What does it mean to be 'the same person' that you were last week, or last year? Memento implicitly raises these questions, in a subtle way, without being heavy-handed in the way that the Matrix is, for example. The real genius of this film is that, while it raises all these issues and is genuinely thought-provoking, it manages at the same time to be a truly entertaining, tense, and compelling thriller.The story revolves around Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) who, after a blow to the head, suffers from a neurological condition which means he cannot form new memories. He can only remember things for a few seconds, and then they fade away. This means he has to write himself notes, take Polaroids, and even tattoo himself to try and form some kind of continuity in his life. He has no idea who to trust, where he lives, or even where he was five minutes ago. All of this complicates Leonard's quest in life, which is to find the man who raped and murdered his wife, (and caused his own condition) and take his revenge.This is a genuine neurological disorder which I had read about in a piece by Dr Oliver Sacks called 'The Lost Mariner', and I was fascinated when i heard there was a film dealing with the subject. I didn't think it would be possible to really depict this condition in a film, so I was amazed by the skill of the director, Christopher Nolan, who really makes you appreciate the tragic and horrific quality of this condition.It is a stroke of genius on Nolan's part that the film itself runs backwards. Or rather, while each moment of the film runs forwards, we see Leonard's life in a series of small chunks lasting a few minutes, which we see in reversed chronological order. This is an incredible use of film to make you understand the sort of endlessly unknown, frightening world that Leonard lives in. It means the viewer has to make that little bit more effort to understand what is going on, it demands a bit of intelligence and attention. Unlike most Hollywood films, it's not a simple progression from mystery, to disorder, to the solution. It's more complex than that. When someone comes in and speaks to Leonard, we are in a position like his - we don't know if he has met them before, if they are friend or foe, whether or not they are telling him the truth. The pace, direction, script, and acting are all outstanding. All three of the leads (Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano) give excellent, gripping performances. I was impressed that the female lead, Natalie (Moss) is not just used as eye-candy or objectified, but is a fully developed and intriguing character (all too rare in Hollywood films). The cinematography is gorgeous, with great use of colour and light to create atmosphere. The music too adds to the tense and gripping nature of this film.In short, this is one of the best films that I've ever seen, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys films that are a bit different.",Memento
720,fepp,Brilliant movie told in a brilliant manner,8,8 September 2001,"First, about the movie: the way it is told, backwards, is a perfect way to get people drawn into Leonard's condition.  You have the same sense as he does of there being no past, just the future.  Brilliant techinique, creating a movie that you have to think about.  More of this stuff and less standard Hollywood-style braindead entertainment, pleaaase!
******** PLOT SPOILER ********Me and my girlfriend were kind of miffed at first, since we thought the ending just left things hanging... but when you think about it, it actually makes perfect sense.  Our interpretation is that:Sammy Jenkins did exist, and he did kill his wife. Leonard's condition is real. The reason he knows he has his condition is the tattoo of ""remember Sammy Jenkins"" on his hand. Always, when he wakes up, he is utterly disoriented.He did kill the man who killed his wife, maybe a year ago.  Teddy helped him do it, probably. Since then, Teddy has been using Leonard as a killing machine, getting rid of people for him.To give meaning to his life, Leonard refuses to keep the proof that he killed his wife's murderer.  With that mission accomplished, he has nothing to live for, and that is too painful.  So he keep inventing new clues, moving to new cities, and looking for new John Gs to kill.
If you think about it, why does he just jot down Teddy license plate and get it tattooed on him, instead of just writing ""kill him"" on the back of Teddy's photo?  This way, he ensures that he has something to keep him occupied for the next week or so, as he tracks down Teddy.  Probably, he has lived his entire life since the condition began ín this fashion.
He has a routine that is used to keep him going, and that routine rests on hunting for the man who murdered his wife.  So he needs to keep that hunt going on. In a way, the movie is about the old question of what keeps a man motivated to stay alive and keep going. When you have no memory to live for, you have to live for tomorrow. And then you need some ultimate goal which cannot be achieved, since once you achieve it, life will be over.  It is a very interesting look at the human condition!Actually, considering other interpretations that say that Leonard and Sammy Jenkins is the same man, that he killed his own wife, and that his condition was mental, does not really matter.  In a way, what came before his memory loss is of no importance to the current situation.  Look at the movie as a study of a strange mental condition, and you can enjoy it, regardless of the ultimate interpretation of what is going on. After all, the memories are not important, right?",Memento

I don't see how anyone could pull off this type of ""pacing"" any better than Momento, the problem is I don't see how the pacing of this story can be good either. It's not the fault of anyone involved, I just couldn't stand constantly receiving the same information over and over. I already know this, I don't care that the main character does not. It could not have been put together any better than it was, but it just kept frustrating me over and over.

730,maxigarciasoto,Memento - Movie review,10,25 July 2017,"This movie is a masterpiece and it's one of my favorites of all time. First, this film was directed by Christopher Nolan who is my favorite director, this guy is excellent at his job so when i was going to watch Memento, i was very excited to see what he could do with this film.This movie is about Leonard Shelby who is a person that is trying to solve a crime involving his wife but he has this condition that makes him forget things very quickly so he has write all the puzzle pieces of this crime somewhere to solve it. In the opening scene of Memento you are instantly into the film and makes you have this feeling of mystery and you ask yourself to many questions even before the movie really starts. The one thing that makes Memento so great and different from other films is the structure that this film has, which Nolan nailed perfectly. Christopher Nolan directs this film so well that the structure it self makes you have Leonard's condition, because you are trying to put all the pieces together, but has the movie goes, you forget things that happened before, and that's why you can't see this movie once.Every time that you watch this movie you find something new, and it's really great.Do i have to talk about the performances here? My god, Guy Pearce was so good in this film. The fact that this character it's so real, you don't even noticed that he is acting. One actress that also was great in this movie was Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, i think that it's one of her best performances.All this along with the amazing editing, the script, the performances by all the actors, the directing, and the rest of the work that was done by really talented people. Makes Memento one the best movies ever made.",Memento

733,eliaaminii,A PERFECT Myth,10,22 December 2020,"Memento, masterfully executed by Christopher Nolan, is kind of a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat from the beginning to the very end of it. It's a rarity with films nowadays to work mystery into their plot and yet steel, be engaging.The story centers around Leonardo Shelby who has lost his ability of making new memories through his trials for saving his wife. The plot depicts how he does his best to take his wife's revenge BUT nothing seems as simple as they are. The most phenomenal thing about the movie was the way it was narrated. Seldom do we have movies to narrate a story backwards as well done as memento; and its all thanked to the Nolan's skillful direction.Now getting to the characters, being amazingly well written and given great backstories, their greatness would not reach their demands if it wasn't for the performances of the cast, who were all perfection. Guy Pearce's portrayal of a ill-minded character stands out as one of the best performances contributed to a myth story. Needless to mention Carrie-Anne Moss who gives an equally mysterious and complicated performance.Speaking of the technical points, it was all well-set, especially its skillfully set cinematography, which contributes a great deal to its audience in descending them along its mysterious and unreliable world. The score was satisfying too, especially regarding its main theme. From the very first point of the movie, the emotions that the main theme expresses, makes its viewers aware of the sadness and confusions ahead of them.Plainly put, such a exciting myth it is with solid performances that overall, doesn't give a sec to blink as fast-paces as it is. Surely a must see.",Memento
734,bruno-51,"Brilliant story & editing, falters slightly toward end",8,7 April 2001,"I'm one of those people who don't mind a little extra length if the movie I'm watching is worth my time.  Memento is definitely worth your time!  It's gripping, it's a wonderful story, edited exquisitely.  The use of continually working backwards in time, ending each sequence where the previous began, is brilliant.  I'm sure I'm not the first to mention Hitchcock, but I'm sure he would applaud this film were he around.  In terms of concept, this is better than anything else we've seen in years (yes, even The Usual Suspects).Where I would not have minded a little extra time spent is at the ending. The filmmakers use the reveal process in a very innovative fashion for the entire film, then wrap it up with a bunch of exposition.  What a letdown!  I could feel our entire audience deflate when Teddy begins his big explanation, and Leonard follows shortly after with his.  I really would have appreciated being SHOWN Leonard's history, instead of being told (why I watch a film as opposed to reading a book).  This is where The Usual Suspects was better:  the ending.  In that movie, the exposition is a feint.(As my wife pointed out, what makes the exposition at the end particularly disappointing is that it comes from Teddy, who we're not sure we can trust anyways.  For those of us jaded enough to realize that we're in an expository moment, we just take the explanation at face value with a sigh or a groan.  But for some folks, my lovely wife included, she was wrapped up enough in Leonard's story to still mistrust Teddy's explanation.  Thus, she and others end up going ""Hey, wait a minute, you mean NOW he's honest?!"")Still, a lot - a LOT - to commend.  8/10",Memento

This film is one true example, along with Requiem for a Dream and Crouching Tiger, that the oscars aren't a good meter of how good a film truly is.  Memento totally blows Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring out of the water.  The story possesses a great concept; how would you exact revenge on your wife's killer if you could only remember in 15 minute lapses?

As one of the few movies that has ever kept me guessing until the end it is one of those rare movies where once the novelty of the surprise ending has worn off, you can still watch it again.  The Game starring Michael Douglas has a great ending but after viewing the picture once, is the thrill still the same?

738,tyguy-2,"complex, sometimes confusing, and worth repeat viewings",8,15 August 2002,"This movie has received rave reviews and falls into the same category as your Usual Suspects and to a lesser degree, Pulp Fiction.  The story is told in reverse fashion, like the Seinfeld episode a few years back when they went to India to see Elaine's friend get married and George didn't want to take his boots off and Kramer was hexed.  Anyway, the story involves a dude who has some sort of long term memory loss and can only remember things with Polaroid photos and notes that he's tatooed onto himself.  Like the Usual Suspects, we get swallowed up in the mystery, but here we are not so much wondering 'whodunit' as 'what is going on here.'  This works for 75% of the movie, but there are bits in the middle and the ending especially drag it down a notch.  I loved watching it, but at the end felt cheated.  Maybe it merits another look-see as I certainly got confused while watching it.  This is a good movie, but it's not one that you'll be raving about for years on end like Pulp Fiction. It lacks the style and snappy dialogue of that movie. Memento as a whole is very entertaining and one of the better movies you will find, but not quite 'great'.",Memento
739,gautammayya,Nolan at his best!! It's like solving a puzzle along with the main character,8,22 October 2020,"Nolan's second movie about a man seeking revenge for the murder of his wife, truly put the director on the map as an exciting prospect for the future and he has lived up to it. Obviously, the biggest selling point of the movie was the unique storytelling in the sense that the story revealed itself backward. This allowed us to truly be in the mind of Lenard (Guy Pearce) who is an amnesiac who can't form new memories apparently since the death of his wife. We are along with him in the search of what happened in the past. In the process we see all the people taking advantage of him in his pursuit.
There are a lot of things I liked in the movie. Guy Pearce is excellent embodying an amnesiac man who has absolutely no idea what is going on. The rest of the cast doesn't have a lot to do but are serviceable enough. The best thing was the editing. Even though there are two narratives, one told forward and one in reverse, you understand it clearly. Although at the start you feel confused about what's going on, you will get used to it. The flashbacks establish what happened without being distracting. The greatest strength of the movie is the ability in keeping you intrigued and interested. Due to the premise, it feels more of a puzzle that we are solving along with the main character.
Even then, there are stuff which I didn't like. I think the story doesn't allow the main character to be something more than just a tool to move it forward. Nolan and Guy Pearce don't add anything to make the lead more interesting for us to care about. The side characters are forgettable as well. They don't have definitive traits to make them full rounded characters.
Still, I do think it is a wonderful movie which is entertaining and tells us about revenge and violence and how it blinds people to the mistakes they are making. We distort our memory to suit us coming on the right side of things. We try to twist a fact in our favor so that we can do certain things that we want to do.
Watching Nolan's older movies (i.e pre The Dark Knight/Inception) really makes me wish he does those more regularly. Following the success of The Dark Knight and Inception he has chosen to do more of his big Blockbusters with more spectacle and complex plots but falling short on character and humanistic themes. Memento is a true reminder that Nolan isn't someone who can't make good movies about humanistic themes. It is actually his funniest movie (TDK is darkly funny) and has complex relationships between characters.
Highly recommend even for someone who isn't a Nolan fan. A true masterpiece and Nolan's second best film (after TDK). A 9/10",Memento
740,Mighty_sheman,Mediocrity Gone Mad! Yet another cynical and senseless byproduct of this wonderful era of cinema.,4,3 June 2005,"*Tiny unspoilers within*No, it's not a dig aimed at the formerly great MGM, I talk of Memento. Intelligent film making? Perhaps. An intelligent film? I think not! In this post Tarantino age of cinema this is what passes for a masterpiece, god help us! It was Tarantino's Pulp Fiction that sparked this brave new age of cinema we are currently suffering, the age of mediocre is the new good. It is so fitting that the so called benchmark for film making in the 21st century should be the personification of style over substance. In fact there is hardly anything worth extracting from this self congratulatory thriller other than the over stylized imagery and technical wizardry on show. This film is stone cold, a lifeless film made purely for your aesthetic pleasure.The premise for the film IS intriguing, the director provided himself remarkable scope in which to create a fantastically gripping thriller by virtue of the protagonist's 'condition' combined with a muddled take on the old reverse narrative. This allowed him the chance to chop up the plot and deliver the punch line from each segment first then show us the events leading up to that point. This is fascinating the first couple of times, but by the 4th I was thinking ""wow, that's getting old fast"" by the 8th time I just wanted the punishment to stop. The narrative device is purely and simply a clever gimmick, and one that is clearly wasted on such a banal story. The argument has been used that the connect the dots narrative structure is the only thing that makes it intriguing. Heck, so what? It is possible to take a half decent plot and spin gold from straw with the right narrative structure. Not here though, even told in reverse it had no worth in my eyes because the plot is beyond redemption. A thriller should be thrilling, this film is snail paced and instead of being intriguing the narrative structure quickly begins to resemble someone desperately trying to draw blood from a stone, futile. Further more a thriller or drama should have interesting characters and a bit of intrigue. The plot was not captivating, the situation was not captivating, the characters were not captivating and I did not care about them, especially not Lenny and his questionable motives.There is not one good character in this film, not surprising since the actors don't have any challenging dialog to work with. Also they look like they were sleepwalking through filming, only Pantoliano attempts to bring anything resembling life to this turkey. I can almost forgive Pearce as he is playing a vengeful, obsessive psycho, and he has no short term memory so he might well have zero personality or emotion for good reason. However Moss' character is simply a horrible film noir cliché, the femme fetale, and she performs the role with no style whatsoever, perhaps because she has little work with. All she is required to do is look moody and menacing and be a bitch. Please, can nobody come up with good characters these days? The effect is not good at all, I felt these characters and the swiss cheese style excuse for a thriller/drama were spat out as the appendix for a Nolan master class in technical magic and whiz bang editing. The cast are rendered pointless by a senseless plot that only exists to be manipulated and rearranged to display the fact you can take a terrible story, mix it up beyond recognition and somehow disguise it as some sort of epiphany, a la Pulp Fiction.Then the ending (sorry beginning?) was just the icing on this grotesquely elaborate cake, I don't want to totally spoil it for those who have not seen it as the surprise of having your head deflated in disappointment is one not to be spoiled. It's suffice to say the preceding events were rendered even more senseless by the anticlimactic conclusion, I had not seen an ending this whiffy since Fight Club (later bettered by Mulholland Drive). I was left apathetic and cold by the conclusion to this 'riddle' that seemingly offered two possibilities, neither of which would validate the rest of the miserable excuse for a film. Why? Because I didn't care! Memento (and it's message) is like ouroboros in the most literal sense - circular, self contained, endless and ultimately pointless. Forgive my apparent artistic blindness, I DO appreciate creativity and inventiveness, my message to Mr Nolan and his peers would be ""please use it to INVENT a decent story!"" In reflection, perhaps the most annoying thing isn't that Memento is so mediocre in every way, it's the fact that it has been so widely regarded as a great film, much like the two putrid films that it rooted from - Fight Club and Pulp Fiction. I don't know, my friends say I am a cynic and the harshest of harsh critics, well I simply say I am just reflecting on a harsh and cynical world that thrives on misery and depression like they are going out of fashion. With the rapid development of special effects, filming equipment and creativity in cinema it's easy to look back on the 'golden eras' of cinema and chuckle at the technical integrity and naive world view of some of the oldies. However it almost makes me want to shed a tear that cinema has come such a long way technically but sadly seems to have lost the values that used to be at it's heart. Films used to tell stories, they used to have REAL characters and had soul and substance. Now I look at the 'classics' of todays material world - films like Pulp Fiction, Memento, American Beauty and Fight Club and I see nothing but hate, cynicism, sharp emotionless dialog, 2 dimensional characters and most importantly style over everything else, a sad but accurate reflection of the age we live in?

He is man with a memory that gets erased in seconds, and all he is left with is his old memory. Therefore, his dilemma is clear, The last things he always remember is the raping and killing of his wife. His is faced with that, due to a case of absence of short-term memory. How can such a person with enormous rage and little ruse face his life?He tries greatly, but does he succeed? I will not give it away. You will live with him his case ( The movie starts from the end, and you have no idea what happened before, same as Leonard ). This is one beauty of this movie, because its totally unpredictable. There are many twists to keep you eyebrows raised! Leonard is taking control, just follow him. You will learn on the way everything about his Tattoos & Polaroid's. You will be amazed with how good the script is. The script is the star here. Very original, and very twisted. Now this can be a problem. Quite honestly, Its not easy to make sense of the ending, you might be left confused. I wasn't, I made a conclusion that made sense to me and I told myself: This is it. Then minutes after that, I thought again, and I realized: Well maybe this is the ongoing creativity about this movie, it continues to surprise you even after its finished. So maybe the ending was planned not to make sense!The music is something I really liked about this movie. The tune that kept repeating did add another dimension and was quite brilliant.

I am watching movies from Hollywood and other movie industries since my childhood but much less than Bollywood movies but in last 2 3 years my love towards movies from Hollywood and other movie industries just skyrocketed and I now watch lots of movies from Hollywood and other movie industries and very few Bollywood movies.In that process I saw many movies that Bollywood copied from other movie industries and Memento is one of them.Unless you consider adding songs and additional Bollywood garbage big difference, Ghajini is a copy of Memento. Creators of Ghajini added some additional scenes so they can say that their movie is not a copy, those scenes include typical boring Bollywood love scenes and some totally unnecessary comedy scenes. I used the word 'copy' rather than 'remake' because the creators of Ghajini never admit that their movie is a remake of Memento, they always said that their movie is a remake of another Indian movie which is also a copy of Memento but this would be an act of stupidity to believe that they are not lying and they don't know about the existence of Memento, they just quietly copied Memento.Now about the original movie.

757,jrm-3,Comment on some of the Negative Comments,10,9 January 2002,"I've read through many of the comments on IMDB for ""Memento,"" and I was surprised at how many of them focused on the ""top 10"" argument.  (As in, ""This is a good movie but it shouldn't be in the top 10 of all time."") Well, obviously enough people have voted on this movie at imdb to place it in the top 10, so the whole argument is over.  Done.  Move on!Secondly, some of the ""holes"" that people have pointed out can either be explained or are, in my opinion, intentionally unexplainable.  For example, the whole ""if he REALLY had no short term memory, then he wouldn't remember that he had no short term memory"" discussion.  Was I the only one that noticed that this argument was the whole point of the movie? SPOILERS!!! I mean, when the film ends and Lenny's memories are brought into question--did his wife really die?  Did he already kill John G?  Was he really Sammy Jenkins?--then I began to wonder if he even really had a memory problem to begin with.  After all, everyone doubted Sammy's memory problems, even Lenny.  In fact, Lenny says to Sammy's wife that Sammy should be able to make new memories.  But HE's Sammy...  It's like his subconscious is trying to tell him that if he really wanted to, he'd be able to make new memories without a problem.  He just doesn't really want to... he's stuck in a world of depression and guilt over what happened.  That's why every once in a while he remembers things that he probably shouldn't have (like the gun in the drawer...knowing the car that Teddy drove so he could write down the license plate number... etc)  Then again, that interpretation could be totally false, too. There's no definitive answer... the movie is built to make you discuss and question everything you've seen.  The BEST thing about Memento is that it DOESN""T explain everything away (a la Vanilla Sky).  It trusts the audience to form its own opinions through intelligent discussions...",Memento

You won't even know it's happened.""FACT FIVE: ""I want time to pass, but it won't. How can I heal if I can't feel time?""FACT SIX: ""We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are.""When life becomes incomprehensible human beings tend to simplify things, revise memories, select facts that may or may not be representative of ""the truth.""  We strive to make events as intelligible as possible but that act often has unintended consequences.  Now, if you can capture this existential human reality on film in such a way as to allow the viewer to experience this struggle for understanding, for the placement of private aspirations into the context of the moment even as the primary character makes this same struggle, then you have connected our hearts and minds seamlessly with the film's lifeworld.  That is a rarity indeed.Such is Memento, a brilliantly conceived and executed work of art that has its audience literally at their wits end (just like the film's main character) trying to understand it all.  The great debate of whether Teddy's version of the truth at the end is really ""the truth"" is symptomatic of director Christopher Nolan's purposeful craftsmanship.  The very fact that we are as uncertain throughout most of the film as to the context of Leonard Shelby's actions as Leonard himself signifies that Nolan has succeeded in not just telling us Leonard's story put allowing us to know what it is like to *be* Leonard.  This allows the film to work at a much deeper, almost subconscious, level scarcely achieved on film.Guy Pierce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano all deliver terrific performances with some of the most original material I've seen in years. This film grabs your brain and won't let go.  It twists and turns and  just when you think you've got things figured out  Nolan whips the rug out from under your feet.  You are left totally involved and struggling with creating some sense of closure out of the infinite loop of the film's structure.You can debate endlessly whether Teddy's final summary of events is the truth.  You can argue both sides of whether Leonard killed his wife or invented Sammy Jankis out of thin air.  In the end these are open questions. In the end there are no definitive answers.  In fact, in the end ANY answer is plausible, just choose the one that sits best in your mind.  Make that the truth.  Because THAT is what this film is all about.  It's about a man who can remember who he is but not what he has done and, to that extend, it is the prefect postmodern critique.  We are often forced to act without sufficient information.  The accelerating rush of our lives sends us headlong into our present without full consideration of where we've been. And on that level Memento provides a bold, compelling narrative that connects Leonard with every person.  It is the mirror image of our divided selves.No matter how much his audience might disagree with the film's conclusion, Nolan understands that - in the end - truth doesn't matter.  It is what we choose to do with what we think is the truth that's important.  And that can mean anything at all.",Memento

No, I just have my version!).I believe Dodd was the second man that attacked Lennys wife. His ""friends"" were Teddy and Natalie. After the murder they started to realize, that he lost his memory and they started to use him as a killer, they just had to give him some hints and he thought he is after the murderer of his wife (maybe the first time it happened was on the picture he burns?). Then Natalie somehow got the money and wanted Dodd and Teddy to be killed, so she made up all the things to bring Lenny to kill them both.Well, thats not very fascinating (as the movie is); the fascinating on it is Lenny. His life is just one thing, he tries to find the murderer of his wife, so he follows the clues. How often did it he already? I think 2 times (the picture I mentioned and Teddy), but after a while he will somehow start a new hunt for the murderer and he will find new clues!I think this would explane from where the ""Never answer the Phone"" could come (this was a very important part of the whole movie to me), or the huge ""Teddy G rapped my wife"" (or somehow like this).

He only remembers what he has tattooed on his body to remind him of the path he is on and not to stray.What makes this movie unlike any other ever before? It is the way it was shot and edited. The entire movie is being played backwards, no not exactly the way you are thinking, it is Chronologically in order how ever the black and white parts are before and colour parts are after, and it is going forward just not in order of which they happen. This may sound confusing and this was a main factor into why this movie has created not only a splash but a tidal wave across all other movies. The amount of debate about the movie, the story and plot, the actual disease and how things turn out create for discussions that still go on till today. A thing of beauty of this film is that some could have different interpretations of roles and story lines however it could go both ways and Nolan's beauty was the ability to keep the secrets to himself so this debate goes on and on.Guy Pearce did a wonderful job however this was the brainchild of Christopher Nolan and this not only sky rocketed him onto the big name movies that he later directed such as Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, it created a new style of films. The unique style that he brought to this film and the ever confusing and debates that ravaged on after the movie with internet junkies and friends and the replay able factor of it has made this fall into 1 of the top movies of the decade, don't miss your chance to watch this, it is a thing of beauty.10/10 ~XTC",Memento

I was very impressed with the editing scheme and direction of this tight little noir and hoped the director would gain success. It's too bad that success had to come from ""Momento"". This too plays with the arrangement of scenes, but in so simple a fashion that getting the trick was no challenge. It isn't a bad film, really, but it's not great either. I don't recall having any complaints about the performances. But the story and the way it is presented are not all that interesting. The gimmick of seeing the scenes in reverse order and the little carry-over at the end of each one felt like a running gag that had gone sour. The film is a one trick pony that was lucky enough to snag everyone's attention. If people looked closer they'd know that the movie behind the hype is actually fairly thin and shallow. I'd really like to see Chris Nowlan have a hit with a really good picture. This one just isn't as good as ""Following"", but it is better than ""Insomnia"".",Memento

The only reason I like it is because your get the answer to all the questions you had and didn't had in the last 20 minutes. It feels rewarding and makes you feel smart in a way because you had thought of this way before you got it confirmed. But other than that the movie is pretty lame. Not many interesting characters and the story itself is no big mystery. I mean a mystery only gets weirder as time goes (Mulholland dr) but this is the other way around. WHICH IS WHY IT GET SO MUCH PRAISE. To be real people love to know whats going on. But they love being confused and THEN in the end get all the answers. I like this to so don't think im bashing anyone here. But my point is before that moment of truth this is really nothing. The deeper you go the more dragged in to it you get but I can't LOVE a movie because the ending is pleasing while the rest of the picture is bland. But I believe the whole backwards idea is cool.

768,Karlos-3,"Overall, great story telling, great flow, disappointing finish.",8,4 October 2001,"This movie is truly unique. One of those movies that you MUST see. You just have to experience. All the reviews you read and all talk you hear will not do it justice.The plot is simple (at first) as we have a person, Leonard, whose wife was raped and murdered and he was attacked during the incident. The whole incident (either the hit by the attacker or the traumatizing effect of seeing his wife die) left him with this illness. He lost his short term memory. He cannot form any new memories. Several times in the movie we see Lenny (Leonard) doing something, and as soon as he loses focus for several seconds, he forgets what he was doing. At one point he is being chased by an armed man, he gets tangled in a few obstacles and when he comes out of them he can't remember why he is running, he sees this man running on the opposite side of the building and he thinks he is chasing that man, as he starts running at him the man pulls out his gun and starts firing.. Lenny then realizes it is he who is being chased. In another incident.. Lenny is harassed by someone who knows his condition, that someone insults Lenny and his wife and then walks out.. Three minutes later that same person walks in (to Lenny trying to find a pen to write down that this person is bad) and the mere distraction of the door opening is enough for Lenny to forget what took place and for that person to pretend he/she was Lenny's friend.From the get go, there are two things that capture your interest..One, Lenny is a strange person, he has this weakness that he refuses to succumb to. He refuses to trust anyone or anything but his own observations, sentences like ""I know when someone knows me, I just look into their eyes"" strike you are pretty confident for a guy with no memory. He places infinite trust in his Tattoos, notes, files and photos. The major facts he finds about his wife's killer, he writes as a Tattoo on his body, his research work on the killer is in a file he keeps with him all the time. He leaves notes in his pocket for things he plans to do, simply by leaving them there, he is sure to revisit them later. He takes polaroid photos of all the important things in his current situation, where he's staying, his car, people he met (and on the back he writes his impressions about them). The techniques he uses to record these memories are not surprising, but the way he trusts his own handwriting and his own remarks on the back of each photo is what strikes you as odd. I believe it is a very accurate depiction by the writer of the story as anyone who has dealt with a disabled person will testify that this form of defiance and reluctance to rely on others is very much a real behavior. As Lenny himself said (describing a case he handled when he was an insurance investigator of a man who suffered from the same condition he later on acquired), ""I realized that the look of recognition in his eyes (which made me think he was faking the condition) was actually fake. He was giving that look to everyone who approaches him hoping to give them SIGNs that he is doing better.""Two, the movie is told as two tales.. One moving backwards, and the other moving forwards. The reverse tale is in color and is the personification of Lenny's case. Like Lenny, you see events unfold with out knowing what took place before them. You see he is talking to a man who is trying to help him, but on the photo he has of that man he has written the sentence ""Don't trust him"" so he ignores the man's advice. You (like Lenny) have to believe the photo (of course as a viewer, you start thinking, may be that's not his handwriting, may be someone forged his handwriting to lead Lenny in the wrong way). And as this story unfolds backwards (with you having the privilege of knowing what would result from each scene because you've seen all the way till the end) the other story (shot in black and white) is moving forward. From the beginning you realize that it is taking place prior to the colored story (Lenny has less tattoos).Eventually, the two stories meet near the movie's finale. Until THAT point in the movie, it is one of the greatest movies EVER.But it is the finale that detracts from the movie as the director (or story writer?) tried to leave a puzzling finish to make the movie sound real deep. He succeeded in making the finish puzzling, but he failed in making the finish live up to the level of story telling and overall performance of the movie to that point.Someone likened the surprising ending of this movie to the ending of the 6th Sense.. All I can say is that this statement would be true if the Sixth Sense ended in you finding out that all those ghosts the kid saw were just actors and that it was all a prank on the little boy. That's how surprising the ending of Memento is.. It's REALLY surprising, but greatly frustrating.",Memento
769,dark-10,"Overrated, but still Good.",1,16 May 2001,"All in all, this was a good movie. It used TWO gimmicks that have already been used. The first: Starting at the end of a story to find out what happened in the beginning, was used in a Seinfeld episode (and much more effectively may I add). The second: The hero's inability to create new memories, due to short term memory loss, which was used by Dana Carvey in Clean Slate. Having said that, I think, like several movies which have had a gimmick to their story or format, that Nolan took the easy way out at the end, knowing people would overlook it due to it's gimmick. Like the Goofs section pointed out, Leonard wouldn't be able to remember he had the condition of memory loss. Even in Clean Slate, the story made a point to remind the main character he had this ""condition"" every time he woke up. And that wasn't written nearly as good as this.  An obvious oversight by the writer/director. Also (I think another user comment mentioned this and I'm surprised more people haven't), Leonard has tatoos on his body BEFORE his wife dies. Including the one that tells him his wife is dead! I dunno if this was intended, but if it was, it goes unexplained.Ever since the Usual Suspects waxed The Third Man, filmmakers have had this thing with hiding one's ""identity"". Well, honestly, for me the only time I was fooled was in the Usual Suspects. I saw it coming in Fight Club and The Sixth Sense (though in this film it didn't ruin a thing for me), and I saw it coming in Memento. I gotta say, the two ""bad"" or ""not as good versions"" of these films are Fight Club and Memento, while the better ones are the Usual Suspects and Sixth Sense, and here's why:The Usual Suspects and the Sixth Sense gave a CONCRETE, CUT AND DRY answer at the end. An answer that allows the audience to say ""Ohh, well THAT explains EVERYTHING.""In Fight Club and Memento, while their stories were every bit as riveting as the former two, the payoff wasn't at big at the end. They gave kinda cheap answers that leave viewers asking ""What about this? What about that? And what about that other time?"" which in fact are subsequently answered by the characters one by one, but some of them are kinda half-assed, dubious, and just plain too easy that anyone coulda thought of them as explanations. Ultimately this leaves some viewers disappointed, often saying ""THAT was it? I coulda came up with that!"" (Though in Fight Club, this could've been amended had they ended the film the same way they end the novel).Note to filmmakers: When you have a gimmick, it becomes a RULE for that screenplay. OBEY IT! At anytime should you so much as BEND it, IT becomes another time the audience will say, ""Well how do you explain THAT!?"". If you don't always have the answers, THINK ABOUT IT. Don't just settle for the easy ones, compromising and detracting from what could be an otherwise great script. E.g. The Sixth Sense. Gimmick: Bruce is DEAD. He can't talk or touch ANYONE except the boy. At no time (until the closing and closure of the film) did Shyalaman break that rule. Hence: A MASTERPIECE!As for this film, I thought it was VERY well written and conceived until the end when all is revealed. The Revelation as it turns out, is disappointing. I would give it an 8 out of 10. HOWEVER, it's ranked #14 of all-time on this database. I don't think it's anywhere near being one of the top 50 of all time. So seeing that people have rated it so high, I'm giving it a 1 to compensate for people's lack of good judgement.",Memento

Great film, reminded me of The Usual Suspects in the way that you had little to rely on to distinguish lies from truth.**spoilers ahead**Sorry, I've got to do this, 'cause I just can't not say something. Some reviews poo-poo the film because they say the ending is too neat or too gimmicky or whatever.  I ask, what exactly does the ending tell us?  Do we believe the supposed ""truth"" just because it comes at the end of the movie? Consider the source -- a slimeball who has lied to the main character in every single scene -- why do *we* believe him?  Some of what he says is substantiated (the photo of Leonard) but do we believe everything?  I think the truth and lies are meshed together so tightly that we can't unravel them any better than Leonard can. The next question is, has Leonard painted himself into a corner so that he has to stop?  After all, every single one of his notes now points to John G, bad cop.  He has a photo proof of his deed.  Teddy can no longer use him for his own ends.  What will he do next?I gave this film a slightly lower rating than I did The Usual Suspects because you can imagine that you know what happened here (not like U.S., where nearly everything is related second hand, so you never know).  Also, the ""gimmick"" at the end of U.S. was better, in my opinion. In summary, it was very very good.  Pearce, as usual, did a stellar job. Pantoliano (sp?) also as usual did a great job playing the smarmy nice/not nice guy who lives (or dies) by lying.  Moss did a great job, which upon reflection, becomes an excellent job -- after all, *we* believed her (as Leonard did).

'Memento' is so smartly put together that both groups lack the courage to say that the movie is a failure and a bore for fear of not coming out ignorant and unsophisticated.Long ago it was observed by Pauline Keal that art house audience accepts lack of clarity as complexity, accepts clumsiness and confusion as 'ambiguity' and as style.

It's the kind of 'mind-trippn'' (I call it) movie that really makes you think during it's whole running time. In brief, it follows the story of a man (Guy Pearce) who only wants to avenge his wife's murder and rape. The catch? He has short term memory loss, which means he cannot make any new memories of anything after 15 minutes, so he lives in fifteen minute segments, the only thing he has got is a polaroid camera, notes and tattoos of things to follow, in order to find the killer. The film poses many questions, and, trust me, if I tell you any more about it, the movie won't be as great as a first-time viewing.There really isn't much else to say - except that the film is filmed very differently than your average picture.Once again, all I have to say that this is one helluva film.

785,learnnew,One of the best movies I've ever watched ...,10,11 May 2003,"An amazing movie! Much has been said about the movie, the screenplay, direction and performances. I'm not going to add much here. I'm amazed that Joe Pantoliano didn't get nominated for an acting award for this movie! He gave by far the best performance in the movie. Stephen Tobolowsky and Guy Pearce were also amazing. And I'm also amazed that Nolan didn't get nominated for the best director in many major awards, including Academy awards and the Golden globes. What a direction! Hats off!
I give it a hearty 10/10!Onto the movie ... There can be many interpretations of the ""ending"" and the entire movie itself.SPOILER ALERT!!! VIRTUALLY ENTIRE PLOT GIVEN AWAY!!! BEWARE!!! BEWARE!!! STRONG RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT READ AHEAD IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE MOVIE!!! PLEASE WATCH THE MOVIE AT LEAST ONCE! (You've been warned enough!)I found this interesting question on a few reviews, including Ebert's. (I personally think Ebert missed a number of points in this movie, very rare for him to do so.) The question is this: if the last thing the main character remembers is his wife dying, then how does he remember that he has short-term memory loss? I kept thinking about it quite a bit. When I recently watched the movie again, it clicked to me. Remember he is always looking at the back of his left palm (at a very prominently visible place) where he has tattooed ""Remember Sammy Jankis""? It is to remind him of his condition. It makes sense because he always associates his condition with that of Sammy Jankis. This is my take on it.There was also another comment in Ebert's review: Nolan's device of telling his story backward, or sort of backward, is simply that--a device.
I disagree, because, what I got out of the movie was this: It doesn't matter whether the cop-character Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) or Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) are nice people or not. It doesn't even matter whether Leonard even found the murderer or not. What the movie is really about is the helplessness of Leonard. Granted, he writes copious notes, tatoos stuff on his body and painstakingly lives as much an ordered life as possible given his condition. But ultimately, he is human. In the ""climax"", when he says to himself that yes, he is going to play a game and make Teddy his target, it so amazingly brings out the helplessness of the character. It would be even more ironical if what Teddy said (as to Leonard being the real ""murderer"" of his wife, i.e., the story he attributes to Sammy Jankis,(did leonard succeed in making a long-term memory by training, after all?)) is true. The entire life of Lenoard is now being played in his mind as some ""normal"" life of revenge but he really has a psychological condition. And since we see the movie in Leonard's point of view, we are inclined to believe his thoughts and notes. Only in the ""end"" is his ""condition"" revealed to us. Therefore the movie had to be told backward. If we knew of his helplessness beforehand, I wonder what is left of the movie!A personal message that I got from the movie: We always live under the illusion that we are in control of our lives, at least we want to live so. Is it possible? How do our helplessness and weaknesses and subjectivities manipulate us?",Memento

Do the creators of this movie even try to do that? No - the story never strays away from a long-trodden path of a sturdy commercial thriller-mystery. Yes, yes - reverse order, unknown past instead of unknown future etc., but this all looks to me like using a statue as a hammer. What makes you think about anything in this movie: some reviewers claim to go on thinking about it for days - about what? If you really want some deep insights into the nature of time and memory, try Immanuil Kant or Upanishads - don't try to get them from this source.Now after all that I cannot deny that this is a well-made mystery film, the actors are really good, the suspense is there, and it's quite worthy of a higher-than-average review.

With the constant stream of typical, boring movies with nothing but eye candy and a plot so loose and full of holes it's degrading to believe that any real thought went into them (and not just a series of cliches thrown together to make a movie), that I was so ecstatic when Memento was released.This has been by far my favorite film of recent years. Everything is skillfully arranged. The narration adds a comedic and sometimes sad resonance to the film. The acting was great. Guy Pierce, formally in L.A. Confidential, was so believable and secure in his role as Leonard, that it was hard to imagine he was not experiencing his problematic inability to produce new memories. The movie is filmed in reverse. And of course, that means, the beginning is really the ending. But Memento is so wonderfully written, that even this does not really give away what is going to happen. And it is not this alone that makes Memento such a wonderful movie. The ride through Leonard's life in the past few days is so fun and full of interesting events, that there was never a moment that dragged or left the viewer with any sense that things weren't going somewhere. It is such an entertaining film that though it is a movie full of surprises, knowing them and watching it again does not hinder its ability to absolutely capture its viewer's attention.Memento is a great film that should be viewed by everyone.

The one thing I wanted to know was left unanswered, or possibly was answered, but perhaps I need to watch the movie again about five times back to back and then spend a few days mulling it over to figure it out.Complex is the best way to describe the plot of this movie. It was done in reverse fashion, showing the latest scenes first, followed by a scene one step early, and so on. This added an extra component of viewer involvement; I had to be locked into the plot every second for fear that I would miss something, and I probably have.The main character was excellent; very believable. I suppose it probably isn't too hard to act as someone who hasn't experienced something, especially when you never have. Perhaps this is part of why it was such a believable film.I have not yet read any of the other reviews on this film, but am eager to see what others have to say on it.

Memento is just too flawed, despite its ingenuity, to be rated as a great among greats. Very good yes (I gave it a 9), but unlike Citizen Kane, Schindler's List, Casablanca, and The Godfather, it is far from cinematic perfection.Then again, the IMDb top 250 baffles me anyway at times.

Then I saw the movie and thought, ""WOW, what a PHENOMENAL cast and INGENIOUS concept!""  The movie is about Leonard, a man with no short-term memory due to a violent ""incident"" in his past, and his search for the man who killed his wife.  To compensate for his very rare and odd handicap, he takes Polaroids of people and places he needs to remember and, for those truly necessary facts, tattoos them upon his body.  This alone would have held my attention throughout the movie, but director Christopher Nolan shoots the movie in segments starting at the end and working its way to the beginning.  Sounds pretentious, but it truly creates an environment where the viewer feels the confusion and struggle that Leonard feels.  This style of editing makes Memento's characters the hardest to decipher of nearly any movie I have seen.  The two main supporting characters are played wonderfully, brilliantly, powerfully, intelligently and eerily by Carrie Anne-Moss and Joe Pantoliano.  Each plays a character with such varying motives and actions that the viewer cannot find the line between truth and manipulation.  The ending is a real kicker(don't worry, I won't spoil it) and I could spend a lot more time talking about this film, but I will leave it at this and simply say, ""One of the year's best...without a doubt!

Compared with Pulp Fiction or Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind which are both great movies of all time, the model that Memento established was more than its art of editing. Since this is a mystery movie, there won't be as much pleasure if we see the movie too clearly! Therefore, the complicated way of film editing really leveled up the unsolved problems which made the audiences wonder all the time until the end.In fact, the process to reason the story is parallel to the missing part of each chapter which was played backwards, and with the disease the male leading role had, every flash moment before the missing parts make the audiences go through the same experiences as the male leading role did. The ambition is not satisfied with only one narrative method, so there appeared two different time lines in the movie which are separated by their colors. As the movie approached the end, two time lines came to an intersection, and the mystery was finally solved at that time. The most genius and impressive point is that at the forwards narrative time line, the leading actor mainly talked about the past story and that really confused the audiences about the real story that was going on! Not only the form of the movie impressed me, but also the humanity that occurred after things he had gone through and the problem he had to deal with.

But somehow I made a review myself and thought about the whole plot. Actually, I had to admit: Its not I that got confused, Its Nolan that wanted me to get confused ! The whole thing is made up backwards to learn two things: First - imagine life as it could be, learn to love what you got - because somehow life can change and the only thing you rely on are pity emotions like revenge that provides your life with some sense. And second: Not everything really is, as it looks like on first view. You can adapt this interpretation for almost every situation of life - for example prejudices. And maybe you can also test yourself about how moral you are. Do YOU understand Leonards behavior if Teddy really tried to help him, by burning all the evidence for already killing the real murder but hunting instead Teddy as nothing in life worths than the sense for revenge? Or maybe do you even share this behavior? Or do YOU deny all of Leonards doing? Whatever it is, its all in your imagination.Well: I have to admit, Nolan really got me.

Leonard's world is a world of total confusion and complete disorientation where he's forced to live and re-live his life through the present moment, rather than through the past and the present. By showing us the scenes in reverse, we're forced to forget what just happened and so we can get a real sense of the disorientation and resulting frustration of not knowing what's happening or what led up to it. Combining it with the forward-going plot line of Sammy Jankis serves to push the disorientation and confusion even further. A brilliant, utterly ingenious concept of film-making, if you ask me.

An ""ending"" where the facts are unclear, and leaves the viewer in the same state of mind as the central character, might leave some members of the audience unsatisfied.

Guy Pearce made his character his own, and plays the part with great deal of innocence, charm, and humour. His comic timing is surprisingly good. His two co-stars, Joe Pantoliano, and Carrie Ann Moss, are both very good, and add to the mystery, which unfolds in an interesting structure.

839,asaidi-2,The major thing good about the movie is the way it was shown.,7,15 April 2001,"(some SPOILERS in this review). The major thing that makes this movie really interesting and exciting is the way it is presented, a reverse timeline.  Basically, the first scene in the movie (besides the black and white scenes) is the last scene if the movie were in chronological order, and the last scene would have been the first (after the black and white stuff).  It's a more extreme version of what Tarantino did for `Pulp Fiction', however that movie had a lot more going for it where this one doesn't If the movie had been shown with the correct timeline (and if they had moved the final twist scene to the end of the film, which would have been very easy to do) then I think the movie would have lost a lot of appeal.First, it would have removed most of the questions in the movie.  Most of the mystery is about `what happened to that ?', or `when did that happen?'.  By showing the movie backward you see what happened to people and then you see how it happened.  This is one of the most interesting things in the film, which would have not been there if it had been shown in chronological order. Secondly, if the movie were shown with the correct timeline the plot holes in the movie would be much more apparent.  For example, Natalie supposedly first meets Leonard behind the bar.  The next time she meets him in the bar (right after she meets him behind the bar, but in the movie this scene is right before the other one) she quickly plays some pranks on him because of his mental condition (he has sort term memory loss  which she apparently has heard about before although I don't think she had met him before).  Then, a few minutes later (which is a few minutes earlier in the film) she invites a guy she basically just met to stay at her house for `a few days'.  If the movie were shown in chronological order this would have been somewhat confusing, just like it is if you think about it after you see all the scenes in the movie. I'm not saying that the movie has only one or two things going for it. It has some very good acting in it, some very interesting scenes which take advantage of Leonards unusual mental condition, but the best thing about it and the thing which makes the movie so mysterious, creative, and entertaining, is that fact that it's shown backwards.",Memento

My biggest feeling of disappointment was in the exclusion of Memento from just about every category save for writing and editing.  I have read reviews of the nominations, and most of them said that Memento was excluded for being ""gimmicky"".  The argument, they say, is that since the storyline runs backwards from the end to the beginning, it limits the creativity possible. Hogwash!  So what if it's a gimmick. Why not reward them if the gimmick works? It does, here, to perfection.The backwards-running storyline produces many moments of ""aaaah, so THAT's how that happened!"", feeding important pieces of the plot to the viewer in a patchwork style that keeps the viewer involved.  This is not a movie for the easily distracted, as most ""gimmicky"" films are; this is one movie best viewed on DVD or VHS simply because there are many scenes so dense that you want to rewind them and watch them again. As the hero, Guy Pearce's performance fuels the entire story, expressing a full range of emotions and often juxtaposing opposite feelings from one scene to the next.  The writing, directing, and editing are top-notch, intelligent, clever, humorous, and, when needed, brutal.  Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano deliver excellent supporting performances, although this is becoming mere habit for Pantoliano.Memento didn't find a mass audience because it is too intelligent for the average movie-goer.

Then i got some perspective on things.Memento is technically very good. It has a very slick execution and you believe the story. Still, it is just pure entertainment. It doesn't have any deeper meaning.Very well executed and intelligent film. Very fun. Very good. Witty. Not the best movie of all times. 9/10",Memento
845,badbit,"Very innovative structure, but it gets tired soon (spoilers)",8,14 July 2002,"When the first scene of the film began, I knew I wasn't watching your average movie. After reading so many good reviews, and hearing here or there about this movie, I became really interested in it. I was expecting one of the greatest movies of the decade, it was pretty good, but it is highly overrated. The idea of starting backwards it very interesting, but it becomes predictable very soon. The characters are very two-dimensional, the cinematography it's very average. The only innovative aspect it's the script, wich has very big flaws...For example, when Leonard says that the police doesn't believe him, how could he remember? And how does he remember that he writes down everything on photos and tatoos? And that he is seeking the murderer of his wife? He would have to read A LOT to know what he did since the murdering of his wife.Overrall, it's an entertaining movie, if you consider that this is the best movie of all time, maybe that's because you haven't watched The Godfather or Citizen Kane. If you want something better from the same year (2000), try the mexican movie ""Amores Perros"" (wrongfully translated ""Love's a bitch"").",Memento

He developed this condition after suffering a TBI the night he and his wife were attacked in their home. This is the same night he ""thinks"" his wife was killed. He must put tattoos all over his body and gather every clue he can to find ""the killer"".Truly a classic in the suspense and mystery categories.

It is utterly compelling, has you thinking and scratching your head throughout and the ending is such a revelation that it took me about a week to scrape my jaw from off the floor.

The intention of the writer / director wasto show how life for us is simply a combination of short memories, which we can omit, extend, devote our lives to, confuse ourselveswith etc. The film demonstrates wonderfully what chaos happenswhen we lose these short term memories, and combined with thisis a refreshingly fractured plot, which we can make no sense outof, like Leonard himself. We are cleverly and disturbingly placedinto the mind of Leonard and leave the theater wondering andconfused, just like he drives off with absolutely no resolution. Don'twe get tired of films that are resolved in the end?; our own lives aremostly unresolved, and the film magically reflects this feeling. Onecriticism I read was the question of why Leonard didn't use a taperecorder to capture his memories; the answer is simple, and hepoints it out in the film; if he lost it he would lose everything ( mostof his important facts to remember are tattooed on him for thisreason ), and also he realizes the sheer impact of visual memory;his ""records"" are either visual or written on himself. Remember heis a very intelligent perceptive guy, which is why he was good at hisjob testing insurance claims; and he also repeatedly reflects theimportance of speaking to someone face to face...here againcomes in the impact of vision ( seeing the eyes and bodylanguage etc  ) ...this may be an indirect criticism of the growingtrend of Internet friendships and dating, where mostly you just seeor hear words. Another criticism raised by the well known criticRoger Ebert is the idea that if seeing his wife was the last thing heremembered, why could he always remember he had short termmemory loss? Well the answer to this is pointed out in the film aswell, and also when you understand short term memory loss thesolution becomes simple ( these talented film makers doresearch, unlike some well known critics ). Leonard points out thathe is different from the poor guy with a similar disorder but who iscompletely incapacitated, and ends up in a nursing home;Leonard would have been told by doctors about his condition, andhe sees it as crucial to remember he has a problem, which is whyhe is constantly repeating it to people and I'm sure in his ownmind; he is fighting it all the time. Also the experts say thecondition comes in different degrees, and that a good method ofrehabilitation is constantly repeating things and thoughts; he canalso remember where he parks his car, leaves his keys; everydaythings. The problems he encounters in the film are not everyday,making his struggle all the more difficult. Therefore anothermessage we may gain is to admit openly that we have a problemand not repress it, such as alcoholism. For me the film isfaultless. It is absolutely confusing and disjointed, evenmeaningless on the surface; well to me thats what life is.",Memento
851,eli-ass,Very intelligent and perfectly directed,10,17 March 2010,"--- more detailed review coming soon ---This is one of my favorite movies.Well what can I say about it ... It's fresh, original and highly intelligent. Christopher Nolan (who has not made any bad movie so far) also wrote the screenplay for this with his brother Jonathan and the way he directed it and put the scenes together is what makes this film work so well... There are some people reviewing this film as ""manipulation of the audience"" and that the style of storytelling is all just a gimmick ... That's simply not true! It is NOT just a gimmick! The way it is directed is not to confuse us (though it obviously does) but it just makes really! much! sense! concerning the plot and the main characters situation. In this way we really getting into the same trouble that Guy Pearce is going through. This will also be the reason for everyone to watch this movie at least twice. It will blow you away the first time, will reveal itself at a second viewing (well most of it) and will still be enjoyable for another run. I have to underline again I've probably never seen a movie as clever and intriguing as this one.Besides that we have great performances by all actors especially Guy Pearce who is really likable throughout with a slightly dry humour ...And the best thing is that the movie - once you got the mind challenge done and puzzled most of it together - still leaves room for interpretation! It's a real pleasure to discuss this movie.It's NOT a movie for popcorn or a Friday night with lots of friends and alcohol :) ... It's a movie for smart people that you must pay highest attention to cause if you miss anything you'll be completely lost!So go rent it right now and have fun!10/10",Memento

I mean, regardless of the editing, which will be in the future looked upon with appreciation and jealousy, the movie is absolutely stunning...Guy Pearce makes, as usual, the audience believe his feelings are genuine. He is able to transmit to the people watching every bit of anxiety, lack of trust and desire for the truth his character feels, doing it in a manner making you want to see the movie again and again.THE MAIN QUESTION is: what if the movie were edited in the ""traditional"" manner? Would it have been less appealing? Well, it's a hard question to answer.Mainly because the editing goes strictly linked to the title and the condition of the leading character, but also helps you in a very subtle manner to transcend from the position of viewer to the one of a character in the movie... It helps you identify to the character and beyond...Maybe a slight reminder of the ""Fugitive"" theme, that only makes one appreciate both these films...As for the cast, it is a work of genius. There are so many angles that could be debated here! Beginning with the talent Guy Pearce shows when playing roles of people with very troubled minds and lives, one can only speculate the very interesting idea of bringing 2 of the stars of the first installment of ""Matrix"" around for another challenging movie.Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano really make even here a great team. Their characters have quite the same ""talent"" of apeearing to be ""good"" people, but being in fact very cool, calculated manipulators of people. They do prey on the leading characters ""disability"" and they do it in a very effective manner, until a certain point.Why ""disability""? Well, because even the character played by Guy Pearce uses it as a weapon of some sorts and at the ""end"" of the film we see to what effect.What can I say besides: Enjoy!",Memento

I found it too slow and too drawn out, like Christopher Nolan was wanting you the get it instead of messing with your head (like the repetitive scenes where Lenny meets the girl and Teddy keeps saying hello).

A man suffering with short-term memory loss, seeks revenge for the murder of his wife.Sounds like a recipe for a bad comedy. I thought it was going to be longest 2 hours of my life when i saw the cover of the dvd but i had nothing better to do.SO whats so exciting about a guy that takes polaroids of his car and hotel while tattooing license plate numbers on his body? Its his condition. He cant make new memories. He remebers everything uptill the accident but after that its all in pictures and tattoos.The movie cant be explained. You have to see it to comprehend it. You have to see it again to comprehend it. But you must accept one thing, the movie does not have a definite ending. the director never made it to prove anything, just to toy with our minds.We believe whatever we want to believe. We forget whatever we want to forget. We remember whatever we want to remember. But no matter how hard he tries, he cant. So, in order to make life justifiable, he decides to go on his own terms. Using his condition to his advantage, (and to others advantage or so it seems), he tries bring meaning and purpose to his life. Something he wasnt able to do before the accident.The movie is great not because it is in reverse, not because it has some fantastic direction, not because it has a sexy green jag, but because it makes one wonder if we are truly honest to ourselves.watch this one CLOSELY.

I know that when describing this film the most obvious thing to mention is the unusual editing. But it's worthy of every mention, so forgive me as I repeat what everyone's said a thousand times. The reverse chronological order is quite a fascinating trick. Using editing to force the viewer into Leonard's situation was a brilliant trick that, though it mired me so much I had to sit there and ponder what I had seen for nearly fifteen minutes, is worthy of praise. Honestly, I can't think of a better way to use editing to create empathy than this. It's hard to imagine just how difficult it would be to have Leonard's condition...until you see it on the screen and realize just what that poor fool would have to deal with, solving a murder and not being able to remember anything about it.

It is pathetic.Think of a situation where you do not know who your friends are and you do not know if the person you speak to is a friend or a foe. Its a chilling feeling and i would term the guy with no memory as ''the loneliest person on this earth'' Coming to the story;Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man with no short-term memory and the last thing he remembers is his wife's murder. He is on a death hunt but he has no memory of the murderer or any details by which he could get to him. He tattoes himself with mementos of his daily life. Imagine that!!

While watching you really have to pay attention because how each scene begins is how the next one ends, but often it will be difficult to remember how it began because you will be pulled into the conflict of the story. Leonard Shelby is wonderfully played by Guy Pearce who earlier acted in the cop drama L.A Confedential, which in both of these movies he shows what kinds of talents he has on the screen. Christopher Nolan, the Writer/Director of Memento is one of Hollywood's greatest directors, he has done Insomnia(not based on the Stephen King book) with Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hillary Swank. Just Recently he has directed the thrilling Batman Begins which has an a list cast including Christian Bale, Michael Cain, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and Katie Holmes. In Memento Nolan shows us how the character thinks because Leo will know something and then the next minute he would have completely forgotten the whole thing. To help himself remember things Leo will take pictures of people and places such as the hotel he is staying and Natalie(Carrie-Anne Moss) and Teddy Gammel(Joe Pantoliano), without these pictures th movie would be a total mess and would not be nearly and good.

Confidential, Iron Man 3, Hurt Locker), Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix, Chocolat, Disturbia) and Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix, The Fugitive, Bad Boys II). It is written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, Interstellar) and it is based off his brother Jonathon Nolan's (Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, Interstellar) short story, Memento Mori.Memento is a psychological mystery/thriller about a Leonard (Guy Pearce) who cannot make new memories on the hunt for the person who raped and murdered his wife. He leaves himself notes all over himself and has tattoos that all have information on the man he is after. Along the way, he befriends Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) but are they really his friends?What ultimately makes this film so good is the writing. It is told in a way I have never seen before and it is so creative and smart I wish I thought of it first. Since Leonard cannot make new memories and we are seeing the story told through his eyes the only way to give us the information Leonard has is to tell the story backward. This doesn't mean it is like a tape being rewound and you can't make out what the characters are saying. It is told scene by scene by scene so the first scene is really the last scene and the last scene is really the first scene. So when a scene begins and Leonard is in a place he does not know with people he does not know, the viewer has no idea where he is and who he is with either. It is wildly creative. With such an innovative way to tell a story like you would need to edit it in such a way where while it doesn't make sense, it does make sense. The editing does this perfectly where things don't make sense deliberately, unlike sometimes where the editing is so sloppy you can't tell what is going on even in a linear story.This film is a great one if you really want to challenge your mind and try to guess the ending (or the beginning) before you make it there. This film is great the first time since you are trying to figure it all out, the second time it is also interesting because you are trying to pick up all the things you missed. However, after that the film can never get better than the first time you saw it. In summary this is a film everyone should watch mainly because of Christopher Nolan's brilliant writing.",Memento

This is what makes this film terrible. Christopher Nolan didn't have the foresight to edit this film in proper sequence, a rookie error.I remember in my early days of directing, I would be sitting at my Moviola and all of a sudden, the film reel would spring off the spools and into my uncoordinated, meaty arms. Next thing I knew, I had miles upon miles of film pressing down hard upon my muscle-less body. I had stay there for 2 weeks before my mum found me.In the following week, I spent the majority of my time straightening the now noodle like coagulation of film. I had already split the film up into the constituent scenes but there was no way of telling the order because during the one-man fracas, I had fallen inadvertently performed a flying triple axle dragon kick on my film projector crushing it immediately into a fine dust. Because of this, I had no other option but to just guess which scenes should go where.After stitching all the scenes together at random I had myself a film. But what to call it? There were film festivals coming up and it had to have a name and without a linear structure, the name, 'I Stab Your Balls in a Chornological Progression Over The Course of Many Scenes From Multiple Perspectives', would make no sense whatsoever. I went to the desk of the festival, film reel tucked nicely into the warm embrace of my fanny pack and when the receptionist asked the name of my film, I had a stroke of genius. Rashomon! I'll call my film Rashomon! I had no idea what it meant but it sounded nice and that sure tickled my fanny. I submitted Rashomon (which has proved to have been my magnum opus ('magnum opus' in Latin meaning 'accidentally good film' (obviously))) and it won the Palme D'or. It was the greatest day of my life and the last time I shed a tear. That's right, I am legendary film director, Akira Kurosawa.Unfortunately, as I sat in that cushy theatre in Cannes watching back my award winning film, I realised that I despised my creation. 'No film should ever be made like this ever again', I thought to myself as I hurriedly drew out a plan on the back of my hand. The plan was one sentence long and read simply: 'BURN THIS GARBAGE'. I slipped in to the projection booth, snapped the projectionist's neck and set the monstrosity ablaze. Sitting in that projection, heated by the warmth of a fire fuelled by a film that I despised, I sought to stop anyone from creating a non-chronological film in the future.

Memento does something that few other movies have done before: it is shown backward. There are scenes shown backward, along with scenes shown forward, and the two eventually converge during the climax. And while showing a movie backward may seem like a horrible way to craft a movie, it is everything but. It shows us something that will happen, and shows us how we got there. Whether we like it or not, the ending is inevitable. The movie opens with a murder, and at first, it seems justified; the man raped and murdered the wife of our protagonist, Leonard (Guy Pierce). However, as the movie progresses, or rather digresses, we learn that the man was, in fact innocent. Leonard has a strange case of anterograde amnesia that prevents him from making new memories. Every 5 minutes, he forgets who he is, where he is, and why he is there. As a result,
he uses a complex (but heavily flawed) system of notes and photographs to understand his
everyday life. He relies on these notes to survive, and track down John Doe, the man who raped and murdered his wife. Memento has so many plot twists that it is often hard to keep up with, but in fear of spoiling for you, I will end this review here.",Memento

Very original, highly non-linear (not sure I've seen anything quite like it).  If you like beginnings, middles and ends, don't bother (you'll be disappointed and apt to think there are plot holes or black holes). 
If you are looking for something to see again and again (like I've seen ""The Matrix"" about fifty times now) give this a try.  The rental folks should have it now (definitely try it).My wife says ""it's a ten minute story told in a two hour movie"" (she likes beginnings, middles and ends).  Besides, there's no butler to do whatever butlers are supposed to do in mysteries (does anyone have butlers anymore?). Vote:  0 of 10 (ouch!)I'm going to see it a few more times, but I'm more inclined to give it 9 of 10, after my first watch (I'm probably the only person on the planet who liked ""Gattaca"" after all).Hey, different strokes (for different folks).",Memento

I suspect few movie devotees would have been nearly as interested if the film has been in normal linear mode.  After straining to notice each hidden clue, I was dumbfounded when this ""classic"" ended.  The star - Guy Pierce - gave a wooden ""Keanu"" performance, although in all fairness, he was given little to work with.  I couldn't give a damn about any of the characters.

The performances of Guy Pearce (Leonard) and Joe Pantoliano (Teddy) are absolutely brilliant. Carrie-Ann Moss (Natalie) is also good, but not brilliant. The way this film is told is so original and new, that I can't tell you, you have to see for yourself.The reason this film is so good, is that something like this has never been done before and I think movie fans such as myself, have been waiting for a movie like Memento that is so original, its finally good to see something different instead of all those stupid teen horrors, romantic comedy's and over budget action films, and so on, well you get my point.Memento is now in my favourite 10 films of all-time.

Maybe...There was a strange twist of irony at work here: the more I watched this film the less I liked it. What began as a wonderfully, refreshing look at (reverse) story-telling, became less entertaining and more tedious with each passing (and re-passing) flash-back (or is that flash-forward?)Part of this film played like an old Twilight Zone episode I recall seeing many years ago. And that's not a bad thing. I enjoyed piecing together the ""why"" of the plot, since we already knew the ""what."" However, generally uninteresting and unappealing characters mar the performances, and while our hero may be unaware of time, as a viewer I was painfully aware of how his film seemed to drag, lacking a good sense of timing. As for the ending, it too could have been given the same delicious touches as the beginning sequence, but alas, it does nothing to reward the viewer for having endured the bulk of the film.One reviewer commented how well this HIGHLY RATED film will hold up in another few years when compared to the classics. Others have asked how on earth it could have rated so high to begin with. The former will be answered on its own, and I believe time will not be too kind. The answer to the latter is akin to the McDonald's Syndrome: Those who grew up eating Big Macs on a regular basis erroneously come to believe it's actually good food. Perhaps compared to what Hollywood is offering these days, Memento is indeed gourmet fare. To me, it's still just a hamburger. (6 out of 10).",Memento

Christopher Nolan is one the best directors to emerge from the 21st century. As an aspiring director it's great too see that Nolan can make a brilliant indie classic like Memento and then do great big budget commercial films like Batman Begins, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight and not loose any credibility, in fact I think The Dark Knight probably earned him more respect even though he had a huge budget for it. The Movie has it's little holes, but I get passed it because it so creative in every way, especially in it's structure of storytelling and narrative similar to Taxi Driver. The film has a noir feel to it which I love. It asks questions about satisfying our needs emotionally by lying too ourselves and I think shows how the need for revenge can be taken advantage of by other people. Nolan's favorite films are Cinatown, Blade Runner, Lawrence Of Arabia, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Chiantown and 2001 are number one and two on my list and the other two are definitely in my top 50 or 30. Love Nolan, love this film, one of the best five films of the decade.",Memento

890,amillerz3,Memento: Christopher Nolan's Masterpiece,10,2 May 2012,"What can I say. From one of the most intelligent directors of our time comes one of the most thought-provoking and ambiguous films of all time. A man who has lost the ability to create short-term memories seeks the person who raped and murdered his wife. Armed only with the tattoos on his body (as a way of reminding him who he is and details about the murderer) and a pistol, he stakes out a town with the help of his friend Teddy, searching for the mysterious John or James G. While the plot may sound a bit traditional, the presentation is anything but. The story is essentially told in reverse, in order to imitate the feeling of short-term memory loss. While there are little snippets here and there that are told in forward motion, that is only for the sake of continuity when the character reveals his background. Everything else is told in reverse. For most of the movie, you are lost, like this man, caught in a perpetual state of disbelief and confusion. However, as the forward clips and the reverse clips intersect, the story comes together completely. For a movie that ends with what is technically the middle, it has an unbelievable twist. The dialogue is thought-provoking and clever, the direction is flawless, and Guy Pearce gives, in my opinion, his best performance ever. Go and see Memento",Memento
891,XIOMANGER,"I had a summary, but my memory is too fallible!",10,26 October 2004,"Right when I began watching the movie, since the very moment that picture in the opening credits started disappearing and the initial kill, I wondered is this just one of those gimmick movies or will they actually follow through with this idea till the end. I say this because, without a doubt, the idea of a movie played entirely in reverse (as opposed to flashbacks or other narrative non-linear-story-telling devices) is quite bold and unconventional, at least before other movies such as Irreversible started copying Memento. That this reverse storytelling serves a purpose to actually for the most part enter the world of our character is even more worthy of compliment. Instead of knowing the past we know the future, which is of little use as the future itself has to be redefined each time we go further into the past. The fact the movie comes up with fresh ways of challenging our perceptions of the future is another plus for it. The film-noir atmosphere is another plus. Guy Pearce's acting and conveying the emotions of an eternally heartbroken and disoriented person is yet another plus. Finally, an ending which completely and profoundly reverses all expectations, not only of all preceding events (in the future) but also of what these movies are genrewise supposed to be like, quite simply settles it for me. This movie is more than worthy of a 10.Memento is another one of those superb and almost perfect movies which is a joy to watch over and over again and continually ponder not just its plot but also the philosophical and emotional issues it raises.Rating 10/10Scale:Positive opinion of a movie: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OKNeutral opinion of a movie: 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 MediocreNegative opinion of a movie: 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE",Memento

Playing with time, while not a completely original concept, could make a film feel gimmicky and artsy. I am happy to say that this is not the case with ""Memento"", a clever and twisted thriller that makes the audience sympathize with the lead character by giving them, in essence, the same lack of info that the protagonist has. By telling the story in the fashion that the writer and director have chosen, if you don't pay keen attention to every line and every character, the film will definitely lose it's impact. The final twist is a whopper that I never saw coming and yet I didn't feel at all cheated. On the contrary, I wanted to watch it again (which I did immediately) and see if I could pick up on clues (which there are in abundance). If you like movies that challenge you to think while you watch, give this one a try.",Memento
893,swedeandsour,Great film with a great plot twist,8,23 February 2016,"A critical review of a film I liked.I saw this film when it came out and rewatched it again, knowing what the twist was. It is a great film, but once the twist is revealed, there's not much else in it.There aren't memorable or iconic shots, locations or scenes, memorable or quotable lines or dialogues, soundtrack or strong characters. The timeline doesn't allow for much character development, but characters are still one dimensional - they are who they are and that's about it. We only get to see a thin slice of time, so don't expect character growth or change, but one could still expect strong, unique, memorable characters. There's none of that.There isn't much of a sub-plot or other threads competing for our attention or making the story deeper or more complex.The locations were also anonymous. Everything is there just to serve the twist. There is nothing more, nothing less. It would've been interesting to be lead to a false conclusion before the reveal, or have elements that raise doubt or debate in the viewer's mind - there's none of that.My biggest complaint is that the film is not that enjoyable for the duration of the film, except the ending. If one were to leave before the end, he would not have enjoyed the film at all, whereas that is not the case in most films. As someone who rewatched it knowing the ending, parts of it felt boring.This was not a great film with a twist at the end, but a great twist with an okay film at the start. I never find myself googling quotes from the film, searching youtube for great scenes from it, don't remember the soundtrack at all.Compare this with Fight Club or Inception, where the soundtrack, characters, scenes, events and lines have such a lasting impact on viewers. But those are different films with bigger budgets, so I'm not penalizing Memento for that. I'm penalizing it for not being very enjoyable without the ending.I still give it an 8/10 because although it does one thing, it does it very, very well.",Memento

There is literally nobody that I have shown this movie to who didn't immediately like the plot- structure(and I have shown it to quite a number of people). The movie goes backwards and basically starts with the end, a murder. You then consistently go back in Leonard's memories, always rewinding a piece as if you actually were the protagonist himself. The best thing about this is: You never know what happened previously, just like Leonard doesn't. You have to figure. That's what makes this an incredibly good movie on it's own right, the creative story telling and the integration of Leonard's condition of not knowing anything that previously happened. But the end is just the cherry on the cake, literally a mind-blower you can't possibly expect when watching this movie the first time.

Therefore, he writes notes on his body and on photographs so he can remember things. However, many of these notes are vague because he didn't have much time, and he ends up doing some things that he doesn't even know why he wanted to do it. The really crazy thing about this movie, though, is the way it is told. One timeline in the movie starts at the end of the story and works backwards to the middle; the other one starts at the beginning and goes to the middle. The ""main"" storyline, the one that goes backwards, is the best because it always keeps you guessing and wondering why he wrote certain notes.

What's very interesting is how you have to think for a while then you get it. Spoilers ahead stop reading if you haven't seen it yet!
You have the movie starting with him shooting Teddy, and then how he got there in the next scene, but what's funny is you think it's leading up to (or I guess leading down to) how he's going to reveal that Teddy is the bad guy. He is not! He's a cop, a not crooked one but a cop all the same, that's using a guy with no short-term memory to kill off drug dealers. Then you have Natalie, who seems nice but is ripping him off just the same and is using him to kill drug dealers that are competition and to get the cop off of the streets. You have him being used by everyone around to fit their purpose, turning him from a man on a revenged quest to basically a serial killer. They make him kill who they want as long as they justify it will help him. It's very well told and really makes you mad that the guy you're rotting for is a killer that's been duped. Nobody is a good guy. There is no hero. And why is it good then? It plays with your mind so well, you walk away and contemplate on it forever. Great movie, one of Nolan's best ever.",Memento

As we left the cinema and walked home we couldn't work the story out. Had we been given enough information after the apparently abrupt ending? Was Leonard's wife diabetic? Had he already avenged her death (having unwittingly killed her)? Had we really seen him, with tattoos, with her? Were the occasional flashes of memory (like remembering that the licence plate was fact six) down to his sometime failing or the scriptwriter's fallibility. Or was that the point? That we spent time after the film trying to recreate the story proved the fallibility of our memories - a meta-level, interactive display of what we'd just seen.

901,mrhonorama,Manipulative but entertaining,7,28 April 2001,"Christopher Nolan deserves points for not only building on a clever premise, but providing a great deal of drama and comedy, without ever destroying the overall tone of the movie.  The 'beginning at the end' approach really sucks you in, and it is easy to see how it could have been a disaster in the wrong hands.  Nolan is aided by three terrific primary actors -- Guy Pearce brings a tricked up intensity to his role -- part Ed Exley (his L.A. CONFIDENTIAL character) and part a guy who is both frustrated by his situation, yet still sees some humor in it.  Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Panitalano (sp.?) are likewise outstanding, particularly Moss, whose character shifts tones a few times as the plot progresses backwards.However, the ending of the movie is part of THE USUAL SUSPECTS school, which many people, judging by the ratings, apparently love.  For me, the ending, like that of USUAL SUSPECTS is a screenwriter cheat -- perhaps moreso here. Instead of building to a logical conclusion (or a logical beginning?), the ending is decidedly random in a manner that suggests more that Nolan didn't know how to end the story, rather than providing a true resolution.  When screenwriters get into this 'playing god' mode, I wish that maybe they'd try to pull a page out of the literary playbooks of Flann O'Brien and Alasdair Gray, and set up a confrontation between the lead character and the writer, who ultimately determines the character's fate.This is essentially an terrific bunch of magic tricks.

I thought it was well done in directing, cinematography and just an all around good plot. If you are going to rent this, give yourself enough time to watch it a few times before you return it.",Memento

That's why you're so good at it.""",9,9 April 2001,"(*probable spoilers*) I read a review of The Talented Mr Ripley which summed up a large part of that film for me. It said something like, ""It's when he kills that we feel most sorry for him"".  Well Memento's backwards approach doesn't give us that context immediately, but towards the end it has sunk in just how sad this story really is.  In some ways they are alike; stories about people who have little in the way of identity, only iron clad purpose and desire.  They don't know who they are, but they're fairly certain where they have to go (even if deluded on that front as well).  Stories about the manufacturing of truth. I liked Memento better too.  Despite its depressing basis its not relentlessly sad. Leonard's deadpan narration, ""Now, where was I?"", cry of the perpetually distracted, is pretty funny at times.  And further illustrates what's wrong with him. In fact, pretty much everything about this film does (well, as much as it could for people with brains that can piece together a film).  Many will dismiss it as gimmicky and say the rug is pulled out right at the end.  But it's interesting and entertaining in every way.  Don't miss it.

I was captivated from the very beginning with the clever filming technique, the clear, yet confusing plot line, the interesting story...  Memento lived up to everything I had heard and expected.  Right until the end. NOTE:  do not read any further if you wish to remain in suspense until the end of the movie.
The movie created an excellent mood of suspense and curiosity as the plot points slowly fell together and everything began to make sense.  The girl, the drug dealer, the murder...  it all started to come clear, and, as I had suspected from the beginning, there would be a surprise ending, though, given the terms of the actual movie, it was hardly a ""surprise"".  The final confrontation brought Teddy and our ""hero"" together...  and then, there was no hero.  There is no one to root for here.  There is no tragic savior, there is no revelation, at least one worth being excited about.  The cop is as crooked as could be assumed, the drug dealer was a drug dealer, and our ""hero"" turns out to be nearly the worst of all.  It is a huge let-down for me to discover that there is no justice in the world of forgetfulness of Leonard, our tragic man who is used by everyone, including himself.  It's hard to even feel sorry for him anymore.  It all falls apart. Of course, that is my only qualm with the movie.

Its about a man named Leonard who uses notes, pictures, and the tattoo's on his body to try and find the man who he thinks raped and killed his wife. Not too often do you have movies that start from the end of the movie and finish at the beginning using multiple jump cuts, giving you more information each time but also going back farther from the beginning scene. Within the first five minutes a guys head gets blown off and you have no idea why. The reason why i thought this movie was so great was that throughout the movie you are trying to put all the pieces together just as Leonard is. You feel like your in his shoes throughout the entire movie which keeps the audience enticed. I thought it was great in the end finding out that he had actually already killed the man who killed his wife but it never stuck with him, so to make it stick he just changed the details to be remembered as if his friend Teddy Gammel did it because him and the killer have the same last name.",Memento
921,BooChanan,Not very fulfilling,10,28 April 2013,"Memento was the film that really got Christopher Nolan noticed and it is my personal favorite of his films, just because it is so unique. It uses a non-linear structure that Nolan has used in a lot of his films and gives it a very dark, tense theme. The structure is reverse-chronological and, therefore, means that the film starts at the end of the story and end at the beginning. But what makes this particular use of it so spectacular is that, for the whole film, you know that the film is going to end with the beginning but, as you reach it, Nolan pulls all certainty away from you; leaving you craving for more. This film is not very fulfilling due to the structure - the viewer still wants to see more - and that's what makes it such a memorable film. Nolan's directing skills aren't the only great feature of this film. His script is also stunning. It involves the main character, Guy Pearse, talking to himself but, almost, addressing us; allowing us into his head. Guy Pearse's acting is superb, portraying all the emotions that his character would have. The rest of the (rather small) cast are also great and help to give the viewer the uncertainty that makes this film so great.Christopher Nolan took on a tricky idea to make a good film of and executed it in a very clever way. A film that should be seen by any Nolan fan or wannabe-director. 10/10",Memento
922,Krazykopper,Unforgettable,10,23 December 2004,"Undoubtedly the most astounding piece of work Hollywood had produced in decades. If Hitchcock was around today even he would surely bow to this movie's understated genius. What is undeniable here is the urge to keep watching. From the start you are shown the plot's climax, but to make sense of it you are pushed into rewind, slowly absorbing the plot, only understanding fully the end (or the beginning), by enduring long enough to finally see the revelations laid down at the beginning (or the end). Anyone who has watched the Easter egg chronological order of this on DVD will know it is not the plot but the reverse telling of the story in which the genius lies. This is a film that doesn't just entertain through its runtime , it will keep you enthralled for days as the outstanding plot reveals more and more with closer scrutiny through 'dare I say it', your own attempt to piece it together through memory. The little known Chris Nolan has outdone himself with this marvel and although his subsequent effort 'Insomnia' failed to make quite the same impression it will be interesting to see what he makes of the much anticipated 'Batman Begins'. A shrewd movie lining up Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano fresh from their success in the original Matrix movie. It is the performance of Guy Pearce 'LA Confidential & Neighbours (sorry Guy had to mention it)' that is enthralling. The audience insight through him into the complex life of a man with no memory is mesmerising. Many films which gradually unveil a series of complicated twists fall down upon subsequent viewing, but this delivers time and time again. In a time when originality is the greatest gift that a talented film maker can give us, this is without doubt the best example of a gripping original film ever made. It is just a shame that such original, independent films go unrecognised by the academy.Don't dare miss this 10-10",Memento
923,lazylaurablue,Intricate weave of several agendas,10,5 September 2005,"This film gets the 10/10 rating in my book as although I am not 100% sure I understand it fully, it is possibly that little bit of remaining intrigue that makes me love it. Maybe it's because I'm middle-aged and slow of brain that I have to watch it twice before I work out what's really going on, and a third time just to be sure, and yet a fourth time to make sure I haven't missed anything the third time. Is/was Teddy a bad guy or is/was he just trying to do his job the best way he knows how, and give Lenny a purpose too? And Natalie, is she bad or just angry? Maybe the plot really is that convoluted. In my opinion, rather.Lennie, in his own quest for revenge with his inability to make new memories, hard as he may try, is the perfect vehicle for anyone like Natalie smart enough to use for their own purposes. Everyone is using this guy, from Natalie to the hotel clerk; if he knows he doesn't care, well not for long anyway, most importantly he has to kill John G.""Remember Sammy Jankis"". It appears that Teddy is the first person to take advantage of Lennie by using him to bump off an undesirable, but it's hard to tell from the film whether Teddy has persuaded him that his wife was murdered by junkies or if Lennie has persuaded himself of it because of an inability to accept the awful truth. Or maybe he doesn't remember the truth, maybe Sammy Jankis' story is that close to the truth.I love it. I'm not sure if there's a philosophical point to the movie, but it's a very, very clever idea, beautifully acted by all. If you want some food for thought and a plot so convoluted it takes more than one viewing to unravel it to it's full extent, this is an excellent film.",Memento

What's happening? Who am I?"" really gets to you and leaves you with a slight feeling of helplessness and apathy after the last scene.

Is the top 250 list hijacked?,8,13 July 2007,"So many of us are asking these questions (me too) that I can't resist writing the 1743th comment :) Q1: I give it an 8 (I give good movies 7-8) but I make the official vote 7 to even out the over-rated 10's. It's a good movie ... for being able to take an attentive viewer to think loud with and think like Lenny. I like the feeling that everything is unreliable and conflicting but not quite, and like Lenny, we're struggling to label and put down all possible hints to give ourselves a ""consistent"" story we can come into terms with (there is no truth ... that's life). I particularly like the debate on distortions of memory and interpretations verses facts, and how even the process of recording can be tailored for our purpose (brief spoiler -- the handwriting). The movie is successful in sharing these good ideas, due to excellent choices in the editing and the filming. It's also somewhat philosophical, giving the movie even a little depth and intellect beyond the regular thrill and entertainment. Not sure why I won't give a 9 ... I guess to score 9-10, a movie has to be good beyond reason, and here, I am still reasoning.For comparison, Taxi Driver also takes the viewer to feel like Travis, but is more superior to me. Eternal Sunshine debates between over remembering the good and forgetting the painful parts of a relation, but falls short of doing the right job. Now, the top-250-problem. I agree with many others that the top list is overwhelmed by the lack of criticism and breadth. It still serves a reasonable function to recommend well deserved movies, but the strong bias for ""popular"" movies prevents many other better movies to be brought to the limelight. (How can OK-movies like Pan's Labyrinth, Eternal, or the Departed get so close to Memento???) No one wants to use a top-1000 list, but together with filtering, we can have more versions of the top-list? Just like the filters for the comments, one can view the list with votes from prolific authors, or foreign movies only, or movies below/above a certain budget?

927,jakemelin1217,Made a good impression,8,24 March 2020,"""Memento"" is the first major film directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Guy Pearce and Carrie-Ann Moss, based on the short story by his brother, Jonathan Nolan.The film is about a man with short term memory loss, who investigates his wife's murder.Critically acclaimed director Christopher Nolan is a household name in the film industry, responsible for giving us films like ""The Dark Knight"", ""Interstellar"", ""The Prestige"" and ""Inception"". He is known for telling stories in a non-linear fashion, and revolves around the themes of obsession and memory, and often uses practical effects.Memento tells a great story of a man obessesed with finding his wife's killer, the mystifying ""John G"". Nolan takes the audience along with Lenny, or as he likes to be called, Leonard (Pearce). The story is such an original concept, combined with the interfering style of editing, how the story plays out from end to beginning. Sections of the film are in black and white, which plays in a linear fashion, while the colour scenes, are non-linear. Original and very clever. This subjective point of view that we have with the character engages the viewers with the story, finding out mysteries as soon as Leonard finds them, being as equally surprised. The film is riddled with tension. As we see what the outcome of the film is, we still don't know how it will play out, always figuring things out with the character.The prop work is to praised. The idea of Polaroid pictures used for Leonard to remember places and people by is an excellent way to drive the story. Leonard writes the names down, and little notes to go along with them when he does forget, so he has an idea of who they are. The mysterious scratch on Leonard's face is ambiguous. No one knows where it came from.Guy Pearce is very good in the film, portraying this fractured character, desperate to find the killer. His performance is underrated and should be praised a lot more.Overall: 8.3/10",Memento
928,joannaraspberry,The best movie I have ever seen,10,28 May 2015,"The story is there is a man named Leonard who has had short term memory loss since his wife was raped and murdered and now he's out for revenge against the killer, who he believes to be Teddy. And because of his condition he takes Polaroids and gets tattoos of what he wants to remember. The only thing I didn't like about the film was it (ironically) required memory as the story was told in an odd way, with the colour bits going backward in time e.g if at the start of the first one they said 'what are you doing . . .' at the end of the next one they'd say 'what are you doing . . .' and with the black and white bits going forward in time before they eventually met at the end of the film. Although it was a little inconvenient to remember everything that had happened it was a very interesting and clever was to tell the story as things you thought were true throughout the film were made lies as you learnt more. The story wasn't too hard to follow as long as you were paying attention and the acting was amazing. I really liked how it made you question things while you watching it. Overall a fantastic film, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a not too complicated Nolan film/a very interesting look into how memory is not the most reliable thing in the world/a person just wanting an amazing film.",Memento

932,IvanX,"imaginative and clever, but morally empty",7,13 January 2002,"(PLENTY OF SPOILERS)Memento was a neat trick, which I found to be engrossing throughout. Whether or not it was a ""gimmick,"" I thought the gimmick added something, and did partially simulate the character's experience for the viewer; every scene unfolds without any knowledge of the scene before it, meaning you always start disoriented and need to rely on the character's notes to figure out what is going on.In many ways, it is just a clever way of telling a detective story; detectives try to recreate what happened in the past, and this movie takes it the next step and simply tells the story backwards. Unlike the Blair Witch Project, in this movie the gimmick helped absorb me in the story.However, the movie has a fatal flaw in my view, which is that it seems to take place in a kind of inexplicable moral vacuum, which prevents any serious identification with (or even belief in) the characters. It is not only cold, as many have noted, but positively barren in terms of anyone in the movie having any normal concern over human life. Leonard is not presented as someone who has any background which would lead him to serial killing, and yet that is what he does, and no one even questions him for a moment, as if bloody revenge is just something that everyone talks about over coffee. The movie takes at face value Leonard's conclusion that murder is the only, best, and most natural way for him to heal.Leonard believes the world will be a better place if his wife's death is avenged, even if he has no satisfaction in knowing that it happened. At any point, he could simply choose to forget, but the fantasy of revenge gives his life purpose. Fine, I can sort of accept that. But no one challenges him; no one questions him; in fact, people use him to carry out their own dirty business. I realize there are bad people in the world and all that, and I have enjoyed a great many movies about them. However, in this movie, there is not a single person who acts honestly; no one fails to take advantage of Leonard, and no one challenges Leonard's fundamental mission, even as they are fully aware he could kill an innocent more easily than his man (which, in the end, it appears that he has).It's like a world where honesty and loyalty have never existed, and, since it's neither sci-fi nor a movie about low-lifes or criminals, that makes it a hard world to take seriously. It would have made more sense to me if he were a cop or something, but instead he is a mild-mannered insurance adjuster who really knows his way around with a gun and has no problem assaulting people with tire irons.But let's say, whatever, he got really messed up by his wife's assault, is hell-bent on revenge, and even though he could choose to forget, he doesn't want to. Ok. But then, if the end of the movie is to be believed, (BIG SPOILERS), it appears that he has already had his vengeance, and after ALL of his meticulous notes that he keeps for EVERYTHING, it would appear he chose to forget about it, invalidating what for him is the single most important event in the world, the thing that makes his breadcrumbs in time worth creating.But THEN, even better, he makes the conscious decision to forget, again, and choose not just an arbitrary target but someone he knows has helped him, just so that his life has meaning. It's a great one-two sucker punch for the audience, but it makes no sense. He makes a conscious decision that the lives of others (his friends even), *and his wife's assault and death,* are less important than his need to have a mystery to solve. So in the end, he just winds up being truly pathological, which is not really that interesting; he was much more interesting as a wounded man with a mysterious and disabling condition he must push past in order to heal his wounds (if dubiously) and right his wrongs.(Some have pointed out the ""I did it"" tattoo in a scene with his wife; I missed this, but since it doesn't appear elsewhere in the movie, it seems like it may have only been part of the weird impressionism of the scene, and not really there; and if he had it removed somehow, then he's even more pathological than I imagined.)Even his wife's/Sammy's wife suicide by taking advantage of the condition demonstrates a curious lack of humanity -- before ever consulting a doctor or psychologist, she finally chooses to take her own life by allowing their loved one to kill them via a cruel test. Who does this? Again, it is as if, in the world of the movie, people just don't think about life and death in the same way the rest of us do.And the thing is, a movie is completely entitled to have that perspective -- but it doesn't serve this one very well. This movie is a murder mystery with a main character you have to be sympathetic toward in order to make it through the film, in order to make his journey yours, as well a meditation on the nature of memory. However, the life-indifferent perspective makes it hard to identify, and clouds the discussion on memory. It just gets in the way.So, in the end, great idea, fine acting, entertaining execution, good brain candy, worth watching for sure, but ultimately hobbled by a serious lack of believability of the motivations of the characters due to an unexplainable indifference to human life and emotion, demonstrated by every character in the movie. It kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth in the end.",Memento

Obviously it is the delivery, rather than what would otherwise have been a simple story, that is the key to this film.  Starting at the end and then working backwards in the style of the affliction which affects and fragments the lead characters mind, one has to do mental gymnastics trying to cope with seeing the cause of after seeing it's effect.Not a Sunday afternoon flick, this is a film that you really have to watch and concentrate all the time if you are to get to the end knowing what is going on.  Many people I have spoken to have been put off by the fact that you frequently have to go long periods not understanding why something has happened, but I think that is part of the beauty.Saying any more would give the game away - but this is up there with Being John Malkovich in the originality stakes...",Memento

939,c.huddle-lamb,kudos to the 2/3rds of a script they call a movie,6,19 December 2001,"It's a pretty cool idea. The last thing Leonard (Guy Pearce) remembers is someone killing his wife - since then he's had a head injury and has not been able to form new memories (a little like the start to Dark City). He takes pictures, makes notes, tattoos himself to try to order his life - but ultimately he does not know what he's doing. All that drives him is the desperate desire to track down the elusive 'John G.', who raped and murdered his wife. The film starts at the end of the story and works backwards (yes Raquel - backwards).  The only problem is, the scriptwriters seem to have suffered the same defect as their protagonist and forgot to wrap up all the questions actually posed at the start of their script.
Just when you're thinking ""This is a really clever piece of film!   I have no idea what the real answer is."" the screen goes blank and the credits start to roll. The story doesn't go back to who actually killed his wife, and dodges with some philosophy about 'who are we if we don't have our memories' - which is nice, but not strong or original enough to justify the weak script. Plus, this philosophical point is not exactly proven by the sudden ending - it would have been just as strong with some answers to the plot.Like: Who is Teddy? Why is he really involved? Was Leonard actually caught up with the other characters before his wife died? Why does he have two, apparently contradictory, sets of memories? Just a couple of big holes that lower the quality of what had the potential to be a really brilliant film. Still kudos to the acting, directing, and the 2/3rds of the script that they call a movie.",Memento

In fact I would almost advise you to watch it by yourself or with a very die-hard movie fan friend. Just a little conversation with your friend or girlfriend can totally derail you from the path of the movie...it's already hard enough to totally understand in 1 round...I needed 2 to get everything straight.The 3 main actors(Pearce,Moss,Pantoliano) give,not stellar,but great performances nonetheless...the movie plot surely gives kudos to their performances...I found Pearce to be the best of the three...his confused voice,his empty from opinion face and,of course,his blocknote-body make Leonard come to life...Moss,was good also,she has in her face the mystery the role needs...the good girl that is not totally what she seems to be... Remarkable is the scene where she shouts and curses Leonard,by stating him that she can tell him whatever she likes,since he will not remember anything soon enough,transforming him into a mere puppet...my personal favorite onePantoliano,at last,gives the movie what it lacks:the funny element,without becoming a clown,but by showing us at least a smile in the mysterious world of Leonard...Opponents like The Usual Suspects or Silence of the Lambs are,not easily,but slightly beaten in my opinion...They are great movies too,but to me they lack the so perfect identification Memento offers us...Nolan has proved to be a genius director and screenwriter,as he continuously show's us in his new movies-he is today my favorite director.He hasn't directed many movies,but those 6 or 7 ones he gave us, are all brilliant and thought provoking...To Sum Up,Memento is truly Nolan's Masterpiece and a jewel in the Thriller Museum.

946,malberts1,Probably the most overrated movie of recent memory.,3,10 September 2002,"First of all, this is not a horrible movie.  It does keep you mildly interested.  But it has several, fatal flaws. One reviewer mentioned that the film was too clever by half.  I totally concur.  The film went out of its way to create something unique, and in the process lost the entire narrative structure.  So when it ends, you barely even know if it happened.  In fact, you don't know that it happened.  If Leonard was delusional about Sammy, then perhaps he was delusional about all the characters in the movie.  The fact is, you will never know.The problem is, this doesn't make for a good film.  Good films are those where the narrative art is enhanced by the photography.  By this measure, the movie fails, as the photography does almost nothing to tell the story, and Guy Pearce is as milquetoast a leading man as there is.  The fact is, the film is about trying to put you in his shoes, to show you what Leonard must have felt like living with no memory, but you end up feeling nothing at all because he is such a bland character actor.  I would compare this film in some ways to Se7en--except that Se7en does a much better job telling the story (even if the ending wasn't at all surprising).  The major difference is that you care about what happens to the characters in Se7en.  There is no empathy with Leonard, partly because the film never gives you the chance because it's too busy being clever.Perhaps people will rate it highly, but it is definitely not a Citizen Kane or Casablanca, a movie where you can take it out and watch it over and over again.  It's far too dismal for that.  It's more a movie like Resevoir Dogs, where you like the idea (and perhaps the execution), but the way the story is put together keeps it from being a classic.3/10",Memento

Thank you Christopher Nolan for this unique piece of film making and not considering us as intellectually redundant. The film is by my standards (which are pretty cynical I'm told) a modern masterpiece. Everything about this film is delivered in great detail, from the colour schemes to the cinematography. Nolan gets the structure spot on, if he twists it too much, it becomes wrapped up in so many layers it becomes uninjectable, too little and it becomes pointless and weak. The characters are brilliantly written, even if the dialogue at times is a little pretentious. Pearce and Pantoliano are both excellent and Carie Ann Moss is annoying, which is a shame, but excusable.

949,Mark1988,Mind Bending Suspense!,9,10 July 2007,"I can't think of a word to describe Memento. What is entirely original and delightfully complicated? 'Intricate' is a complete understatement in the case of this film. Memento simply grabs the viewer by the throat with these two elements. You'll be astounded by the nuances in the plot and puzzled by the unique way in which the story is assembled.With that aside, Memento is a film in which the more effort you put into solving the riddle the more pleasure you will get in return. The story itself for those who don't already know, concerns a man who suffers a rare form of short-term memory failure (""It's not amnesia!""). Leonard cannot make new memories, however he still recollects who he is and his goal; track down the murderer of his late wife. This setting opens up some interesting opportunities for the superb direction/writing of Christopher Nolan. Leonard can be manipulated easily and must resort to piecing together his puzzling existence using photos, notes and tattoos. His condition makes the entire film feel like an intricate puzzle with plenty of twists and turns. Fortunately Nolan never lets Memento collapse into a stereotypical whodunit style mystery.The most important technical aspect of the film is without a doubt the editing. Presumably to allow viewers to experience a world where the present isn't in anyway validated by the past, the time-sequence is inverted kind of. The film presents two stories, one going forward, one backward, one black and white, one color, both involving Leonard while the circumstances in which the two stories take place is left curiously ambiguous. This convoluted structure is the film's greatest asset. This film is nail-biting not because of teenage-fantasy-action but because the fundamental question of 'why did that scene just happen' is never fully answered. The uncertainty and intrigue in every scene is a superb emulation of Leonard's mind-state.Sound confusing? Good! Memento is a startling original and exhilarating thriller. This movie genuinely deserves its spot in the top-250. The absorbing, troubled and uncertain atmosphere of Memento will definitely stay with you long after the credits roll. An absolute gem.",Memento

It's nothing more and nothing less. Yes, the plot and the way it's told (backwards) is clever, but hey, so was 'the butler did it' once. Face it: ALL plots in thrillers are clever in some way or another. That's no reason to call the movie brilliant. It takes more than that. A brilliant movie is a movie that tells you something about the world, about people, about yourself. This movie just tells you a nice story. It's well-made, well-acted, and well-thought-out. Although some stuff is really too hard to believe. But it doesn't matter as long as you're just expecting a solid ride, not a life-changing experience. By the way, there have been many movies and books which are told backwards. This movie is nothing new in this respect. OT: For example, read the book 'Time's Arrow' by Martin Amis. It's a story about WWII told backwards. The good thing there is that it gives you new insights about history of events and of how people thought during the war.",Memento

Memento is one of them, and it is brilliant.The cast plays to the perfection (my award would go to Guy Pierce who plays the tormented Leonard Shelby masterfully !)

960,micahbundy,Masterpiece in Reverse,10,12 February 2018,"Memento is written and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film follows Leonard (Guy Pearce), who is trying to track down the man that murdered and raped his wife. However, he struggles with this due to his reoccurring short-term memory loss. He copes with this by writing everything that he deems important, on photos and on his body. He does this in an effort to find out who killed his wife. The best aspect of the film is how you are thrown into Leonard's shoes, while part of this is due to Guy Pearce's great performance, this is mostly due to director Christoper Nolan's brilliance in writing and directing. He does this by using repetition and telling the story in reverse. This film uses repetition very effectively. Leonard constantly suffers from his short-term memory and has to remind himself of what his life looks like after the event that causes his short-term memory loss. He does this by checking his pictures and his writing to see what he drives, where he lives, what clues he has, and which people are a part of his life, as well as how he feels about these people. Like I said, the film does this a lot, putting emphasis on his condition. This, as well as Pearce's performance, makes the condition extremely believable. The film is brilliantly told in reverse. As the film progresses backwards, not only is more revealed about Leonard's character, but just as much is revealed about the characters around him. What kind of a person they are, what their motivations are, and why they're involved in the life of someone like Leonard. It feels like peeling an onion, each time the film works its way backwards, we get another layer of these characters around him. This is done well throughout the course of this film and makes their motivations and their role in Leonard's life clear by the end of the film. As these characters around him develop, a question is posed. Who killed Leonard's wife? During the beginning of the film, there is a prime suspect with an overwhelming amount of evidence for this question. But as the film goes on, this becomes unclear and more characters are thrown into the mix. As the characters develop they also become part of the list of suspects. This creates a feeling of uncertainty throughout the course of the film, which makes the film addictive and fun to figure out.Another great aspect of this film is how it creates a question during the film and quickly answer itself as the film works its way backwards. This helps you put the clues together and gets you that much closer to solving the murder. The film does this a lot and the sequences are short and choppy. Although, halfway through the film there is a particular sequence that drags on and I ended up forgetting what question I was trying to answer in the first place. Fortunately, the film picks back up after this. Overall, Memento is an excellent film. It's brilliantly written and directed. Nolan does a great job of putting you in Leonard's shoes, which makes the film addictive. Guy Pearce gives a great performance, that is complimented by the supporting actors who are well written and have great character development. This film is one of a kind and makes for an easy: 10/10",Memento

962,Larry-17,All Night and into the Day,10,17 May 2001,"All night, I kept waking.  Bits of the film kept crawling out of the dark. A monster movie where  the demons are ideas:  What the hell is reality?  Who am I?  What do I want?  No, no:  What do I really want?Reality is facts.  Yes.  Facts tied together by memory--by context.  But memory lies...every cop knows eyewitnesses are highly unreliable...the ""Rashomon effect.""  You can't build a solid case on the shifting sands of memories.  Facts can lie too, facts can be manipulated.  Facts require context to structure reality.  Pieces of this film kept resonating with me on the walk home, later at night...  I warn you: if you see it, you'll want to go back.  If you like it, that is.  You may hate it.  You may find it too much trouble.  It isn't a ride, it's a forced march through some pretty rocky topography.  Or you may just hate it because you do!  But if you are as drawn into it as I am, you'll want to go back to nail it down.  I know there are things I missed, facts that are left slippery, details that are kept vague, details that pass by so quickly and which alter the terrain completely...Imagine: you wake up.  You don't know where you are.  You know you don't have amnesia.  This is ongoing reality, you know that. It is that your brain cannot build new memories.  You remember your life perfectly, you think, up to a point.  The rest...?  Your present--where you are, who you're talking to, where you're going--is based on the notes you've jotted down on the Polaroids you've take.  Pictures of places, of people, of signal events in your recent life...  You know you took them, that you wrote the notes.  You recognize your handwriting.  You build each scene of your life on that construct and from it, you measure out your actions.  You know that because you've conditioned yourself to know it.Your life is a quest, your body has been conditioned to know that too: you have to find the person who did this to you, who killed someone close to you.  Your life is about revenge.  What is revenge for a man who has no memory?  Whose reality is an eternal now' without a firm context.  What meaning has any relationship?  Any fact?While the technique of telling a tale from backwards is not new, this is without a doubt the most compelling film I've seen in a long time.  Telling it backwards, in this case, is the only way to tell this tale.  Like any good thriller, the plot is a labyrinth.  At first it seems simple: You enter here.  You work your way through.  You arrive at the end.  Done.  Nope.  It is much more complex than that.  On top of the twists and turns are questions.  Why am I doing this?  What do I want?  Who is with me and who is against me?  Each answer seems firm, yet not.Complex.  At the heart of it, though, it is elegantly simple.It holds your attention throughout and, after it ends, it resonates.  It's filled with ideas...ideas about life, the nature of perception and...did I say it already?...of reality.  This isn't about murderers and vengeance. It's about you.  It keeps you thinking, keeps you frightened.  Into the night.",Memento

You will be talking about Memento at work, at the grocery store (to total strangers!), and you will find yourself joining conversations when you hear the word ""Memento."" That's why this little film that received almost no marketing stayed in theaters for months and was in the top 10 money makers for several weeks.The movie starts with a murder -- a revenge killing, in fact. But was the right person killed?Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man with no short-term memory. He hasn't been able to form new memories since the night his wife was murdered. Now he's on a hunt to find the murderer but with no way of remembering names, dates, places, facts and faces. Instead he tattoos himself with mementos of his search. When someone knows his name, he checks Polaroids to see if he knows them. Does he like this person? Does he trust this person? Is this the killer? He doesn't know unless he's scribbled a note.Don't worry about trying to empathize with Leonard because Writer/Director Christopher Nolan puts you right in Leonard's shoes. You live the story in reverse order so that you never know more than Leonard does. In one scene you see Leonard getting information from a person who knows him -- maybe a good person; maybe bad. In the next scene you see a previous meeting between the two which sheds more light on their relationship. Later still you see how they met. But is that all of the story? You've yet to find out... and you won't know everything until the last scene. By living it backwards, you, like Leonard, have no knowledge of what came before.It's brilliant story telling. But you might get frustrated because you don't know what's going on. That's normal. In fact, that's the whole idea. Just sit back, try to relax (though that's difficult in this movie), and find out just how twisted and complex Leonard's world is.This film will leave its own memento on your mind, and you'll have a hard time forgetting how much you enjoyed it.",Memento
967,DrLetoPicard,Intriguing but not mind-blowing.,8,7 September 2001,"Memento is one of the most intriguing films I've seen in recent years, but it hardly deserves the current ranking it has in the top 250 films of all time.We begin the film with the murder of the man whom our hero believes raped and killed his wife, and move backwards throughout the entire plot. Each segment moves forward narratively, but comes after the scene which follows it. Meanwhile, in black and white, we follow a short space of time somewhere in past in which Leonard talks about his life as an insurance investigator before his wife's murder.The main character suffers from a brain injury, acquired at the time of his wife's murder, which has destroyed his short-term memory. He can't remember what has just happened to him, but remembers everything up to the ""incident"" - his name, his wife, his job. He deals with life in 15-minute snatches, as if he was continually waking up in a strange room. In one especially clever sequence, he is running through a trailer park with the thought, ""Okay, what am I doing? Ah. I'm chasing this guy. Wait. He's chasing me!"". He tattoos his body with important information relating to his pursuit of the man who killed his wife and destroyed his memory. He writes copious notes and takes Polaroids of people and writes crucial information about them on the back.All this is simply a device, a device which sometimes transcends the relatively standard plot which accompanies it, but not always. It does make the film worth watching. One of the hallmarks of a great director is being able to take a familiar story and tell it in a way that suprises us. It succeeds. The backwards storytelling puts us in the same predicament as Leonard; we don't know what just happened before this scene. We're confused, working off what he's written on pieces of paper and Polaroid photographs, with no knowledge of what has happened before (which will be displayed to us subsequently).Good system. The story, unfortunately, isn't entirely worthy of such a cool storytelling method, but it's still quite good, despite falling into some film noir cliches.The directing is crisp and the innovative editing style is enjoyable. The score is unnotable. The acting from all four of the major roles is outstanding. Leonard's character is incredibly sympathetic, which is crucial to such a film, although nobody is who we think they are by the time we've rewound through time far enough to understand what has come before (after).The DVD features an ability to watch the story in forward rather than reverse order, a perspective on the film I'm very much looking forward to experiencing.Totally worth watching, but don't expect the greatest film you've ever seen, despite the state of the votes at the moment (11th of all time). My rating: 8/10.",Memento

But I must urge those who have seen it to give it another viewing:  so many little lines and situations have such resonance when you know all the movie's secrets (which I won't spoil).  It is most interesting on second viewing to pay close attention to the characters of Natalie and Teddy, as they are the most inscrutable; while they still have great mystery and complexity, it's fun--knowing what you know the second time around--to watch their brains click along and get a better grip on their motives.

In twenty or so years, I believe this movie will finally be given its due rewards. The innovation of the storytelling and the directing of this movie will reshape the art of cinema as we know it. Some movies have employed non-linear structures to tell their stories. Although MEMENTO does indeed have a linear structure (merely inverted), the unique storytelling has never been so integral to the characters and plot of the movie as this one.Even though 2001 ended on a particularly strong note for movies, none surpassed this one in creativity and ambition. While the simpler movies collect all the awards this winter, MEMENTO will be the movie with the most impact upon the medium of filmmaking. I think that that speaks for itself.
As far as the movie itself, even if it was played forward, it would be compelling. The fact that it doesn't stick to convention makes it riveting. Guy Pearce proves that he is a great actor, even though he doesn't appear to want stardom. Good for him. Good for us.",Memento

My only negatives would be that it is quite dark and disturbing in its subject matter, with a lot of tension that some might find hard to deal with.

'It was fantastic...brilliant...best film I've seen in ages.' The real test is if the film sticks in your head. I saw Memento three months ago, and as soon as it is available to rent on video I will be first in line for a copy.The story concerns a man named Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce aka Ed Exley from LA Confidential, Mike from Neighbours), who as a consequence of witnessing his wifes rape and murder has lost his short term memory. He can only remember moments after this event in fifteen minute periods. Afterwards he forgets everything. He is trying to find his wifes killer, but the clues he gathers are not in his head. They are maps, diagrams, Polaroid photos, and tattoos of names and places which cover his body. He needs to rearrange this information to find the killer.This could have been a very straightforward thriller, but in the hands of director Christopher Nolan it becomes a film which will mess with your mind for weeks after viewing. The editing and cinematography really contribute to an air of extreme paranoia, as do the peformances of the actors (including the delectable Carrie-Anne Moss).In my view it was a scandal that this film was not exhibited in time for the Oscar nominations.

1000,brooksmurphy-1,The most innovative film ever to grace the cinema!,10,9 October 2002,"`What if I just forget about what I've done.what if I just pretend it never happened.' This is a quote from Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce) as he speaks of his own acts in the film `Memento'. Written and Directed by Christopher Nolan, adapted from a short story by his brother John Nolan; `Memento' is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. This is such a tough film to break down, due to its complexity; but I believe once you do break it down, you'll have a feeling of accomplishment that you would never have figuring out any other movie.Looking at this film broadly, it seems so simple: `Memento' is a psychological thriller about a man seeking revenge on his wife's rapist and killer. This is definitely a classic storyline. As you indulge yourself deeper into it, you find that the main character has a memory condition called Short-term Amnesia. This is a rare case where you remember your past before your accident, but you can't remember what you've done fifteen minutes ago, after your accident. To top that off, the film is edited where the last scene is the beginning and the beginning scene is the last.Although the film is structured oddly, many claim that this film is non-linear, but it's actually more linear than most films. If this film weren't as linear as it actually is, it wouldn't even work. The only obstruction is that the film is shown chronologically backwards by scene.As the film unfolds, the audience sees the darker side of the protagonist, which wasn't often seen in Classic Cinema. This is also true with the storyline; like the character, the stories weeds off and changes the audiences' perspective. The balance in the film is barely apparent and the key to this film, I believe, is disruption. This film was meant, among other things, to trick the audience. The great part about this film is, other than the disorder of scenes chronologically; this film hardly ever manipulates the audience with tricky character placements and camera shots. The only way it does, is through it's main character Leonard Shelby and this is due to the fact that he has a memory condition. Therefore, his mind is foggy and very uncertain. This mentality of the main character transcends beautifully upon the audience. This is one of the only films to ever do this.Technically, this film is a basic marvel. Veteran editor Dody Dorn: who was nominated for several awards, superbly pieced this film together. I loved the subtle photography and the ambient music and sound. Any dramatized musical score would have probably ruined the film.All in all this is a great story powered by great acting from the entire cast. The editing is sheer and flawless, with obstructions of only intentional means. The screenplay couldn't have been better, even from the simplistic basic story that the film displayed. Christopher Nolan is a prime example of a dedicated filmmaker, with so many aspirations for originality. A marvel accomplishment and one of the greatest films of all time!",Memento
1001,Mr_Noir,One of the most original movies you'll ever see.,8,25 May 2003,"Yeah, my plot summary is accurate. As I look at the titles on my DVD shelf, I realise that Memento - nestled comfortably between The Matrix and Ocean's Eleven - is easily the most unique title in my collection, and probably one of the most unique movies ever created.Christopher Nolan has done a hell of a good job here. This is a movie, that, much like Fight Club, is a movie that you have to watch at least 2 or 3 times before you can fully understand and appreciate it, but even then, this is by no means a bad thing. Memento is a movie that I find myself watching over and over, and it still isn't at all boring.Putting it simply, without spoiling anything, Memento's a movie that you have to see, and with it's extremely intricate storyline, will probably make a lot more sense the second time round. In fact, possibly the ONLY problem I can find with Memento is that the first time you watch it, it takes a little while for you to work out just what the hell's going on.

According to my view, i can only say that if this movie is a ""fill in the blank"" type puzzle, then if you put that thing in blank mind that ""The main character of the movie actually can remember everything at-least more than a normal person, and his so called friend is a habituated liar."" then there is a chance that you can solve it. that's all.",Memento

The filmstyle is superb, I won't say anything to spoil the movie but rather explain the style of its approach. The movie starts off in the end and it sequentially plays 'backwards' towards the start of the movie. A very ingenious method of filming, it leaves us guessing in the end (or shall I say start?). Easter eggs (I won't say which!) also linger in the movie which increases the question/discussion count. The character development is superb as it is the only movie to my recollection which 'un'develops the character. ALthough it might be confusing for a first viewing, watching it a second time will make the viewer yearning for more just to get his/her questions answered. Acting is superb, we are left with no hint of overacting or underacting in all cases. I would recommend for all to watch it at LEAST 2 times for the full effect of complete heavenly satisfaction.10/10 - Better keep this as a memento...",Memento

It's about a man who has a brain disorder where he can only remember things for about 4 minutes. He remembers who he is and he knows he has the disorder, and he remembers everything up until the attack. The movie starts with the end, and works its way back 4 minutes at a time until you know exactly why everything happened. You see the effect, and then you see the cause. It's not as complicated as it sounds and it really flows together nice so even the lesser intelligent watchers can follow the plot. Guy Pearce does an amazing job and he has the perfect voice for a fast talking, intelligent man who has to get things done fast so he doesn't forget. It's Christopher Nolan's first masterpiece and it wont be his last. It's every bit as good as Inception or The Dark Knight if not better. Every film buff should see this.

The first scene (or is that last?!) shows a man being killed by a gun but filmed in reverse. Thankfully the rest of the film is not people walking around in reverse etc but carefully layered scenes, each new one set chronologically before the previous.This opens up endless possibilities of twists, turns and humour, which Christopher Nolan takes full advantage of. Guy Pearce is at his absolute best playing Leonard Shelby, the man who cannot make new memories due to an injury sustained whilst himself and his wife were attacked. He therefore has an uphill task finding the true murderer of his dead wife which he has now set as his only goal in life.Matrix stars Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano give excellent support in this gripping and original tale which may take at least a couple of viewings to completely get your head round.The great concept, acting, score and of course editing make this an unmissable thriller.",Memento
1008,alan_nicoll,"Unique, challenging, and rewarding",9,19 October 2004,"Memento is a brilliantly conceived Chinese box puzzle of a movie. It tells of Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce) who, due to a brain injury, is unable to form new long-term memories. Every time he wakes up he has to rediscover his life and his quest, based on notes, photographs, and tattoos he has created for the purpose. The movie starts at the end and works backwards--most scenes begin with Leonard gathering the threads of his life together. The next scene then shows how he got to the beginning of the last scene. It's an unsettling technique, but it is also a marvelous idea, because it puts the viewer in a similar situation to that of Leonard. When he wakes up, he doesn't know where he is, and we don't, either. This is a unique conception, and it makes a movie not to be missed. Unfortunately, it is also rather unsavory, full of violence and murder; but it also comes to a piquant and satisfying conclusion. It's only later that one begins to pick apart the logic. Not for all tastes, and some viewers will start completely lost and never figure out what the heck is going on. But for those up to its challenges, Memento is a unique viewing experience.",Memento
1009,tlcglitznglam,brilliant fun!!! 4.5 out of 5,10,7 April 2005,"Memento is the type of movie you will watch once and immediately want to watch again. It is brilliant. I myself have watched it three times in the past two days: the first time, then I checked the official webpage (don't visit until after viewing) and comments here then watched it again, and then I watched it a third time, but this time backwards from scene to scene. It is suspenseful, funny, artistic,and keeps you guessing until the very end. Your ideas about the movie,the plot, and the characters will change many times while watching the film and the ending is nothing you expect. Even after it's over you still need to piece the movie together in your own mind to make some sense of it. Basically, it's about a man Lenny who has a memory disorder where he has no short term memory. His goal throughout the movie is to find and kill the man who raped and murdered his wife. He helps himself ""remember"" things by taking pictures of important people and places he encounters while searching for his wife's murderer. The movie is shown through two intertwined ""stories"". One is shot in black and white and is mostly of Lenny talking with someone on the telephone. The other is in color and these scenes are shown to us backwards... that is, starting with what happened most recently in the story line and ending with what happened and the ""beginning"" of the storyline. The purpose of this is to take us into the mind of Lenny, who can't remember more than small chunks of what he's been doing before he forgets again.While it sounds confusing, it's not one of those movies that you sit through the whole time getting frustrated and thinking I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON. It's more like you keep asking questions and picking up clues as the movie progresses, keeping your interest so that you can't wait until your next question is answered... like a fun mystery. I found myself smiling and laughing each time the scenes jumped to another place in time because it's all crafted so cleverly and seamlessly. If you watch the movie, which I highly recommend that you do, it will be clearer to you. It's definitely a fun movie that's also very stylistic and intelligent. There are so many layers to Memento, that you can watch it multiple times and have a different opinion each time you watch it.... about characters, the plot, motives, and what the director and writer are trying to say about memory, truth, psychology, ethics, love and revenge.",Memento
1010,juvenjoom,The movie Memento is one bizarre illustration of a rape story and its later consequences.,8,27 September 2013,"It sets off with a murder from the look of which, the protagonist of the movie kills the guy who's raped and got it over with his wife. The look of satisfaction and enthusiasm on his face implies that he's gotten his revenge and will live relieved after this, but you can never say that as there is no afterward events; the story enjoys a reverse chronology. In a story employing this technique, the first scene shown is actually the conclusion to the plot. Once that scene ends, the penultimate scene is shown, and so on, so that the final scene the viewer sees is the first chronologically.This 2000 Christopher Nolan movie which is made well before Batman trilogy, The Prestige, and Inception, is based on a short story from Johnathan Nolan, the outstanding director's brother who has been the co- screenwriter for Nolan's other great works as well. All the first scenes are happening after the next one and just come to an end when the other one starts which is as strange on paper as it looks on the screen! Nonetheless, this is not the most moving factor in the movie as it is about to get even creepier. The main character of the story, Leonard Shelby (personalized by Guy Pearce) has lost his short memory in the unfortunate incident in a fight with the jerk raping his love. He would only keep the stuff going around him in his recollection for less than ten minutes. To remember things by, he has developed this taking pictures plus adding notes under them method. He usually carries a camera around and takes pictures from the people and places to have in his pocket which will be his only tool to judge people on their good and bad nature. It does not often pay off as the man would choose to write notes about people at the wrong time. Besides, Lenny has developed the habit of getting tattoos on his body about very important facts and information. The numbers of tattoos increase constantly, but never stop. The main character, who remembers to be a psychologist, usually talks of a Sammy Jackson which the viewer can never be certain of its existence which is the most terrifying fact. The movie leaves the viewer holding the bag and awing at the heaviness of a 2-hour backward story. It educates you that you can never judge people based on one situation, teaches you that even short term memory is a full blessing, and shows you that everything could start only when you think they've come to a bitter end. There it is: Christopher Nolan's weirdly overwhelming haunting movie that will make your jaw drop and leave you asking ""what did I just watch?""",Memento

The film commands multiple viewings, as one does not pick up everything from only one watch. Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is a man coping with short-term memory loss and centers his life around his need to avenge his wife's death. ""Memento"" contains one of the most dazzling scripts of any movie I have ever seen, and also contributes amazing acting performances by almost all actors involved. The story is extremely difficult to understand as obvious time shifts occur, and it is only up to the viewer to keep up (scenes being in color and shifts to scenes being in black and white). It's definitely a mystery and is in the 4th gen of film noir. I would call it art, and I would call it unprecedented, but those not willing to fully engage themselves into a confusing watching experience will dislike it completely.

Where to even begin with this movie...I remember that all of the performances in the movie, especially Guy Pierce of course, were very solid and believable. I liked the almost noir-feeling that it gave off, and I liked the setting a lot too. But none of these are the selling points of the movie. The way this movie presents itself is so unique and thought provoking. The way that the story is told is unlike anything I've seen before, and the way Nolan uses colors and editing to piece a story that leads into the middle of itself is so weird and experimental, but it makes this movie so great. I can definitely see how this method of storytelling made a lot of these people leave 10/10 ratings.There were a few things about the movie I was a bit off on, however. I do wish that the movie didn't spoil its chronological climax at the beginning of the movie, because it kind of ruined the rest of it in my opinion (even though the plot twist at the end of the movie was unexpected). I found this movie to be kind of confusing at times, and sometimes I couldn't help but lose track of what was happening. I get that in a sense it's supposed to make you feel that way though, so maybe we can chalk those up to my stupidity. Overall, I'd really like to see more films take risks like this did. There are so many points where this movie could've gone wrong, but it never did. Maybe I'd consider making this a 9/10 on a second viewing, but either way I'm completely sold on Memento.",Memento

1017,Snoogins,This movie is great.,10,8 April 2001,"I have been waiting to watch Memento since I first saw a review for it on Ebert and the Movies, but it wasn't playing at any of my local theatres. This is one of the most stylish, interesting, and well-done movies I have ever seen.  I don't know of any movies that I could really compare it to.  I suppose that if you liked The Game, you will love Memento.  It is similar to The Game in terms of the way the story seems to lead you towards one conclusion then suddenly, and continually, throws a new twist at you.  The story is told in an unconventional manner in terms of chronology.  It begins at the end, and over the course of the movie it alternately flashes back and progress towards the middle.  This seems like the best way to show the viewer the way Leonard experiences his life since his accident.  This is a movie that could probably be watched three times consecutively without being able to grasp everything that has unfolded. This movie is about... It does a excellent job of showing how fragile our memories really are.  After watching half the movie, how clearly do you remember about the first five minutes?  As the story progresses, previous events get a little hazier, harder to recall clearly... I was so excited about this movie that I kept going to the website (www.otnemem.com) to find out about it.  Now that I've seen the movie, I realize that the website is really not about the events that happen during the movie, rather it's an extension of the movies' story into the past and the future.  It gives more insight into what has been going on with Leonard since his injury.  I'd recommend to anyone who has seen the film to check it out.  I was confused about a few things by the end of the movie, and if I had to make any complaint about this film, I actually wish the movie was longer.  The story is so engrossing that I wouldn't mind sitting through another hours' worth of film for more insight into Leonard's condition.

The way this film is structured is delightfully confusing, taking twists in both style and plot. The matrix refugees, Joe Patalangio and Carrie Ann Moss both do great jobs as supporting antagonists (a quite suitable oxymoron)and compliment Guy Pearce's character ""Lenny"" extremely well.Any plot holes or inconsistancies are either hidden and explained later, except for one that after you see the film you'll realize you don't care about because it served the plot SO well.In short, this film is a must see, definetely the best film of 2001 thus far and it's gonna be hard to top.

Not that the other actors aren't excellent too. The film seems confusing for the first 20 minutes or so until you get used to the way it works, but after that you will be completely hooked until the surprising ending.

Memento is a murder mystery where the whodunit question is answered in the first scene. But did the victim deserve it? Or did someone trick Lenard Shelby into killing the wrong man? And if so, why?Because of his 'condition,' Lenard knows he has to watch out for people who want to take advantage of him. Condition is a euphemism for severe brain damage, which left him unable to make new memories. The last thing he does remember is his wife dying in front of him. When he closes his eyes, he sees her dying, and since he can't make new memories, the horror of her death and the pain of his loss is always there, fresh and never fading.Memento at its heart is a quest for freedom from the prison of personal limitation. Lenard desperately wants to regain control over his reality. He follows clues, writes notes, takes photos, hypothesizes solutions. These things, however, can never compensate for the terrible loss of both the continuity of the present and the connectedness of time itself; he knows neither what year it is now nor how long ago his wife died. But he believes if he can somehow avenge his wife, even with his tremendous limitations, he will regain some part of the self-worth that he lost when his brain became damaged.Profound, unique, and beautiful in its achievement -- Memento isn't a gimmick; it's an elusive puzzle with a clear answer.

It's not only a stunningly tragic thriller, it has an amazing emotional core that provides balance for the film. Consider the way Leonard talks about his wife at the restaurant, then when he is unable to sleep.Director Christopher Nolan's brother Jonah actually wrote Memento as a short story, Christopher then adapted it, and he did a fantastic job. Memento has a great screenplay. Nolan gets us involved in what's going on as far as plot (or, actually, what has already gone on in the plot. Whatever.) and he inter-cuts the black and white sequences with perfect placements. They serve as a bridge for what's coming up next, or before. But then, he also knows that there needs to be some sort of bond between the audience and Leonard, so he gives us these short little snippets of Leonard's personal life, his sadness, his lonliness.In terms of theme, I think the film has many. (WARNING: SPOILERS!!!) The movie deals, of course with revenge. To me that was the focus. How revenge will eventually leave you unsatisfied and unfulfilled. Then, there is the observation that sometimes we force ourselves into believing something just because we want to feel like we are important. We want to have purpose. And when faced with the truth, Leonard lies to himself to feel that importance. Then there are the smaller more subtle thoughts about loss, and sadness, which I found very moving.Every single actor in this movie was perfect. Guy Pearce is just wonderful at film-noir. Look at his breakthrough in L.A. Confidential, and his very entertaining and highly fascinating movie, Ravenous, about cannibalism and carnage. He's just a very fine actor. And the characters of Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano (who is just hysterical) give the movie an even more mysterious feeling. The way we see their pictures and we see what's written on them and immediately wonder, ""When was that written? I want to see Leonard write that. I can't wait to understand how all of this fits together.""This is not a movie you just watch once and then forget about. I've seen it three times, and I own the screenplay, and I'm still not sure I have it all figured out.

Yes, from the way the story was told, it was kind of a mix of ""Usual suspects"" and ""Pulp fiction"", but Memento was really dark.Imagine, the only memory you got is how your wife was raped and killed. No other memories would stuck in your mind, and you'd have to take polaroids, write notes and get tattoos if you wanted to recall something that happened after your haunting memory. Imagine not to know no other feeling but revenge. And imagine someone taking an advantage of it. Not knowing who.Memento plays with viewers mind. It makes you think, question and suspect anything and everyone. And truth is never what you expect....",Memento

If you blink or go to the bathroom during this film you will return and be completely lost, but it is taut... intense, and has more twists than a Cirque-de-Soleil contortionist.Ultimately, it left me thinking in a very profound and philosophical way about the nature of human memory.  Set against the backdrop of a modern day noir detective reverse-whodunnit...  an incredibly difficult film to describe without giving too much information away.Guy Pearce is EXCELLENT... terrific in basically a one man show.

This question was brought up throughout the entirety of this movie. Are we the sum of our actions, or of our memories? In this ecliptic, surrealistic tale of uncertainty, distrust, and overall confusion - we are captivated every second by the constant twists and turns.Guy Pearce delivers an amazing performance as Leonard Shelby - a former insurance investigator turned vigilante searching for the man who raped and murdered his wife, and ultimately left him with a condition that doesn't allow him to make new memories. Reclusive and a bit eccentric, the story follows Guy Pearce backwards, from the opening scene where Leonard murders a man - all the way to how the entire fiasco began.Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantalino are excellent back-ups. Who is an ally, who is an enemy? Who is there to help Leonard in his quest to locate the man who raped and murdered his wife? Who is there simply to exploit his condition for their own personal gain? These things question you, pull you, and drag you throughout this movie.We are taken into the mind of a man who can't distinguish from one moment to the next. He is forever subdued into a life of pure confusion and turmoil, where his entire life story(post-accident) is scribbled on notes, or written on the back of photographs, or tattooed to his own body.Watch this movie, right now.

Nolan brothers are geniuses. Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano make a good cast, each one really give the best to their characters.

Some movies just give me a bad vibe and i can know upfront if i'm gonna like them or not. So far, the only movie I was wrong about was V for Vendetta. I didn't want to see it, but did and was completely amazed.With Memento...not so much. The storyline is just way too complicated to be explained in such short time. I know, Memento is special because it's not meant to be obvious...blah blah. I'm not gonna bash the movie because everyone has their own opinion, tastes in art and so on. I'm gonna say Memento is in film industry what poetry is in literature. It can be seen in many different forms. I just happen not to like that in a movie. For example, Shutter Island is, for me, a perfectly done movie in the somewhat same genre of mind-f like Memento. Suspense, thrill, mystery, unpredictability...has it all. And in the end it can be interpreted in different ways but you can back it up with something.In Memento, there are different ways to understand it but no logic at all. You can just guess what happened with no arguments, only guesses. And you can never be really sure what the hell went on there. It's like I write down some sentences(seemingly related) for a couple of pages and let you decide what I'm writing about.The only reason why I watched it to the end was because i just wanted to know what the f happened. Only to be left alone in the dark in the end! :D Just kidding. In some ways, it's like The Elephant man. Simply f'in hard to watch. Just hard to watch.I don't want to rate this movie at all, because I really wouldn't know what to rate it. It's not bad, it's not the best...It left me with no feelings at all. And when i feel nothing, I can't rate it. It gave me no new experience.For The Dark Knight, I didn't want to get out of theater because I didn't want it to be over. I was thrilled. That's what I like about movies. A story with a message. Something that touches you as a human being. I love movies because I learn from them. Memento felt more like a test with no right answer, and I learned squat from it. Maybe I should watch it again and again...after a couple of times, maybe it'll make more sense.

The screenplay is simply unique. However, this is no gimmick - having watched the movie in chronological order (thanks to the wonders of DVD) I am convinced that the story holds its own even without Nolan's remarkable narrative structure. The acting equals the screenplay, especially with Guy Pearce who confirms his quality as the central character of Leonard, who is attempting to locate his wife's killer.I'm loathe to give away too much about the film, but it is definitely one of the more thought-provoking pieces to appear on our screens in recent years.

Many people say this is nothing but a gimmick picture, which I don't think is right at all.

1049,Whas,Mind-blowing!,10,15 September 2015,"This is the typical movie where you have to pay attention to every detail! I really like the way the story is told, even more than the plot itself! It put you in the situation where you, like the main character, are not able to view the entire story in one single line. You are confused as long as you watch the movie, and you are even after. But then you got the occasion to put all the pieces together, rather than Leonard! I would like to try to put those pieces together now, discovering the real meaning of the movie, so if you haven't watched ""Memento"" yet, stop reading this! His wife was really raped by two bad guys, but she survived. He develops a psichiatric condition, and he can no longer remember new things. The wife is diabetic, and tests him by letting him inject her a lot of insulin. If you paid attention, there is a scene where he's preparing insulin, between one of those where the famous Sammy is doing it. And, in the end, we can see his wife hugging Leonard while his chest is nude, and he has the tattoo ""he raped my wife etc"". For this, he was moved to a psichiatric clinic. He could not live anymore realizing what he did to his wife, because he remembers, as long as his condition is mental (yes, it's a real disease, but he phisically can store new memories), so he invents a puzzle where John Q. killed his wife in Leonard's last memory: the rape. Freddy is the cop to whom the case of the rape was assigned. He starts helping Leonard, giving him the files records etc. Lenny finally kills the man who raped his wife, but then continues to manipulate his own memories! He put away 12 pages of the records, deletes many sentences etc. Freddy now decides to use Leonard to kill people, to become rich, because the main character won't remember anything. But Natalie understands what's going on, and helps Lenny to kill Freddy, in order to avenge her boyfriend. Leonard itself wanted to kill Freddy, because he told him the truth, and he can't hold it.",Memento
1050,pacifist_parsi,I think that it is classical,9,6 August 2011,"I think the film Memento fell under the Formalist editing style. To start off, the cuts from one shot to another were very sharp. They went right from one to another, no fade out. Also, the way they went from the present to old memories, was constantly changing. Since it changes from color to black&white, it created an opposite conflict of time. Lastly, the story created many different view points and stories. This came from the unreliable narrator, and also from the unreliable people who used him throughout it. It made you think throughout the film and was very thematic as well.2. How well did the editing establish and maintain Rhythm?? I think Memento had a well-paced rhythm. Though it was confusing at times, it was the narrator that made it so. The rhythm itself was well done through out. The speed of which they had each shot was perfectly done, stopping right after you realized it was starting to repeat. Also, the speed wasn't too fast, and always kept you guessing. I really liked how Christopher Nolin chose the setting as well to correspond with the scene. It made it more believable and relevant to what was happening. ALI KOHAN FOROTAGHE_ifilm.freeblog.ir",Memento
1051,lynnblake1108,Fabulous Film,9,20 June 2011,"When ""Memento"" first started up, I was a little bit skeptical. To my surprise, I was immediately entranced by this clever film. Obviously, the plot structure is the most notable part of this work. While the majority of the audience found it confusing and nonsensical, I thought it was perfect. You didn't have to think until you were exhausted, but it did require the audience to pay attention all the way through. The ending was somewhat predictable. I figured out that Leonard was actually Sammy Jenkins when Teddy said (for the second time) ""That's who you were, but who are you now?"" It made me realize that his story corresponds perfectly to that of Sammy's. It just makes me question the validity of the movie as a whole. What really happened? How do we know? Is there any way to tell? Even if we watch the movie in ""order"", with all the color pieces in their chronological sequence, would the movie be different? Personally, I believe the movie wouldn't be nearly as captivating nor interesting.Another key element in this film is the concept of time and its passing. Leonard has no concept of time, and thus, we as the audience have to forget all of our preconceived notions about time. If we don't, then it's easy to get lost in Leonard's condition. For example, when Natalie leaves the house for a moment or two to manipulate Leonard, we see her exit her car, then go back to enter it, and then exit again. If we as the viewer didn't understand that time has no meaning to someone with a memory problem, then we cannot figure out why society interacts with them in such peculiar ways.The acting in this movie was fantastic. I love Guy Pearce, and his acting choices fit in perfect correlation with how it was written. Natalie was quite an obnoxious, manipulative demon, but Stowe's acting was impeccable. Even the little characters, like Burt the rental guy, seemed to be extremely realistic, which always adds points to a film.All in all, Memento was a fabulous film. I had no major qualms with it.",Memento

1054,e5312,An unforgettable movie but not the best from Nolan,6,15 January 2012,"We have a really original story here: Leonard, a man suffering from short-term memory loss is hunting for the man who raped and killed his wife. I guess I don't have to mention that his illness does not make his job easy, since once he starts a conversation, at about the fifth sentence he forgets how did it start, and only takes him a while 'til he forgets who is he talking with. Basically he can't remember anything since the day he got the wound on his face, but thanks to the notes and photographs he keeps creating all the time he manages to find the killer. Or at least that's what he thinks The directing is most definitely what makes this movie as unique as it is. The whole story is going backwards, so you just have to wait for the reasons, they will always come later. It reminded me a lot of French movie Irreversible, which had almost the same schema, but of course Memento is two years older, and to be honest I didn't like Irreversible since I found it a bit weird. On the other hand, the whole movie somehow magically reminded me of Fight Club, the thing between Leonard and Sammy was a bit like the ""connection"" between the Narrator and Tyler. Crazy, I must say.Watching this film was a nice and interesting experience, and I would recommend it to anyone who is not scared of a little headache while trying to figure out what is going on.

It transcends beauty and normal patterns of rational thought, and, sadly, there may never be another film like it.I urge you to watch this with mature friends and colleagues in a quiet setting to minimize distraction, as it is quite hard to follow even for mature audiences.

I have to tip my hat again to Mr. Nolan, because he's one of the only directors in my opinion that can find a nice median between style and substance.Another big reason that I think this film is so smart is because it has an art-house feel to it. That is due to the relatively unknown cast. (Granted there not as unknown now) They include: Guy Pearce, Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano. Though, truthfully if you've seen this movie, the breakout is Guy Pearce.

I think the premise of the film was well done but the execution and direction could have been a lot better.

You can watch it over and over and see something new.Memento was a hidden gem from 2001 that flew under the radar. The movie plays the story in reverse order utilizing black-and-white cinematography interlaced with normal colored scenes of the story unraveling forward, in a typical fashion. It is simply a beautiful and refreshing presentation.If that doesn't catch your attention, wait till you hear about the story. Leonard (Pearce) has amnesia and wakes up each scene forgetting what has happened. This movie is so damn smart by the way it plays out; It almost tricks the viewer into feeling as confused as Lenny at first glance. Do not fret however, things come together quickly as we find Lenny taking notes on his skin with tattoos and Polaroid photographs-- jotting notes in black ink. Someone has killed Lenny's wife, but who is it? Is it the cop, Teddy (Pantoliano) with ""don't believe his lies"" scribed by his picture? Or is it Natalie, the risqué Moss, who has been using him for her own benefit. Lenny's clothing, his car and his apartment all give us clues on how to break down this film.Confused yet? Well make sure you give this film a few viewings before you quit. If you're not a fan of film that makes you think, supreme mystery/ thrillers, then skip this gem.Nolan, of the new Batman fame, is a genius in more ways then one.

THAT'S what just doesn't add up.You know how Quentin Tarantino creates all those scenes that gen X think are awesome, but are just physics challenged? You know the world doesn't work like that, and there's no plot reason to violate the laws of physics, but Quentin thought it would be neat and his sheep think so too? This is the social relationship version of that kind of...being reality challenged.The temporal order in which events are presented is absolute nonsense. He doesn't remember things that way, so why would you present it that way just to...look cool? Is that what it's supposed to be?

It's the kind of totally self indulgent gen X rubbish where ""nothing exists outside my head"" and ""I dream that I am a..., so I am"" that drives Boomers insane.

It allows for the a priori decision to do this from a POV view that is, well quite frankly, produced by managing to insert one's head far up one's rectum. The jokes aren't even funny. This movie scares me. It scares me that there is a whole population of people that can identify with what the screen writer and director were trying to do. A lot of the glowing reviews are the only one written by the author, so there could be a good deal of ""paid buzz"" generation going on here as well. Bottom line, if you actually liked Kill Bill or Blair Witch, you will probably find this awesome.

1062,Leem4004,Amazing. How a low-budget indie should be done.,9,1 December 2015,"Disregard its mind-bending profundities about the nature of memory and existence and what it means to be human. Even if all these things were willfully ignored and Memento were simply reduced to an architectural blueprint, it would still be akin to watching Bobby Fischer play chess, seeing the board several moves ahead of his opponent. It's an exhausting experience just to keep up—be sure to arrive on time and stay seated until the credits roll—but for Nolan to dream up a scenario this complex and yet work it out so thoroughly seems almost inconceivable. His story marries two high concepts that would be baffling enough on their own, let alone together. Traumatized by his wife's rape and murder, Guy Pearce suffers from a rare neurological disorder called anteriograde amnesia that prevents him from creating any new memories. Basically, the world as he understood it 10 minutes ago has evaporated from his mind without a trace. In order to exact revenge on his wife's killer, Pearce has devised an elaborate system of tattoos, Polaroids, note cards, and file folders to help him piece together the facts. He also has to uncover the possible ulterior motives of shady ally Joe Pantoliano and a sullen bartender played by Carrie- Anne Moss. To further complicate matters, Nolan begins with the end and ends with the beginning, so the action takes place in overlapping fragments that move backwards in time. On top of all that, he inserts black-and-white scenes of Pearce on the phone in his motel room, telling the harrowing story of a fellow amnesia sufferer (Stephen Tobolowsky) he met in his days as an insurance claims investigator. Memento has endless fun playing with hiccuping time and ephemeral memory: In one of its funniest scenes, Pearce wonders if he's being chased or giving chase; in one of its most suspenseful, he scrambles to find a pen before he forgets a person's diabolical abuses. For a while, Nolan's twin gimmicks seem to exist solely for clever gamesmanship, like the achronology in his low- budget neo-noir debut, Following. But the astonishing payoff takes the film to another level entirely, unleashing a battery of existential questions that shed new light on everything that precedes it.",Memento

I think it is unsurpassed in at least the last decade of movie making that I have seen (I don't watch a great many movies so I could be wrong here) if not longer.I saw it on a satellite channel that shows the same film a few times over the course of a single evening and after watching it for the first time I started looking up the times for when it was going to start again, and half an hour later I was back feeling the same things all over again. Now I'm not a person who finds it easy to watch something over and over again (and almost never in the same night), but TBH I feel this film needs it, almost deserved it.Throughout I kept thinking to myself what would it be like to be in that state of mind (short term memory loss, or more like, a total lack of), not knowing if you can trust what little you have remembered, or managed to pieced together every 10 minutes might be a better way of putting it, to make your way thru the day, with having the weight of all what this man has on his plate, wondering to himself if this could have been the person....At one point *slight spoiler ahead* another of the other characters waits just out of sight for a short amount of time, after something had happened (that had been forced, just so as to allow the slate to be wiped clean, so to speak), causing the person to think that something 'totally' different had gone on and just by hiding all of the pens and pencils to hand can reinforce what they want to be the truth as seen in the head of the Leonard Shelby character, a very vulnerable and unlucky man ? ... or is he just a nut-case without a grip ?, there is room for an air of doubt to be left in my mind about how much of the underlying stories are about what people.Even now as I think back I want to watch it over again because it could make some things clearer in my mind, or not, its not a feeling that I did not get it, its more a case of did I put things back together in the right order.

Editing peculiar movie like this must've fried his brain good (hope he got paid good).Christopher Nolan never disappoints with his movies and this one ain't nothing new. Very intriguing story, always makes you question what's happening throughout the movie. Not a single boring scene. We need more type of movies like this which leaves you shocked at the end.It puts you in the shoes of the person who feels short term memory loss and cannot recall the thing even from 10 minutes ago. Definitely worth a watch. I would say this movie need at least 2-3 watches to fully mature in your mind because this is not an ordinary movie. I have personally never seen anything like this. Now grab the popcorn and start being bamboozled for the 130 minutes or so.",Memento
1065,Ace-33,Who killed Leonard's wife?,5,14 May 2001,"It amazes me how many people praise this movie yet still don't get it and fail to grasp the full truth of the story. Because the plot is so complicated in the way it was presented it took my wife and I hours to figure out what really happened. Credit that to the director for having pulled off such an incredible and original movie.   ------WARNING***-----SPOILER AHEAD------------- I have read the last 80 comments on this board and not once did anyone observe that Leonard ALREADY had started his body tatooing before his wife died. In an extremely brief scene at the the end of the movie, Leonard is seen laying in bed half-naked with his wife with a few of his tatoos already on his upper chest. This lead me to the following conclusions. 1. Leonard's wife survived the intruders' attack, though Leonard himself suffered severe head trauma which leads to his handicap. 2. As a result of this affliction, Leonard begins tatooing his body, the results which are seen in the final bedroom scene with his wife. 3. Leonard himself kills his own wife with an insulin overdose and then transposes the deed to Sammy Jarkis. The 'real' Sammy never had a wife according to Teddy. Yet in order to justify his 'revenge', Leonard reminds himself that Sammy was a murderer.   4. Leonard is sent to a mental institution (according to the clues in the official website) and begins plotting the murder of the second assailant in his diary. He then escapes the institution and hooks up with Teddy who helps him find the assailant. Teddy photographs the blood-covered Leonard as a reminder of his nasty deed, knowing full well that Leonard will soon forget and continue his killing rampage. 5. Teddy takes advantage of Leonard's affliction and uses him to kill a drug dealer for monetary gains only to be outsmarted by Leonard when he realizes he was duped by Teddy.Presumably, Leonard will continue his rampage until the authorities eventually catch up with him and puts him away for life.",Memento

1068,Bowman-7,A Phenomenal Movie-going Experience,10,4 May 2001,"""Memento"" is quite possibly the most amazing film experience I've had in a movie theater (I've seen ""Citizen Kane"" and ""2001"" only on video).  I daresay (though there is not much risk involved) I will not see a better movie this year, and I say this even with my excitement over the upcoming ""AI"" and ""Fellowship of the Ring.""  ""Memento"" is a remarkably complex, beautiful, blistering, masterpiece of a movie.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone everywhere in the world.  I am not even going to comment on the plot, because I think you should go in totally fresh as I did and willing to take an active interest in the movie.  This is not your typical popcorn machine movie, where the plot is easy enough that you can fall asleep through half of it and still know what's going on.  ""Memento"" transcends what going to the movies is all about: its complexity and method of storytelling make it almost some kind of a revolutionary audience participation spectacle.  It's twists and turns are not gimmicky like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Fight Club"" but gradual and calculated.  I can not possibly sing this movie's praises enough, so now I am going to give a word to its detractors: LEARN TO THINK AT THE MOVIES.  Stop watching Candycorn Crap like ""Bring it On"" and ""Charlie's Angels"" and invest in a movie that has ideas and wants to challenge you.ALSO: a major complaint (read no further if you want to go into the movie fresh) is that the film's method of backwards storytelling is just a gimmick and that the movie would not be as interested if it went from start to finish in regular order.  Well, gee, thanks!  I didn't realize that watching a movie the way it's intended to be watched is more entertaining than watching it backwards.  You can also make the argument that watching ""The Bicycle Thief"" in rewind isn't as entertaining as watching it the way it was filmed.  DUH!  Of course, the backwards chronology is essential to the plot: the idea is to distort reality and confuse identity.  The movie is like looking in a mirror where everything is distorted and backwards.  You're not supposed to grasp all this in one sitting.  Just think about it a while after you leave the theater and you should understand.  For those of you who haven't seen it, though, GO SEE IT NOW!  I beg you.Px",Memento

So heres the deal, once in a great while a director comes along and says I am going to CREATE a movie that is intriguing, mysterious, and very mind-engaging to view. Noyce (director) did this with Memento. This movie is astoundingly good. The characters are all screwed up, and very human.

If I happen to see another movie that is better than ""Memento"" I will submit myself for public flogging - that's how positive I am that this is the best movie of the year.Poor Leonard Shelby, magnificently played by Guy Pearce, is on a mission to find ""John G"" the man who raped and murdered his wife (or did he?...dum, dum...) Complicating the search is the fact that Leonard suffers from short-term memory (or does he?...dum, dum...) and can't remember conversations that took place or people he has met, and needs photos to remind him of what the heck is going on.Oh, did I happen to mention the movie runs backwards, providing a stark difference to standard H-Wood fare. And, to be 100% truthful, I don't think the movie would work if it were run straight-forward. Seeing it backwards made me feel as if I were putting a puzzle together without having use of my hands. It was challenging and exhilarating to try and figure out what was going on and forced me to pay attention. At least 95% of the movies I go to, I daydream, look at my watch, etc. This was not one of them - that's how much this movie impressed and challenged me.Admit it, you got a chill up your spine when Leonard is talking on the phone, looks down at his leg and sees the phrase ""NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE"" - stops talking, and we, the audience, feel Leonard's fear.I'm not going to get into what I think happened (okay, I think Leonard is faking because he feels badly that he didn't believe Sammy, there I said it, those who disagree with me can disagree with me if they choose) - but everyone I've talked to about this movie has added a fresh perspective as to what they think happened, and everytime I talk to someone different it gives me points to ponder. It says something about a movie that you can talk to ten different people as to what they saw and you will get ten different versions/stories, and ALL of them are valid arguments for what really happened.I haven't been this hung up on a movie since ""L.A. Confidential"". Pearce deserves an Oscar nomination (and if he doesn't get it I say we all storm AMPAS headquarters, or just camp out at voters homes), and Joe Pantliano (sp?) and Carrie-Ann Moss are equally stunning....the script is tight, the directing is superb, and..uh..sorry guys, I'm off to see ""Memento"" again....",Memento

But after the camera goes behind a pillar and returns, the one seated in the home is not Sammy, for a split-second, but Leonard.  This is not evident in normal speed.  I discovered it as I was splitting the movie into 43 discrete segments, and arranging their playback in absolute linearity.  That's only important insofar as that's how I found this sublim.  It's very subtle and, though not over the top in reach (it's only meant to emphasize Leonard's wretchedness) I think we as a civilization have decided that this kind of thing shouldn't be allowed, or at least have some sort of warning label attached to it.Other than that, this is about the greatest movie in the last five years.",Memento

In a lot of cases, it will be because they made the mistake of reading too many reviews or visiting the official web site (which IMO introduces 'facts not in evidence' and ruins it).In any case, here's what I loved most about Memento: it was the first movie I've seen in years that was completely unpredictable. I guessed the ending of The Usual Suspects, and I don't understand why so many people didn't. But anyway. Every time I thought I had things figured out in Memento, I learned I was wrong. Every pre-conceived notion I started out with was shattered by the end. Nothing was what it seemed, though the differences were of varying degrees. I walked out of the theater questioning just about everything and trying to remember how certain elements fit together. I thought about it the rest of the evening on into the night. I love movies that do that to your head.The fact that the movie was edited with a backward scene order is sheer brilliance, and I don't think the movie could have worked if it had started at the beginning. In each scene, the viewer is trying to put together a puzzle, just like Leonard is. And even though the viewer may ""know"" what comes later, he still doesn't know what's going on right now, or why. There are small clues on Leonard's notes that give us a hint and nothing more. It's the closest we could come to having Leonard's condition - the memories we have of previous scenes are pretty much irrelevant to what is going on in the current scene and we are constantly re-evaluating ""the facts"" in light of new information.

I think if it was told forwards it would've been more of a comedy; everything's being spelled out for Leonard but he can't remember a thing.

1093,pudgefan7,A must-see!,9,19 March 2002,"Leonard (Guy Pearce) is an insurance investigator who's wife has been raped and murdered by someone. That someone also caused Leonard a strange head injury that does not allow his brain to make new memories past the incident. Leonard wants revenge on this man who's ruined his life, but he also has to get over the obstacle of his memory loss. So he takes pictures with his Polaroid camera and makes himself notes by Tattoo of who he knows, what he knows about them, who he can trust, who he can't, and what to do next. Along the way, he meets up with Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) who help him.The major twist through all of the movie is that Memento is shown in clips, like pieces of a puzzle and you, the viewer, figure out how the puzzle fits together. There are two different types of clips in the movie, one is in color and is the story of Leonard's thirst for revenge, while the other clips are a telephone conversation that is shown is black and white. This is one of those find-it-out-for-yourself flicks that I certainly do not want to ruin, but be patient with it. I rented the DVD and had to watch many, many parts over and over to understand what just happened. Grab a pen and some paper, because this is a great ride.As for the acting, let me start with Guy Pearce, the star of the show. What a wonderful performance, excellent emotion and frustration runs rampant in this film and he does it so well. To be completely honest, I think he should have gotten at the very least an Academy Award nomination, but this is the Oscars we're talking about and, well don't get me started. Next is Carrie-Ann Moss, from The Matrix fame of playing Trinity, but she plays the bartender Natalie and befriends Leonard on his quest of avenging his wife's murder. She also is very good with the frustration of the whole matter. Teddy is probably the most over looked character performance, he's played by Joe Pantoliano, who, incidentally has also played in The Matrix as Cypher. Joe does a great job of being annoying in this film, just like he was good at being the guy-you-love-to-hate in The Matrix (is that a good thing?). And how about Mark Boone Junior? I like him, there are a couple of scenes where he just loosens up the tension and emotion that drives the film, and they're just refreshing scenes to watch.Memento is a very well done movie, but in the content area it doesn't fare so well. Memento has over 75 uses of the ""f"" word and 23 ""s"" words. The movie is saturated with them and the only way to get over them is to tune them out. Other words are used too, including the Lord's name in vain a few times. So, if you're sensitive to harsh language this is a movie you might want to pass on. That's not all, when Leonard is making notes from tattoos we see it. He takes out the center of a pen and injects himself with it, and it's not a pretty sight. The main reason this movie got an 'R' rating is from the language. The violence is really PG-13 type stuff.Overall, this is a great great movie and I really do recommend you see it, especially if you like to be the sleuth on the case in trying to piece this whole mess together. 9 out of 10",Memento

This is one of the most cleverly edited films I have ever seen.  The approach that director Christopher Nolan takes to tell us the story is the films strongest suit.  This is not to say that the film is short in other aspects.  The cinematography is superb.  The actors deliver virtually flawless performances.  The score is never overpowering yet facilitates the feel of the scenes as they unfold.  The dialogue is intelligent and provoking.  The action is never boring with its stark transitions working to an integral purpose.The way the story is told is the essence of Memento and why it works so well.  The story seems to play out in reverse.  That is partly true. It is told from the end AND the beginning towards the center, or summit if you will. The audience ultimately discovers the protagonist's true motivation and comes to understand the reasons behind the seemingly disjointed activities they have witnessed.The film opens with what is surely the end of the story as the titles are presented.  Unlike the rest of the footage, this scene is truly played in reverse.  This is the story's ultimate conclusion.  However, after the opening titles are played, the first forward moving scene is of the protagonist in a motel room trying to adjust to his strange condition. This is the true beginning of the story time line.  The events are played forward in time and backwards in time, in parallel toward the astonishing final revelation.  The forward sequences are presented in black and white while the backward sequences are presented in color.  This interplay continues through out the film until the final segment where the two time points converge on the ultimate tension of the story.  At this convergence and within a single scene the black and white footage smoothly emerges into full color.  Even though they move forward in time, the black and white scenes are actually retrospective of the main character's experiences that lead him to his understanding of his condition. The affliction that the protagonist suffers is described through the experience of a third person whom we are, at a point in the story, led to confuse with the protagonist.  The truth is revealed at the climatic ending of the film; which as it turns out, is the summit of the story.  Everything becomes clear to the audience as to what the beginning of the film had revealed.Memento is without a doubt the most effectual use of editing and story development to involve the audience with the problems of the protagonist that I have ever witnessed.  Memento is a masterful film that will surely become an example used in film making colleges for years to come.John H. Freeman",Memento

His killer is holding the picture, he shakes it, the picture get's dimmer, he shakes it again, the picture is almost white, he shakes it again, and there is no more picture. The killer proceeds to put the picture back into the camera. Confused? This first scene lays down the basic structure of this brilliant movie, and that brilliant structure is based off one question. How can an audience relate to a man with sever short term memory loss? The answer is to start from the end, end at the beginning.Leonard Shelby, an insurance fraud agent who's last night of his regular life is seeing his wife dying in front of him, and he's helpless to do anything about it. He wakes up every day with that image, and he is determined to kill the man who put it there. With the help of his friend Teddy, he works to track down the killer. The only thing is, he has this condition, after a period of time, usually ranging around 7-10 minutes, he forgets everything. So how does one acquire a friend, when he can't even remember them meeting? It's a good question with one hell of an answer.This is a wonderful movie with absolutely amazing performances all around. Joe Pantoliano, is wonderful as Teddy, always trying to push Leonard down one path, Carrie Anne Moss is phenomenal as Natalie, she seems to care for Leonard, but in this movie nothing is as it seems. The true appraise all goes to Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby.Every scene he is clueless, and usually has to immediately act on instinct, not quite sure how he got there, not quite sure who the guy in the closet is, not quite sure how to get out.But about this ""gimmick."" This is not a cheap trick to confuse the audience, even though it is, but that's not the intention exactly. It's so we can relate to Leonard's state of mind. He has short term memory loss, would this be a better film if we saw it from the beginning, found out the surprise plot twist immediately, and just went down the classic road of a man who refuses to listen to reason and the results. I don't think so. In fact, that would be awful. I know a lot of people who say it wouldn't be a good film without the ""gimmick,"" but that doesn't make a good movie. All of Tarantino's movies are non linear story lines, but everyone seems to accept that without question.Chris Nolan does something brilliant here, and we can't get past the ""gimmick"" which is the worst reason to take credit from a movie.

1101,ckjabroni,can you say director on the verge of becoming a legend?,9,16 October 2002,"Here is the deal with Memento. Some viewers feel it is a film that doesn't deserve its rank of #10 on the top 250 films of all time. My response to all those who say that: huh? This is a film that will withstand the test of time simply because there was never a movie before to walk through a story like this one did. These same people would probably also say movies such as, ""Man With A Movie Camera"", or ""Nanook Of The North"" were fads and people would forget about them in a few years. WRONG! Here is a fact for you, when a movie starts a genre, it never dies. Memento started a genre of style of film that will infinitely live on simply because other directors will try to mimic Nolans style in this flick at least to some extent. Films like this cannot be praised enough, because these movies in forty years will be watched by our grandchildren and great grandchildren and even they will be appreciative of it. Guy Pierce in this film is the classic example of an actor that is truly terrible, and has the same exact style in every single movie he ever makes and because of the character, he totally pulls it off! Carrie-Ann Moss is stellar as she is in every movie she does, and deserved at least a best supporting nod for this. Joe Pantoliano also puts in a tremendous acting job, could be considered his best to date. hmmm 2 matrix actors...Other great performances in this were put in by Mark Boone Junior and Stephen Tobolowsky. On top of a great cast where supporting actors are as good as anything, the movie style by Nolan is legendary. Nolan had already made an amazing film in ""Following"", and after ""Memento"", did a tremendous job with his third film ""Insomnia"", the man is on pace to be one of the greatest directors of our time, and also possibly of all-time! This film can be easily understood after 1 time through if you actually think, and has replay value, but unlike movies like ""Fight Club"", the replay value does run out, which is why it gets a 9/10 instead of a perfect score.

1102,vovietanh,I give a finger to this movie,8,9 June 2011,"and a rating of 1.Watching this until the end and back a few minutes of the beginning is, TOTAL IRRITATION.The ONLY unique element of this movie is that scenes are played backwards and every time the man reads the note taken in previous scenes so that you can understand the confusion of someone with short term memory loss. A secondary element is that, similar to the case in Shutter Island, this man's hallucinations forged his memory into distortion so that later on he realized that even the name imprinted on his body wasn't fact but invented by himself.The main character was supposed to be a 'disciplined and organized' person, or in short, highly logical being. But he turned out to be a stupid and conceited retard.Yes, it particularly amazed me that every word thrown at him by Natalie (played by Moss) when she tricked him into her puppet and changed the course of his revenge fits him perfectly - a freaky venereal disease-ridden retard who did a pretty poor job in taking notes, which is the very central element in this movie.And so in the end his stupidity drove him into killing a good friend, a good person. I wouldn't say it's emotional devastation but total irritation.I dislike Christopher Nolan too. It's not that I don't enjoy his movies but there is no sense of logic in most of them, Inception in particular.

But this movie is not the amazing work of art many would have you believe. It is a decent thriller with a twist in that it works backwards and puts the watcher into the same mindset of our main character who has reoccuring amnesia. Decent movie that changes the viewers opinion throughout the flick as our character slowly works his way through time in reverse. We see things happen and then we slowly find out how those things came to be as we move farther back.***********Spoiler****************One major fault in the movie. The scene where our main character is manipulated by the lady to deal with her boyfriend is completely screwy. They tried to make it out that she totally planned it and covered all the bases but if one watches that scene one can see that one million things could have gone wrong and even should have when she plays her game and gets hit.

Anyways this dude cant remember 2 minutes ago throughout this movie. Trust me its a trip.

Christopher Nolan these days looking to be improving his skills, is kind of different from a typical director.Considering Batman new series & Inception, he is not going to direct a movie which he is not it's writer too & this is what appears to be his superiority in Hollywood.The only thing I can say about Nolan is that he wants to be his only films star. No matter who is the first role, Nolan's screenplay should be the part which absorbs everybody.Memento is telling a story on Leonard Shelby who lost his short-term memory in an accident which lead to his wife murder. The only thing he wants is a revenge & he is trying to find the person named J.G who is the suspect of this murder.Two story lines exist in the film. The first one is moving backwards. Two important events has been chosen, the story starts from the second one & moves back toward the first one. Another storyline is going forward until two story lines get together in the last scene.""Guy Pearce"" that was chosen instead of ""Alec Baldwin"" as Leonard looks to have a strong personality & is dead serious about what he thinks he should do. His short-term memory loss irritates him and the only way he has found to calm down is reminding himself a person who had the same problem named Sammy Jankis.Leonard believes not remembering things doesn't make them meaningless. So he continues looking for his wife murderer. However the last scene indicates that he is not going to find who he wants forever.

1106,jordnthoms,A Dome Rumbler,7,2 January 2011,"Leonard Shelby wakes each morning to find that he can't remember anything past the date he and his wife were attacked in their home. During the attack, he received permanent brain damage and is unable to store short-term memory. Memento is a film depicting his journey to track down and kill the man who raped and murdered his wife. You experience the movie just Leonard Shelby experiences life -- unable to draw on the past to determine how to perceive the present. Shelby is often confused and disoriented, but his drive to track down his wife's murderer gives him the ability to act on instinct and a few small notes and tattoos. The story itself is an incredible one, and you will certainly enjoy it. The telling of the story engages the brain in a unique way. As the film progresses, the viewer finds the information being presented explains scenes from earlier in the movie -- because the movie is presented basically in reverse. This style is similar to Pulp Fiction, but rather than a loose correlation of characters intimated in brief encounters, most people catch on to Memento's pattern rather quickly. This causes the viewer to desire sources of information that are the basis for Shelby's actions. The movie is an excellent story and presentation with a powerful climax, but some viewers may find the style of presentation tasking. I continually found myself waiting for information and paying less attention to the occurrences of the film. I truly sympathized with Leonard Shelby by the end of the movie, but since the presentation allowed viewers to know what the end result of each scene would be, I really had a feeling that I wanted the key element of the scene to appear. After that element appeared, I completely lost interest in the rest of the scene. Viewed linearly, the characters might be a little unrealistic. The musical score was extremely outdated -- it reminded me of something from a 60s or 70s film. The acting was excellent, with the exception of Guy Pearce -- incidentally the main character. I understand that it is very difficult to play a handicapped person, but I found his blonde hair and clean-cut look to be insufficient in compensating for his overly cool demeanor and emotionless performance. Watch this movie. It is a fair picture of a rare medical condition with a brilliant ending; however, I can only credit Jonathon Nolan with brilliance and Christopher Nolan with some pretty sub-par directing.",Memento
1107,jakeanderson1206,Innovation meets Excellence in Nolan's daring first film,10,17 November 2015,"(I am primarily reviewing this right now because I heard the film rights of 'Memento' have been bought and a remake is in production. In summation, there is no need to remake that which is perfect.)Christopher Nolan is a director that has become far too popular for his own good. After making the landmark film 'The Dark Knight' he essentially doomed the rest of his career to be compared to this film. He became so popular that hating him seems to be 'the cool thing to do' now because whenever something is popular, it inevitably gets backlash.I would like to take you back to 2000. Forget everything you know about this director, his work, and Hollywood. I am a fan of Nolan but disregard this as I write this review, because anyone who likes his work is flagged as being a 'fanboy/fangirl' and the sheer amount of stupidity that it takes to assume that I would like a film because of whoever's name is on it is so incredibly vapid and idiotic that I might have an aneurysm. So anyway, Memento is about as close to 'perfection' as you can get.The less is said about the film's plot the better, if you haven't been alerted as to this movie's ending you should stop reading this and watch the film right now. Cherish the element of surprise. In a nutshell, it is about a man who cannot form short-term memories. He is also attempting to solve his wife's murder, and has a very... unique way of keeping track of everything that he can't remember. The story shows him going through various locations and people that may or may not be leading him the right direction, as well as helping some people with their own issues. Also, the story is played in reverse chronological order AND chronological order, Black and White scenes are in order, color scenes are reversed.This simple and ingenious idea not only lets us see this story in a unique way, but lets us see it in the way the protagonist sees it. Its confusing, its difficult to decipher, but thats the point, we feel the same way he does. We understand him. But like him, as the mystery of the film unravels, the mystery that IS the film unravels as well.From a technical point of view the film is incredible. Interesting to see how talented Nolan was with a camera even back then, the shots are beautifully composed, the editing is absolutely phenomenal at conveying both the confusion and the understanding that you and the protagonist go though, and the acting is stellar. Guy Pearce is phenomenal, having to change his emotions and overall state on the fly in every scene is impressive, but the sheer skill he has of reading his more expository lines with such confidence makes me wonder why I don't see him in films more often. I can't decide whether or not this or LA Confidential is his best performance. Carrie Anne Moss also does a phenomenal job, and every other actor, while briefly in the film, plays their part very well, as set-pieces that we go through to uncover the mystery.The amount of detail and film devices Nolan employs is borderline absurd. Not only do you want to watch the film over and over to understand the chronology, but also the MEANING of everything. There are so many things in the dialogue, the shots, the foreground and background, that allude to elements of the plot, Nolan rewards those who look carefully.Memento, as a film, is a wonderful experience and an absolute required for any fan of mysteries, as well as good cinema in general. While I love the vast majority of his work, I still believe Memento is his 'best' film. It did something daring to make an already captivating and heartbreaking story more interesting, and the best part is, the way he does it is purely through film. This movie could not have been accomplished in any other medium. Had anyone else made it, it simply wouldn't have been as good.This, Hollywood, is why this film should not be remade. Even if the remake is good, it would be ultimately redundant. You can't fix what ain't broken, and Memento ain't broken.",Memento

As I've never seen Pearce act before, I was impressed by his performance as the scenes play out of order to mirror Leonard's plight.The opening shot of the film is played in reverse, as a photograph fades back to white. This is like having a blank canvas with an 'Etch a Sketch.' Some people are good at using them to create decent artwork, others not so much. This is where Memento fails. It crafts 3/4 of an effective and pleasant portrait, but then decides to erase it.With the sense of humor and dependability of an insolent child, it offers a pretentious and underwhelming twist instead. This twist emerges as a shocking turn for the worst, especially after so much buildup and countless u-turns. Despite my efforts to solve the mystery, and my investment to wait for the nearly 2 hour film to reveal the truth, Memento flatly explained how there was nothing behind the curtain.

However I was left in awe of this movie and realized how perfect the choice of showing the film in reverse actually was. Leonard's condition leaves him chronically unaware of how he gets places and what he's doing. By presenting the film starting with Teddy's death at Leonard's hand Nolan is able to leave the audience with the same feeling because they are unaware of what Leonard is doing at the beginning of each scene as well as how he has gotten there.

1123,kruttik-a,A complete experience,9,27 February 2006,"Memento definitely ranks top in my list of favorites. I have seen the movie many times and every time I see it, I realize it has a fascinating blend of all facets of movie making.Generally when one talks about this movie, the focus is on the directorial misadventure or brilliance to run the movie backwards and forwards to converge somewhere but I have strongly felt that this is only one of the many beautiful things the crew of Memento have done to this great movie. I would like to discuss some other amazing feature ignored by many critics.Memento is a story of a guy who has lost his power to retain and create new memories after an ""incident"". So basically, this movie revolves around this guy Lenny and his quest to exist in a world where his condition is almost an exception. But since one needs a reason to carry on the ventures of daily existence and since Lenny has no way of remembering these reasons, so he invents some extraordinary techniques to remember them - taking photographs and writing notes on his body. He tends to create opportunities and forget that he created them and that the reasons he has created are not a consequence of natural course of life. The movie not only brilliantly explores the agony and pain of a person suffering of such a condition but it also describes the journey of this person to fight all odds and still exist in a world without time but only matter.The ""incident"", which happens to be the last memory of his, is compelling him to exist but only till he finds the man responsible for it and kills him. Lennys knows that after he has killed the man, he would loose the reason to live and so he practices the great gift given to him-the ability to forget.Christopher Nolan has displayed that story telling is the most important part of movie making. He has successfully brought all the faces cinematic experience in one masterpiece.If movies mean anything to you, you have to see this one.",Memento

It's also a film about trust. What should you trust; your subjective memory, or the proof of evidence you photographed and put down on paper? Since, the main actor doesn't have a short term memory, the last thing is what he relies on.
The film is shown backwards. Not that people walk balkwards, but they start with the last scene, play it, move back to the second last scene, and this way go back to the beginning.Starting at the end, is starting at the moment that his wife's killer is killed. But how did he find out that this was the killer. Especially without a short term memory which makes him forget everything that happened since his wife's death. And how did he get his injury. And who are all the people he meets on the way? You will find out (will you) at the end (or is it the beginning?) of the movie. You hope at least.The best part of the movie is the first half, where you just watch with amazement that the movie really works!

The second half of the movie, just discover that things are not as simple as they seem. And you ask yourself: do I still get it or not.

********  SPOILERS  ***** ***ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE FILM****
Ever heard of false memories? Even Lenny in the film points out that memories can't always be relied on. That's why there can be 2 different guys in the bathroom- because it's Lenny's memories, and they can change, if Lenny gets it into his head that it was a certain person- e.g. Teddy. The story of Sammy Jenkins, which was in black and white, is NOT TRUE. Didn't you get it? NOBODY MURDERED LENNY'S WIFE. A guy who broke into the house and raped her and struck Lenny to the ground, which caused his memory defect, was probably really already dead as Teddy said. Of course, you might choose to believe that Teddy was lying that time, too (as he does often, anyway), but I think it was true (and why would Teddy lie about it, since he had nothing to gain by this?) - since we see a picture of Lenny lying in bed with his wife, with I'VE DONE IT tattooed on his chest: SHE WAS STILL ALIVE AFTER HE LOST HIS ABILITY TO REMEMBER, and he had killed the guy; but he was only shortly happy because of his revenge (which the picture Teddy took showed) and then he simply forgot. The story of Sammy is so important because IT IS ACTUALLY THE TRUE STORY OF LENNY AND HIS WIFE. She died of too many insulin shots as he described, but he didn't want to remember it. Haven't you ever heard that people repress some memories, that they stay in the subconsciousness, but pop up in an unexpected way? He preferred to believe there was still a bad guy somewhere who was responsible for everything- and looking for him in order to kill him would give his life a meaning. That's what the ending is about. So when Teddy told him the truth (as I believe), Lenny decided to make Teddy his bad guy. That's why he copied his license plate number and had it tattooed, and wrote ""Don't believe his lies"". Why not? After all, he did lie to him and used him to kill Jimmy. Natalie lied and used him, too, to get rid of Dodd (who would otherwise threaten her or maybe kill her - obviously he was some guy involved in the drug dealing business with Jimmy). But it seems she was afterwards honestly trying to help him (and was interested in him in other ways, but what's the point when he can't even remember her). I think both Teddy and Natalie are neither good not bad, they seem to genuinely like him, but they also both used him to solve their problems. BTW, I first thought when Natalie gave Lenny the info, that she was maybe setting Teddy up (because she knew he had something to do with Jimmy's death), but no, she hadn't even made the connection, and she told Lenny the truth that time and did help him find his guy- the guy that Lenny decided to pursue. So the lie that Teddy was guilty for Lenny's wife's death is the lie that Lenny had made up.The only question that is left unanswered is: What is Lenny going to do after he's killed Teddy? Start looking for another 'John G.'? Probably.",Memento

The main character is Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce. His wife was murdered, and the murderer gave Leonard a right good smack too. The result was that Leonard since then can not form new memories. He sets out to find his wife's killer. Not being able to form memories makes this quite difficult. As such he tattoos clues on his body, takes polaroids and writes lots of notes.The movie is shown backwards. So you see a scene, then you see the scene that led up to that. Strange at first.

I agree that the film is extremly well-crafted, imaginative and stylish - but that does does make it a top-ranked film.Above all, a film must first have a compelling plot/story-line (which ""Momento"" has) but it must be presented in some fashion that the viewer can reasonably hope to understand.  If it doesn't, then the film must convey its message to the viewer through visual and sound impact.  ""Memento"" is only average in the latter approach.Frankly, this movie is just plain incomprehensible and fails miserably because of it.  I tried to understand it, but after awhile one reachs the ""I just don't care about these characters anymore"" point and gives up.  A truly great film must be outstanding in all facets of filmmaking and must be able to communicate its message to the general audience.  ""Memento"" fails on this count.When people rate films (as with any other rating exercise that spans a long time period), they tend to remember and focus only on that which is ""fresh"" in their mind - in this case, recent films while forgetting and failing to keep the current film in proper perspective against the many, many truly great films of the past.While an interesting film, ""Memento"" by no means deserves to be in the IMDB Top 250 films of all time.",Memento

The concept was clever and consistent, the editing was sharp, and through most of the film you could almost empathize with Leonard and his ""condition"".However, it is not the ninth best film of all time. I'm not positive that Nolan is a big Hitchcock fan, but he should be thrilled that Memento is ranked above every one of Hitchcock's films.If you don't appreciate the plot devices, you probably won't like the film. You are actually forced to connect with Leonard, follow the notes and solve the mystery, because there is nothing else for you to do or see.The characters, scenery and plot are all secondary. Without the devices, it would look like a tame NYPD Blue episode. To keep your attention from finish to start, nothing is unintentionally given away. To accomplish this, the places and people Leonard sees are limited in number as well as range, and hints are parceled out sparingly from scene to scene.If you take everything into consideration, M.

While flowing backward in chronology in a perfectly synchronized manner, we yet still move forward in terms of development and yes...even in terms of the drama's critical movement. I thought that what I was going to see was just this clever tapering of scene upon the scene before, but what I got was such a rich and flowing evolution of the central character (as well as support) that I was left with an instant resolve to include this movie in my collection asap.

1157,bdogg_2001,Great psychological thriller that leaves you in deep thought,10,8 November 2006,"Memento follows the life of Leonard Shelby, a man who was diagnosed with anterograde amnesia after the junkie who has just raped and murdered his wife hit him over the head with his gun. The main symptom of Leonard's condition is that he cannot create new memories since the incident. He can only remember seeing his wife getting killed and everything before it. This means he can never remember anyone he's met since the incident, what he's done, or even how long it's been since he lost his memory. Lenny is intent on finding and killing the man who raped and murdered his wife, and can only keep track of his progress by taking polaroids of the people he's met and jotting notes on them, tattooing notes all over his body, and so forth. As well as Lenny not knowing what he's done before each given scene, the audience is kept in the dark, too. This is done by showing each memory sequence in reverse order. That is, we start off by seeing the end first, then the next scene will lead up to how that end scene got started, etc. all the way to the start.If you were to ask me what, in my opinion, is the most brilliantly crafted movie I've ever seen, I would instantly think Memento. Although it wasn't at all easy for me to follow the first time I saw it (the backwards sequences must be paid close attention in order to understand how everything fits together), it still captured me all the way through the film. I didn't fully appreciate it until I watched it through a second time, after which I decided this has to be one of the best movies of all time. The ending is just plain genius, and left me thinking on so many different levels for a long time afterwards. After seeing it a third, and then a fourth time, I was just plain mindblown at the genius of the writing of this movie. What I thought were flaws in the movie (which I accepted because no movie is perfect) turned out to make perfect, logical sense (look in the goofs section of this movie and see those labeled ""incorrectly regarded as goofs"").If you haven't yet seen this one, put it at the top of your list, it's a must-see! it will leave you perplexed and I can almost guarantee you that you'll find yourself discussing it with the people around you and thinking deeply on many levels about the concepts this movie presents (if you're anything like me).

A gimmick movie is a movie which depends on a gimmick in the storytelling or character development to hold your interest. Most gimmick movies from ""Nick of Time"" to ""Sliding Doors"" don't really hold up but others like ""Memento"" and ""Seven"" do. Here are the gimmicks in ""Memento"" :1)The main character, played by Guy Pearce has short term memory problems.2)The story is told backwards.The reason this works where the others don't is that the two gimmicks work in conjunction. There are scenes when characters appear and talk to Guy Pearce like they've known him for years but he's clueless- and so are you.The acting is solid. Pearce does a nice job as somebody who no matter how hard he tries doesn't have clue what's going on. Carrie-Ann Moss plays the love interest in a nice follow-up to ""The Matrix"". Joe Pantiliano is outstanding (of course, he always is).Having said all that, I felt let down at the ending. I didn't get that sense that the wool had been pulled over my eyes as I did with ""The Usual Suspects and especially ""The Sixth Sense"". I think it needed another 30 minutes of storytelling.

1166,stigwiksnes,Ignorance is NOT blizz...,10,13 March 2002,"This movie came as a huge surprise on me in a very positive way. Once in a while there are screenwriters and/or directors who really want to do something extraordinary to impress the viewers of their production. As an example, Groundhog Day had the main character relive the same day over and over again for ages until he finally got the girl of his dreams in the end, and it worked. Fight Club also gave you an intense story where two very different characters slowly evolved to a movie climax rarely seen, because to most people the answer to all the story's conflicts is to unimaginable. A closer example to ""Memento"" is ""The Usual Suspects"" from 1994, which gave you a very exciting story set in the criminal underworld run by Kayzer Zose, a man everybody fears but no one knows who he is...a lot like the main character in ""Memento.""The story is about insurance investigator Leonard, who suffers from short-term memory loss. Leonard got injured after intervening on his wife's murder. The murderer was still there when Leonard walked in on them, thus the main character ended up with a cracked skull (figuratively speaking).The movie's opening scene is where most crime stories would end; the main character gets his wife's murderer. The rest of the movie is built upon the fragments of memories that led Leonard getting his guy, in other words this movie is kind of told backwards, starting from the mentioned opening scene and ending where the whole situation actually begun... sound confusing? Well, I was confused for about fifteen minutes but once I understood what was going on the rest was just pure genius. At one point I asked myself: ""How can a story told backwards actually get more exciting by the minute?"" As much as I would give you some information about this, you really have to see the movie for yourself to actually understand what a gem this really is. The tension curve is always rising, with an ending so surprisingly good that this movie is up there with stunners like aforementioned ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Fight Club.""This is a totally unmissable movie for lovers of the crime/mystery genre.",Memento

An unpleasant movie as I watch it for the very first time. If you have a great ability to remember things you've seen and heard, you'd be able to understand it the very 1st time you watched it and then this will probably be just an average movie. But if you have a bad memory, though maybe not as bad as Leonard's(Pearce) memory, at first you'd find it hard to understand. So you'd probably watch it twice. The plot is backwards so it's confusing. You have to connect the start of his 15 minutes latest memory-which has passed 'bout 15 minutes- to the end of his 2nd latest 15 minutes, which is shown about 15 minutes after his latest memory. It's hard to put the pieces together. You'd probably watch it three times to enjoy it. At first it's unpleasant and it's not something you'd immediately like. But as you watch it for the 2nd or 3rd time, you find yourself enjoying thinking bout the movie, putting the fragments of his memory. And every fragment is great. Every 15 minutes of his memory has a feeling and also an objective. It help you dive into Leonard's memory (one that he can never remember). The final part, his last memory that we dive into is shocking. That he is never to remember any of the things he had done is good as it is bad for Leonard. In one hand, he will never be satisfied cause he will never remember even if he had succeed. In the other hand, it is the drive of vengeance that gave meaning to his life in his unusual life. This is a movie that - not only explained a disease but also - made us feel the feelings and of an ill character.It's a great movie.

The first fifteen minutes of the movie are completely undecipherable to the viewer, as it takes time for the audience to figure out the unique style of multiple narratives and reverse story-telling used by the director. After that, though, the movie grips your senses and takes you on a suspense-filled ride, and the suspense does not end until the credits start rolling down. The climax of the movie takes you off-guard and you keep on thinking about the movie for days. You have to watch it at least twice to understand each and every scene and dialogue. The movie has a great concept, and an excitingly taut storyline. Guy Pearce acts marvelously well, especially in scenes when he forgets his whereabouts and the identities of people he meets. Carrie-Anne Moss does full justice to her character, though her dialogue delivery is somewhat sloppy. Joe Pantoliano acts wonderfully, as usual. This one is my personal favorite in the genre of psychological thriller. The movie is refreshingly innovative, and I'm sure that viewers looking for an intelligent plot and a lightning-fast narrative. would revere this as the best piece of cinema of all time. The gritty direction also allows each and every character develop deeply, engrossing the viewers even more. Nolan is a master film-maker, and steers the movie through the mind of the protagonist, delivering a gripping thriller. He focuses more on the mentality of the characters, rather than the physical elements of the story. It somewhat reminds me of the short story 'The Sphinx without a Secret' by Oscar Wilde.

It is indeed every bit the cinematic brilliance that its rating suggests and ,in fact, I rented it solely on the rating it had received here on the imdb (part of a little experiment that I was doing to see how well my tastes matched up with those of everyone else).  The film is rife with existential commentary which in the end seems to be the point of the film.  For some individuals this film may be difficult to watch as you are forced to trace the main character's bizarre brand of introspection through a sequence of events and narration that are delivered to you in reverse chronological order.  Our minds perceive time in a linear fashion so out of sequence filming can be an absolute disaster as many film makers have discovered.

RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE"", and the rest saying facts leading up to the murderer. He also finds his Polaroid pictures, one with a guy with glasses and a mustache, named Teddy, and other pictures of information. Everyday he has to go through the same thing, so you gotta feel bad for him. For the rest, you probably have to find out the stuff yourself.I love how Nolan takes control of his movies like this, I guess he wants everything to be good, and he did a pretty good job doing so. He creates the most innovated dramas that nobody can miss, and thats why he goes right up to one of my favorite directors.

With his total loss of short term memory, he can't hang on to the clues he finds.The movie shows us Leonard's story from end to beginning so it's easy to get caught up in the strange loops of the narrative. This technique is not just a gimmick. The inverted sequence drives the story in ways that make events flow in a way we can follow, but also hits us with sudden ambushes. Memento puts us inside the mind of a man whose mind can't work right. The experience is strange and disorienting, rare and uncomfortable.The best illustration of this occurs some way through the movie. We are abruptly cut to a junk yard, and we hear Leonard thinking to himself ""Am I chasing him? Or is he chasing me?"" And at this point, we don't know. Despite everything we've seen and heard, and figured out so far, we have NO idea. There is simply no way to make it fit in. And no time to sort it out. We are very much in Leonard's skin.Even if told in a normal sequence, Memento has layers beyond the story line. Beyond the story line about Leonard's mission, we see how life delivers rough justice: What happens to Leonard is rough justice for what he did to someone who suffers from the same memory loss. The stranger we see Leonard murder at the beginning of the movie is receiving severe judgment for his crimes. Also, everyone who interacts with Leonard takes advantage as soon as they discover his shortcoming. A pretty dark take on human nature.""in medias res"" starting the story in the middle is an effective way to tell a story. Memento may begin at the end, but it constantly keeps us in the middle of things. The rare experience it provides is good reason to see it. It's also the reason it's not a big commercial success. Watching Memento again, you can't re-experience what you experience seeing it the first time, and you may find the initial experience so disconcerting you don't recognize that that's the payoff.

1183,AndyWakes,"""Memories...they're just an interpretation, not a record""",10,6 January 2015,"The most common criticism of this film is that it's ""hard to follow"" or ""too unconventional."" Well, that's exactly the point! The movie is intended to disorient the audience so that we feel the way the protagonist (Guy Pearce) feels with his short-term memory condition. After the opening of the film, it works its way backwards to show how we got to this point. Slowly, the entire plot is shown in flashbacks that reflect the character's 15-minute memory. There is also another ""timeline"" shot in black in white that happens in chronological order, a true showcase of Nolan's skill as a director. We learn that his wife was killed in a break-in that left him with a head injury leaving his long-term memory intact but unable to make ""new"" memories. He is bent on catching his wife's killer, which proves to be a difficult task given his condition. Before his memory resets, he takes annotated Polaroid's and tattoos himself with clues to which he is after, and what his situation is. However, this allows for him to be manipulated by those around him, and even himself. In his mostly positive review of the film, Roger Ebert seemed to discover a huge plot hole. How does he remember that he was short-term memory loss if the last thing he remembers is his wife's death? That seems like a legitimate observation that should discredit the film's cleverness. However, his memory of this is triggered by a tattoo on his hand of the name of another man (who becomes very important later) who had the same condition. Anyway where was I? Oh! ""Memento"" is a brilliant, mind-mending film that works both as a thriller and a psychological drama. It will undoubtedly receive very different interpretations from viewer to viewer (just like memories in real life). As the protagonist says: ""memories...they're just an interpretation, they're not a record.""",Memento

I will admit that it has little redeeming quality message wise, but the film is superbly made, and is really an original creative work of art. I cannot even begin to fathom the technical complexities of writing a script chronologically from two points in time, having the story work from those two points toward each other until they meet in the middle, and make all of it make sense only then, and yet manage to build suspense and keep peoples' interest up to that point. Simply stunning acting on the parts of Carrie Ann Moss and Guy Pierce, and just enough comedy to keep it from being as dark as it could have been. The plot twists keep changing everything you already knew, and there are plenty of moments where you think, oh...so he did that because....oh. It is quite a roller coaster of a film and comes off artistically as about a nine out of ten.",Memento

Guy Pearce is a great actor, and I think he deserves to be recognized. at first i empathized with his character, until the last piece in the puzzle was placed. when that happened, i thought his character was not that likable, though i understood him. this movie is cleverly done. its movies like these that bring us something meatier, not something that a studio sells with all that gloss that comes in many of today's movies.",Memento

He suffers greatly as he fails to find anyone he can trust and begins to lose faith in himself.Memento is an absolute first of its kinds. The story is told in reverse and every scene came after the next. The events being told backwards is not a disadvantage as it only gives the viewers an opportunity to know only what Leonard knows.

His voice is serious and his acting is of incredible quality. The scenes begin and end in all the right places.This is not the film to see if you feel like a light viewing.

1188,SittingStill,When Form Meets Function,10,3 May 2005,"I loved Pulp Fiction. I was one of the many who bought into this wave of non-linear storytelling, and believed that the structure as crafted by Quentin was the cat's meow.And then I saw Memento.And I saw it again.And again.Christopher Nolan's gripping story of an amnesiac seeking revenge on the culprit who caused his condition and raped and murdered his wife takes the non-linear structure to a whole new level. Most importantly, the structure-- which is told chronologically backwards-- is not thrown in frivolously. Rather, it serves a definitive purpose and compliments the story being told: it allows us, the audience, to experience the vertigo, the unknown, that our protagonist experiences. We start with our hero's conclusion, and as the story unfolds, the issue becomes, how did our hero arrive at this conclusion.Memento further works in taking advantage of a technique utilized so perfectly in Usual Suspects, and to a lesser degree in Fight Club--the unreliable narrator. In this respect, Nolan plays off of the long standing general principle that the narrator is trustworthy. Unlike Usual Suspects, however, where the protagonist turned out to be unreliable because he was outright lying, the unreliability of our hero in Memento is not (necessarily) that he was lying, but that his condition resulted in a distortion of his perception of what was true and what was false.Therein rests the underlying theme of Memento. In a film where every character takes advantage of our hero's condition, he conditions himself to take advantage of his own condition.",Memento

The story is centred around the protagonist Leonard, who explains throughout the film about his short term memory loss (known as anterograde amnesia), as well as focusing on his attempts to solve and avenge the murder of his wife. However, what divides 'Memento' apart from other films is the complexity within the narrative and portrayal of the structure. The bulk of the film alternates from colour to black and white scenes, which then converge at the end of the film leading us to the beginning of the proceeding scene. Nolan uses the black and white scenes to represent the past; whilst including other material, such as flashbacks, that precedes the beginning of the black and white scenes- observed as Leonard's long term memory. However, just like the protagonist, us as the audience do not know the exact length of time those memories occurred- thus creating the ""most interesting ambiguity of the film"" (Christopher Nolan). As one of the highest grossing directors in history, Nolan is able to create an unusual yet captivating masterpiece, which continues to be admired and loved seventeen years later.",Memento

Some of the films detractors say there are plot holes in it. But I think most of them can be explained away be the human condition (people in the movie making dumb decisions and forgetting things). I noticed one or two of mistakes in peoples assessment because they weren't really paying attention (Carry an Moss takes pity on him and helps him after she manipulates him but it's hard to tell because you see the action backward).This is what the film is about. A man who is constantly forced to trust his instincts and the mistakes and victories that go with that. It's not about philosophy or society cause frankly, most people don't think about those things on a day to day basis. It's about one guy in a unique and truly frightening situation. A couple of words of warning. This is not a sit back and relax film. Throughout the movie you find yourself trying to connect the dots.

Leonard is Sammy Jenkis in a way, despite his claim he is much more organized, he has been continuously tricked into avenging his wife, similar to the way Sammy Jenkis was tricked into administering repeated insulin shots to his wife.

1200,Drakkhen,An unforgettable movie about forgetting,10,5 April 2001,"""I thought the whole purpose of reading a book is to see what happens next.""In conclusion, this is probably the best movie, both from a technical perspective and an entertainment perspective, that I have seen in months - maybe years.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys not being spoon-fed while they watch a movie!Because of the way the story unfolds, the audience is consistantly left partially in the dark about everything that is going on.  Why is Lenny here? How did he get here?  Who exactly is Lenny?  We find out, but not until the end.  Don't even try guessing...okay, you can try.The last thing Lenny remembers is his wife getting raped and murdered.  He can't remember anything else, and he knows it.  So, he uses tatoos (which is a very significant metaphoric device, since memories are often described as tatoos of the mind) and polaroids to help him seek his revenge.  Lenny writes notes on the back of his polaroids so he knows what to do the next time he reads them - almost training himself.By playing the chronological order of the film, the director accomplishes 2 things: First, it lets the audience partially experience anterograde amnesia by not allowing us to know what happened before.  Secondly, it totally disorients the audience, because we soon realize through our own experience through cause and effect, that for any particular effect, the cause can be a myriad of different possibilities.  The viewer realizes that it is practically impossible to guess what happened before, yet we still try. Interactive, and keeps everyone at the edge of their seats.Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano round off the key characters, and their performances are amazing, both actors had to act out the script while keeping a certain sense of ambiguity to their character, which is no easy task.  Think Olivia Willams in ""The Sixth Sense"", acting almost interactively with Willis during the dinner table scene, and you'll know what that's about.The movie puts Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential) in the lead role as Leonard (Lenny), a person with anterograde amnesia - a condition that prevents him from creating new, or short-term memories, while his long-term memories seem to be intact.  He can remember things that happened years ago, but things that happened 5 minutes ago are lost almost immediately.The gimmick is simple, actually.  The film plays out in reverse.  The final scene is shown at the beginning of the movie, and each scene after that is what happened before the current scene you are watching.  This even sounds pretty gimmicky, but trust me, it works better than anyone could have imagined.Going into Memento, I was not sure exactly what to expect from the movie.

I advise you not to read my review or anybody else's if you have not yet seen the movie. The following might contain some SPOILERS. If you are worried about the spoilers and yet still wanna read, just read the very last paragraph :)Amazingly the movie is played antichronologically. This puts the viewers into the life of Leonard, by not knowing what has happened in the near past, not knowing what has lead him into current situation. I was so absorbed by the film for the two hours, I even had difficulties coping with my real life for a few days.Directing was excellent. The whole movie showed a unique atmosphere, with its unique music and its stylish art directions. Acting was good but I think the casting of Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss caused too much prejudice (because of The Matrix, ofcourse) about the plot. btw Guy Pearce was just the perfect man for the role.The movie in whole, is excellent and beautiful yet I found a few minor glitches (goofs). I can understand that Leonard uses photographs to keep the memories after the incident, but how does he remember where he keeps his photographs and his camera (how does he remember the system he is using to remember stuff... like in the scene where he finds some documents about the police investigations and stuff). Also I don't get the part where he writes something like 'she has lost a person too bla bla' on the back of Natalie's photograph, since he couldn't have linked the death of Jimmy with the photograph with Natalie and Jimmy together. Also there is a goof in the goofs section about Leonard knowing he has a memory problem. This condition Leonard is suffering from is called 'anterograde amnesia' and from my short studies of psychology in the past, the people who have this brain problem somehow always know they do have a problem with their memory.I feel the need of buying the DVD version of this film. This movie has now entered my top ten list :) I especially recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed The Usual Suspects, Tarantino films, and Guy Ritchie films. Must see!!!",Memento

In fact, this movie has only one bad point--its low replay value.  A large part of the movie's intensity revolves around being in the same shoes as the protagonist, not knowing anything about a character beyond a brief hand-written note.  Once you know the full chronological story, which characters are good and which bad, the movie loses a lot of its effect.If you haven't seen Memento, go rent it--it's excellent.

The big problem is that he has short term memory, and he must take notes and leave himself clues to find the man he seeks.The film tells the story in reverse chronological order. the end of the story is the first thing we witness, and the big twist, the most crucial part of the story which explains countless details, happens at the end of the film.Confusing at all? you don't know the half of it.I strongly recommend this movie.

Unfortunately this doesn't happen very often, but sometimes it happens. This is the case of Memento, yet from the beginning we realize that we are not going to see a usual film. The first image we see after the excellent music of the opening titles by David Julyan is a man with a photograph, we don't know anything about this man or the man on the photograph, still we begin to ask questions. That is one of the main achievements of this film, yet from the beginning you are trapped in a plot which will interest you till the end of the film. With a script as brilliant as The Usual Suspects, Memento is an original film in all the aspects. The story is one of the most original ever written, and visually it's very different from the most of the films, as the action doesn't go from beginning to end. To sum up, Memento is a film that everybody who likes cinema should go to see, most of the people who have seen The Usual Suspects will leave the cinema with a very similar feeling, I want to see this film again.

1240,freedomsbeat,Why didn't Lenny buy a PalmPilot?,5,24 March 2001,"Not to be cynical, but why didn't our hero just buy a laptop or a palmpilot? I mean, the last time I checked, tattoos cost a significant amount of $$ and, well, a PDA would have been much more convenient as well (heck, we know he had the money - why not get a nice digital camera instead of the Polaroid as well). I know I'm being totally trivial here, but a better movie wouldn't have me questioning this.I was really waiting for this one - the killer reviews and film festival buzz had me running to the theaters on opening day.  Firstly, let me say that I'm now a Guy Pierce fan - the guy simply rocks.  Carrie Ann Moss also surprised me with her very strong performance, and I've always liked Joe Pantolione (sp?) since I saw him in Bound years ago.  Aside from the great acting and occasional surprises (I loved the ""am I chasing him? Oh wait, he's chasing me!"" thing), this movie suffered from being a bit too full of itself. Don't get me wrong, the backwards narrative was an entertaining device- but without this device this movie would simply be your average thriller (a well shot one, but still average). SPOILERS I left the theater with a very, very empty feeling in my stomach.  I almost felt sick.  I love movies, and when a movie presents itself so compellingly as this one did, I literally give the film makers 2 hours of my life: I separate myself from the world and try to get caught up in the world of these characters.  My problem is that the ending didn't justify my attention.  When I go to a suspense thriller, I love to mentally jot down the clues and try to put the puzzle together - there was no puzzle here. Think about it, what in the movie points to the Sammy story being fabricated (other than a near-subliminal shot of Sammy turning into Lenny in the home for the mentally disabled- that's the sort of retarded trick that has people saying `holy cow, it was all there and I missed the frames before! It's ALL there..' Nope.. It's all a trick). NOTHING showed that.  Yes, there were hints that Lenny was being manipulated and yes there were hints that there was a larger conspiracy - great stuff that had me on the edge of my seat till the ending.  But what did we get??  Pseudo-psychological bull about him creating the Sammy story to give him a point of reference that's detached from his own self to hide his guilt and confusion while he goes on to seek revenge for a murder that didn't exist???? Come on people, we're smarter than that! STOP BELIEVING THAT THE INCONSISTENCIES CAN BE EXPLAINED AWAY BY THE `HUMAN CONDITION' AND HOW MEMORIES ARE SO ABSTRACT SO WE SHOULDN'T BE CRITICAL OF THE PLOT HOLES IN THIS MOVIE. That's cheating!  At the point we could have been told that he was abducted by alien life-forms and fed false memories so that he would go out and do their evil deeds! It would have made just as much sense (well, ok that's a little far fetched, but you see my point - or I hope you do).Lastly, think about Pulp Fiction (one of my fav. American movies of the past 10 years): take away the non-linear story line and what do you have? Great characters, an intriguing movie, incredible dialogue and a rich, memorable experience- the movie was enriched by the timeline but it did not MAKE the movie.  Memento, on the other hand, would not exist were it not for the film-school experiment with a backwards narrative.  It was a gimmick that made a hollow movie `work,' much like the big special-fx in ID4 that we art-house fools love to shake our fingers at.  Best movie of the year? Maybe.. The year has sucked so far (come on: `Gladiator' or `Crouching Tiger Hidden Tiger' up for Oscars? Must be the year of sappy manipulation and hollow characters!). Go rent Bound if you want a nice and juicy noir (or rent the classics).PLEASE email me if you agree! My film school buds are all teasing me for not liking such a ""brilliant"" movie..

A movie that gets you thinking is great, I love that, but this one requires you to think non-stop, which is exhausting! I came away feeling very tired and very confused. After a discussion with my boyfriend we figured out what it had all meant eventually but we didn't feel entertained.Guy Pearce is brilliant, I'm hoping to see him in excellent roles such as this in the future and Carrie Anne Moss plays an interesting part very well. The way the movie was put together eg. the scenes in reverse order was interesting, although I feel as if I'd have to see it again, preferrably from the end to the beginning, to see how it all fits together properly.
Overall, the movie is well filmed, acted and written and definately worth seeing. There are a lot of confusing elements, parts of the movie that still don't make sense to me, and I think that there should have been some explanation either throughout or at the end of the movie. I don't know about it's ranking here on the best movies of all time, although it's better than most movies these days, I wouldn't have included it myself, but I tend to like movies to be a little more entertaining than this.

Lenny, as he liked to be called, is a man suffering from short term memory loss and is trying to find his wife's killer.  The movie itself runs backwards.  The opening parts of the movie is how you would normally see a movie end.  You'll see about 4-5 minutes of a flashback, then the movie cuts to a side story of Lenny talking to someone on the phone about a man with the same condition as him named Sammy Jankis.  Then it will go back to another flashback that happens right before the previous flashback and ends where the previous flashback began.  Sound confusing?

Memento is a true masterpiece of creativity and masterful acting.  Guy Pearce should make the majority of young hollywood actors feel ashamed of themselves.  Pearce has emerged as a truly exciting and versatile actor that blows almost everyone out of the water.Guy Pearce plays Leonard, a man suffering from a form of amnesia that doesn't allow him to retain memories.  Thus, he wakes up every morning unaware of what has happened to him previously.  He can only recall memories from the time before he contracted his condition.  All Leonard knows is that he is in search of the man who has raped and killed his wife.  He has tattooed everything he knows about this man to his body so as not to forget. The story proceeds in reverse chronological order, which works because Leonard can't tell how time is progressing anyway, due to his amnesia. Leonard meets many people on his journey, but who can he trust.  Many people are intent on taking advantage of Leonard due to his lack of memory (the motel manager who charges Leonard for two rooms).  Many people are not what they seem to be.  Is Leonard what he seems to be?  Will the story end how you expect?  No.  Memento had me guessing the whole time.  Right when I thought I knew ""the secret"" the story would twist around and I would be left in complete awe.The movie also stars Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Anne-Moss.  Who both do great jobs, especially Pantoliano.  Memento is a movie that everyone should see, a gem in a sea of tired Hollywood stories.  Christopher Nolan has shown that he can direct a truly new and creative movie.  See it now.",Memento

I found myself appreciating Mr. Nolan's directing more at home, and Mr. Pearce's performance stood out the second time around. What remained the same, however, was the complete lack of interest I had in the story. It seems Mr. Nolan was so pleased with the gimmick he had that there was little atttention paid to generating suspense and creating involving and/or compelling characters. There were moments at home when I was entertained by the film, but I was never fully interested in it.

1272,paul-daniels3,Memento is a unique film in many regards,9,24 March 2003,"'Memento' is edited in a way unlike any other movie I have seen. The story in the film is played out backwards in time; this break in the linear timeline of the film is similar to that of 'Last Year At Marienbad'. As you watch the show, you will see about 15 minutes of the story, then it will cut to a scene about 15 minutes before the start of the last segment you saw. So, to try and explain it more clearly, its like if all the scenes in the movies are played in the reverse order (so, instead of going from scene A to scene B, 'Memento' shows the scenes from scene Z to scene Y). This style forces you pay attention to what you have just seen, and remember it. Doing the film this way changes the show into more of a puzzle, a puzzle that you figure out over time. The effect of the movie as a whole is that it causes you to question your own memories (since Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce, does not have the ability to form new short term memories), you question what it would be like if you could not create new short-term memories. For that matter, this film raises the question of if you can trust your own memories (did you really ever go to the store, or do you just think you went to the store?) Personally, this show caused me to considered what it would be like if I could not trust any empirical information or knowledge. Because of how different this film is, and how it forces you to think while you watch it (unlike most movies today), I enjoyed 'Memento' very much.",Memento

This is a movie which you have to sit down and watch and not pause it or turn it off or fall asleep & especially not watch while you are drunk or stoned. The film follows Leonard (Guy Pearce) a regular guy from San Francisco trying to find out who raped & murdered his wife. One problem. He has a short term memory loss. Solution. He uses tattoo's & photo's to remember certain things. Ie. where he is staying, his car, the people he knows. The film itself goes backwards and forwards. Your probably saying what the hell is this guy talking about. Well in the movie there are colour scenes & black & white scenes. The black & white scenes are going forward & they are before Leonard has found the person who raped & murdered his wife. The colour scenes are going backwards so right at the start we see Guy Pearce blow Joe Pantolianos brains out (don't worry this isn't a spoiler as it happens right at the start) then we see a black and white scene then we see the scene before Pearce shot Pantoliano and how it got to the first scene and so fourth throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan has just done something i would like to do and that is to breakout through writing & directing one of the greatest movies in the history of film & have it shown. The performances in this film are brilliant from Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano & Carrie-Anne Moss. The script is bursting with originality and is a must see movie for anyone who enjoys a good movie.

Memento is masterfully edited and directed, with a complex plot and unique, intricate time line that puts the viewer in a unique state of mind. Due to the way Memento is directed and put together, you end up not knowing who to trust, what anyone's motives are, or even what happened when and in what order events took place. In short, the movie puts you in the character's state of mind - a man who has short-term memory loss, and all he knows is either tattooed on his body or written on some photos. Memento is disorienting, its confusing, and its a unique experience. Nolan really succeeds in putting the viewer in the character's frame of mind, and in keeping us hooked until the very end.

He tries to find her killer, as he wanders around, using a series of Polaroids and tattoos as his guides. Leonard doesn't know who he can trust, who's using him, who he has met, and if they've hurt him before. Pearce brings a beautifully subtle performance as Leonard, haunted by the past, because that's all he can remember. Despite his organized system, we see him struggle just to function. By reversing all the sequences of events, Nolan allows us to only know as much as Leonard knows. Moss and Pantaliano are a strong supporting cast, and you don't know if they're allies or enemies. This film may require several viewings. It is worth it. As soon as you think you know what's happening, another fragmented, misplaced idea will surface.

What makes this movie (and most of Nolan's movies) so strong is, that it combines an intelligent plot with a personal drama. It also shows, that the writers and the director want to serve cinematic demands as well as literary. It manages a symbiosis, that is, in my opinion, very hard to shoot.The story itself is not that complicated. Leonard lost his wife and is out for her murderer. He has no short-term memory, what makes it almost impossible for him to be a good pathfinder, that's why he has a system to remember things, including notes, photos and tattoos.This Story is told from the last scene to the first of chronological order. Besides there is a chronologically told story of Leonard investigating against a man, who he thinks is a insurance fraudster.At the end the two stories climax together as nothing is as it seemed. I loved the backward storytelling so the recipient does not know more than the main character. beyond that the movie shows, which tricks our brain plays us to make us feel comfortable. At this point we see short story character, that never has been come to big screen before. (In my opinion)The acting is good. Only the character Teddy is a bit overacted by Joe Pantoliano, but on the other hand it fits his role. All in all I loved to sit in a scene and feel as uninformed as the main character.

1290,TunaDm,One of the greatest.,10,3 May 2016,"As summary says, this is also my personal opinion about this movie. There is something about this movie that makes you think about it again, and again, and again. It has absolutely amazing plot, amazing directing, amazing performances. This is probably one of the most unique movies that has ever been made, and that makes it on top of my personal top movies list.Plot goes around Leonard Shelby, the guy whose wife has been killed and he is investigating her murder. But, he has one problem - he can't remember any new stuff, so he makes very strange system to help himself remember things.That's all about plot you should know, watch the movie and then see for yourself that this is absolute masterpiece by Christopher Nolan!",Memento
1291,peterpearce-58025,Memento review,7,4 October 2017,Memento was a very good film about a man called Lenny with anterograde amnesia and in order to progress with his journey he takes photographs and write on them to remember. The storyline uses a technique called fabula and ceujet which is Russian and means the story line from the black and white to the colour crosses over after building from different points.,Memento
1292,jonathantstorm,The whole film is based on a gimmick and is overrated,1,20 January 2006,"Although people may view this as a stupid comment.The entire film is based on a gimmick,yes,there i said it people i mean its basically a simple story done countless times before.A guy is exacting revenge on his enemies for murdering his wife so obviously in the filmmakers mind they had to come up with a cheap gimmick to throw off the viewer and they use this backwards gimmick nonsense that really makes no sense when you look at it by making the main protagonist in the film,a man with short term memory loss who writes on himself,oh how weird is that.The film has average acting,mediocre cinematography but nothing else going for it except a simple story wrapped in a convoluted wannabe virtuoso type film-making.I mean Christopher Nolan is a great director but this is not an outstanding debut like M Night SHyamalan's The Sixth Sense which had a great story,a superb twist and larger than life characters,a scary movie with doses of romance and the physchological horror.Nolan basically rips off Tarantino here with the chronology type film-making.I'm sure some other filmmaker one day will film a similar story like this sideways or some nonsense and it becomes a sensation like the overrated Memento.Besides IMDb rating sucks anyway.This movie would be forgotten eventually",Memento
1293,prakswal,Some memories are best forgotten,8,8 September 2017,"Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is truly a rare and exceptional achievement in modern film-making in that it manages to be new, fresh, hip, and exciting without ever tiring its audience out - unless you're walking into this film without the desire to participate and actively analyse the mysterious details. If that's the case, then this is DEFINITELY not a movie you should see. If, on the other hand, you are open-minded, creative, and alert, you'll definitely appreciate and get a kick out of this one. ""Memento"" is an old-fashioned ""film noir""-type mystery thriller with an intriguing, ingenious twist: outfitting the entire film with a style that mirrors the protagonist's own mental condition while giving the viewer(s) their own perspective as well. It is masterfully filmed and edited in such a way that it is chronologically presented backwards (with two initially separate, parallel story lines - the main one, shot in colour, is the chronologically-backwards story with scenes that intercut with those of the other story, which is filmed more like a documentary, shot in black & white, and mostly takes place inside a motel room with the main character narrating, talking about the effects of his condition, etc.) While the average viewer may already be put off by such a complicated, confusing format, it is a very original premise that is well worth the struggle to figure out.Acting is solid across the board, as is the writing, directing, etc., but special kudos must be extended to the very talented editor Dody Dorn, who successfully managed to put all of these fragments together and help them flow in a smooth, healthy manner that is not easy to pull off.One of the most ""memorable"" films you're likely to ever see, ""Memento"" is an instant classic due to its ground-breaking narrative style and impressive dramatic undertones. For those jaded moviegoers who seek something to keep them awake, interested, and constantly thinking, there couldn't be a better choice than this film.Excerpt from ""Movies that Moved with Prakash Silwal https://www.facebook.com/ektafilmsnp/",Memento

1295,cemilcamci,I love you Nolan,9,13 November 2017,"It might be the most mind-bending Nolan-movie to date, and it truly is spectacular.After seeing all the other masterpieces by C Nolan, I thought it was time to watch his first big movie; Memento. The non-linear structure and the constant character motivations is a classic trait by Nolan. Memento is no exception. The first time I saw this movie I didn't really understand all of it. I only gave this movie a 5/10. But after watching it again and experienced the grasp of Memento am I totally convinced that this really is a blockbuster. The movie is so refreshing with its unique structure and excellent actors. The plot is very solid and because we're talking about a man that can't make new memories is this movie even greater. Because of the unique structure; the audience is forgetting what they just saw. It's the same with the main character. That tight connection between the audience and the movie makes this movie wonderful. But you really need to pay attention. If you miss something you risk missing the greater importance. And if you do; watch it again! Memento really is a fabulous movie. The cinematography is very smooth and the acting is phenomenal. There's really nothing bad about it. It's one interesting, deep and flawless movie. It even got the classic Nolan-ending, the part of the movie that has the most plot-twists.People may say Interstellar is too ambitious; but Memento isn't? Memento is one refreshing, awesome and non-linear thriller that's highly enjoyable. But not as great as his newer creations.9/10",Memento
1296,dschoenike,the best film I've ever seen.,10,6 December 2007,"I'd first like to acknowledge all the outstanding reviews and discussions of Memento written by IMDb users and visitors. I'm not a good enough writer to add anything original or thought provoking that hasn't been said before. What i will write about, are some aspects of Memento that make it such a wonderful film. The attention to detail; Memento practically demands that you watch it a handful of times at a minimum. I firmly believe that any little mistake or oversight would have been greatly magnified, due to the fact this films whole premise is paying attention to facts and details. Even when you think you've discovered a plot-hole, or a situation that doesn't make sense, you have to realize thats's the genius of the film. You're viewing the film the way Leonard is going through life. Where you/he cannot be sure of anything, and there's a fine line between facts and perception. The outstanding acting; I think i've read that Brad Pitt and Alec Baldwin were asked to play the part of Leonard Shelby. It's my opinion, that Guy Pearce is the most underrated actor working today. His portrayal of a normal man living through extraordinary circumstances was nothing short of phenomenal. His ability to hold the viewers attention on his every word and action, really made this film work. Joe Pantoliano was great as Teddy, a guy who was maybe helping Lenny, or just taking advantage of him. Or both? The musical score; Composed and performed by David Julyan, the music is chilling and beautiful. It seemed to me like the music was itself a separate character in the film, with its ability to grab the viewers attention and bring about ranges of emotion. And lastly, the director; Christopher Nolan, in my opinion, has made nothing but excellent films. Not a bad one in the bunch. I think that Memento with a lesser skilled director, would have been an above average movie. But not the mind-bending masterpiece Mr. Nolan gave to us in 2001. Memento is a rare film that requires your full attention, (a few times at minimum) that'll have you thinking about it long after you've viewed it. To me, its a movie that in 20+ years, people will say, ""they don't make 'em like that anymore"". Now, where was I? ;)",Memento

This Movie is really great, with a new topic (which is not easy to find these days), a great script that should win the oscar for best adapted screenplay and an amazing directing. You really can not tell much about the plot, because you realize the ""big picture"" at the end of the movie, and the beginning stands in a new light.

In fact, this movie centers around the haunting, eerie way in which Pierce's character has woven that memory into the very fabric of his existence.The masterpiece of Memento is the way in which the director literally ""sucks"" the viewer into Leonard's ""mind"". This movie truly succeeds at engulfing  the viewer into that swirling, whirling, twisting, dizzying world that constitutes Leonard's confused existence.  Moreover, the mental acrobatics demanded of us to follow this movie is what makes the ending (which is actually the beginning of the story) absolutely the most poignant climax I've experienced since ""Angel Heart"" (in which the detective played by Mickey Rourke discovers that he's been searching for himself -- or rather, the person he used to be -- all along).",Memento

It is all there for us to see, there are no ""goofs"" and certainly no holes in the plot, just our minds' confusion. Once you actually understand the whole plot, you will indeed be able to appreciate the complexity with which Mr. Nolan takes us to it. There is so much to digest the first time around.

1310,minhee,The ending -- Interesting but unsatisfying,6,29 April 2001,"***SPOILERS*** I agree with the other comments on this movie that this is an original and fascinating film.  Kudos to everybody involved.However, I found the ending of the film to be intellectually intriguing but ultimately manipulative and unsatisfying.  We are lead to believe that the beginning of the film (and ending of the ""story"") is the culmination of Lenny's search.  The man that he did kill may not be the man who truly killed his wife, but we believe that Lenny believes the man to be so.  At the end, we find that Lenny has intentionally duped himself.
This ending is intellectually interesting for two reasons: (1) It says something about memory.  Without some goal to strive for, Lenny's life is meaningless and made all the more meaningless by his condition.  His decision to fool himself shows the lengths that he will go to in order to give his life meaning.  (2) The backwards formation of the movie makes us experience what Lenny does.  In the end, we are manipulated and handicapped by our ""condition,"" just as Leonard is frequently manipulated and handicapped.  As a result, there is a rhyme and reason to this manipulation, as opposed to the manipulation of the Usual Suspects, for example.However, while the goal of the movie is to cheat us, and while there is a point in cheating us, I nonetheless don't like be cheated!  It left me wanting more.  Okay, this interesting thing happened, but I was ultimately drawn into the movie by the chase, a chase which was shown to be false. This left me wanting the film to go even farther back.  For example, how did Lenny know that the killer was John G?Also, there are some holes and other unsatisfying elements.  Why did Teddy keep helping him?  I didn't get a good explanation of that.  And Natalie, while suggested to have a significant role in the plot, really does nothing of consequence, besides getting the license plate number for Leonard.This is a great movie, but a bit too much style.  8/10",Memento

1313,colethree,still the best movie of the year,10,26 June 2001,"I was just reading the ""goofs"" for this movie.  There is only one, but in defense of the film makers, screenwriters etc. I will make an argument that the one goof isn't a goof at all.  You say that Lenny shouldn't know that he has a condition because his short term memory loss would prevent him from remembering the condition.  But...I say that he knew the condition existed before he was injured.  Remember Sammy?  I realize that it is up for debate whether Sammy even existed, the movie never gives a definitive answer to this question and it is left up to the viewer. I am persuaded to believe that Sammy existed and  Lenny clearly understood that people could in fact have short term memory loss before he lost his.  Since he can remember everything that happened to him before and up to the assault it makes sense to me that he could remember that he had a condition that he was already familiar with before losing short term memory.  Now on the flip side it is well to argue also that if someone knew all about (another disease in the movie) diabetes, and lost short term memory....then being diagnosed with diabetes after the injury would a person realize and remember to treat the disease?  I don't know.  But it was cleaver of the film makers to attempt to explain Lenny's knowledge of his condtion in this way.
It is a mark of a very well made movie that keeps a person guessing even months after first seeing it. Memento is a very smart movie, that requires thought, attention and an open mind to understand. Brilliant sequencing, shooting, and acting add up to a film that gives one a glimpse into a tragic condition.  This movie will be hard to top.

I did like it, and it was an enjoyable film, but in its self-imposed restriction of only allowing the audience to know as much as Leonard it becomes victim to that restriction. Some reviews here have mentioned good characterizations, yet I think that despite very good efforts by the performers, there was no room for character development because of the very limits the movie imposes on itself. Its greatest achievement is in leading the audience to believe that what Leonard knows - what Leonard holds as ""certainties"" - are all true.MEMENTO is good, and worth seeing.

Although there is nothing really original about the actual story, a man seeking revenge for the murder of his wife, the presentation is truly phenomenal. Guy Pearce, plays Leonard Shelby, a man suffering from short term memory loss after being  hit on the head, trying to save his wife.  Although he remembers everything before the accident, he can only remember things for about 15 minutes at a time afterwards, so he keeps the clues through a series of polaroids, notes and tattoos. The film is told in a series of segments, starting at the end and moving back to the beginning, with a wraparound scene in between each segment.  By telling the story like this, it effectively places the audience in Leonard's shoes, we can see what's happening and know what's going to happen, but we don't know what led up to it, just as Leonard doesn't know. The film sports great performances from Pearce, Joe Pantoliano as Teddy, the shady character that could be a friend or foe and Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, who seems to want to help Leonard. All in all this is a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat, not wondering what's going to happen next, but what happened before.

The whole ""not being able to form new memories"" thing makes for an intriguing film.  Also, the way the scenes are played in reverse chronological order works well. You're thrown into each scene not knowing what has happened just before.... just like Leonard is.  There are also some great characters in this film.  Joe Pantoliano's ""Teddy"" is excellent.Now the cons.... I don't care for movies that leave questions unanswered, and this one leaves MANY questions unanswered.  Plus, it could've gone further back in time (when did he get the other tattoos? how did he get the other clues?, etc.) Also, late in the film, the reverse scene order gets a bit difficult to remember, but not too bad.  Another thing, Leonard seems too calm and at ease each time he loses his memory for someone who is basically waking up in a strange place with strange people.  Often times it seems as though he does remember the people and places and the investigation. But, maybe that's the whole deal.... maybe that's supposed to make you think. But, that brings me back to the unanswered question bit.  I want to know what's going on!And one thing I kept thinking was, ""If Leonard can't remember anything after the incident, how does he know he has a condition?""Oh well, I guess that's part of the intrigue of the film.

So many times before I have seen movies where a new concept or style is introduced, but the movies only quality is that it tried something new. Memento, however, was a great movie to start out with, and had the bonus of a new concept for a story line and a unique, new, and refreshing way of telling the story. The story is told backwards. The end of one scene ends up being the begining of the scene that preceded it. So, unlike any other mystery, in Memento you know the ending yet strive to know the begining. One line in the movie states something along the lines of how memories cannot really be trusted. Only facts can be trusted. Interestingly, at the end as you try to piece everything together, you realize that you have to trust your memory to figure it out. I don't know if the creators of this film meant for this irony to exist, but if they did, then all the more admiration and respect to them. I rarely ever give a movie a 10 rating, but I made the exception in this case. See this movie. Trust me. It is worth more than the rental price.

Nolan often seems obsessed with the nature of time and the manipulation of time and how it can tell and enhance a story, and it certainly does here. This follows a man with a unique condition in which he has no short term memory after an accident which caused his wife's death, and he sets off on a mission to find and kill the person who did this and get revenge. This film deals with a very interesting concept where the man has to discover clues and write them down, because afterword he will forget and have no recollection of what he has just worked out. Like any Thriller/Mystery film you are racking your brain for what might have happened and who might have done it. This film is an extremely exciting and fascinating film with the cast delivering excellent performances, and at points makes you think you might have this memory condition with you thinking 'Hang on, what just happened?'

However, it seems to me that this is one of those movies that, upon additional viewings, becomes less substantial rather than more substantial.  That's because the development of the characters is rather limited and the various twists of plot, done so cleverly, nonetheless fall prey to inconsistency and, eventually, little more than melodrama.  There are any number of problems with plausibility that, in the end, cannot be overlooked because of the film's reliance on its regressively expanding unravelling/complication of plot, and there's not enough in the development of the characters to rescue it from the corner(s) into which it paints itself.

The first strain, played in color, runs backward whereas the next strain, in black and white, runs forwards. This is disorienting at first but the audience gets used to it.

First off i'd like to mention a certain convience of this movie, how can the main character remember that he has a memory disorder, yet can't remember anything else? Think about it, he'd constantly live in the present, and be completely unaware of living in the present, the only way he'd know he was living in the present would be if someone was there to tell him that. So that's a MAJOR plot hole. that's not the worst thing about the movie, the worst thing is that the character's are flat, the plot is flat - C'mon a plot about a guy searching for the guy who killed his wife, with NO twists (if seen without the contrived plot)boring characters, and lame dialogue. Watched in regular motion this movie is not interesting at all. Some people were comparing this to Lynch. Well, comparing it to what lynch has done so far, he ALWAYS uses interesting characters and great atmosphere to tell his stories, not just some lame plot contrivance. The movie isn't terrible, it has it's moments, but it's annoying that it's getting so much praise when movies like lost highway get trashed. Look at Pulp Fiction, Tarantino didn't use just the plot contrivence to make his movie interesting... oh ya and i didn't re read this, bollocks to all the grammar and spelling errors!5/10 Boring, contrived story, with flat characters, the only saving grace is the surprises that occasionally pop up.

It is the most original, mind-bending movie I've seen since Clockwork Orange or the Usual Suspects. I saw this movie simply because I liked Guy Pierce in LA Confidential.  I knew nothing about the plot or style beforehand, and I think that is the best way to initially view this film. (If you haven't seen it yet, stop reading and watch it...NOW!)  I saw it in the late afternoon in a theater with four other people, none of whom I knew.  This movie captivated me from the very beginning.  I loved how it started with something that every one of us has done; developing a Polaroid picture by waving it back and forth. It quickly progresses to an action that (hopefully) very few of us have done; murder.  I had no clue that it was backwards, so I was surprised that someone would be killed in the first five minutes.  As the movie progressed, I kept thinking of various explanations of what was going on.  I usually observe movies and think about them later, but Memento is so captivating and has such a creative style that it is impossible not to come up with motives and theories for what is happening.  It was like riding a roller coaster backwards and blindfolded. I thought I knew what was going on, but by the end I was so amazed and dumbfounded that I didn't know what to think. Memento is so great because of the director's style.  I felt as lost and confused as Lenard, because I didn't know what had just happened.  All of the characters knew, except for Lenard, but they didn't want to tell us. Although the movie is confusing, it is not difficult to follow and all the components are tied together very well.  One other thing that surprised me is that this movie is very funny in a morbid sort of way, especially the parts with Dodd and the hotel room.  This is a great movie, one for the ages.

He told me a little bit about the story and I thought it was a normal, to mutch action and special effects, movie.A weak later I saw Memento standing at rank 9 in the IMDb top 250. That evening I ran to the videoshop and hired Memento.I didn't thought it would be so great, because the story looks kind of easy, but I was wrong. It isn't a easy story, it's a good story. A man (Guy Pearce) can't make new memory's, because he was in a ""excedent"". He can only remember everything what happened before the excedent. His wife was killed and he wants to find the murderer, but he can't make new memory's so he write it down on his body. There are flashbacks to understand do whole story.

On the way, he is joined by others -but it is up to the viewer to decide whether they are friends or foes.At the very end of the movie, there is a massive twist [of course I won't reveal the ending and ruin it for everyone] which surprised me and had me thinking ""Aha, very cunning!""Even if you still have doubts on whether you possess enough brain cells in order to understand or enjoy the movie, I suggest that you should go and see it anyway - if you don't understand it, hey never mind, you just get to see Guy Pearce strip down to his boxers - a lot.",Memento

Few films can match the impact of Memento, the film etches itself in your mind as a unique experience that clenches you instantly and doesn't release you until the end credits roll. This film should be in the top 10, to have the film in the top 50 isn't high enough for it. Memento is on par with seven, usual suspects, pulp fiction, the matrix , the shawshank redemption, the prestige, American psycho, American history x, Fight Club, Face/Off, The Devil's advocate, Heat, Casino which also should be in the top 30 it is underrated in its position as with heat, The Sixth Sense, Shutter Island should be in the top 30 as well the twist is brilliant.

I'd certainly put it on a par with 12 Monkeys and The Sixth Sense in terms of a film made to invoke audience intelligence.Actually my wife and I watched it flabberghasted at the detail and puzzle of each moment as it unfolded. Each trying to answer the final answer as the film ran it's course.Since watching it, I availed myself of the many sites dedicated to unfolding the mysteries within the movie. At first I was unclear to the conjecture and *myths"" within the confounds of a basically simple film.  Then as I was drawn into the numerous (and often) quirky and deep reverential references made (or supposed) and found myself drawn into the ideas based on much effort and imagination based on investigation unequalled for a movie as this.In fact I read so much as to the unanswered (and guessed at) in this movie that it spoilt my initial enjoyment - and came to this simple conclusion: Leonard cannot cope with life without the impetus to find his wife's killer at all costs. It is this simple emotion that drives him and keeps him alive. Without it he has no reason to live.  The STM leads only to the next time he has to chase his next ""victim"". Without this reason to find his wife's killer he may well as be dead.  That's why when he gives ""himself"" information about Teddy at the ""start"" of the film, with the numberplate, he leaves himself another time-period to find his wife's killer again. How many times this has happened? But does it matter, because this film is a snapshot of a few days of Leonards life - what happened before who knows (apart from being coerced by a bent cop) and after - whatever?This mans whole life is driven by love.  A love for a dead wife, who's rapist and murderer he must seek to destroy to keep his own life.
NO he is not Sammmy. STM is very rare to this extent and I feel this focus is to reinforce Leonard's own mental state.I liked this film a lot.

Now when I see it, I am just wondering how come that it has occupied place in top 250 IMDb rating. May be that I like movies with straight forward story that is gripping and its narration flowing smoothly. It is all as confusing and vague as the mind of the character played by Guy Pierce. It is simply hard to find what he(the lead) did first and what he did later. Whether he commits murder and drives away in car or first drives in and then murders or whether he commits the murder at all. It is taxing on the mind of the viewer to watch the narration going back and forth and it is really tough to keep track of the story line. Many of movies of this director demand certain level of IQ from the viewers to get to his style of narrative.

As the viewer, you are kept in a similar state to Leonard as you only see pieces of the story at a time. You start off with him shooting a man in the head and spend the rest of the movie trying to understanding why. Because of the method of telling the story, you can relate to Leonard because you don't know any more than he does, but then you begin to feel for his situation as you slowly start to understand how the other characters are playing him. Carrie-Anne Moss gives an amazing performance in an amazing role where she evolves from an seemingly abused victim, to a manipulative and malicious piece of work. I loved her in The Matrix, but she is even more impressive here. Her Matrix co-star, Joe Pantoliano, is just as good.

1401,hasan0811-292-607267,Great and Entertaining Film ... with some crucial flaws.,9,17 February 2012,"""Memento"" is more of an evolutionary film than revolutionary, adding a slightly different dimension to what other films have already done before, such as ""Pulp Fiction"", in presenting it out of chronological sequence, with two different running stories, one going forward in time and the other backwards, relating the story of a man with a memory condition unable to create new memories and seeking vengeance for the murder and rape of his wife.""Memento"" is an extremely entertaining movie for those that like a film that makes them think a bit, and though many people would regard Christopher Nolan as just using a gimmick of using reverse chronological order to cover up what would be a pretty boring plot,this is a pretty foolish remark as Christopher Nolan designed the whole film specifically so that it could be portrayed backwards, hence no-one should even consider if the plot would be just as good if played in chronological order as the whole structure of the story would've been different to accommodate such a change. However, ""Memento"" still has some major flaws that I feel really hold it back from being a truly great film. Though the film does engage the viewer's interest through the suspense built up before, it would have held the viewer's interest much better if the central character was someone that the viewer could feel sympathy for, making them want to know what happens to him, which would have made the twist at the end far more unexpected. As well as this it can be seen that at the end, no matter how many different answers people may come up with to try and cover these questions up, there are still many unanswered questions with some unsatisfactory answers to others which was not Nolan's intention as he himself said that all the answers should be within the film. But though many other people would describe it as being riddled with plot holes there aren't many, if any, of these, such as the common misconception that he shouldn't even be able to remember that he has Anterograde Amnesia, which is actually untrue as can be seen with real-life patients who have the condition. The acting is pretty good throughout, especially from Joey Pantoliano and Guy Pearce who really perform their roles amazingly well, giving very convincing performances. Overall, the whole movie should serve as a highly enjoyable and novel movie (although some people may find it slightly dull or hard to keep up with, and the main character a bit expressionless), with an extremely absorbing narrative structure and plot that'll keep your eyes glued to the screen, with a great twist at the end that should make it, all in all, a really worthwhile movie.",Memento
1402,michelle-gilmore3,Disturbing but Powerful Movie,8,23 March 2012,"Memento plays with our emotions using Leonard, as he often seems to be an emotional void with a very faint sense of hope that he will ""solve"" the murder of his wife. Eventually, the audience knows what has happened to her, and that people constantly try to tell him that her case has been solved, but Leonard knows nothing. He essentially sabotages his own mind in order to have that single, missing piece of the murder case continually hanging in the air, making for a very sad, desperate character for whom we feel great pity. The simplicity of the movie is also displayed here, in that the basic action of crossing out a few words means that Leonard must embark upon his desperate search again. He is deceitful to himself, and does not even know it - the audience is left with the mixed emotion of feeling sorry for Leonard, and being angry at him for double-crossing himself at every turn. We do not know what to think of him, meaning that such a character is a powerful tool. I remember that when I saw this in the cinema, certain parts amused the audience greatly, such as when Leonard found the empty bottle, without recalling why he was there in the bathroom, and thought, ""I don't feel drunk...."". I didn't find this funny at all, nor do I think Nolan was attempting to insert an element of comedy. I simply felt sorry for him, knowing that this is the continual path of his life.

By the time it had finished and mates/hubby returned from pub, I was forced to grab them by the scruff of the neck and make them to watch it.

Confusion is the state we are intended to be in."" - Roger EbertI looked over our top 100 list and saw my favorite movie so I thought it would be perfect to make my own review. Memento didn't have the clout movies like the Passion did when it came out, although it didn't do bad at box offices it wasn't played everywhere thereby not many people heard of it. My story with Memento began with an episode of ""Cribs"" where a celebrity recommended it. Then a few years later IMDb had it #14 on it's greatest list. I had to see it after reading about it.Memento is a thriller defined. Something Hitchcock or Kubrick would probably praise. The plot in simplicity isn't large. A man with brain damage trying to avenge his wife's killer/rapist. But Nolan defeats this slight flaw by complicating it without changing what happens, but when it happens. We open with a Polaroid being held of a dead man, shot. Slowly the polaroid undevelopes and then is returned into the camera, your rewind button is not busted. We then witness the reverse murder of a mysterious man. Then CUT, we go to a B&W scene of a man explaining his condition, setting the basis for his problem. then CUT, to a color scene, right before the murder, showing how it was led to, then after it happens again in forward, cut to another B&W scene, this is the pattern of the movie.The movie follows the plot of Leonard Shelby, dubbed ""the ultimate protagonist"" by some editorials. Lenny is a man who witnessed his wife rapped and murder, he kills the man, and is hit by another which renders him handicapped. Leonard cannot remember things for more then 15-30 minutes. He tattoos important facts on him about the killer, etc. and carries polaroids to remember places/people. The story starts with the end and climaxes with the first thing that happened [realistically].Nolan constructed it greatly with the use of BW scenes and color. And how he meets these scenes [BW ones take place before the color ones]. There are many interpretations, especially people who like to get mental. Unlike Ebert, I think there should be multiple viewings because it makes the movie greater and you see the new things you missed. Nolan means for us to identify with the main character, by showing us his story through HIS perspective. Confusion. We start with the end with ignorance as we learn more of each character, their different intentions and even then they could be reversed if you pay attention but I will not spoil it.In my opinion Nolan made a masterpiece and it is at least within the top 10 or 15 greatest ever. The parts are not over or underacted. Hell, I even hear that Memento is shown in Psychology courses as a character study. Nolan tested directed in Following and perfected it in Memento.10/10 #1 Favorites",Memento

Now, I have nothing against films that backtrack - sometimes this is used in films to very good effect - but what we see in 'Memento' is just plain ridiculous. Boring scenes are repeated ad infinitum as the film constantly goes back, then forward to scenes we've seen already, and then go further back only to then run forward into those same scenes again. This is not clever, it may be different, but it's also stupid. Now, all this might even be bearable if you feel any empathy or sympathy with the main character, or anybody, or anything in this. No such luck with 'Memento'. The only positive emotion I felt in the whole thing was when the main character was running down the street and couldn't remember why. At least that was funny. The only other plus for the film - at least it was in color.",Memento
1408,rboothe,DSM-IV Diagnosis of Leonard's Mental Condition,10,1 December 2007,"The Limited Edition DVD Set of Memento released in 2002 includes a sheet of paper in the box with a blank space labeled ""diagnosis"". It seems that the director is literally inviting us to make a diagnosis of Leonard. I intend to do that here, but doing so will necessitate revealing some spoilers, so be forewarned before reading further. I only have room here for a brief synopsis. For a fuller treatment, see the commentary about Memento at my blogsite (rboothe.wordpress.com).The DSM-IV is the standard reference manual used by psychiatrists and psychologists when diagnosing a mental disorder. One of the diagnostic conditions listed in the DSM-IV is amnesia, a cognitive disorder secondary to brain injury or trauma. Can we fit Leonard into this diagnostic category? The short answer is no! Let me elaborate.Consider first, the relationship between Leonard and Sammy. The character Sammy is either Leonard's alter ego, or was someone Leonard once met whose persona he has tried to assume as his own. Most of what Leonard tells us about Sammy during the film is actually a description of Leonard (himself). We know that Leonard himself went by the name ""Sammy"" sometimes, as evidenced in the scene where the character Jimmy is dying and calls out, ""Sammy"", towards his murderer, Leonard. The character Teddy informs us that ""Sammy"" did not have a wife, and that all of Leonard's stories about ""Sammy's wife"" having diabetes were really stories about Leonard's wife. Finally, the director threw in an even more explicit clue in the form of a flashback. In the scene where Leonard is discussing how ""Sammy"" was committed to a mental institution, we are shown flashback in which we see ""Sammy"" sitting in the hospital. At the very end of the flashback, the director inserts a few frames in which the person in the mental hospital is actually Leonard.There are several lines of evidence that ""Sammy"" did not really have amnesia. Leonard tells us that, in his role as insurance investigator, he concluded there was ""no physical reason that should prevent Sammy from making new memories"". We are also told that ""Sammy's wife"" was skeptical about whether or not he really had memory loss. Finally, we are told that the doctors who examined ""Sammy"" were skeptical about his memory loss.Lets tentatively conclude that since ""Sammy"" probably did not really have amnesia, that means Leonard did not have amnesia. If that tentative conclusion is correct, we can expect that the director must have provided a clue  Some example where Leonard messed up and revealed some fact that he could not have known if he really had amnesia. This clue shows up in the critical scene where Leonard refers to the motel manager, Burt, by name. As an amusing aside, I would like to mention that the IMDb site for Memento lists this as ""a goof in continuity"". However, this is a ""goof "", as opposed to a ""clue"", only if one presupposes that Leonard really had amnesia! So, if the evidence does not allow us to diagnose Leonard with the condition of amnesia, what mental condition did he have? Lets consider another diagnostic condition described in the DSM-IV, Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD). In layman's terms, individuals diagnosed with APD are often called psychopaths. They lack empathy for the pain and suffering of others, and are able to inflict physical and emotional pain without feeling any remorse. These individuals also enjoy playing elaborate con games, often simply for thrills rather than for personal gain.Lets consider the possibility that Leonard was a psychopath who was playing an elaborate game in which he pretended to have anterograde memory loss. Perhaps he had actually once known someone named Sammy who had the condition. Or perhaps he just heard about the condition somewhere, became intrigued by it, and went to the library to study up about it. Either way, he decided to initiate an elaborate game where, in every situation in which he found himself, he imagined what a person with this form of amnesia would do, and then acted in the same way. He played this game to the limit, regardless of where it led, including if it required him to drink other peoples spit, or hurt or kill other individuals, including his own wife.What evidence in the film supports this possibility? Consider a key diagnostic feature of individuals with APD, as specified in DSM-IV. They do not exhibit normal fear responses, and as a result have trouble learning to alter their behavior based on punishment. For example, if a normal person were given an electric shock each time he chose a triangle over a square on a psychological test, that person would quickly learn to choose the square instead of the triangle on subsequent tests. A person with APD would have trouble learning this task. Does this test sound familiar? It was the test failed by the character ""Sammy"", and that led to ""Sammy's"" diagnosis and subsequent commitment to a mental hospital.Is there any direct evidence for this diagnostic trait in Leonard? There is a scene early in the film where Leonard runs into the glass at the entry door of the motel where he has been staying. Ouch! He does this because the door opens outward but he tries to push on it. A ""normal"" individual might do this once, or perhaps twice, but then quickly learn to alter his behavior so as to avoid continuing to be punished. An individual with APD would take much longer. At this point in the story, Leonard has been staying at this same motel for at least days, possibly weeks. Bingo! I think I have my diagnosis.",Memento

2- The Goal (4 out of 10): The idea behind the movie is very good .. really good which is that the ""human is just memories"" BUT actually it is messed up for me because of the bad way that the movie goes on it.
3- The Excitement: (2 out of 10): where is it? oh! i found it on the beginning only, then Nothing but boredom.
4- The influence: (1 out of 10): Not that way please nothing affected me , i already know the bad guy from the beginning why i should affected by the events then?.

The protagonist, Lenny had anterograde amnesia, in which he cannot make new memories. This and the fact that his wife was killed has led to a roller-coaster ride with him hunting down the killer with his condition. To be able to cope, he has to take Polaroid pictures and tattoo himself for reminders, since he can't trust anyone.Delving into the film without any knowledge of the plot or structure, I was surprised and was greeted with a very complex narrative structure, known as the Fabula and Syuzhet or the 'hairpin', in which the movie flows backwards and interchanges with black and white flashbacks. Add this to the already complex plot and you get a very intriguing, captivating and slightly confusing film.

1414,lavanyabarnett,Confused but interested until the very end,7,1 October 2017,"First and foremost I'd say to anyone going into this film blind, do not come in thinking you're in for simple linear narrative with a clear start and end point; it's one of those films that can will never be easily explained, the narrative is just that complex.The film follows a man named Leonard or ""Lenny"" with after an accident now lives with extremely short term memory. This characteristic is the very foundation of the film because we as the audience follow Lenny from start to finish, we know everything he knows, we learn everything he learns. However just as we learn everything Lenny does, Lenny is unable to remember the new information which adds good layer of intrigue and mystery as to how the film will end.The narrative as I've mentioned before is non-linear, the events as we see them are not chronological for the most part. The only scenes that actually run in chronological order are the series of black and white scenes that incorporate flashbacks providing additional plot points. The scenes in colour play backward in contrast to the black and white scenes in what Christopher Nolan (the director) describes as a hairpin narrative where the narrative loops on itself and the true end point lies around the middle of the story.As my summary suggests Memento had me confused for the large majority of the run time, what with the unconventional narrative structure and the slight frustration I felt as Lenny's memory issues proved to be his greatest weakness amidst everything and everyone around him. However the overall mystery of the film kept me engaged from start to finish, although the conclusion may leave some (as it did with me) with an anti-climactic feeling due to how Memento resolves its plot threads. Despite this Memento is still gripping from start to end and I'd highly recommend checking it out, especially for those interested in more unconventional and experimental storytelling.",Memento

1418,nicholasttalbot,Memory and Identity in Memento,9,25 August 2019,"In philosophical terms, Memento focuses on the questionable relevance of memory in determining personal identity, and how identity persists over time. The film's protagonist, Leonard, has a short-term memory loss condition due to a violent encounter with a rapist. He is unable to form any new memories, and last thing he does remember is his wife ""dying."" Many philosophers, such as John Locke, have argued the importance of the persistence of our personality and memory when determining identity. Is the Leonard after the incident a different Leonard than the one before? Does each independent block of remembered time represent a different person? According to the psychological account of personal identity, yes. But this is troubling to many philosophers. Let us look at Leonard's case: Every time he ""comes to"" he remembers who he is, and everything that happened to him before his wife's apparent murder. However there is an amnesia block similar to Chisholm's account. This block breaks the consistent chain of memory. As far as personality is concerned, Leonard still identifies himself as the same Leonard prior to the incident, albeit a lot angrier and more confused. If we consider an account of memory as a sort of glued-together chain, then we might be able to think of pre-incident Leonard the same as post-incident Leonard. Leonard before the incident (A) is connected to a period of forgotten time (B) who is in turn linked to present Leonard who is consciously processing his surrounding environment (C). Perhaps we can consider A, B and C the same person merely by their bonding, even though C cannot remember B (reminiscent of the General unable to remember stealing apples as a boy). However there is a glaring issue effecting the authenticity of Leonard's memories. Teddy reveals to us at the end of the film the possibility of Leonard manipulating his memories to serve his desires. If this is possible, then theoretically Leonard could, given his condition, manipulate himself to believe almost anything, since he knows very little to begin with. Does this imply that Leonard could willingly alter his identity? It sounds implausible, but given the fundamentals of the memory theory, it is not ruled out. Perhaps Leonard, as a result of his condition, is the ultimate master of his identity: a role that at times gives him great power and freedom, and other times feeds into his madness.",Memento

Like The Usual Suspects, Memento revels in leading the audience down one path of apparent certainty before taking a sudden sprint down another to confuse and disorientate, but more importantly to question what has come before.  Is what you have just seen only 15 or so minutes before real? Can anybody be trusted? And what do we really know about Leonard?This is the true beauty of the film, not only does it present a character who himself is an, albeit empathetic, enigma, but it forces the audience to feel exactly what this character is feeling.  The short, sharp bursts of information which is contradicted, then re-inforced, then contradicted once again to provide a list of characters whose motivations are at all times unclear puts us in exactly the same predicament that Leonard is in.  Who if anyone in this film is telling the truth, the whole story? And who can we trust?This is a film which demands a second viewing to begin to come to any level of understanding, and even then you will find yourself reaching for the rewind button to try and reach a further understanding.  The key to remember is that this film is intended to be ambiguous, there is no real answer to the questions that you will find yourself asking.  Has Leonard finally found his man, has he killed before and most importantly does the man he is looking for actually exist? We simply don't know, and why? Because we learn only what Leonard learns and know only what Leonard knows which ultimately is nothing more than a few scribbled notes and images to fill in the pieces of a much larger puzzle.This film demands viewing by anyone with an interest in film for the simple fact that it is an incredibly powerful example of the power of the medium. The majority of films present a story in a neat little package nicely wrapped up, if not necessarily for the protagonists, certainly for the viewer.  This film does not on either count and requires a level of concentration and involvement from the audience that will make you forget entirely that this is only a film, a piece of entertainment.Incidentally, the Memento website provides some clues in answering the mystery that are not provided in the film.  Leonard's wife is definitely killed in the attack at his home and not, as Teddy would have us believe, at a later date by Leonard.  However, the site lends much creedence to the notion that Leonard has killed several times before and then consciously or other wise, destroyed the evidence. It also informs us that Leonard has spent a great deal of time (nearly 2 years)in psychiatric care trying to recover from his condition, undergoing many of the same tests used on Sammy Jankis.Overall I give this film 10/10 and would advise anybody to go and see it and experience a rare treat, a true cinematic gem.",Memento

There is soo much going on with the story + characters in the movie that I sometimes feel like I'm experiencing short-term memory loss like Leonard himself did! Each scene of the movie was soo elaborately put together & felt like a puzzle piece! I really felt like I was like in a dream like state while watching this movie!The best part of the movie for me was Guy Pearce's truly Stunning performance! He totally blew me away with his exquiste & touching portrayal of Leonard Shelby! He really became Leonard in this movie! His mannerisms, facial expressions, & raw mixed emotions of saddness, confusion, frustration, anger, vulnerability, and witty sense of humor were soo perfect that he truely captured the heartbreaking & tortured soul of Leonard! Guy's Astonishingly Beautiful performance definitely deserves all the acknowledgement, praise, & awards! I'm soo happy to have finally seen this movie & especially witness Guy Pearce's unforgettable performance!",Memento

I think there is a definite clue at the end of the film to explain that Lennys' condition is psychological and not physical (i.e. he chooses to have short memory)...At the end of the film when he decides to make Teddy the John G. he's looking for, he takes a piece of card and writes 'FACT 7: License Plate Number xxxx'How did he know he was up to fact number 7? He could have been on fact number 3 for all he could remember!Maybe it was a mistake, but I like to think it reinforces that Lennys problems are of his own doing not because of the head injury.",Memento

First heard about this movie in Total Movie (a wonderful movie magazine that comes with a DVD), then through a couple of friends. What they told me could never fully prepare me for what I saw on the screen last night. Truly a brilliant piece of cinematography, from casting (Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano) to locations, to (most importantly) the script and the plot behind this movie, everything has come together in a fashion exemplary of visionary movie making. Word of Caution: Only see this movie if you are able to devote all of your attention to the film.

I couldn't be further from the truth.  This movie does things to your head that are illegal in some countries.  Portrayed (for all intents and purposes) backwards, it forces you to think in the same way that our lead character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce being more brilliant than usual) does.  Suffering from a condition that renders him unable to remember anything for more than a few minutes, he is searching for the man who raped and killed his wife.  Since each seen lasts no more than 15 minutes before jumping back to the what happened before that, our perceptions are shattered in the same way.Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of The Matrix) put in great performances that leave you guessing; simultaneously endearing and revolting.Overall I left the film trying to figure out what was what, and I'm still not sure.

The story line is extremely luring, you're drawn into the plot in the first scene. Humour is subtle, but definitely there. This film lacks definition which is very effective.

Well, there are many films providing mysterious puzzles right now, but not many movies can link their scenes like this one.  This movie is clear, and yet you can never be sure.The plot itself was not magnificent...but editing is what makes this movie a must-see.  pieces are well-organized (?), and color of the screen is well chosen.  When Lenny puts Jimmy Grantz's blue shirt and pants, color changes...well, I thought that was brilliant.Now, if you try to figure it out, it's not that easy to see how things work in this film.  Did Lenny's wife really die?  Does Sam Jankis really exist? Who's Dodd, and what's up with him?  And how can Guy Pearce know that he has a short-term memory problem?  By watching this movie twice or three times, you may solve all these problems or at least come up with every hypothesis. But you don't have to.  Do not really focus on details.  This movie is to confuse you, and you go see the movie to be confused.Guy Pearce was superb in this movie.  His character was believable.  And he just looks like Leonard Shelby, his voice, his gesture, his facial expression, everything.  I did not really like Carrie-Anne Moss.  She was all right, but she could have been better.  All other characters were good, but no one really stands out.Overall, this movie was brilliant, well worth watching. Rating: 9/10",Memento

1453,bizarrono1,I feel somewhat cheated...,6,30 May 2001,"I saw this movie after reading and hearing rave reviews for it, and I must admit that I was disappointed. I paid too much attention to its supposedly-confusing details after some of my friends (and printed reviews) told me the goings-on were murky, I was led to believe that if I blinked I'd miss out on something that might have been important.(The following could be considered to be spoiling, so be prepared!) It is unfortunate I had been ""informed"" about this movie like I had, and here is why: the ending raps up its precedings perfectly, the whole thing has no ambiguity to it whatsoever like some people have been saying it does. Lenny's (he being the main character) tale ultimately turns out to be a psychologically- rather than a physically-based one, and I was let down because that felt somewhat cheap to me. I got to the end and received something I didn't really care about, it (he?) just wasn't very interesting. Simply chalk that up to my personal taste?As I think about it more, to a certain and perhaps large degree I felt the way I did due to my unmet expectations, but still, even w/o the ones I had I would say that the story was unsatisfyingly executed. It is rather hard for truly rewarding films which use characters' deep psychologies as their real subjects to be made in my opinion, and this one didn't quite pull it off, not even close actually. For one thing I think too much effort was spent on being ""clever"" with its method of storytelling-in-reverse instead of trying to be compelling in legitimate ways, say by having characters with more depth: all in all I considered it to be a slightly above-average B-movie. So, after pondering the movie a bit I give it a 6 after my initial response of 7.",Memento

Loss of memory as a plot device. This is hardly unique and has its origins in a far more compelling film ""Mr. Budwing? staring James Garner circa 1965(?). Also Sidney Lumet's ""The Morning After"" with Jane Fonda and Jeff Bridges also use the same plot device. The manipulation of time device. This is also old hat having been used by, dare I say it Orson Wells in Citizen Kane. And more recently, and far more interestingly, Doug Liman's ""GO"" Steve Soderbergs ""The Limey"" and ok, Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction."" In Memento the use of a time device is quite tedious after the first go round. The pay - off is not worth the wait ""TRUST ME!""Acting UG! the performances by all of the principal cast were soulless to say the least. there was no chemistry between any of the characters. Indeed the only actor who has a soul in this film is on screen far too little Stephen Tobalosky (I know spelling), who turns in a heart wrenching performance that outshines everyone else in the film! In short the film takes its characters and drags us down into a soulless nihilistic pit of slime that is uninteresting, unhelpful and boring! directing More ug! This director better not start believing his own PR or he will out tarantino on the down tic. He has nothing more than pedestrian story telling abilities. He does nothing with his camera that is noteworthy.

1456,noreen-2,Fight club meets the usual suspects?,10,4 May 2001,"Fight club meets the usual suspects, well not really, comparing Memento to such excellent movies as Fight Club and the Usual Suspects, still wouldn't do it justice.  Christopher Nolan has created a cinematic materpiece, a thriller, that puts you so close to the edge of your seat that at times you have to pick yourself off the ground. It may be a bold statement, and I am willing to take some heat for it, but the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock, could get out his ball point(god rest his soul)and takes some note on Nolan's suspense filled story.The story is about Lenny a man who has short term memory and uses poloroids, tattoo's and notes to remember what he is doing.  What he knows for sure is someone raped and killed his wife, and he has clues in various places of his body to help him solve the crime. Anyway, what creates the great suspense in this movie is that we too experience a short term memory, and we are given the plot backwards.  AT the beginning of the film Lenny has already found the killer, and we get to see what happens building up to the end,piece, by piece.  It is very original, and I can guarantee that it will have a couple oscar nominations attached to its name a year from now.  Well I will not bother trying to do this film any more justice by trying to explain it in this feeble review.  I will just say this movie will blow you away.  Nolan has broken many conventions with this movie most notably how to tell a good mystery something that has been lacking in hollywood since.....The Usual Suspects, oh did I mention this is better.

Basically about a chap who loses the ability to make sort term memories when he was trying to save his wife from a rape attack. He makes it his mission to find the culprits, but with his memory problems has to rely on notes he made himself, constantly reviewing his notes to work out what is happening and how far he has got in his search.As he says in the movie we rely on our memories to know who we are, but our memories do sometimes bend the truth.. he tries to see his 'method' as a better way to remember the past thru the unbending reliance on his note taking.When he is sure of a fact... he tattoo's himself so that he cannot lose that memory.You go in to the cinema, and after the first 10 minute you understand the plot and think you have 'solved' it. Then a little later on you realise that you must have missed something and start working on a different scenario. This goes on until the end of the film... you come out believing you have a theory as to what happened... but it takes some mulling over to really understand.Brilliantly acted by Guy Pierce (Mike from Neighbours years ago!!)I would highly recommend this film... one of the best I've seen in years.",Memento

Pantoliano is also good, as is Carrie-Ann Moss, but the real player of the movie is the story. Nothing will top Memento this year in terms of originality. The ending is very similar to that of The Sixth Sense, with the think-you've-got-it-but-you-don't ending. But what is more amazing is that the movie flows in reverse. The start of the movie is actually the end. If you don't get it, don't worry because there may not be many people who do.

It is something you will have to see more than once to catch all the nuances of plot and theme crammed into it. Herein lies a love story, a mystery, a drama and more packaged in a film noir wrapper. The story unfolds in little forward running segments that progress from end to beginning. Leonard Shelby (Pearce) is looking for revenge for his wife's rape and murder. He has a ""condition"", however, that makes it impossible for him to form new memories. He only remembers life up until the moment he saw his wife die. Interspersed with the sadness, even horror, of his situation are moments of dark humor. You can't go wrong seeing this movie, especially if you are a glutton for tricky plot lines.

If you want a lot of fast action, special effects, and spoon-fed messages, pass on this one. You won't understand it, and it will probably bore you to tears. However, if you really enjoy puzzles and if you appreciate absolutely first-rate production values, acting, direction, and plot, then buy or rent this one as fast as you can. Also, bring a little intelligence. It helps.Memento succeeds on many levels. It is among the greatest noir films ever made. It's got guns, cars, black humor, red herrings, and a femme fatale. It outshines Psycho in engaging the audience on a subliminal basis. Indeed, as a thriller, it ranks with Hitchcock's best. Best of all, it poses a number of profound BIG questions concerning the nature of man, his morality, and the basis for his civilizations and religions in such a subtle way that it almost seems an afterthought. Yes, this movie will really make you think. And it will make you want to talk to others about it.Much has been made of the way the director, Christopher Nolan, structured the film in backward sequences to give the audience the same feelings of confusion and frustration as the protagonist, Leonard Shelby, who is played by Guy Pearce. Not so easily recognized is how the clues that Nolan gives his audience can be added up in many different ways to reach a `conclusion'. Virtually no two people will agree completely on just exactly what they saw or even what it means. This effect is extraordinary and can be compared to only a few films, such as Rashomon, where the characters give widely different interpretations of events. In Memento, we are able to construct our own reality from the facts that we are given. In truth, what seem to be facts can be interpreted to a high degree and are really decision points upon which we can diverge to build our own recollection of events and conclusions. Memento thus becomes an individually unique experience and, in a convincing way, supports Nolan's thesis that memories are not to be trusted. (After repeated viewings, it's still 10/10.)",Memento

We may not understand what the artist is trying to `say', but if we are honest, we must admit that we like the final result. Memento is as close to a great painting as anything I've seen in cinema. It can be admired on so many levels-the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the sound, the editing, and the story. However, I think Christopher Nolan's greatest achievement is that he not only puts you in the protagonist's shoes, but he proves beyond any doubt that memory is unreliable and that memories cannot be trusted.

The viewer is able to empathize with Leonards condition because although we start the film at the end of the chronological order of events we do not know what has preceded.

Such movies, like The Matrix, the Sixth Sense, and the Usual Suspects, remind us why we repeatedly pay 10 bucks to see a film that probably will only midly satisfy at best: we are hoping that this film will be it, this will be the film that will revive our interest and excite our senses.Since you probably are already familiar with the plot sypnosis and the narative technique of the film, I won't waste any time repeating what you already know. Instead, let me say this to those who are hesitating about seeing this movie:If you are one of those who stays near the mainstream Hollywood movies and away from the ""artsy"" ones, you have probably recently seen either a romantic comedy, a gross out comedy, or some action/ suspence film, and are planning on seeing another of that genre soon. Let me tell you this: even though these movies may be entertaining for you, you pretty much know what to expect before you even buy the ticket. Well instead of seeing another one of these movies this weekend, take a chance a buy a ticket to Memento.
Why? At the very least, you will probably enjoy this movie and have a good time. Its really not so hard to follow as most people make it out to be. However, my guess is is once you have seen excellence achieved on film (and Memento is certainly an example of this excellence) you will constatly be searching for the next standout movie. And this search for the great movies is what makes movie going such a great experience.",Memento

Yet I assure you this is no gimmick (which can be attributed to the Usual Suspects). In fact it helps you sympathize with the main character in his startling ""disability"". I will not spoil anything in that anyone seeing Memento should see it as it is meant to be seen- without knowing anything.

Beginning at the end of the story and ending at the beginning, Memento makes you think and pay much more attention to it than most any other movie out there.Guy Pearce plays a man without the ability to form new memories after a brutal attack on him and his wife. Relentlessly seeking out his wife's killer, he is aided by numerous tattoos and photographs which give him vague clues about what to do and who to believe. But are his notes really trustworthy? Is everything as it seems? The movie wouldn't be near as fun if it was, and works very hard at turning your mind into a pretzel. The fact that you don't know what happened before adds to the desire to see what's next(or before), and helps you sympathize with the main character.

You have no previously etablished data to understand the different events in their narrative sequence: the data needed to understand one scene establishes itself, at least partially, in the next, and so on. This structure puts everything afloat, everything is destabilized: memory, the Other, nothing is given, nothing is safe. Absolute genius! I know a lot of critics will probably say that this is SO Quentin Tarantino (stupid, boring hack if anyone ever was) or Usual Suspects, but it actually manages to do something more than show of it´s coolness and how smart it is; it is more conceptually and philosophically oriented, in a way similar to for example Alain Resnais - his Providence (1977) being a key point here - and THIS is the the stuff greatness is made of.

The problem is, they're missing the point of Teddy's revelation at the end of the movie.  Leonard is insane, not brain damaged. He is like Sammy, the Sammy of both Leonard and Teddy's experience: he does not have a physical disability (like the Sammy of Leonard's experience) AND he is ""faking it"" (like the Sammy of Teddy's experience).  Leonard is insane.  His mind is playing tricks on him; he can remember, he simply choses not to.  That is the power of this film, the haunting quality of his refusal to knowledge it when Teddy tells him, thus, finally, spiralling off into complete madness.Yes, he could record things better, but he doesn't; he doesn't need to.  He remembers, so tracking things acurately isn't really what its about.  Not recording things well is part of the madness of his delusions.  He harps about Sammy's bad habit of writing notes, getting confused, but this is what he largely does.  Also, in regard to calendars, know, he doesn't keep one, because he doesn't want to:  he wants to be lost in the same repititious day, again and again reenacting his revenge, a revenge, as he himself caused his wife's death, is being meted out upon himself and his sanity.",Memento

1489,alexclover,Snazzy editing doesn't make an amazing film,7,10 July 2001,"The majority of people on this comments board attribute this film's success to its very original editing style. The film is built upon this style, showing you a present-time snippet of the main character which leaves you wondering about why he got there and what he's doing. The film then continues showing you a snippet of the immediate preceding past of the main character, and so on backwards in time helping you understand the beginning of the film. That's where the movie's originality stops. The plot itself is filled with huge holes. While the premise is interesting, it is hardly plausible that someone with no short-term memory would not be 'assisted' by society in any way, nor that he could not have a notebook handcuffed to him or something rather than all the tattoos. I found the movie rather predictable and did not really care about the movie after about halfway through.Still, an interesting and innovative movie-making style with a neat, if unplausible, situation for the main character. This coupled with sometimes very unconvincing acting by the main actor (although it is a hard role, he never really pulls it off) and a wholly boring plot earns this movie a 7 in my book.If you want to see a real whodunnit type movie that will haunt you for a long time to come, try Thesis by Spanish director Almenabar which I saw last night and save Memento for a day you want to study film rather than enjoy it.",Memento

It is true that the short term memory loss has been dealt with in other excellent movies like ""Wintersleepers"", but what makes this movie so brilliant is the combination of this ""condition"" with the way the story is told. BTW, the fact that Leonard could remember that he had a short-term memory impairment is not a goof - he knew the illness from before his accident, and he had a tatoo in his arm reading ""remember Sammy Jankis"" to help him remember that. Plus in the final scene we realize that Leonards mental problem was far more complex than it could be have been supposed from the rest of the movie - in this sense there is a ""gimmick"" in the movie, but only insofar as the whole truth is not revealed until the end (the beginning, that is :-)) I give it a 9 out 10 only because I like to save 10 for later.",Memento

How can he remember then that this is fact number 6???3) Unfortunately I did not notice but my boyfriend says that in the scene where Sammy is shown in this institution, after the death of his wife, for an instant it is actually Leonard sitting in his chair.4) I think Teddy and Natalie had a deal to use Lenny to get rid of Dodd and Jimmy and get themselves a nice bit of money.

There seems to be a metatheme in this movie.  The main character was a detective for an insurance company before his accident.  Now the whole movie seems to follow the path such a detective would go by when investigating. Namely, starting out with the crime itself and working backwards untill the person who did it and the motive is found. This movie might also allude to the current state of our historical science, showing that memory, and especially history can be tampered with and changed (especially in the hands of less morally founded individuals).  Thus one might even say it is a profound criticism of the all objectivity. Basically though, this is a thriller about manipulation in its different shapes and forms, and how people use each others weaknesses to outwit each other and sometimes even themselves....",Memento

Given the way the story is told, this was probably unavoidable, but I find that it hinders true immersion into the film.The other problem is that it takes absolutely ages to build up even a hint of suspense. After the initial surprise at the storytelling has faded away, one finds oneself sitting there, just waiting for something - anything - to happen.Still - eventually the film does start and from that point until the end it leaves a very good impression. The storyline, even though it's extremely artificial, has been carefully plotted out and I certainly appreciate that it wasn't an easy task in this film.In the end thus, it's a film worth seeing once... but it's nothing you'd want to watch over and over again.",Memento

Memento would be an accomplishment at any point in a director's career, which makes it that much more impressive that it came so early in Nolan's.

The final sequence of the movie (which is the middle of the story) starts in black and white, then brilliantly and subtly shifts into color as the two timelines come together (the shift occurs as the polaroid of Jimmy G is developing).To illustrate, let's say there are 11 sequences in the movie.  Temporally, they occurr in order from 1 to 11.  However, in the movie, they appear 1, 11, 2, 10, 3, 9, 4, 8, 5, 7, 6, where 1-5 are B&W, 7-11 are color, and 6 begins in B&W then changes to color.Definitely a new and interesting twist -- I thought it was sort of like ""Pulp Fiction"" (out of sequence storyline) meets ""The Usual Suspects"" (ending which calls into question all assumptions made by the viewer since the beginning) meets the book ""Time's Arrow"" by Martin Amis (man lives his entire live in reverse).After I saw it the first time, there was a strange lingering affect, where for a while afterward, linear time didn't seem quite right to me.

It's a highly exaggerated movie. The performances are also not that good either. When rating a movie, people should consider and compare it with other productions.I mentioned about the ""last to first"" thing because it is really not a spoiler. You understand it at the beginning of the film. But I recommend those who have not seen the movie yet to skip this paragraph - The part which I hate the most is where Leonard ""the poor victim which suffers from memory loss"" suddenly turns out to be a man who can control his memories. It is contrary to the main theme of the movie. I think this is where the whole movie becomes senseless.Memento is rated R for violence, language and some drug content but why doesn't it say that there is some nudity? There is a scene where Guy Pearce is nude and you can see his ass. If it was Carrie-Anne Moss's or Jorja Fox's ass, wouldn't it be different?Normally I wouldn't give such a bad rating to Memento; I gave 1/10 due to its high rating which it definitely doesn't deserve.

This movie is best suited for viewers who prefer an unpredictable outcome or for those who like to keep their minds wandering.

I think these changes in time are his memory, and it is showing us the memory he is trying to produce. When it changes that means that he had lost that memory. Also, this show keeps your mind wondering. It doesn't show us the bad guys and who he is looking for, it just shows us people as we normally see them. Such as Natalie when she appears to be a good person, then you realize that later on she is using his sickness against him to kill someone. The conclusion to this show was a real thinker, because it made you think about everything that the main character has been telling us throughout the movie.

The story unfolds in reverse, so that you have to see things in the same way that Leonard Shelby, the main character of the movie has to, you don't know what happened before the present! That helps you to identify with this poor man's plight as he searches for the person who ruined his life in one night, by raping and murdering his wife, and causing a brain injury that left Leonard unable to make new memories. Some people complain about the lack of depth in the characters, but how well do you expect to get to know someone who has no short term memory and who has to scribble important things on notes and get tattoos to help him cope with his handicap?

1538,sdogpdx,"Good, but not great (***Spoilers below***)",8,28 December 2001,"In general, I liked this movie.  The idea of a continually lapsing short-term memory was a good one, and I'm surprised it hasn't been explored to this extent before.  I also thought the acting was good, although beyond Leonard, the characters were really one-dimensional.  The sequencing was actually done quite well, considering the challenge of showing the plot backwards, and what I thought would be utterly confusing turned out to be quite exciting.Despite the novelty and cleverness of the writing, the movie does have a few major problems.  First, a person with total short-term memory loss would not be able to remember that he or she has such a condition in the first place. I was happy to see that another reviewer pointed this out.  Unless Leonard had a tattoo explaining his injury and all of the circumstances (to which he referred constantly), it seems like he would always reset and end up believing he was at that very moment after his wife was ""killed"".Second, the end of the movie was really more confusing than elucidating, and did very little to help the plot.  I understand that this was the producers' intent (to leave us with a feeling of uncertainty about Leonard's life, since that is what he faces throughout the film), but I think it could have been written much better.  I like to leave a movie with a feeling of satisfaction that I understood what the producer(s) wanted, whether it be resolution or purposeful uncertainty.  In this case, I still don't know if it the confusion was written in the script, or was just a mistake.Third, the movie hinted at some philosophical purpose, but never really got to that point.  Rather than examining what makes us human and whether our memories are actually our identity, the writers used the loss of memory as a novel storytelling tool.  I disagree with those reviewers who claim this was some great philosophical work of art--it may have made you think about it, but offered very little to the debate.Last on my list of complaints are the loose ends.  What happened to the woman?  Why wasn't anyone chasing Leonard (besides Teddy) if he was a murderer and had a bunch of money?  Why didn't anyone from his old insurance firm ever talk to him?Overall, this was a fun film, and there were many little nuances that made it very interesting.  I really don't care if the IMDB reviewers give it a 10--that's up to them.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, though, because it is captivating and done quite well.",Memento

While it does help artistically (making the viewer sympathize with the lead by having to constantly reconstruct the past, and being constantly confused), it creates an even more practical simulation of the story. If the movie were shot forwards, the viewer would then remember the past - why things happened, who characters are. However, by shooting it backwards, viewers do not remember the past, like the character. It allows the viewer to watch each scene with no memory of the preceding events.

This technique allows for plot twists like that one by not letting the audience know the important info Leonard doesn't. This technique probably had many purposes, although I think the others were included after the decision to shoot backwards for this reason.The most amazing artistic part of the movie, however, was its ability to create suspense by going backwards in time. SPOILER - I was gripped by the one note that drove most of the plot: the first about Teddy: ""do not believe his lies"". The movie was unconventional, but there was great suspense (for me, at least) about the origin of that note, since all the others came out of that one. Why would Teddy be lying? Couldn't his advice have been valid, too? I was dying to know during the second half. Everyone who said there is no suspense were obviously not willing to commit to the movie. The movie doesn't leave neon signs; You have to do a bit of thinking on your own. There was more to the movie than exploring a self-imposed limitation. There was suspense and mystery that required attention for true benefit. Considering the unconventional narrative structure, this movie was seamless in plot. Many complain ""how can he remember his condition if he found out about it after the injury?"", but remember, his condition, unlike Sammy's, was physical. He could remember things through instinct and repetition (checking the hotel night stand when he woke up). He could have made a note about his condition early, on, but I'd assume he'd have had to use it a lot (read: repetitively). That routine of explaining himself to everyone new - to him, everyone - could have become instinct, like opening the drawer, and he would have remembered it. Eat that! This was one of the most creative, artistically innovative movies since 2001: A Space Odyssey.",Memento

The history works deeply with the strange amnesia that confuses the poor avenger (Guy Pearce). You and him just don't know who to trust. Initially,  you know the result of investigations (shown in the beginning), that is a scene where Guy Pearce appears killing a man, but... is he the true killer who he's looking for? you will have the answer at the end, or better, at the beginning.Memento already became an atemporal film, of course no one would try to edit a film like it is. And everything is carefully thought: the black & white scenes along the film allow we differ in memory the chronology; the mementos in Pearce's body are an inteligent method and characterize the protagonist; the polaroid is another great idea, just like the sensation we have watching the film, but in the film it appears losing focus, back to front.",Memento

They did not get this and were visibly puzzled with the sequence of last-to-present film making. I thought Guy Pearce was great, but I'm biased as I liked him in both 'L.A.

This movie is really made for DVD, so you can view it over and over to get additional glimpse of events missed. Also kudos to getting a major studio to finance this.

1564,cinquad,Incredibly good movie,10,13 October 2002,"Warning! This contains spoilers.Memento is, in my opinion, the best movie released in the past five years. It has vision that no movie since or before has really been able to capture. Memento is a movie about memory and how it can be manipulated and changed to fit people's desires. Lenny believes that he suffers from short-term memory loss suffered when he tried to break up an attack on his wife. But one of the main questions that the movie seems to imply is if Lenny found out about the diagnosis after the attack (after he lost his memory), how can he remember that he suffers from it? The question can not be answered without making some parts of the movie seem impossible, and that is where the true strength of the movie lies.It is impossible to draw up a definitive theory about Memento that explains everything without making some things appear impossible. However, it is a great deal of fun to try. I've discussed this movie with friends for hours on end. Whenever we think we have it all explained, our answers just lead to more questions. This is a sort of courage that most filmmakers today do not have. Most movies end with very clear-cut endings that leave little to the imagination. Memento is about the imagination and how you remember details in the movie. It may just be me, but for some reason the backwards plot of the movie with the black-and-white cuts in between makes it impossible for me to remember details even on repeat viewings.In my opinion, the definitive scene in the movie is not Teddy's revelations at the end, but the small scene in the coffee shop where Teddy and Lenny talk about memory. This is where the movie's themes become obvious, and also where Lenny presents some of the more intriguing philosophical questions. He argues that memory is unreliable, that it distorts facts according to what people want to see. This can be applied to how people view the movie (what facts they remember and what theories they draw up), and also to how we view life itself.All the acting in this movie is incredible. Guy Pearce deserved an Oscar nomination for his portrayel of the confused Lenny, and the Teddy actor was perfect for the part.This is a movie that I've seen a dozen times and continue to love. It is absolutely incredible.",Memento

But once I did, I must say I was not extremely thrilled with it as the rest of the world seems to be.It is a brilliant and creative idea of how to make a movie (backward revealing of pieces of the story with every new scene) but unless I missed something, I believe that this is all this film had to offer. The acting was good, the story was good, the movie was good... but I do not believe it should be rated the number 1 best indie film and number 10 best film of all time.  (As it is on IMDB while I write this review)I think it simply receives a lot of praise because it is a movie made in a way that no one has ever seen before.  A friend even told me that he thought it was an amazing movie--though he didn't quite totally understand it.  Maybe it is appealing because it is confusing and people view it as a ""smart"" film because they can't quite follow totally what it going on and they have to watch it over and over again.  Either way, I believe it has received much more acclaim than it deserves.  It has certainly won many awards for great editing and original screenplays, etc--which it has.  But a movie of the year--or of all time as some IMDB users are rating it--I totally disagree.Finally, It is indeed totally original in the way a story is told and presented, but it is certainly not the greatest movie of all time.  I was disappointed overall with this film.  I do not believe it is a must-see.I could film an entire movie by attaching a camera to a dogs back and having him film the action, then playing it on the big screen mirrored and upside-down during some scenes.  That would certainly be an original idea never seen by movie-goers before, but that doesn't mean it should be voted into a group with The Godfather or Citizen Kane.I'm not saying Memento is like watching an upside-down film from a dog's point of view...

1569,Naggastos,Brief thoughts on a terrific movie,9,5 January 2003,"I found Memento to be one of those truly remarkable films that stays with you long after watching it (be it the 1st time, or the 4th).The main point of interest is how the film is edited; it basically runs backwards in time, showing the last occurrence first and vice versa. This could be seen as a cheap stunt to generate interest, but it turns out to be an extremely effective and clever technique. The main character, Leonard, is an anterograde amnesiac - he can't form new lasting memories after his head injury. Whatever he experiences he can only remember for less than a minute. Therefore Nolan has placed us in his shoes, not knowing what came before, but slowly finding out.The social/moral content in this film basically revolves around Leonard's plight, and his dubious actions. A year or so before the film's setting, when he sustained his head injury in a brawl with a home invader, his wife was killed (supposedly by the invader). This sent him on a mission of revenge to track down and murder the perpetrators. As he can't form new memories, he has to write himself 'mementos'. Most are on Polaroid photos, and he even goes so far as to tattoo important notes on his body. Though he wouldn't even remember himself getting revenge if he succeeds, he believes that justice for his wife will be done nonetheless. This attitude, combined with his memory loss, leads him to make some very bad decisions which I can't go into without spoiling somewhat.Anyway, the acting is quite good all round, especially the humourous Teddy (played by Joe Pantoliano, the traitor in The Matrix). The main musical theme is a very eerie tune and seems to set the tone for Leonard's sad and ultimately destroyed life. The ending of the film (along with much of the rest of it) was very confusing and quite open to interpretation, but nevertheless striking.Recommended to anyone who wants a challenging, intelligent breakaway from mainstream tripe.",Memento

Leonard Shelby has a condition which renders his short term memory all but useless in fact he can't remember something that happened to him as recently as ten minutes ago.

This mechanic allows you to peice together parts of the mystery just as Shelby is having to do. It sounds complicated, and to a certain extent it is, but no film maker has tried this approach before and I doubt anyone will try it again. As for the plot well to put it simply in the accident that caused Shelby's condition his wife was raped and murdered and he is seeking to take revenge on the killer.

1586,yourfriend_ap,Memento: A movie that needs to be seen in reverse. !,10,18 February 2014,"The problem with being on a quest and having only short-term memory is that you can easily forget that you just finished what you started to do. Even though Leonard uses a system of Polaroid photos and tattoos to keep track of what he's doing, it's up to him to record whatever he considers important. At the moment of making a snap judgment, if he fails to find a pen, or if he's out of film, or if he just choose to not record the information, then he's out of luck.The movie starts by showing Leonard killing someone, and it is soon hinted that this person might be the killer Leonard was seeking. The movie traces Leonard's steps backwards to try to illustrate the logic Leonard uses in making his decision. In doing so, the movie also recants the story, in chronological order, of Sammy (Stephen Tobolowsky), a person who Leonard investigated for insurance fraud and who suffered from the same condition as Leonard does, and how their wives (Leonard's and Sammy's) apparently meet their demise. This happens gradually and for the most part, both stories are very clear cut (which means it's too good to be true). The most damning revelations are made during the final minutes of the film, which illustrates the nature of Leonard's condition, as well as his circular quest (the tag-line gives a major clue: ""some memories are best forgotten"").While some people think of the movie as being rather ambiguous, I believe there are enough pointers to solve most issues (just view the movie backwards). For example, Leonard, our protagonist, is allegedly helped by Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who seems like a good person. However, towards the end, she issues a tirade which makes it clear exactly what her real motives are. The final sequences are the most telling, where another person who Leonard isn't supposed to trust, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), tells him what is really happening since he has been with Leonard since the beginning of his quest. Leonard's reaction to Teddy's ""truth"", and a failure to record it, illustrates the motivations behind his actions.The movie's style of telling the story backward is interesting, but I'm beginning to discover that it's really not that hard to tell a story in this manner. Take a few your favorite books (or even this review), reverse all the chapters/paragraphs, and with a bit of mental filler, you can easily follow the stories in most cases.Director Christopher Nolan has made a memorable film in Memento, which serves as a metaphor for forgetting everything we hold dear when humans embark on a quest and want to succeed at any cost. Don't miss this film. AWESOME!!!PLOT A backwards sequence is shown. It starts with the Polaroid photograph of a dead man. As the sequence plays backwards the photo reverts to its undeveloped state, entering the camera before the man is shot in the head. This is followed by interspersed black-and-white and color sequences, with the black-and-white sequences taking place chronologically before the color sequences.",Memento

This a film that that is fairly easy to describe the outline of the plot but almost impossible to describe the story. Guy Pierce plays an insurance investigator who suffers from short term memory loss after a bash on the head during the murder of his wife. this means that he can't retain any memories for more than 5 minutes although he can remember everything before the accident. With this affliction he tries to find the killer of his wife to inflict revenge. The way the film plays out is quite brilliant. It has little pattern yet it is so watchable simply because all the time you are trying to work out what it going. It is like the viewer has the same term memory loss as the main character.While it is almost impossible to know where you are in the story it is not irritating in the way some films can be when the story is to complicated. Guy Pierce is superb and pulls this off to perfection.But i think a big congratulation goes to Christopher and Jonathon Nolan for the brilliant direction and writing. 9 out of 10.,Memento

At first they're quite literally playing the scene backwards, but don't worry they don't keep doing that.But it's a really neat deal that the movie plays backwards (reverse chronological), starting with a scene at the end of the story and working its way towards the beginning. The main character has a (real) disorder where his hippocampus doesn't work right so he's unable to form new long term memories. Having the movie play from end to start allows us to appreciate *his* perspective on the events of his life as they unfold. I.e., we the viewers are just as in the dark about what he's just done or what's just happened as he is.This is a really, really incredibly great film. It's got action and suspense, pathos and all that, plus it was just a whole lotta fun to watch. I should mention that it's not the *happiest* story ever told.

I wonder whether the screenplay by Nolan has not been taken from Pyszora's novel. If so I would consider this information to be absolutely necessary, otherwise one could draw the conclusion that this movie is a case of plagiarism. The plot is quite witty and original, something that is rather uncommon these days in newer films.

This movie shows Nolan's early spirit in movie making, as this is his second feature film. However this is not for everyone. Even if you're a die-hard Nolan fan, you still might not like it. It was in my cup of tea, so I loved it. The movie is a complete mind bender. It doesn't play in order. It jumps from the past to present a TON of times, so it can be a hell lot of confusing. It's a slow movie, but fantastic. It grabs your attention from the start till the end. The suspense builds stronger as every second ticks by. If you haven't seen it go see it now, because in the second part of my review I'm going to talk about the ending. The ending is something to talk about. There is a plot twist at the end, rather twistS. It is one of the most unpredictable twists ever.Spoiler Alert!As many of you have seen the movie, you will know the ending is completely mind blowing. I never expected that Leo had killed the attacker over a year ago, and that now he kept forgetting and believed that the killer is still alive. Also another crazy twist was when Teddy told Leo that Leo's wife survived the attack, and that Leo himself killed her by accident with an insulin overdose. The real shocker was when it was revealed that Leo was mixing Sammy's life with his life. Everything that was said about Sammy, indeed revealed Leo's life. Totally mind blowing. There were like 3-4 twists at the end, which blew me away. To be honest, I didn't even expect one of the twists. I was blown away because there were many twists at the end, and none of them were predictable. From all the movies I've seen this movie had the second biggest twist ending, right after ""The Prestige"", also by Nolan.This movie is very suspenseful and interesting. It doesn't let your interest leave until the very end. In short, fantastic movie and it deserves at least one watch. For me many more watches. Nolan never disappoints. Not one of his movies disappointed me, and I've seen all his movies, including his short films.",Memento

1600,collateralcable,Memento is a Truly Intriguing Journey,9,9 June 2017,"Before Inception and The Prestige, Christopher Nolan created a film with a completely different feel that is based on his brother's short story that follows a man lost in his own mind, unable to separate truth from lie.Memento is centered on Leonard, played by Guy Pearce, who is a man determined to find and kill the one who raped and murdered his wife. However, throughout this investigation, he experiences one immense handicap: he is unable to retain any memories after the death of his wife. Despite this setback, his determination leads him to take pictures, write notes, and even tattoo himself with facts he refuses to forget. This is only the first sign that he won't stop until the man he wishes to kill is dead.Without spoiling the movie for future audiences, I would like to start out by saying that this movie has a fascinating flow in its sequence of events, and it gave me true joy when I first recognized this unique element. If you have already seen Christopher Nolan's later films, recognize that Memento is nothing like them, nor should it be. It has a completely different pace while intellectually expecting much from its viewers. This is a movie that demands your attention, and I can say without a doubt that it received mine. It is as though the movie is always challenging you to be as perceptive as you can, while taking note of the most minute of details that flash by you on the screen. I don't believe this is a perfect movie (although I have yet to find anything of the sort), but it is a movie that excels in so many ways, creating interesting characters, an interesting setting, and most importantly, an interesting flow.If I haven't said it already, Memento is an incredible movie that should not be missed. It is unique and knows how to separate the fun pace from the emotional plot, giving it even more flavor. I personally found it difficult to emotionally bond with Leonard, given that he didn't always seem as heartbroken as he should over his deceased wife. Fortunately, I didn't find this issue to be nearly enough to hold this movie back from being truly amazing movie that captivates audiences of all kinds.",Memento

Example: in Lennie's phone conversation, if he can't remember things that happened a few minutes ago, why doesn't lose his memory at any point in the call? The ending, though a surprising and definitely unexpected twist, also didn't seem very clear. If Lennie's wife wasn't killed, why would he remember it that way?

Leonard responds with it's the only thing that keeps him alive and gives him purpose after the short term memory loss. Not remembering every word and action these characters do leads to leonard being used. There are two different perspectives in this movie. Colored and black and white. The colored scenes are of the present and the black and white are of leonard having a telephone conversation about a client he once had when he was an insurance investigator.

A singular effort from Nolan, who pens and helms his second feature-length film, Memento is the ultimate non-linear thriller, dolling out moments of cinematic excellence. Its only criticism is an unavoidable one, at times flirting with the edges of being puzzling and unclear.
Starring Guy Pearce, Memento, in its simplest terms, chronicles Leonard's experiences as he wrestles with short-term memory loss whilst trying to uncover the identity of his wife's killer. 
In the interest of not completely alienating too many audience members, Nolan deploys the use of a black and white colour scale to signify flashbacks and breaks from the chronology of the story.

These scenes are also filled close ups, with Stephen Tobolowsky's facial expressions superbly depicting fear and confusion, and ultimately inspiring empathy from the audience, as the film approaches an emotional crescendo.
Loud noises, such as doors slamming, also give structural cues to the audience as to when Guy Pearce's heart-broken amnesic Leonard's current cycle of memory ends, and consequently when a new one begins.

This film deserves to be watched at least 2-3 times to fully comprehend the story and to truly appreciate the master piece this film really is.Imagine yourself in a tragic situation where you and a loved one are involved in a car accident, the other person dies immediately from the impact of the crash, and you survive but suffer serious brain injuries that affects the functionality of an essential part of your brain where all the short term-memories are stored; Moreover, due to your brain injury you are diagnosed with Anterograde Amnesia, which means that you lose the ability to create new memories, while long-term memories from before the event remain intact. Furthermore, let's suppose that the last thing you fully remember is witnessing your loved one die in the accident, and everything else you experience in your present life fades away during your sleep every night or within short periods of time. In such hypothetical situation, how can you heal your grief if you can't feel the passage of time? How can you heal if the most recent and profound memory you have is of your loved one dying? How can you find meaning and purpose in your new life if you cannot retain new feelings, memories, and experiences to reflect upon tomorrow or the future? It's a tough situation to imagine yourself in, isn't it? This is the philosophical theme that Memento (2001) presents in a unique multilayered storyline in which the past and the present collide, and just like the main character, the audience questions what is real and what is not.I highly recommend this film! One of my all time favorites.",Memento

If you watch the movie carefully once, you just might understand it fully. If you watch it more, you catch new things every time.Memento puts you beautifully in the shoes of Leonard Shelby, a man who had his life ripped out from under him. He lost his short term memory while trying to protect his wife from being raped and murdered. The only trail he has a shreds of evidence and notes he has scrawled to himself.Memento is illustrated perfectly by the editing, acting, and camera-work. The movie places you in Leonards shoes by playing snippet scenes that would be just long enough for Leonard to remember. Each turn in the plot leaves you guessing as to what caused it.

I understand that different people look for different qualities in a film, but some of the criticism written about Memento needs to be addressed. Some of the viewers think that the story relies on the ""gimmick"" of telling it in reverse chronological order. Sure, I agree that the story wouldn't have been as engaging had it been told chronologically but I fail to see how a director can be blamed for telling a story in the most interesting way possible. Do these same critics believe that all murder-mystery movies are to be disregarded for using the ""gimmick"" of not revealing the murderer until the end? Maybe these people are only happy watching Columbo, where you actually see the murder in the first scene.I also just read a review that claims the film is inferior to the likes of Sixth Sense because the loose ends aren't all neatly tied up at the end. Now, I'm going to have to assume that the writer of this critique either has no imagination or simply can't bring himself to consider the implications of the ""open-ending"". As for similarities between the Sixth Sense and this film, I just don't see them. Both are highly enjoyable, but Memento has a much richer plot and lacks the depth of characters exhibited in Sixth Sense (this lack of depth is crucial to the film, however).Once again, I understand that this movie won't be enjoyed by everyone, but at least do the writer and director the courtesy of not criticizing it's greatest elements.",Memento

Just pick some of the movies with the highest rating and you will certainly have a good time - if you don't find fine art, you will probably have a good entertainment.So, I went to see Memento because pure 9 usually stands for masterpiece. And for the first time I was really disappointed with IMDB. Memento is just a trick movie and it's really shameless to compare it with 'Pulp Fiction'. And to rank 'Memento' higher than 'Usual Suspects' is really a crime.The story is told backwards. Nice touch, but try to tell the same story as usual and you will find it pretty lame and flat. My biggest objection regards the way in which Leonard handles his short-term memory problem. It is really stupid to use tattoos and short handwritten notes on Polaroid photos just to keep your lost memories around... What's wrong with notebooks, computers, and diaries? You don't need to be a psychology expert to see the holes in the story. For example, it seems that short-term memory loss does not affect Leonard's capabilities to use his camera day after day (he is always perfectly aware of what it should be used for).After the movie I read almost all of the comments posted for ""Memento"" (I thought: ""If I didn't understand it, there are some guys out there who did!""). It was a complete waste of time. More than 95% of comments are mere compilations of superlatives, just simple conclusions without facts. Those who posted possible 'spoilers' didn't spoil a single thing (read them freely). Those who used the biggest words (""best of the best"", ""film making revolution""...) were *very* careful to avoid any word of explanation.

1634,dasaffe,"Nice Editing, Poor Film",4,15 August 2001,"Perhaps this film's success will signal the transition of film from a medium of words to a medium of pictures, but that doesn't mean i have to approve.  The problem with Memento is that the film shown backwards (ie without the gimmick) would not be watchable.  The plot develops at a slow pace, the dialogue is riddled with ughs, every time Guy says he has a ""disability"" as an example (South Park speaks more intelligently about the topic).  The acting is flat, which i think could be attributed to the filming process during which the actors have said they weren't told much about their roles.  The film is mostly predictible, barring plot twists which seldom make sense due to the backwardity. One thing that this film proves even moreso than The Limey (a better, if average, movie) is that editing counts. Another thing this movie proves, except this time by bad example, MUSIC counts.  The score in Memento is typical pad swells and synth strings, it only hinders a film which would be much more riveting with no music (or perhaps some odd backwards soundscapes). While the directer immerses you in the world of the amnesiac, it's not a world worth inhabiting, as nothing is really happening.  Memento is sort of like throwing a party but spending all your money on the band and not being able to afford invitations.  It's just you sitting alone, enjoying the show of your life (the editing), but wondering why you bothered. 6 of 10",Memento

1641,dr_dan-2,New Same-Old,6,21 April 2001,"""Memento"" is tough to pin down.  The gimmick is generally great, but it's the only good thing about the film.Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a former insurance investigator with a condition (""severe anterograde memory dysfunction"", for those of you en route to med school) that leaves him unable to form any memories.  He introduces himself to people he's met dozens of times, he writes down anything he hopes to remember (as basic as where he's driving his car to), and tattoos the real important stuff all over his body.  The only thing he can remember is the home invasion that left him with his condition, and his drive to kill the man who raped and murdered his wife.Given this, it almost makes sense that the film plays in reverse.  The opening scene shows Leonard gunning down a man in cold blood; in the next scene that same man is alive, and we learn a (very little) bit about why Leonard has done this deed (he has a Polaroid of the man; on the back is written ""Don't believe his lies.  He is the one.  Kill him."").  And this is the way the movie plays, with the last line of every scene being a repeat of the first line of the previous scene.It fits quite smartly, since the camera never leaves our hero.  We're stuck in his world.  He has no memory with which to process the events he lives, why should we?  There is no way we could sympathize with this character if ""Memento"" played forward, so reverse it is.Unfortunately, if this story played forward, it would have a hatful of other problems also.  If it didn't follow the film noir playbook to the letter, it could at least keep the viewer working on untangling the confusion.  As it is, however, the viewer is constantly two scenes ahead of the movie.  When each bombshell is dropped about what's really up with the characters (when you boil it down, the film only has three), you're not the least bit surprised.  You've already seen the last of them, so it's generally obvious how they got into the film in the first place, when considered in the context of Teddy's (played cleverly by Joe Pantoliano) death at the beginning/end.  Even if you're not sitting in the theater playing detective, when director Christopher Nolan tells you the real dirt on Leonard/Teddy/Natalie, any surprise you may experience will be tempered with the realization that it couldn't have been any other way.It's been suggested to me that this film requires repeat viewings.  I feel quite the opposite; that the extremely pedestrian nature of the storyline can't be disguised once you're in on it.  Leonard has no memory; you do. As it was, I found this movie pleasant enough, but more for novelty than any more conventional qualities of a film.  2 1/2 stars.",Memento

Memento is one of the best films I've seen in years - a film people will be talking about for a long time.Granted, it won't appeal to a lot of people because of its complexity and the fact that it leaves the viewer with several unanswered questions.  But let's forget the average viewer - they wouldn't know plot if it grabbed them by the brain and smacked them, and they can't understand the appeal of any film without a standard hollywood ending.Memento is entertaining, intriguing, disturbing, and even funny at times. Unfortunately, there were several people in the audience who laughed EVERY time Leonard forgot something, whether it was funny or not.  (Probably the same people who laughed uncontrollably during Crouching Tiger every time someone jumped or flew.)Anyhow, Memento is well worth seeing, and if you don't have a good theatre near you that shows independent films, I highly suggest making the drive to the nearest city to see Memento in the theatre rather than waiting to rent it.",Memento

Sammy Jankis is a man who Guy Pearce checked out as an insurance investigator that claimed to have the same condition. Pearce was constantly looking at the tattoo throughout the movie therefore being reminded of the condition.

And then you can come back here and read everybody's comments and they will make more sense to you.What follows is directed more at people who have already seen the film:There is no question that Christopher Nolan is an exceptionally talented and intelligent filmmaker -- if nothing else, he sure is ambitious -- and we should all look forward to his next work.  But whether you think this is a great film or simply an impressive technical exercise depends, I think, on how you react to the ending.A structure like this demands an ending that knocks your socks off, and if that ending isn't there...Either the ending will convince you and you will feel as if Nolan had intended to take you there all along; or it will not convince you, and you'll feel as if he's throwing up philosophical smoke and mirrors to cover up what is a less-than-dazzling conclusion.  For me, it felt like the latter.  I didn't buy it.  It seemed like he started with the intriguing structure and the puzzle and then used some philosophical scotch tape to try to keep the whole thing together.Yes, memory can be unreliable, but not quite to the extent that it is for Guy Pearce's character or anyone in real life who suffers from that kind of extreme mental condition.  Ultimately, Memento is not a film that makes you think about life; it's a film that makes you think about the film.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  In fact, it's an excellent lesson for screenwriters and filmmakers everywhere that you can move a story backwards chronologically and still keep it moving forward dramatically.I applaud Nolan's ambition and much of his execution.  It's not one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but it's certainly one of the most interesting and impressive.  And given that Nolan is already starting to work with the likes of Al Pacino, it's not hard to believe that someday, he could end up making one of the greatest films I've ever seen.  Can't wait.",Memento
1650,tymelord,originality lives in a director who challenges himself and succeeds,10,28 April 2002,"How pleasing to find that mediocrity has not entirely destroyed the movie industry.  Let's be honest, the powers that be are aware that it is not necessary to make an intelligent, engaging film with an original plot to make money, in fact such a film could possibly loose money.  However; take a proven crowd pleaser, change enough details to appease copyright laws, cast a hunk and a honey, and frame it all with a few over-planed and well shot explosions...  ""Now dis a film to bust box-office r'cords, I gar'ntee...""Shining through the cookie-cutter productions offered up as entertainment this year is this gem of a film Memento.  Warning, if you enjoyed any of the following films DO NOT watch Memento:Mission: Impossible IIWhat Women WantAny Segal movieAny Die HardAny movie with the phrase ""I love this job"" in the trailerThat should eliminate most of those movie goers who have been conditioned to turn off their brains as they take their seats.  Because Memento will force the viewer to think, something which should NOT be a chore -- or am I the only one left who actually enjoys a plot which wraps itself around the mind and entices the viewer into constructing a mental maze of plot-lines and ever so cleverly brings us to safely through the twisting and winding walls. This is what story-telling is all about, to take us on a journey which our lives would not allow in reality and thereby escape that reality.I won't bother to rehash the plot events, for that read another contributor's comments.  Instead let's acknowledge the accomplishments of this film and its cast/crew.First, the movie begins with the end.  The hero avenges his wife and kills the bad guy.  This is where we would usually go home but with expert ability Nolan keeps us riveted to the screen until the movie's end.Second, the film has originality.  Enough Said.Third, each actor and actress does one hell of a job, my hats off to each and every one you, even the small parts, like the hotel clerk, are skillfully played.  I also must make mention of an impressive editing job, which allows the viewers to understand the perspective of our main character.  Ah, like real literature, I thank all those involved for this for I love literature, don't you?Fou... O who's counting anyway...? The writing is superb with poignant irony and insight into the most interesting side of the human condition -- the dark side.  Lines like;""I can't remember to forget you.""""What the last thing you do remember?""  Lenny replies, ""My wife, (pause) dying.""""Let's see what am I doing. Ah, I'm chasing this guy.""  The guy shoots at Lenny.  ""No, No he is chasing me.""
I could go on and on but I'll wrap things up with the most important component of any film, and it seems the one nobody seems to address; the theme.  What is this film about?  Remember Lit 101?  The central theme defines the message of the story.  (So what the hell is the theme of die hard anyway?)  Memento, delves into the dark black side of the soul brining us face to face with the part of man which no one talks about; our delusions.  The lies we tell ourselves, although never out loud, which allow us to go on with the daily routine.  Leaving us to wonder, is it our own manipulation which silently drives our motives pulling us towards the eventual outcome like a strong undertow in waist deep water.  In the end this film is about the person you believe yourself to be and how that relates to the person others perceive you to be as defined by your actions. Think about that for a bit and then, as honestly as you can, visualize the differences between these two people.  Which one is really you?See Memento, this is a movie worth your precious time -- which is the true cost of all movies, money you can get more of, but your time here is truly limited -- remember that the next time you buy tickets to that over-hyped summer block-buster release of Die Lethal Mission Rocky Commando Part XIV.I give Memento a perfect 10 -- a score I have only given twice in a long career as a devout media-slave.

1657,a.liggins,Stop reading all these reviews and go see it now,10,7 May 2001,"In a nutshell : is this a fantastic film (if you want to see an intelligent, thoughtful film, this is as good as it gets).  This film makes you think, it IS confusing at the start (and the less you know before seeing it the better), and slowly as the story unfolds (in reverse) you get to see the full picture, and that process of YOU having to work it out is what makes the film greater.  You get Lenny's perspective, you get how he sees reality, any other way of filming would not have had so much an impact.  There are many twists and turns, almost everything gets explained (but go to the official site afterwards AFTERWARDS, which should fill in the blanks - its very well done too). All the actors were great, the characters in it were real, each has their own human agendas (good and bad).  Sets / Filming / Editing / Soundtrack (bonus of a David Bowie song at credit time) / Technical stuff - faultless.My only complaint is that this film did not get the full public release coverage it so rightly deserves (UK), I found out about it by accident, why was this?  Do films that make people think take a back seat to no-brainer CGI junk that we get flooded with now?  What other films have I missed because of this?Now stop reading now and go see it, as I will say something that aint a real spoiler, but everyone is whining about it (which may put people off from seeing it) so : Lenny has conditioned himself (Unlike Sammy who could not) on how to behave (look in pockets for photos, read notes, make notes,tattoos, take photos which helps subsitute for his memory) (Its all in the film).

1658,sndrclsn,Very original,9,16 June 2001,"This afternoon I read an article on the Internet about how to market movies in an original way. Probably the best example of such smart marketing was the whole story around ""The Blair Witch Project"". This article mentioned another example, the web site  for the movie ""Memento"". The name of the web site is backwards, because this perfectly matches with the storyline: it starts with the end and ends in the past. I was intrigued by the article, so I visited the site. I found a mysterious introduction to the film, giving different hints about it, dosed in such a way that I got so curious I had to see the movie as soon as possible, today. Before that, I checked IMDB and noticed that Memento even made it to number 12 in the all time top 250. And I never even heard about it!The opening scene gets you immediately. Only after at least a minute I noticed it was played backwards completely. It shows a polaroid picture developing. That is, you see a (dead) man on a developed polaroid picture that's fading more and more. Right after that, you see the picture being taken and a bullet leaving the killed body flying back into a gun. The rest of the story is in fact a number of scenes of the history that led to this last scene, but cut into pieces and put backwards. Why was the movie made this way? Because the main character has lost the ability to remember things that just happened (his short term memory). Watching the film, the viewer sort of suffers the same, because you never know why things happen the way they do. From the beginning of the film, you want to know about the past. The future is irrelevant. You want to know who is who, how the main character gathers all his facts helping him to find and kill the man who murdered his wife and caused him to lose his memory. But also maybe: did he really kill the man he was looking for? Or is someone trying to mislead him? Nobody can be trusted, because you don't know anything for sure.It is an interesting concept for a movie. But to be honest, after 45 minutes I was thinking how much longer is this going to take? Step by step you are taken along on the path of finding out what had happened and this could have been done somewhat faster. But right at the moment you think you're going to just simply peel of all the layers of the onion until you're at the inside, the movie takes a surprising turn. The main character records everything he hears and sees by writing it down. He can only trust on these notes as facts, because his memory can't help him. In one of the most critical scenes, he just hasn't got the time to write down what has just happened to him and astonishing as it is for the viewer, this means that he manages to forget something that is crucial for the things that will happen in the future.Watching this film is indeed very confusing for the viewer. The complexity of the order in which everything happens makes you forget about the future and not yet know about the past. While watching you realise that the end of the movie will explain it all. It will, but you still are confused. This is the typical film you just have to see again to understand all the details. And yes, I don't know why, but I really felt as if I myself had lost my short term memory during the first minutes after the movie, walking out of the theater. I do not remember ever having experienced such a subtle sort of brainwash after seeing a film. Exciting, somewhat scary, but impressive once you're completely ""sober"" again.Of course there are some logical flaws in the movie, concerning the short term memory of the main character. Sometimes he seems to be able to remember things I guess he should not have been able to remember. But just like ""Back to the future"" also has its minor flaws, in general the story is really good and can keep you thinking about it for days. It could have been just a little bit more perfect. My last hesitation is therefore if I should find this a super top film that deserves the title ""classic"". I fear that in the end the movie lacks just this tiny bit of perfection, which makes it just a very original film but not more than that. At least, I think I'll remember it as such in a couple of years.",Memento

1660,karen_uni,the most intriguing film I've seen in a long time..,9,14 July 2001,"As much as i really wanted to see Memento on the big screen, somehow i missed it and had to wait for video. I found the premise fascinating and intriguing, and couldnt wait to see it. At last, i rented it and got it home to watch, and at first, i have to admit, it was kinda like, 'what...'? The whole backwards thing seemed like it was really going to be an obstacle at first, and i was worried i might not be able to really get absorbed by the film because of this. But, my fears were quelled and i found myself totally getting into the film, and once i got used to the backwards deal, i realised how genius it was. To provide us at the beginning of each scene with only the knowledge that the protagonist, Leonard Shelby, has, and no information about previous events. This way we start the film knowing only what Leonard Shelby knows, and thus allowing us to empathise with his frustration and anguish in his search for the truth. In a way, this divides the film into 3 parts, much like other films such as Reservoir Dogs. In the 1st part, we have little or no knowledge about the characters, so the characters in the film who *are* informed have one up on us. In the 2nd part of the film we learn more, and we actually surpass the level of information of other characters in the film. In the 3rd part, the climax of the film, the remaining characters catch up with us as they learn the truth. This structure gives us a connection with the characters and makes us feel involved in the film. And clever tricks aside, what a genuinely great film! The characters were solid and believable, the actors' and actresses' performances were excellent, the themes of the movie were classic, but not cliche, and i was truly gripped by this film from beginning to end. And the ending (which I'm not going to give away) was completely unexpected (by me at least), but still entirely believable. A must-see, in my opinion, and I'd recommend watching it more than once- there's so much to it that you'll pick up second time around.",Memento

Gladiator may be the best film out this year for sheer enjoyment, but this is the best film to watch with friends. There is so much to think about in this film that you need a few people to watch it with you so that you can all swap ideas afterwards.Basically, Guy Pearce plays Leonard, a man who suffered brain damage in an incident. This has left him with the inability to create new memories so everything he experiences will be forgotten within minutes unless he records it somehow. This ranges from photographs with hand-written notes on them through to tattoos on his body.The style of the movie is very unusual. The story starts at the beginning and the end, and works its way to the middle from both sides. Now this may sound stupid, but trust me, it works. The first few minutes are confusing, but once you get the idea of what is happening, then you can settle back and enjoy.The only film I can think of that compares to this is The Usual Suspects, but only in the way that you never know if you are being told the truth or not. This one will keep you guessing all the way through and still leave plenty to argue about with your friends.I don't know about other countries, but this film appears to have got zero publicity in the UK.

The premise is handled with supreme dexterity by Christopher Nolan in his sophomore effort (his debut being the little-seen Following) and the acting, particularly from a never-better Pearce is outstanding.

It is quite exhilarating.The choices of scene order and the editing were very intelligent and always hugely effective... the opening shot demonstrates this right away (I was in love with the film immediately because of it). The plot is entirely intelligible (replay it forwards in your mind afterwards and the sequence of events is surprisingly simple), which is quite a feat, and the obvious method for maintaining suspense in a film that starts with its ending - that is to lie a lot, Usual Suspects-style! - is employed in a smart and at times cheeky and humorous manner that works really well. You never feel cheated... or if you do, it's done so well that you love it!Philosophy really seems to be invading mainstream cinema at the moment (which is something I and, it seems, the public in general, are enjoying a lot)... first The Matrix, now Memento. These two films share two actors (Pantoliano and Moss) and they also share a major philosophical issue - the existence (or otherwise) of a consistent objective reality. Memento, though (in my opinion), tackles a much deeper and more important point. This point, revealed at the end of the film (this is an analytical spoiler, not a plot one, but skip this paragraph if you care), is not just that we carry our worlds in our heads and that they could be made up by us or someone else, but that we *need* to believe in a world that is consistent and has purpose and meaning - and that this can make us waste our life trying to get it to make sense within the context of these abstract ideas.Life is a series of moments of consciousness for all of us, whether we have a functioning memory or not. No matter what we do in the long run, it is how happy we are in each of these individual moments that counts - a life is not greater than the sum of its parts. A great, long-term achievement only makes life better by making individual moments happier (through pride, say) but such achievements do not necessarily bring a sufficient reward to balance their cost, as was the case in the extreme situation of Leonard.Several people have complained about the lack of an 'emotional heart' to the film but I think that (a) it was present in Sammy's story (Harriet Harris is really, really good) and (b) this is part of the point. Leonard's choice to base his actions on belief in his 'purpose' (revenge) ensures that his life is hellish and never satisfying. An abstract purpose to life that extends beyond the individual moments of consciousness (their disconnectedness emphasised by Leonard's condition but present in all of us) is what many of us seem to follow, yet we do it without any proof that it will make our moments any happier in the long run. We can become obsessed with purpose and life 'making sense' at the expense of happiness.

1673,aaron-121,"A black comedy, film-noir thriller. A minor cult masterpiece.",8,24 December 2000,"A perfect film for noir fans, uncompromising and relentless. The story runs in reverse,scene by scene, from the final shot of a killing to the beginning, where all that has gone before becomes explained. Although even this is open to ambiguity and will merit a re-viewing to check on the details. Leonard (Guy Pierce), an insurance investigator, is a man suffering from short-term memory loss following a brutal attack at his home. We learn that he is seeking the killer of his wife despite the fact that he cannot make sense of the world beyond a fifteen minute span of memory. He is forced to keep records of important clues by tattoos on his body and taking polaroids of places and people, on which he has written notes to himself. As each scene opens we are only able to make sense of it by the knowledge of what is to come.Running through the film is a separate series of scenes, shot in the right order, which illuminates the plot still further; Leonard explains on the telephone to an unseen listener the case study of a man he dealt with in his earlier life before he was injured, who was similarly afflicted. Leonard's job was to investigate and decide if the man's illness was psychological or physical, a fine distinction but necessary for the insurance claim. His decision haunts him and is made poignant and relevant by his own current condition.The cast is excellent. Joe Pantaloni as Teddy, who may or may not be a cop and the delicious Carry-Anne Moss, a perfect femme fatale. But it is Pierce who lends the right air, a hero making sense of the incomprehensible, vulnerable yet tough, bewildered but determined. As we begin to understand Leonard we are taken into his world with wit and technical skill and we believe in it.Despite the films obvious virtuosity some of the plot twists become a little obvious as we become used to the nuances of the characters affliction and at times the thriller element is lost; but this is a minor criticism, the film is inventive, intelligent and has more than a liberal dose of black humour.

Excellently supported by Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss who are either aiding or misleading the ""hero"" to the initial outcome, brought together by Christopher Nolan in only his second feature in a first class and unique way by reversing the whole film, so you see Leonard kill a man but cleverly not the reasoning behind it, till you rewind to the beginning of these events.

1691,mwtorq,A great film (note: spoilers),10,17 May 2001,"This commentary will serve a number of purposes: first, to give my opinion on this film.  Second, to outline a few theories I have on various aspects of the film.  And third, to point out (what I perceive as) errors in judgment of this film that others who have commented have made.First off, this is a magnificent piece of work.  Through the first thirty or so minutes of this film (which I have only seen once thus far), I was mesmerized by the technical/editing magnificence of this film.  The editing of this movie is like no other I have ever seen.  Others have compared this movie to films like ""The Usual Suspects"" (which I agree is a great film, too), ""Fight Club"" (which is one of my all-time favourites), ""Pulp Fiction"" (great), ""Clean Slate"" (have not seen), and ""The Third Man"" (have not seen). Another film (which I haven't noticed anyone mention) that plays around with ambiguities/timelines/etc. in a similarly-masterful way is the little-seen ""Schizopolis"" by Steven Soderbergh.  And then there's ""Clean, Shaven"", which also tries to put us in the shoes of a highly unusual character (Memento - person with anteriograde amnesia; Clean, Shaven - person with schizophrenia).Even if this movie only had the technical/editing aspects going for it, I'd still be a big fan of it - but it does have much more going for it. Contrary to what some of said, I find this film to have quite a well-constructed storyline and group of characters.  The fact that this film is told in pseudo-reverse adds to the quality of the film - but it still would have been great told in the ""correct"" order.  One reason I say this: the killing of Teddy at the ""end""  (beginning of movie) would have had much more of an impact if we knew what came before that incident.  As it is, the killing of Jimmy at the ""beginning"" (end of movie) has a greater impact due to the order in which the story is told.  Also, contrary to what some have said, I enjoy a film with ambiguities: some may view that as a cop-out by the writer, but I view it as an opportunity for discussion to ensue.Now, a few points.  There's one main theory that I have about this movie that I have not read in any other review.  Most - if not all - reviews of this movie make a point of there being some length-of-time significance to Leonard's memory problems; his short-term memory lasts 3 minutes, 6 minutes, 8 minutes, whatever.  I disagree that his memory problem has anything to do with time at all; look to the scene where Natalie shows herself to be manipulating him.  As she goes outside to her car, Leonard searches frantically for a pen to write down the fact that Natalie is manipulating him.  In the process of searching for a pen, he forgets that Natalie was manipulating him - because the focus of his memory shifted from WHAT he was trying to remember to the mere act OF remembering; he was trying so hard to remember that Natalie had manipulated him that he lost track of what he was trying to remember.  Another instance of this occurs when Leonard meets with Natalie at Natalie's bar.  So it isn't a matter of time that determines whether or not he can remember something - it's how well he is able to maintain his focus on an idea.  So long as he's able to stay focused on an idea, his recollection of that idea is intact.  Given the frantic nature of the human mind, however, it's nearly impossible for anyone to stay completely focused on one idea for any siginicant length of time; thus, Leonard loses track of what he's doing.  (As Sean Penn says in ""Hurlyburly"", ""You know what's my biggest distraction?  Me.  I am my own biggest distraction."")  Thus, his problem doesn't have anything to do with the passage of time, but rather his brain's ability to record information prior to his forgetting it.  I'm not sure if this corresponds to ""true"" anteriograde amnesia, but in any case, that's how I view *Leonard's* condition.Secondly, some have mentioned being suspicious of Leonard's previous job - whether or not he was an insurance investigator, since it's odd for an insurance investigator to drive a truck.  I'm not going to touch on whether or not he had that job, but I will say this - recall early in the movie when he takes Teddy out to the remote building?  The truck that Leonard uses to drive out there earlier (later) to kill Jimmy is still there.  Leonard does not recognize it.  If the truck was his before the incident, he would remember it (of course, he may be faking..)And finally, the biggest problem people have with this movie - how can he remember his condition?  Evidently, those with anteriograde amnesia DO know that they suffer from the condition (somehow).Definitely one of the most unique films ever crafted; it's uniqueness is due to the nature of film itself, as this film is a great demonstration of the power and flexibility that is inherant in this unique genre of entertainment.  When the capabilities of this genre are used to their full potential (as so few films do), beautifully-unique things can be crafted - things that cannot be crafted in any other form of entertainment.",Memento

1695,ethan2776,SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!,10,20 March 2001,"Here's my theory on Memento's ending - I hope I remembered everything correctly, I would appreciate feedback/corrections.  The whole Leonard is really Sammy Jankis is just a red herring -Teddy is just playing with his head, making the point that anything can be believed.  What really happened I think, is that Teddy is a corrupt cop who helped Leonard find the original John G.  Then he decided to use Leonard as his hitman.  Teddy hooked up with Natalie and they conspired to screw Jimmy Grants and Dodd out of 200,000 dollars with a drug deal set up. Teddy tells Leonard that Grants is the guy who killed his wife, in order to have Grants whacked.  Then however Leonard takes off with the jaguar which has the money in the trunk.  So the rest of the movie is Teddy and Natalie trying to get close to Leonard so that they can steal the money out of the trunk.  Dodd is also after Leonard, trying to get his money back, etc.So, what we have at the end chronologically, is Natalie will probably end up finally getting the money from Leonard. And who knows if Dodd will show up again.  My only question is why does Jimmy Grants mumble `Sammy' before Leonard kills him? Was Leonard using this as his alibi? Just my 2 cents, appreciate any feedback.",Memento

The critics seem to me to miss the point. We're ushered into his state of mind. Of course, it's cold; there's no memory to give it depth or meaning. Any inconsistencies just add to the effect.Just sit back & experience it.The progressions of clips work. (I think it would be hard not to spin in editing this film.)This film requires all of your attention so I'm glad I saw it in the theater rather than waiting for the video release.I saw this alone & many of the comments say go with friends; you'll be discussing it for quite a while afterwards.

1707,fcree,Memories can't be trusted,10,4 April 2001,"**SPOILERS**Memories can't be trustedNew form of cinema lands in the Indie circuit and challenges the mind.Memento, the hypertext movie of the future, is at times a dark noire about self-destruction and corruption and other moments a backwards journey about a man's search for his dead wife's killer.The plot of the movie consists of Leonard Shelby (portrayed by Guy Pearce) searching for his wife's killer.  Unfortunately, he has a severe form of anterograde memory dysfunction, which prevents him from forming new memories, so every 15 minutes, his memory is wiped blank, or even less under stress.  To compensate, he takes Polaroid photographs of important events and writes notes on the back of them.  For facts about his wife's death, he tattoos them to his body, so he will never forget.  Added to this are the two supporting characters Natalie (played by Carrie-Anne Moss) and Teddy (played by Joe Pantoliano) who play off Leonard's condition.Many writers are describing the movie as a Möbius strip, as one stream of the movie continues forward in time from the not-so-distant past, and the other travels backwards from the current time to thereby meet with the other stream in the middle of the movie, which is simultaneously the end.  Sound confusing?  You haven't seen anything yet, until you've witnessed this movie.  The best way I can think to describe it, is like opening a new book, and starting at the last chapter, skipping forward to the first chapter, then to the 2nd last chapter, until you finally meet in the middle of the book.The backwards journey through time is used to install the feeling of being lost without memories.  Because it is shot in backward-aligning segments of time, you are exploring each scene anew-missing what happened before-so you are left like Guy Pearce's character Leonard.  This effect is like reviewing a forgotten memory, except that it is shot in colour so it has a feel of a fresh event.   What make this even more interesting are the duplicitous supporting characters that challenge Leonard's reason for being in every scene. The dark noire, shot in black and white, give the impetus for the latter actions though the viewer may not catch this immediately, because unlike Leonard, you get to recompile the movie and form a whole.After leaving the theatre, my mind was busily connecting the scenes I just witnessed and I couldn't help being impressed by what an amazing movie experience I just had.   I think it's definitely worth your time to explore this movie. === spoiler=============>
=== spoiler=============> One thing i noticed in this page is that is says there's a goof in that the character shouldnt' be able to remember that he has a memory disorder.  But i don't agree, cuz Leonard states several times that people with less severe forms of this disorder can learn through repetition.  I believe he has trained himself through repetition, because he can remember some things -- the flashback's he has verifies this -- and he can work progressively (not starting fresh each time) -- the entire movie is a testament to this.
And also the fact that he has become what he has, should also confirm this. While Natalie and Teddy (John G.) use Leonard disorder for their own purposes, he ultimately proves that he is better at using himself.",Memento

The way in which the story was told really messed with traditional concepts of time, storytelling and memory.One standout feature was the way in which a scene was played out more than once.  At first you'd be shown the scene in the middle of it, time would go forward to the 'conclusion' of the scene.  Then you'd backtrack to before the moment you first stepped in.  A little more context was added and the scene was replayed just enough for you to catch the implications of the additional information given. Despite this backtracking and replaying it was never repetitive.  There was never too much information.The twists in it were just mindbending, and I'd read some of the spoilers. Nevertheless, watching the truth come out, backwards, was a completely engrossing and startling process.And the end was perfect.  One second more of film would've been too much. It ends, and you just sort of sit there stunned.  You now have to recall the whole film from start to finish with the new knowledge, the truth that is finally revealed at the start of the story and the end of the movie.There were two instances where the exposition seemed forced, more for the audience's benefit than because the scene actually warranted it.  One instance where Leonard (the man with a 'photographic' memory as the sign outside the theatre said) seems to hold onto a memory longer than he should've been able.

It has everything a movie needs for success:  moderate star-power, mystery, and little advertisement save an incredible web site and word-of-mouth. However, little advertisement has not hurt this film, it has actually helped.  People will continue to flock to theaters to see this movie because its trailer is not widely shown, and, therefore, little is known of its plot.  This mystery, as well as rave reviews, is all the hype the film needs.  After seeing the film, viewers leave in awe.  Awe from the confusion they have concerning the plot, awe from their own realization of certain aspects of the plot, awe from the realization that someone has made a film the way the motion picture was first intended to be made:  innovative film shots that grab the audience's attention, and a story that never loses interest in the eyes of the audience.

1722,skamikazi,Absolutely the best movie I have seen in years.,10,5 May 2001,"A buddy of mine went to see memento and commented on how utterly horrible it was. This is coming from someone who considers Quentin Tarrantino-esque movies are paramount and anything other is a fake or a bad movie. This is also coming from someone who went to the restroom during the movie one time. Let me just say that if you go to the restroom, pick up your keys, look into your box of candy, sneeze, blink, or otherwise remove your eyes from the screen for any more than 3 seconds then you have just wasted your time and money. This movie is not for the inattentive and restless. You must focus all of your attention unto the story that is jigsawed before you. This masterfully directed movie makes me wonder why hasn't this been done before? The answer is as simple as this. To make a movie of this caliber takes a director who works hand in hand with the writer. In this case Christopher Nolan is both director and writer and displays pure genius in the way that the movie is not written straight through from the beginning to end. The best way to describe the format and styling would be a backwards ""leapfrog"" approach. That's as simply as you can put a movie as complex as this one. It is a mystery and drama that makes you feel sorry for Leonard, the main character. Without saying too much he has a mental condition where he cannot create new memories and has a short term memory problem where even five minute conversations fade just as quickly as the scenes leapfrog around each other. Combine all of this with some serious twists and turns will leave you dumbfounded in the best meaning of the word. It is truly a masterful work which needs to be seen to be believed.

After coming out of the movie I was totally amazed, Memento WAS the BEST movie I had ever seen. But that wasn't why I was amazed it because... well it was told so perfectly it couldn't have been better. It was hard to follow but not too hard. The movie was told backwards. It was color and black and white the scenes in his motel room were black and white but the scenes out- side the motel room were in color. The end (not giving away any thing) which is the start is so weirdly presented and explained but after the movie you need to think about it because it is backwards. You have to think of it the other way around. But still I think there is more than one ending well not more than one ending but, you could talk to three different people who have seen Memento and they could all have different opinions of what the ending is! Ok I better tell you what this great movie is about! It's a bit hard to explain but I'll try. Leonard Shelby (Guy perice) was a successful businessman until his wife was killed, and that was when he got his short term memory he could hardly remember something that had happened three minutes ago. Now he lived in a motel room, getting up every morning thinking, where am I? Why am I here? The only things he has that can help him to remember things are his photos and tattoos.

In the company of other films such as SE7EN and Sixth Sense (though not nearly as graphic), Memento has probably the darkest ending I've seen in a great while.  Without the gratuitous violence and shock value this film displays all the ingredients of a classic; solid characterization, screenplay, direction, and editing (you'll understand editing after you see the film).My only concern with this film is that it's an independent release with a marketing budget smaller than the amount of change in my pocket right now. Everyone I've talked to has been literally stunned by Memento, but most are film buffs like us who are on the look out for a good flick.  I just hope the film continues to grow so that the movie can find a larger audience as it so deserves.Hats off to Guy Pearce and Chris Nolan (I can't believe this is his first film)and to all those involved in this picture.Go see this film.

1737,cfidsmarc,"SPOILER! Tips on What Happened, What to Look For, And Why.",10,15 June 2001,"I agree with the critics. Memento is one of the GREATEST movies ever made. The themes are deep, especially those pertaining to the nature of memory (e.g., remembering or blocking out what you want or NEED to) and the huge significance memory plays in our lives. The experience of watching the movie gives you some sense of what it is like to live with CFS or some form of dementia. That is the brilliance of the ""gimmick"" that works so effectively. The screenplay and acting are superb. There are very few movies I have thoroughly enjoyed on the 12th viewing -- and I'm ready to go back again. I figured out what really happened (for sure) only after the 4th viewing (which was later confirmed by reading the screenplay). There is a HUGE amount of detail in the movie (the dialogue, the voice-overs, the police reports, the flash backs, etc.) just as there is in real life. For example, watch very carefully the end of the flashback of Sammy in the mental ward and for less than a second you will see another face take the place of Sammy's... Some important facts, but there are far, far more: Leonard's wife survived the attack and DID have diabetes. Note Leonard continues to alter his memory to suit his needs (e.g., re ""his"" clothing and car) after the incident (attack and blow to his head). On first or second watching it does seem that ""its all up for interpretation"" but this is NOT really true. Watch and listen more closely and the plot and the themes become clear. Natalie (Carrie Ann Moss) does use Lenny to kill Teddy because she figures out that Teddy set up her boyfriend Jimmy. Lenny is used by Teddy to make money from Natalie's boyfriend Jimmy and to get a drug dealer off the streets. (Also note Teddy has sincere feelings for Lenny. He could have taken far greater advantage of Lenny. For a laugh, note how often Teddy tries to ""borrow"" the Jag to get the $$$. Teddy could have just stolen the money out of the trunk or taken it at gunpoint.) Lenny is a tool for Natalie to avenge her boyfriend, and Dodd is not a major character, but Dodd's threat is real and he plays a critical (and hilarious) role in revealing the extent of Lenny's handicap. My favorite part is when Lenny knowingly uses himself (the limits of his memory) to perpetuate his quest for revenge (his only remaining purpose in life) by deliberately lying to himself about Teddy near the end of the movie (and the middle of the timeline, when black-and-white switches to color in the same scene). Obviously I agree this movie is worth the effort and am frustrated with those too lazy to appreciate it or too impulsive to understand it. ""Your brain is a muscle, use it or lose it.""",Memento

Lenny got one of them but the 2nd hit him from behind which is when he develop his condition. His wife was not killed. After he lost his short term memory, he was admitted to a mental hospital but was stable with possible mental problems so he went back to his wife. He would give his wife insulin shots once a day at a certain time. His wife wasn't sure if he was faking the condition of if it was legit so he decides to test her. He eds up giving her to much insulin and she dies. He has cant believe that he killed his own wife so he conditioned himself to believe that Sammy was the one that had the wife and killed her with insulin. He went back to the mental hospital but broke out. While he was there, he either found or made up the John G character that raped and killed his wife. From that point on, Lenny believed his wife was murdered the night she was raped. Lenny found the guy that raped, not killed, his wife and murdered him, which is the pic where he is bloody and smiling, but after he got his revenge, he forgot. Teddy, the cop that was assigned to Lenny's case, helped Lenny find the first JohnG. After they got the first guy, Teddy gave Lenny the police report from the night his wife was rapped but in order to keep his new story sensible, Lenny took out pages and inked out certain parts that proved him wrong. Lenny went through the process again with help from Teddy on the phone which led him to Jimmy G, Natalie's boyfriend. Teddy wanted to make some money off Jimmy so he set Lenny up to kill Jimmy. But Lenny took Jimmy's clothes. Lenny knew he got his John G, so he needed a new person to track. He remembers that Teddy's name is John Edward Gammel cause Tedd told him b4 he forgot. After Lenny does forget what happened, he finds fact note cards in his pocket and goes to get them tattooed. He also finds Natalie's note in the pocket to Jimmy to meet At the bar so Lenny goes and meets her at the bar. After she found out who Lenny was, the guy with a memory problem that was hanging out with a cop that was gonna bust Jimmy, she used him to her advantage. She was gonna get in trouble cause she didn't have drugs or drug money t give to her and Jimmy's boss, who's name is Dodd. She used Lenny to kill Dodd with that whole scene where she pisses him off so he hits her. Dodd finds Lenny in Jimmy's car and he gets in. Lenny runs, but forgets why. He finds Dodd's information and knows he has to kill him so he goes to his hotel and waits, but he forgets what he was doing and thinks it is his room. Dodd comes homs and Lenny beats his ass and calls the only person he has a phone number, Teddy. Teddy and Lenny kick Kimmy out to town. Since Lenny helped Natalie, she helps him. He gives her the information he wrote down about Teddy the day he killed Jimmy and she gets all of Teddy;s real info, name which is John G and license plate match up so he decides he is going to get his revenge (which to him, he still hasn't found his guy, this will still be the first one).

Who would like to find this new style out himself, reads on only with the next to last paragraph. The special at the film: There is two different story lines, one in color those told the story by the end to backwards and one to black-and-white those told the story from the outset forward, the end of the film is the point where both story lines meets. In order to anticipate the story not too much: It concerns Leonard (Lenny) on the search for the murderer of his wife is, however suffers him after her death an illness: He cannot note facts, therefore he tries to remember again and again with photos and notes Result: A fantastic modern thriller, in which definitely no boredom arises and whose background too obviously is not to be checked up.",Memento

It is quite a suspenseful movie. Afterwards my head was spinning... I think it is important to realize what Teddy said is probably true... In the posts I've read everyone seems to forget that Teddy is the police man that did the report on his case. Even though he used Leanard he did know what happened... and he said that Leanard's wife was raped and that she survived. The men that raped his wife did in fact hit Lenny into the mirror, 'causing his brain damage. The question I am not sure of is... Was there really the man that he investigated with the same memory problem or did Lenny completely fabricate that story?? I tend to believe that Lenny did have a memory problem. I'm not so sure that he lied about that too. Although the point that can confuse me is to say that Lenny thought of the memories he had of his wife being diabetic and him giving her insulin. If he had no memory how could he remember that?? I should see it again to maybe grasp it better. Maybe he made up the story of the other guy with the memory loss and his wife was the diabetic. That is more understandable if you can believe Teddy. It is a given that people used Leanard. Wouldn't he have the memory problem if he was unknowingly being used??  I am such the type to want a definate ending. This movie leaves you pondering for sure. What I didn't like about the film was that it makes you feel sorry for Lenny then realize he is a murderer...

It forces you to go back to view again. MAJOR SPOILERS First - we must understand the facts of the film.  We can argue all we want. People will have their own versions.  But the version below is a correct account of parts of the movie whether you like to believe it or not:Catherine Shelby was raped.  She did not die.  Leonard kills one of the two home invaders.  Yes, there were two of them.  The other one was NOT imaginary. The other bonks Leonard's head - causing Leonard to sustain short-term memory loss and he gets away.   Catherine recovers.  Some time later, Catherine, frustrated by Leonard's memory loss attempts to snap him out of it.  She does this by administering the Insulin test.  Leonard fails the test.  Catherine die via Leonard's hands.  Leonard knows this, but cannot accept that he has killed her.  He must shift the blame to someone else.  He shifts the blame on Sammy Jankis.  Sammy is a REAL person, not imaginary.  Sammy did not have a wife.  Sammy's story is characterizes Leonard's story.  The exception is that Sammy could not learn through condition/repetition.  Leonard can.  In fact, Leonard conditions himself to believe that his wife died in the attack (which she did not).  He conditioned himself to believe that Sammy's wife (who did not exist) died from insulin.  He effectively shifts the act of him killing his wife onto Sammy.  Also, we must understand that while Leonard has memory loss, it is not 100%.  He CAN remember, but only selectively, and it's what he wants to remember.  For example, he can remember the sequence of fact numbers, and he members Burt's name.  Most importantly, he remembers that he himself has memory loss.  This is core and central to the movie.  Folks, you must understand this - Leonard REMEMBERS that he has partial memory loss. Think about it - if he cannot make new memories after the ""incident"" how then does he understands that he has the condition? Make no mistake about it - he remember things selectively.  When come to grips with this movie, you will understand that Leonard is the real villain in the film.  He chooses to remember things he wants to.  He manipulates his memories to distort the facts.  There is no reason to shed any sympathy for him. In the end, this is not a film about who killed who.  This film challenges us to question the validity of our own memories - how memories can be distorted and changed. Sorry if I upset those who disagree.",Memento

The main story is told backwards i.e. you will see a part that covers the period from 2 pm to 4 pm (not that this is actually the case, time is of no importance in this story, it is just an example used by me in an attempt to clarify the way the movie is put together), after which you will see a part covering 1 pm to 2 pm (or actually 2.10 pm because most of the parts overlap). For this main story color film has been used. These colour sections are separated by parts filmed in black and white film. These black and white parts tell another part of the story in ordinary sequential order.Because the main story is told backwards the viewer obviously does not know what caused the events to happen. This puts the audience in the same position as the main character who suffers from short-time memory loss. I find the way Christopher Nolan has achieved this effect is very, very clever. I have to admit that during the first parts I felt a slight irritation because this sequence he chose forces the viewer to keep on thinking about what he sees to put it into the right perspective. But when it occurred to me why he did it I was completely grasped by the story.I hope that we will see many more movies from this very, very promising director.",Memento

Not to say that I am an avid watcher of independent films, it's just that since independent films don't really have a huge financial backing, they have no choice but to focus on things that make up a good film - such as story line, directing, acting, etc. I am happy to say that this film works well under each of these categories.I have never watched a Guy Pearce film before this - although I had heard of him. I knew about Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss from 'The Matrix'. The cast is obviously not the most high profile in the world and it worked well in a way because this way, the audience really doesn't expect a whole lot either. However, every single character played their position perfectly. Guy Pearce plays his confusion riddled role superbly and Joe Pantoliano play his happy-go-lucky role very well as well. Carrie-Anne Moss also has several memorable scenes from the film.However, the thing that is really the biggest reason why anyone should go see this film is because of its storyline and its directing. Shooting the entire film as a series of flashbacks is an odd yet very original and interesting way of making this film. There is no doubt in my mind that that is really what makes the whole film special. If we look back at the overall storyline of the film, we might find it interesting but it will not be as memorable.

However this film isn't your average movie and i have never viewed something which plunges as deep into a persons thoughts and you get a real sense of the 'troubled' human mind and what this can lead to.

Stijn BossinkWell, that is my opinion about the movie Memento, directed by Christopher Nolan in 2000. Like the movie, I also started this review at the end. Right now you might think i'm never going to get myself out of this, but be patient...Get this; somebody breaks in to your home in the middle of the night, he rapes and kills your wife in the bathroom while you are sleeping (let's just say you are her husband...) While trying to save her, you got a hit to the head and you drop to the ground were you lose conscience.This is what happens to a guy named Leonard. From the moment of the accident he has no short term memory anymore. All his knowledge before the accident are crystal clear to him, but he just cant make new memories. Assuming his wife got killed by the bugler, you (as a viewer) start to put some pieces together. During the film you'll see a story told in a unexpected time frame, namely backwards! All the scenes are like little pieces of a puzzle, all presented to you in a random order. To keep up with the story, scenes of Leonard are put in between. These scenes are filmed in black and white to make them recognizable. The story gets more complicated with every scene that follows. While on the other hand, you notice to understand more of the events taking place. This is the kind of movie were your own memory gets tested. Therefore you really get the emotion of the main character, who's trying really hard to remember all of these pieces to his great puzzle of life. Leonard does this by gathering facts, and tattooing these on his own body, so he will never lose his most important notes that will bring him to his wife's murderer.The movie has an interesting way of telling a story. As a viewer you accidentally assume all kinds of facts; about the killer, the hero of the story and his enemies. These fact are proved to be wrong or right as the story continues. Nolan knows how to think out of the box, and he proves this by blending a few complicated story lines into one big puzzle. The movie is filmed in a chronological order, probably to make it easy on the crew. If you are in for a mind wrecking movie night, go to the video rental and get Memento!(now go to the top of the text)",Memento

I liked the story and enjoyed following the character through the mystery as it unravelled before me and him, also being kept as in the dark as he.  But that is my one problem.  I loved it the first time but the second time i watched it i realized it wasnt that great of a movie.  Its even more confusing the second time you see it, because u think that was supposed to happen or this came later but its really before this and the fun is just taken out of it.

Memento has now firmly lodged itself next to Usual Suspects as one of my favourite ""thinking person's"" movie.

Although Memento is highly recommended to see, since is a thriller that will stick you on the screen from the beginning, I dont think is such a very good movie to be listed with the best 250 movies from All times, maybe from year 2000 but not from all times. The movie is the story of a man with short term memory problems in the search of his wife's killer. The movie is divided in two stories: one told backwards and the other not. This way the movie looks a lot more interesting than if it was told straight, but still its just that fact what makes it interesting. Nice movie.

1806,SafeHouse,"Entertaining, intelligent and thoroughly confusing (in a good way)",10,12 July 2002,"Many films created today are made with the intention of satisfying a public who merely wish to be entertained on an entirely superficial basis. CGI and such improvements in technology have opened up a world where the laws of physics simply don't apply. This has lead to what often amount to be, flashy, overly expensive productions, with no real merit. Memento provides the audience the rare treat of giving the grey matter a bit of a work out, and for that I am eternally grateful.I first saw this movie on a wet, Saturday night, at around 1 in the morning and was totally captivated throughout, indeed living around an hour away from the cinema I had time to utterly engross myself in deciphering its immensely confusing, though not entirely complicated plot, and still couldn't sleep that night in the knowledge that I fully understood it. I have since seen it twice more in cinemas, as well as buying the DVD, and still find myself noticing something new on every viewing. You may call me stupid but I believe this is the mark of a wonderful film.Christopher Nolan assembles a noir thriller, based on a short story by his brother, that places you almost entirely in the position of the protagonist. Constructed in reverse, we follow the tale of Leonard Shelby, a man who as a result head injury sustained during an assault on his wife, has no short-term memory. He's looking for his wife's killer, whilst compensating for his disability by taking Polaroid's, annotating them, and having important facts about the killers identity tattooed on his body. Along with a plot twist that left me totally blown away, this film left me feeling intrigued, as well as in awe of the originality of the story we are told.Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss are all superb in their performances, and unlike in many other films where we are presented with actors who very much play individuals, unreliant on the presence of other central characters, these three present us with a unique unit without which this picture would not be possible. Within the mind of Leonard Shelby we are without continuity and it requires those with which we can identify, if only in relation to the passage of time, to allow us to benefit from witnessing the actions Leonard is unable to remember.Memento though, is not without slight inconsistencies but whether or not they are inconsistencies could be discussed eternally. Despite this Memento has a brilliantly devised plot, is wonderfully crafted as well as acted, and leaves the questions unanswered that should have been. One word of warning, if you are of an irritable disposition, do not consider watching this after you have seen it with somebody who has not, I made this mistake and spent the entire film answering questions.
Ironically perhaps the best way for a film to make money is to combine a story so confusing and yet thoroughly entertaining, the audience is forced to see it numerous times in order to fully understand it. Apparently, from its success this may have been the case, though that is cynic inside me talking.",Memento

There were many beautiful moments, especially when they started to reveal HOW he actually goes from knowing what's going on, to having absolutely no idea.

In some ways was used since the first movies developed on Agatha Christie's mysteries, when the detectives, after investigating, explained how things happened to the audience and the idea has been used several times in other thriller movies i've seen, even though not so extensively as in ""Memento"". After the first 30 minutes i thought that it was going to be one of those surprising movies like ""The Sixth Sense"", but then i got a bit bored with its routine.

Actually no, i was disgusted.  This film, however clever and witty it is, does not live up to this ranking.  I am a huge fan of the film The Usual Suspects, and was disappointed to find that this film also ranked first place under the category of thriller.  Right above The Usual Suspects.  Memento is a very clever film, yet it does not create the pull that a thriller needs because it takes so long to tell what is happening.  In other words, the movie goes by kind of slowly.  Another mute point that caught my attention was the ending.  Although it left the viewer with something to think about, it didn't give you the "" oh-my gosh-that's-fricken-cool"" feel that a thriller is supposed to leave you with.  To see a truly classic example of a real thriller, you need to see The Usual Suspects.  I do, however, recommend this film.  It uses a unique backwards storyline that makes it very interesting to watch.  Guy Pearce does an excellent job playing a character who cannot produce new memories, and Joe P. delivers his always entertaining performance.  Although it doesn't deserve the great praise up to the point of #9, I do believe that this film is worth any thriller-buffs time.",Memento

It's not a bad movie, but knowing the ending and story takes all of the suspense and questions of the movie. A counterexample would be Fight Club, where the ending adds a real twist to the whole movie but dosen't spoil it for the next time you view it, you just view it with different eyes, as Fight Club has more to offer than the ending.Some SPOILERS are ahead due to the nature of the movie. I don't think they will spoil the movie totally for you, but they might lower your expectations towards this movie, and you might even decide not to spend money or precious time on it :The movie is told backwards, so the viewer has no memory of what happened ""before"", like the protagonist. The plot has (in retrospect) some holes that don't get filled, mostly regarding Dodd, a seemingly key figure, who in the end is completely insubstantial.I expected a murder mystery movie bordering towards a film noir, but except for the explanation at the films end (and thus, at the beginning of the story), the story is completely banal. The story is climatic towards the end of the movie, but the end dosen't live up to the suspense that was built up during the movie.As Leonard has conditioned himself to operate on a few promises, he reacts to every situation in the same manner, which makes many scenes repetitive. Partly, this is necessary to demonstrate how he ticks, partly this is entertaining as the viewer already knows how Leonard will react in a scene, but the whole concept is stretched too long like a running gag repeated some times too often.

It's also given in reverse chronological order which lead to mini climaxes at the end of each segment, as the viewer is realizing how the previous scene came to be.Guy Pierce's performance is one of the best ever in my opinion. I give the highest scores to performances that deliver humor and wit in a serious background, such as Christian Bale in American Psycho and Ray Liotta in Goodfellas. His facial maneurisms and tone-of-voice perfectly reflect the ""laugh at his handicap"" that the director intended. So funny.

The director who made this movie didn't have the benefit of a huge studio with lots of money to promote it that so many other movies that basically suck do.

You make these judgments based on past experiences. These past experiences are brought into the equation by your memory. At least you have your memory, that will save your sanity because your memories are realaren't they?I believe learning of a film through reviews and comments, such as this one, helps convince people to go watch a film.

It is the story of a man, Lenny, who has lost the ability to make new memories.  This unusual medical condition, short-term memory loss, was obtained on the night of Lenny's wife's rape and murder when he attempted to save her from her attackers. The camera follows as Lenny attempts to track down his wife's killer using a very organized system of notes and polaroid photographs, and a few seemingly helpful persons.  If Lenny needs to remember something, such as where his hotel is located, or who someone is, he takes a picture and writes notes on the back.  This system is quite effective, but does not aid Lenny's ability to distinguish the time events occur, or specific details related to particular people.The movie opens with Lenny killing a man in what appears to be a revenge killing.  Soon we realize that this is the end of the film, and that the movie will work backwards as many movies do.  However, this film is quite different.  Instead of giving large portions of the story at once, it tells the story as though the viewer is Lenny himself, providing the events as a person with no short term memory would perceive them; very short and choppy. While this is going on, the director also implements the use of black and white film to incorporate  the opposite end of the plot.  In the end, the two come together to form a conclusion that made me press rewind and watch the movie two more times the same day.Hands down, this is the best film of the year, in any genre.  Regardless of what type of movies you watch, what actors you like, or whatever, you will find yourself loving every second of this movie (if the choppy, fast paced plot doesn't p*** you off first).

This film is like nothing you've ever seen before what with the story being told backwards. It took about half an hour to get into it and to drop the confusion level but after that I couldn't and didn't want to leave the screen!You first look at this like some good and bad struggle, right away the movie tells you not to trust Teddy, so you don't. Then Natalie turns out to be quite the witch so don't trust her, but the one you always trust is Lenny. So the ending catches you by total surprise and leaves you gobsmacked. I mean, I can often predict endings in films but that I did not see coming!
Great job by Guy Pearce, he sure has come a long way since Neighbours! Joe Pantoliano has a great way of never gaining my trust, I mean he acts well, but I never trust the characters he's portraying. Carrie also does a great job at going from a helpful co-sufferer, to an angry and exploiting b***c, or did I get that backwards?!A must see!  9/10",Memento

If you look wider and deeper you will become more aware of both the psychology of the participant and the society around him.* No gimmicky effects, as most would like you to believe - Just a true representation of the way the main participant sees life.* Due credit should also be given for an original idea.

This movie is told backwards,(like that old Seinfeld episode)and the story-telling is so original and inventive that the plot, and plot twists, only work once. That's right, no sequels for Memento. This may upset some, but I am glad that this story will remain untouched and unspoiled. Give it up for Christopher Nolan, the writer/director for stumbling upon such a great gimmick.

The narrative structure - totally flawless... I could go on - In fact there is not one aspect of this film that I don't like.I first saw this movie a couple of months ago when I purchased it on DVD and after the first viewing I knew I loved the film but I was not quite sure and since then I must have watched the film ten times (a couple of times with the special feature on the DVD) and each time I see or hear something new that adds to the puzzle and the resolution of it. On the topic of resolution I have searched the web and read a few interesting comments on exactly who Leonard is and who is telling the truth in the movie and Chris Nolan (director) has said all things tie together on close viewing.For the critics out there, sure there are some holes in the plot; for example, if Leonard cannot remember anything since his attack how can he remember he has a condition? he often states this in the movie without reference to his 'memory aids' and I am sure there are many more 'flaws' but to highlight these is pointless as even the flaws add to the puzzle in this movie, as they force you to think your way through the movie and not just sit a eat popcorn.Overall this is the best film I have seen in a long time and being a DVD/Movie nut - I have seen a quite a few!

Furthermore, the plot is grisly.  A person with the protagonist's problem could be pursuing an entirely different quest.

Not only is the main narration told backwards, it is also interspersed with black and white clips from a sequence which is told in correct chronological order and turns out to be the beginning of the main narration. Or its end, depending on how you wanna look at it. In short, two storylines are told simultaneously, one of them backwards, the other one not and in the end they are connected at the beginning of the one told backwards and the end of the other one. Pheew. This is what you are going to have to keep in mind if you are interested in understanding what the hell is going on, you are going to have to memorize the scenes and put them into the right order in your mind.SPOILERS AHEAD
This structure alone would be sufficient to make ""Memento"" one of the most innovative and clever films of the last ten years. But Mr Nolan not only gives us an interesting puzzle (is he the killer? If not, who is the killer? Why did he kill him? And who the hell is this anyway?) that is solved in the last scene. He uses the structure to put the audience - without its knowledge - right into the head of a handicapped man who's whole mission is hopeless from the very beginning. But he does not know that, and neither does the viewer until the very last scene which makes the entire pointlessness of his actions painfully apparent: His entire life is a ballgame since ""the incident"". He is the ball. To all the people around him he is just a useful retard they can play with like a marionette. Yet he does not realize this, and Christopher Nolan's great merit is it to keep the viewer from knowing that until the very end.That is why the ending comes as such a big twist. It is just on account of the outstandingly clever directing. I mean, it should be obvious the second you hear about it: a guy who can't remember a thing ten minutes after he has killed someone wants to investigate the murder of his wife, give me a break. Everyone else in the film knows this, and that is exactly why everyone is using him, including himself. And when the viewer finally gets to realize this, it is a definite jawdropper, as if oneself had been the retard the for last 100 minutes and is just waking up.As for the other aspects for the film, the editing is very good and adds a lot to the atmosphere, as does a great score. Guy Pearce is even better than in LA Confidential. I liked the contrast of the color with the very beautiful black and white cinematography. Watch out for the moment when both storylines connect and color streams into the black and white picture!Maybe one of the best, definitely an extremely clever movie worth watching three or more times.Fact 1: You cannot believe those liars who were bored by this film.

Anyone who finds this film boring or confusing simply has not taken the time to gain a full understanding of everything the Nolan brothers packed into this gem. Personally, I was won over by the end of its fascinating (and ultimately symbolic) opening scene, but if you feel a little let down after your first viewing, do yourself a favor and watch it again.After you've watched it at least twice, I recommend watching it a couple more times so you can catch the tiny visual clues that really solidify your understanding of the truth.  In particular, watch VERY closely during these two scenes: 1) Sammy Jankis sitting in his chair in the old folks home, 2) the final flashbacks that occur as Lenny is driving to the tattoo parlor at the end of the movie. You might also notice that some of Lenny's mannerisms and lines cleverly refer to his past habits.

What then happened, it proved actually that my theory about British directors have stile, been wrong. That was when I saw Memento At first, I found it unusual that the film begins extremely violent, do even the most controversial films ever made, like Cannibal Holocaust, or (what's more possible that this film is a copy of that movie) Pulp Fiction, don't begin by killing people, by showing how they die. Its true that's a shock for the audience and that they will stay to see the movie, but the next move, was so unprofessional, like he did never get a video camera in his hands. He broke the main rule, of every filmmaker that ever broke a rule. He tortured the audience by showing too many flashbacks. The rule, of every film is not to do a same thing more then 3 times or 7 times but not at once. Even if you look at Pulp fiction, it's got not less then 7, yeah, seven my friends, seven! Memento's got 22 jumps. A man, a normal human, looses every wish to see a thing if you have repeated something more then 11 times. I'm somehow surprised that it became a success. I have nothing against the actors, because Nolan chooses quite well actors. What I'm really mad, are the characters In every Nolan movie! The characters are mean, evil, stupid I mean, you don't have to think in Nolan's movies, they tell you anything at the end, so you have to just watch the end, cause anything else it for throwing away: the horrible music, poor characters and no style directing, only some trademarks, but nothing else. But let's go back to Memento You may have notice that the characters are changing, but from good up to evil. This lends realism, that's for sure, but it does not automatically made a great feature. Some of you would probably say that a man gets rotten, because the society wont help him with his problem, but that's not the case in Memento. Leo's the guy who actually killed the only person, who was ever kind to him, and understood his problem, Teddy, what makes Leonard a guy, who doesn't want any help from anyone which turns his character not into a anti hero, but more a antagonist: he has no purpose, he doesn't want any help, he loves nobody a villain. Finally, some of you might think that I'm only writhing bad reviews all the time, but true's that I love much worse movies and writhe reviews that show how charming films are. I even see something positive in Michael Bays films, but this film doesn't have a place at IMDb top 250.I'll give this film a rating 5.6 out-ha 10.0, cause I still think that the idea to have a whole film going backwards nice.

1873,michaelpaulcolo,A movie to 'remember',10,6 July 2002,"Wow! ""Memento"" is one the best films I've seen in a long time. Only a couple of small inconsistencies stop me from considering it a masterpiece. It is however, the type of film that makes you think and pay attention as you watch. If you like to just sit back and relax while the movie pleasantly and neatly unfolds from beginning to end and everyone lives happily ever after, this one may not be for you. The gist: Leonard Shelby wakes up, looks around, and realizes he's in a motel room. But for how long? Could be a day, a week, he's not sure. Sounds like a really bad hangover, huh? Actually, he suffers from memory loss. Not the typical amnesia you've seen in about a hundred previous movies. Instead of not knowing his past or who he is, Leonard has exactly the opposite problem. He can remember everything in his life up to 'the incident'. But now, due to his 'condition', he can't make any new memories. He can only remember things for a few minutes and then it fades away. Interesting concept. To function in society, he must write important things down and take Polaroid pictures of people and places in order to 'remember' them later. Really important facts he tattoos all over his body. Early in the film, we find that Leonard's driving force is to hunt down the person responsible for wrecking his life. A monumental task considering he can't remember people or know whom he can trust.An interesting aspect of this movie is that is viewed in reverse. It starts with the last chronological scene and works it's way, scene by scene, backward to 'the incident'. This, no doubt, contributes to the confusion some people have expressed. In my opinion, Christopher Nolan makes it work quite well. It is arguably the only way to shoot a plot of this nature. If it moves along chronologically, the audience knows (and remembers) everything that happens while poor Leonard forgets everything after a few minutes and looks like an idiot. The other effect that the reverse chronology had on me was that after viewing the film, I immediately wanted to see it again. How often can you say that about a movie? The desire to watch a particular movie more than once is the reason we buy them anyway, right?There are no mega star actors, no acclaimed director, no multi-million dollar special effects, and was shot in 25 days. But it is an exceptional film due to excellent directing, acting and thought provoking original plot. Hollywood should take a good look at this and consider overhauling their usual cookie cutter movie-making machine.The plot wasn't logically perfect and there was one piece of the puzzle that didn't neatly fit (I can't elaborate without giving spoilers), but it was altogether too good to nitpick. If you like to be challenged a bit by a movie as opposed to being lulled to sleep, this one's definitely a 'Must See'.",Memento

It is a movie unlike any I have ever seen; for instance, chronologically Memento begins at the end, and ends in the middle, while during the movie the plot jumps back and forth between the present and the past.  The central character of the movie, Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce), is in every scene.  It is Pearce's depiction of a man uncapable of forming new memories ever since his wife's death that carries the whole movie.

1884,rorinh,A thought-provoking film with interesting aspects.,7,3 November 2010,"Memento Critique I watched this film in my ""Writing about literature"" class in two segments on two different days. As Memento is such a choppy backwards/forwards sort of film, it was incredibly difficult to follow. The film made it easy for me to get lost and confused, especially watching it in two separate sections. I think to understand it fully you need to watch it two or even three times. The film was deep. It showed an intense vision into the human psyche. It was suspenseful in that, you are waiting for the end (or in this case, the beginning) to fully realize what is happening. There are quite a few readers on IMDb who think the backwards theme for films such as these are cliché however, I think it fit well. Watching it in succession, of course you would know the end from the beginning and though understandable, it wouldn't be as thrilling. Having the film move in this order made it stimulating. I liked it very much, but also personally, tend to like movies which move backwards to bring the mystery to the beginning.There were several things I found which were interesting within the film. Everyone seems to take advantage of Leonard and his short-term memory. Particularly, Natalie with, ""I can talk about whoever the f*** I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a f***ing whore and we can still be friends!""  ""I'm gonna use you, you stupid f***. I'm telling you now because I'll enjoy it more if I know that you could stop me if you weren't a freak."" She then proceeds in a few minutes to exit and re-enter knowing Leonard won't know what she said. Another instance where she messes with him is when he gets to her bar where she bar-tends at. She spits in his cup and he watches her do so. But with his condition, Leonard doesn't remember and with a slam of the cup he's nothing the wiser. He drinks the beer and she decides he isn't lying about his condition. Leonard is taken for the fool again with his landlord Burt. He lies to him about how he rented a second room and must pay for that room as well as the first. Leonard realizes it didn't happen and Burt fesses up but still had the attempt at getting his hands on more of his money. Teddy attempts at lying just a bit with the line, ""You know, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep telling the same jokes."" With a condition like Leonard's lack of short term memory, it is simple for even his so-called 'friends' to trick him.Another thing I found quite interesting was how everyone seems to know when he 'forgets' what he has been told. For example, when Natalie has the fight with Leonard and he punches her, she takes all the pens so he can't write down what she said about his wife, and she walks out to the car. She waits for several minutes and comes back inside, slamming the door behind her. That slam seemed to jog his forgetfulness into existence and he immediately no longer remembers what he was trying to not forget. Also with the mug she smashed down on the bar table, it seemed to snap him out of his previous state and after that, he has a clean slate. Also when he is driving from the 'first' killing – he screeches his breaks and forgets what he just wrote about Teddy. It appears as though a bang or crash makes him forget and that no particular amount of time is what it takes.And additional interesting aspect to the film was the things he did to keep 'sane' or remember his events. He tattooed himself with certain facts he MUST remember ""JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE"" and ""FACT 6. CAR LICENSE NUMBER: SG13 7IU"". He takes photographs of each person he meets who he gets to know personally and puts them in his pocket. He creates a map of where he has been and where he needs to go with more photos of places. He also makes up his own reality when he writes on the photos – sometimes lying to himself on purpose. I find it difficult after watching not to speculate on what will happen next. After Teddy is killed, and once you know he isn't the real murderer what happens? What can we speculate about Leonard? Can we perhaps wonder whether he will continue his search and continue to choose to forget what has happened? And how will he understand if he wakes up in the morning, forgotten what he has done, and still has tattoos of Teddy's license plate on his leg? This criminally implicates him, obviously. We read the story the film was based on as well in class and found he previously escaped from a mental institution. Will he only escape again: to commit more murder? Teddy was really the only person who knew who he was and now he has no one helping him decipher the clues and where to go now. Will he always be searching? Memento, whether you loved it or hated it, was nothing short of a very thought-provoking film. And you couldn't guess what happened at the end of the film (beginning of the story) which is how a good suspense film should be. Though confused, I was a huge fan and I think everyone should at least give this film a chance.",Memento

1890,Marrissey,Some films are best forgotten.,7,22 January 2003,"For some reason, and I can never work out why, some films just seem to cast a veil over the viewers' eyes. Take the Sixth Sense, a distinctly mediocre film, with a tenuous and inconsistent twist thrown in at the end, and resultantly worshiped with an astonishingly devout following. Sadly, I must make the same comment about this supposed ""modern classic"". Yes, the film goes backwards - but rather than being the stylish and clever representation of the lead character's memory recollection, this stands out as a cheap trick that ultimately masks a simple and rather stale plot that would never come off in a film shot in the conventional fashion. While I cannot discredit Christopher Nolan for using such a cheap trick, since it has worked so effectively, I find it disappointing that gimmicks still equal box office success and acclaim.So what would be so bad about ""Memento"" if it ran in a simple and straightforward order? Well, for a start, the acting is distinctly mediocre, with every single character seemingly exuding as little charisma as possible. Guy Pearce plays a fairly straight lead role, in a film which probably afforded more acting than Pearce provided, however his performance is passable, but not particularly laudable. Carrie-Anne Moss displays a similar mediocre style, with little really to draw the viewer in. For me, Joe Pantoliano's character provides the only real intrigue, seeming a bit of an enigma, as the viewer puzzles over what the truth really is, con-man or comrade?There can be no doubt ""Memento""'s concept is absolutely superb, but it is the execution which holds the most serious problem for the film. The lead character's life holds little interest, and when the alleged truth is finally unveiled, it left me amazingly under whelmed. Essentially, a story that could be explained in a sentence, is dragged out to 113 minutes. While many seem to believe that the plot itself is what ""messes with your head"", it is transparent that the order change and fractionality is all that really perplexes the viewer, and left me feeling cheated out of a concept that could have been put to much better use. The memory loss idea is fairly consistently executed, and for this the film must be praised. Indeed, pulling off a man who can remember nothing must have been a real challenge for Pearce, however a bit more emotion would have been nice, and a little less of the suave!It would be hard for me to entirely damn this movie, since the concept itself holds such intrigue. However, I find it hard to fully praise a film that owes its success to a singular idea. Yes, it's entertaining, but not nearly as good or as complicated as some would like you to believe. Indeed, I wouldn't be surprised if the normal order feature on the DVD release makes for far more boring viewing.7/10 (on the value of the idea alone).",Memento

1896,suicidedd,Not for the stupid,10,17 March 2003,"Memento is quite simply the best thriller of all time. This is a completely original backwards thriller with outstanding performances from its entire cast and a screenplay that is unmatched by any other movie in history. I wanted Memento to keep going for as long as possible, to keep revealing pieces of its intricate puzzle. More important than anything I've just said is this: GO SEE THIS MOVIE!Note: This is a very difficult movie to review without making it a spoiler, but there is nothing in the following review that will ruin the movie for anyone who has not yet seen it.I had no idea of what this movie was going to be like when I walked into the theatre, but I was hooked from beginning to end. First, the performances by Matrix veterans Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are masterful. Their characters play the audience just like they play Leonard, and that is what makes them so compelling. Pantoliano especially shines here in a performance similar to some of Joe Pesci's academy award caliber work. But the real prize goes to Guy Pearce who really puts himself on the map with a surprisingly sympathetic performance as a man out to get revenge for the murder of his wife. Pearce should have been recognized after his performance in the critically acclaimed L.A. Confidential, but he still remained in the dark due to the box office mediocrity of that film. Here we get to see his true potential in a role that should at least nab him a best actor Oscar nomination if not a win.Additional praise MUST be given to Christopher Nolan who both wrote and directed this film, which was spawned from a short story written by his brother, Jonathan Nolan. Christopher's first film, a black and white piece called `The Following' (another must see film), displayed that he was a director with infinite potential. With Memento Nolan not only shows that he is for real, but also establishes himself as one of the premiere screenwriters and directors of the new generation.We see Nolan's effect from the first scene of the movie: a brilliant shot of a Polaroid fading instead of developing. But this is just a taste of things to come in this backwards movie. After it is completely faded, the picture pops back into Leonard's camera and the entire opening scene plays backwards ending with Leonard shooting Teddy in the head. Throughout the rest of the movie, Nolan uses his color scenes to represent elements starting from the `end' and going backwards in time and he uses black and white to start at the `beginning' and go forward in time. Confused yet? Well, if that's not enough, the black and white scenes and the color scenes actually merge into one in the end of the movie so the final scene can finally piece together this intriguing and complex puzzle. Additionally, the color scenes overlap with each other and we have more and more revealed to us with each scene. This is technically the opposite of Leonard's experience, yet at the same times it allows us to feel exactly how Leonard feels because we are slowly given information until the end when everything comes together.I realize that what I said above may have been more than confusing, but that is how this movie plays out. Most viewers will need to see it at least twice to get the full experience of what Memento has to offer, and most viewers will also want to watch it a third, fourth, fifth, etc. time. This movie truly gets better with each viewing because you pick up new elements along the way each time. Personally, I picked up more on the `Sammy Jenkis' story. Sammy was a man that Leonard liked to talk about because also had a short-term memory problem. I did not fully understand the meaning behind this story until I saw it my second time, but Sammy Jenkis is just the tip of the iceberg. You won't be disappointed in the least bit unless you only see this movie once.",Memento

1899,theagea,narrative form in the fantastic movie 'memento',10,2 June 2010,"In 'Memento' Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) suffers from memory loss since the murder on his wife. He cannot make any new memories after this event, where he was also injured. Throughout the movie he tries to find the man who raped and murdered his wife, but because of his memory loss he has to make notes, Polaroids and tattoos of all the information he gains. The syuzhet of the movie is quite incomprehensible, because there are two story lines on the same story. One storyline is chronological and shown in black and white; the other storyline is narrated from the back to the beginning.Firstly, Christopher Nolan succeeds very well in narrating the story in a convincing manner and he has tried to make the viewer experience everything like Leonard does. The viewer does not know anything more than Leonard: we only see what he does and the information he gets but we do not know the actual truth about the murderer of his wife where Leonard is looking for. Leonard's life is very unsecure: he has to do things and trust people without knowing whether it's the right thing to do. His life depends on the notes he makes, although these might be unreliable. Another way in which Nolan has made the movie very convincing is by using the perspective of Leonard: you can hear his thoughts and he is present throughout the whole movie: Leonard's actions are followed the entire time. By hearing his thoughts you can imagine how confused Leonard is after every time he loses his memory. Nolan did a great job in not being afraid to repeat certain parts. Usually this can become very annoying, while in this particular movie the repetitions make the movie more convincing and easier to understand how Leonard must have felt. Every morning Leonard has to remember himself that he has memory loss and what his goal is: he reads his notes, asks himself questions and looks at his tattoos.The movie Memento starts with the murder on a man, but you don't know who this man is and what is happening. This immediately gives the confusing effect that Nolan intends to create, because it makes you wonder about how and why this happened. This will become clearer later on in the story, because the fabula is told backwards. In every scene you will get more information about the life of Leonard and on the murder of his wife. This makes the viewer very curious, because you really want to know more. One of the advantages of the movie is that the concept of memory loss and the narrative form (which is telling the story in reverse order) works really well as a combination. Due to the reverse order you are not wondering about what will happen next, but what has happened before, which is exactly how Leonard always thinks. In this way, you can really empathize with him and look at the story through his eyes. This was one of the reasons why we really liked this movie since the plot really involves you in the story and it does not get boring. Also, the movie has an open end so you can think up your own ideas of what actually happened since you cannot be sure who is telling the truth. However, if you want to understand (almost) the entire story you should watch Memento several times since one time will not be enough to do so.Another thing that has been very well done in this particular movie is the fact that although the concept of a guy with memory loss whose wife is murdered is in fact rather serious and dramatic, there are some humorous parts in the movie as well. Leonard wakes up in awkward situations without knowing what he was doing, for example in the scene where he is being chased but thinks that he is chasing someone himself. In these scenes you hear Leonard's confused thoughts, which makes the movie a little less serious. So Christopher Nolan has tried to make the movie a little bit more lighthearted and not too heavy, which has worked out quite well.And finally, not only the director did a great job while directing this movie, but he also chose the right cast. The actors definitely showed that they are very talented. Guy Pearce showed some great acting skills while representing the role of Leonard, because he has to act like he forgets everything and does this in a very convincing way. Lots of people recommend this movie and say that it is one of Guy Pearce's best movies, and we definitely agree with that since he really did a great job and it is a fascinating movie.Memento is a very impressive movie and you will remember it because it is a very original way of telling a story. Furthermore, it reminds you of how precious memories actually are and how hard it is to not know which people you can trust. Memento is not a movie where you can relax while watching and which you will forget after wards.

However, the night his wife was murdered he sustained an injury to the head. This injury caused anterograde amnesia, more commonly known as short term memory loss. He remembers who he is, in fact he remembers everything up to the night when he became handicapped. The problem is that he cannot create NEW memories - after only about ten minutes his memory fades. This means that if he is in a conversation for too long he forgets how it started, if he is given directions to a destination he will forget them very soon, and everybody he meets he forgets. Leonard takes Polaroid photographs of places and people he comes into contact with and writes information about them on the Polaroid, and the really important facts he tattoos onto his body.The real genius of this movie is the storytelling technique. It is told in a non-linear storyline. It shows the last chapter in the story first, then it goes back and shows the previous chapter. You are notified of the change by short black-and-white scenes in which Leonard is talking on the phone to an anonymous person. This backwards technique fits perfectly with Leonard's condition - he doesn't know what happened in the last chapter and neither do you. When Leonard looks at a Polaroid or at one of the tattoos on his body you are also shown, meaning that at no point do you know more or less than Leonard about what happened earlier. This film starts with the revenge killing, and works backwards to show us the preceding events.Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix) plays a woman who appears to be a friend to Leonard, but Leonard's only source on her character are the notes that he doesn't remember taking. Joe Pantoliano is excellent as Teddy, a police officer who could be untrustworthy.All of the acting is fantastic, and i'm sure 90% of the people who have seen this film are equally amazed as to how Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Inception) wasn't awarded the Oscar for best director or best original screenplay. This was Nolan's second full length film, and in my view, his best. In conclusion - hunt out this film the way Leonard hunts out his wife's killer, and watch it. It is slightly confusing, and you may have questions at the end, but it is worth it. Personally i have not been able to get this fantastic piece of cinema out of my head for weeks. This movie is simply brilliant.",Memento

1902,swankej,Not the most terrible but far from good.,4,31 October 2010,"Watch this movie only if you absolutely have nothing better to do for two hours. The storyline contains an interesting idea but is portrayed in a boring predictable manner. The characters are as dull as the writing. I found it near impossible to relate to any of the characters as they are flat and emotionless, it felt like I wasn't even watching real people. I was disappointed in Guy Pearce's performance and a little surprised that Joe Pantoliano's character was the best part of this movie but it was not enough to make it a good film. I feel like the movie had to run in reverse otherwise it wouldn't be worth watching at all. The stability of the plot is constantly contradicting its self and is at times way over complicated. The flashbacks and narration really seem to distract from the story, not that it's that believable anyway with its lack of continuity. Since the events play out in reverse you already know what is going to happen and that completely eliminates any suspense. I believe with a better script and character development this movie could have been a lot better. I personally enjoyed the short story much better and wish the movie was more like the that. Definitely read the short story.",Memento
1903,kylemyle728,Overview and analysis behind the shocking plot.,10,1 November 2010,"During the movie ""Memento,"" the audience is left guessing throughout the whole movie until the very end. It has a unique style of presenting the plot in which the movie begins with a scene and then it plays backwards from there. While the movie jumps backwards scene by scene, there is also a transition played in black and white that is continuously playing forwards until a certain point. It is not until the very end of the movie where the scenes played in color meet with the ones played in black and white. This is where the climax of the movie occurs and all the revelations of each characters role are revealed. It is a must see and you will not regret it.In the end of the movie we find out that the main character Lenny, who suffers from short term memory loss, has been tricked by his so called friend Teddy, into killing a drug dealer. Throughout the whole movie Lenny is on a quest to kill the murderer of his wife, who is in fact Lenny himself. Lenny gets the identity of himself and a man named Sammy Jenkis confused and we find out that Lenny is in fact Sammy. It leads us to believe that Lenny has used his brain condition to illicit forgetting what really happened to his wife to clear himself of shame and anger. This caused him to create Sammy Jenkis and allows him to believe that the ones who assaulted his wife and gave him the brain condition were the ones who supposedly killed his wife. We find out that Teddy, who is a local cop, has already helped Lenny kill the man who assaulted his wife. Yet Lenny forgot all about it and Teddy kept the proof and then used Lenny for his own benefit to kill a drug dealer for money. Once Lenny figures this out in the end of the movie he decides to burn all the evidence and leaves himself a clue that indicates Teddy is in fact the one who killed his wife. Lenny then leaves the scene reminding himself that he is still alive and then as fast as it was all revealed it is then forgotten. This leads us back into the rest of the movie in which we had already seen in reverse order.When the movie is over the audience is left shocked and slightly confused about how to view Lenny. He acts as if he is an innocent man who has now become a conscious free murderer. He forgets everything he doesn't write down but he is the one choosing to leave out the facts that he finds out on multiple occasions that he is in fact a murderer for pleasure. It started as pay back but for someone who forgets the feeling so easily and has no direction to his life, why not make it a hobby. It's odd to think about that he is spending all his effort searching for his wife's killer when in reality it is Lenny he is looking for. He takes the lives of others to free him of guilt which in the end makes him more of a villain than the movies hero.",Memento

I need it to watch ""memento"" 3 times to puzzle out all the small things in this movie. Main character of the movie is fashionably looking Leonard. He is chasing the guy that killed his wife. The only thing that really gets in his way of looking the murderer, is that he's having short term memory loss. It means that Leonard is forgetting everything he done in a last couple of hours. So he uses all sorts of pictures, notes and tattoos to help himself. Offcourse its much easier to manipulate that kind of guy... The main thing that makes this movie epic is that it has 2 story lines. One of them ( that is in black and white) is telling normally, but the another is telling backwards. It means that things u will see later in the movie have happened before the thing u saw in the beginning. Director Christopher Nolan have tried to do something like that in the movie ""The prestige"". So in the end of the movie two story lines are combining into one event that explains all the movie. In my opinion Memento is a great movie whit good acting and directing.

Leonard, the main character, loses his short term memory after attempting to save his wife when she is being raped and murdered in their bathroom by two men. One, Leonard shoots then and there, but the other, John G, gets away. Leonard spends the movie trying to find John G and kill him. This is extremely difficult as he has no short term memory which means he can't remember anything he's done between the incident in the bathroom and now. He even forgets things that happened 10 seconds ago sometimes. The alternating scenes between forward and backwards chronologically gives the viewer the same perspective as Leonard giving us surprises around every corner. Memento is a MUST see.

The history is so fantastic and the format of the movie is so audacious that i became a real fan, bought the movie and watched it every day for like two weeks.Nolan talks to us in the movie through the little details. The space in Lenny's chest is one that becomes interesting in, at least, three different moments: when he shows it to Natalie at her place, when he sees himself pointing at it in a Polaroid picture and in the end, when he remembers his wife while going to the tattoo shop. In this last scene, the space appears filled with the message ""I've done it"". I believe this blank space summarizes his pointless odyssey, I mean: it will always be blank, although he knows, deep inside, that it should be filled with that message. It is a proof that he won't stop.The way Lenny feels his hand aching as he speaks to Natalie (after beating her), the way all people use him to their own purposes, the little details that prove that Sammy Jankins' history is his own (the scene with a needle that flashes his mind as he lays on Natalie's sofa and the talking with Teddy in the end/beginning), his deepest reflections about his condition (""How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time?"" or ""I can't remember to forget you""), all those elements are the ingredients for this real masterpiece.

1914,mara-bravo,memento review,10,1 June 2011,"When 'Memento' first released in 2000, there was an immediate hype around the movie. The movie wasn't just popular because of the quality of the movie, but especially because it was a film that was different from all the other films. Memento is film that is based on a character called Leonard Shelby (which is played by Guy Pearce), who used to earn his money as a detective for an insurance company. He can't do this anymore since he got a strange form of amnesia when his wife was murdered. He remembers everything from before the murder of his wife, but now he can't remember everything longer than 15 minutes. Every 15 minutes he wakes up again, without knowing where he is and why. He does know about his own condition and so he tries to deal with it. Because of his condition he isn't really able to find the murderer of his wife, but he still tries. To help him in this quest he has tattoos all over his body, which contain hints and clues.The thing that makes 'Memento' so special is the structure of the movie. Nolan tells the story backwards in which he starts with Leonard dealing with the murderer of his wife (Joe Pantoliana). Then the story is flashed back to the beginning. This is done in segments of about ten minutes. In between these segments, there are also the black-and-white sequences in which Leonard is seen in his motel room having a conversation, with god-knows-who, and telling a story about the past when he still worked for the insurance company. These sequences are chronological.The most thrilling thing about this movie is the fact that you don't have a clue of what is going on until the movie is finished. This gives the viewer a lot of suspense and tension while watching and also makes it more ambiguous than watching an ordinary thriller. If you aren't a patient person and you don't like to pay a lot of attention while watching a movie this is not the right movie for you. The fact that Leonard had a form of amnesia makes him forget everything he has done. Each scene starts with the last part of the previous scene so you see some parts of the movie double. The fact that this is repeated is crucial though because it helps you understand the movie a lot better. This movie is very interesting and well put together. The order of the movie is very confusing but it interacts with the audience a lot. The viewers really need to ''puzzle'' all the scenes of the movie to form a coherent storyline. We thought the movie was very confusing at first but when the movie ended everything fell into place. After the movie is done you will be still confused for what happened earlier but also surprised. Guy Pierce did a wonderful acting job and you will be dragged into the movie as soon as he starts his story. The plot is very simple but the fact that the chronological order very different compared to other movies makes the movie that challenging. We came to the conclusion this movie is not made for people who just want to have relaxing evening and watch a movie without really paying attention. This movie will confuse you and make you an investigator. We did find this amusing and very interesting to watch but we would understand why people wouldn't like this movie. People who enjoy challenging movies should definitely watch memento. This movie was well developed, had some wonderful performances, a clever structure and is very original.",Memento

A scene shows Leonard's wife rubbing his ""I've done it"" tattoo but where is it when Natalie and Leonard look at the mirror when they are reading Leonard's backwards tattoo. Its a good movie but it fell apart for me when i figured out the hole. Because if Leonard would of saw his ""I've done it"" tattoo at the start of the movie, he would need no reason to find that burglar because he would seen on his chest that he has killed him!

I had to watch Memento several times to understand what was going on in the movie. The story plot is intriguing and complicated. Yet, there is a pattern to it once you get a hold of it. I personally think that it adds immense depth to the movie. The greatest thing about this movie is that each time you watch it, you always get a different meaning out of it. Ever since I have seen this movie, I have shown it to my friends, and all of them enjoyed seeing this. I often find myself watching this movie when I am sad or caught up with stressful things that happened recently. The premise of this movie is that main character, otherwise seeming ordinary, has this ""condition"" where he cannot make a new memory since his accident. But the movie is about more than that. It's hard not to reflect ourselves while watching the character struggles to grasp the truth and to find who killed his wife. Memento is also about moving on from the painful past and letting things go, which are two of hardest tasks we ordinarily go through each day. The wall between our memory and imagination is, in fact, very thin. Director Nolan does an excellent job in portraying that small wall, and suggesting that we all have this power and will when it comes to our own memory. Our memory is fragile and uncertain, yet it still exists in a certain form. Memento shows how we have this beautiful ability to recall and recreate the past events. Such creative power defines us as human, and as a result of that, a sequence of events turn into a journey of ultimate truth. What he finds at the end of this movie might be something that we are all seeking for in life. When you are uncertain about your life, Memento is a great movie to watch and remind yourself about the complexity of your own memory and mind. The movie often leaves me with the high appreciation for memory. What our mind can do is quite remarkable. Although Nolan's Inception was bigger scale and had more actions in it, Memento remains to be my favorite Nolan movie.",Memento

I've seen this movie five times and still don't claim to have it figured out. After extensive research here's what I do know. The movie is about Leonard, an insurance investigator, who is the victim of a home invasion. Leonard's wife is raped and severely beaten. It's debateable whether she is killed, severely injured and dies sooner or later. It's even debateable whether she dies from these injuries (as I believe) or from an insulin overdose administered by Leonard (by mistake due to his short-term memory loss from injuries he sustained during the break-in). To help the viewer see things from Leonard's perspective (he has anterograde amnesia (short-term memory loss caused by trauma to the head from his attack) of only being able to remember things for 10-15 min. How you interpret what Teddy (a corrupt cop and the investigator from the incident) says to Leonard in the final scene is how you figure out the movie. I recently read an article where Joey P. (the actor who played Teddy) said the director/screenwriter told him that everything he says in the final sceen is the truth. If that is true (and why wouldn't it be) I may need to view the movie five more times to sort out all of the issues. I normally get a movie after one viewing. But, the more you scratch the surface on this movie the more you get. The color part of the movie runs from last scene (literally backwards) to first sceen (middle of movie at end). The interspersed black and white sceens run first scene (of movie) to last sceen at end and then blend into the color scenes.

1927,InsainJ,"Memento, as complex as it can get.",8,26 March 2014,"This movie has been praised by a lot of people on the internet. But my question is: is it really a 10 star-movie or has it been over-hyped?Memento is a movie about Leonard, a man with severe memory loss. He tries remembering things by photos and putting notes all over the place even tattoos on his body. Christopher Nolan tries to confuse the audience in a way just like Leonard is confused by his amnesia. He uses two separate story lines, the first goes back in time and the second one travels forward in time, the 2 alternate continuously. Actually you can follow the story quite well but it's weird and this is still a unique kind of storytelling although the movie was released back in 2000. Guy Pierce does a great job playing the confused Leonard, you really pity him when he is being fooled by some obscure characters like Natalie. Carrie-Ann Moss plays that bitch in a credible way, which makes you like Leonard just that bit more. The actors in general are not extraordinary, more like good. Unlike Christopher Nolan and his editing team which I really admire for their superb performance, they are the real stars of the movie. For Instance: Something odd happens in the one story line and the when the other story line is happening you can connect things that are taking place to that odd event.(Even describing this movie is complicated) It's incredible how they can make such a complex format 'understandable' towards the audience. But it's still quite hard to fully understand the movie, especially the ending. Most people (like me) will not fully understand it, you have to watch an explanation video or watch Memento again. Probably this was on purpose, but in my opinion this is something negative.There's plenty of action for a movie of the mystery genre. If you liked Inception or Shutter Island, you will definitely find this one interesting. But I prefer those over Memento just because the acting was better. Leonardo DiCaprio was the star in both so it's not really surprising. If you want some light entertainment you should rather watch The Expendables or Harry Potter, which are nice in their own ways.So is it a 10 star movie? As you have probably already seen: No. It's a great movie and It has some unique aspects. But it also has some flaws like the ending and one or two times I was a bit bored. Because of these 2 flaws I give it 8 stars. This is still a good rating and the movie deserves it.Jonas De Maeseneer",Memento

1932,mgrist264,"Review I wrote for college, contains no spoilers :-)",10,11 May 2012,"Memento has become one of the most well known popular films of its genre, and its not hard to see why. Calling it a convoluted and labyrinthine thriller would be an understatement. This film is sleek, and you can even see that by the way Leonard dresses in a beige cool suit with a fancy sports car, but with the twist of him living in a dingy motel. Set around a dark story about a man with short term memory loss, hunting around trying to find the man who murdered and raped his wife, it contrasts with small quirky jokes. The narrative throws people off track by its order, of going backwards and forwards at the same time, then meeting at the beginning of the story, at the end of the film. This film does not need a complex mind to understand but it can help. You are in the brain of Leonard and getting told the story from him, but how are you meant to get the right story, if the narrators brain is unreliable? Christopher Nolans ""memento"" is a unique masterpiece which will keep you on the edge and puzzling what to believe.",Memento
1933,nailbiter27,Brilliant,10,2 March 2004,"Finally got to see this movie. I wish a saw it in the theater. The most original story I've seen in years. Nothing but suspense and surprises. This movie is one of the reasons I find myself watching more and more Independent films. It had me guessing the whole time. The acting was great the setting was cool. I had to watch it twice to really absorb it. It's amazing a film that complex has no holes. At least none that I can see. A must see!!!!

1934,Willie-osterweil,"Interesting, but ultimately bad. Way overrated",1,4 April 2004,"The praise that I usually hear about this movie is that it ""makes you think"" or ""is really confusing, and that's cool"".  What's frustrating to me about it's continued popularity is that while it does have a cool idea, it ends up more like a parlor game than a good film.  Sure, it is cool trying to piece together the story, trying to remember what happened in the last scene, and trying to figure out who thekiller is.  But the movie is ultimately unsatisfying.  The characters are flat, emotionless, and none of them sympathetic.  The editing is great, it is in fact the saving grace of the movie, but the directing is stale, boring and cold. Nolan doesn't get anything near good performances out of his actors.  They seem tounderstand what works about this movie, but never perform in a way that moves you (with the exception of Joe Pantoliano, who is convincingly evil, but notgreat) The movie is sterile.  It has no power over the audience.  The story is ultimately uninteresting.  Just because a movie engages you mentally doesn't mean it is a good film.  Sure it makes you think.  It makes you think alot.  But so does a calculus test.",Memento

1936,sop2013602,Too much effort toward complexity but a great story,7,2 June 2012,"It was my second time ever;viewing Christopher Nolan's thriller ""Memento"".Memento is about Leonard Gray, a San Fransisco resident that is left with brain damage after receiving a hard blow to the head from a frightened home invader.His brain damage gives him a disorder called short term memory loss and changes his life forever.Memento recounts the chilling events that follow Leonard's misfortune.Leonard is a former insurance adjuster with a diabetic wife;who commits suicide by repeatedly requesting her insulin dose from a brain damaged Leonard.She dies in a coma, and because Leonard is unable to retain facts unless they're retold to him several times(this method is also known as rote learning),his ""recall"" is terrible.He's left with a false memory of his wife's death in which he teaches himself by sharing it with pol ice multiple times.After Lenny's brain damage is discovered,one police officer,John G, decides to take advantage of Leonard by moving him out of his home and into a cheap motel room to use him as his personal hit-man.John G easily convinces Leonard that his name is Teddy and he is helping him track down his wife's murderers(what Leon ard believes to be the home invaders that injured him).After catching the actual home invader(who didn't really murder anyone),Leonard seems to forget this event entirely and is afterward tricked into murdering a drug dealer that a female friend of his,Natalie is wary of,along with 2 or 3 more enemies of John G's.Leonard tattoos impor tant markers onto his body and takes polaroids but still constantly forgets everything anyone says or does to him.The details of the movie signify Lenny's hippocampus' as the problem;as he is obviously unable to encode or con solidate anything that doesn't happen more than once.Parts other than his episodic memory like declaration or proce dural memory seem to be fine.He can clearly retain regular facts,like John G's(Teddy's) face,the location of favorite bars and resturaunts and his own belongings.Ultimately,this bloody tale ends when John G tells Leonard the truth,and in stead of taking quick notes of who his next victim will be,Leonard burns all evidence of the horrible killings and writes himself a note of instruction; to track down and kill John G; and ignore anything John says to him beforehand.Leonard lets everything that's occurred ""go"" and moves on with his new life.What he will or won't remember about any of his past without help is unclear at the end of the film. I believe ""Memento"" portrays short term memory loss very accurately..the screenplay makes it very obvious what the physical and psychological details of Leonard's disorder are.I don't feel it was necessary to edit the story without chronological order.The story is complex and exciting with an intense climax and it's a movie that one would have to pay close attention to even if it was in order from start to finish.It was too much in my opinion,to backtrack any parts of the film that didn't involve story telling(like Lenny's episodic recall of Sammy Jenkins).All of the backtracking caused my viewing experience to be more interactive than I cared for.Because of that,I believe I would've enjoyedMemento more if it had been edited differently.Memory is extremely important and regular mental tasks like learning or listening are more delicate and valuable than we all appreciate.For instance,if one were to try to pass up their own mind's encoding system and take notes of everything they saw or heard in one day.they wouldn't do much else!The movie makes that fact even more apparent and illustrates the possible detriment to our lives the inability to perform a simple but priceless mental function ,like encoding and consolidating facts could be.Memento is such a great story that the fabulous acting is almost unnoticeable.That was my second viewing of the film an there will probably be a third.",Memento

The plot of this movie is by far one of the best I've seen and to think that this disability is possible to have. Before watching the movie you will need to know that black and white scenes are going forward into the movie and color going backwards until they meet in the middle of the story at the end of the film.

A ground breaking approach by director Christopher Nolan to convey such a run of the mill plot as a man avenging his wife's murder in such a way as to leave you physically and mentally drained but at the same time keeping you on the edge of your seat, and amazed at it's brilliance.Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby gives his best performance to date, quashing his excellent performance in L.A. Confidential. Carrie-Anne moss is also superb as Natalie, and shows more depth than she did in the matrix trilogy.You sometimes feel as the viewer, having a mild case of Anterograde Amnesia, or short term memory loss to you and me, as so much is going on you forget what just happened, and have literally no time to recover. If it takes you a few watches to get, don't worry its guaranteed to leave you enthralled when you finally do.Arguably the best film of 2000, along with requiem for a dream, and undeniably worthy of a spot in IMDb's top 250.9.5/10 - it loses half a mark, for working hard to keep up.",Memento

What can I say about Memento, from start to finish, you are reeled into a sense of thriller by excellent direction, an amazing story, and of course, an awesome cast. From Guy Pearce to Carrie Anne Moss ( Matrix ), the acting was perfect. But what does gets you going is the excellent writing.

Problem: he cannot remember anything after his wife's death longer than 10 minutes. Solution: Tattoo information on body, take many Polaroid shots and write mementos on the backs of them, and keep random paper in your pockets with anything and everything you need to know there.During the film, Leonard runs into several John G's, and is lied to countless times, his trust abused because of his condition.

I keep questioning things and feeling anxious, the same way that Leonard would.The reason for this personality alteration at the end of each viewing is that every time I watch it, I am completely engulfed in the story and the main character. At the end, I feel like Leonard would feel and I can understand what it is like to live with him. It's this feeling that makes this movie different from all others for me.

The only way he can remember is to tattoo words/phrases on his body, he uses this to track down his wife's killer......John G. Superb writing, directing, acting etc. (I could go on forever) but one of the main reasons I liked it so much is because it makes you think........a lot. During the movie, after the movie (I'm still thinking about it now, and I saw it 2 weeks ago) it's just so awesome.

1943,ann_teak,"Profound, in my opinion",10,14 June 2004,"My husband & I are the legal guardians of a multiply handicapped young man. One of his handicaps is short-term memory damage. Sometimes a passing comment sticks like super glue in his mind, but mostly, a LOT of repetition is needed to allow him to remember events, objects, and people. His time frame is different, too; time for him goes verrry sllloooowwwwwllllyyy. I firmly believe that he doesn't lie, but he has a great need to fill in memory gaps, sometimes with very surprising stories. Therefore, because of my tie with this young man, I have an abiding interest in human memory.I have come to see how very personal and ephemeral memory truly is. Concepts like ""truth"" and ""fact"" are plastic even at the best of times, but in memory-damaged brains, can become downright syrupy. Time can become meaningless. I think this film captures these predicaments very well. The reverse editing of the film shows Pearce's character, Shelby, moving from shakier ground backward to firmer. That must be what short term memory damage must feel like - shaky ground. I had last seen Guy Pearce in ""Adventures of Pricilla, Queen of the Desert"", so this was, of course, a very different role. Luckily, unlike my guardianee, Shelby had learned to read before his brain trauma or the search for the criminal would have been moot! Pearce did a great job displaying all the emotions and conflict Shelby went through to try to accomplish his very difficult task. I found this film to be profound and still think about it today.Thank you.",Memento

This is sad to see what is becoming of America or rather the world when this kind of a movie gets such a good rating.

My interpretation of this is plain and simple. He IS the killer with a sociopathic personality. He feels nothing. He has convinced himself he did NOT do it. He is seeking the ""real killer"" (like O.J. looking for Nicole's killer on the golf course.) All throughout this movie, we have sympathy for Leonard Shelby because we are basically seeing things through his eyes (as disjointed as they may be). Then strange ""unexplainable"" things happen that make one question what is really going on. Why can Leonard remember some things and not others etc.? Why is he not acting like a grief stricken man? We, as viewers, are conditioned not to believe these little tidbits of evidence as reality as they are introduced to us because we have already formed this bond with Leonard and his mission. But truth be told, I had cold chills up my spine in the end when it dawns on me that Leonard's memory may very well be selective and pathological and not a true, memory disorder. Now where was I?

By the halfway point I found there were no surprises left; and after being dragged through every scene twice in the course of a single viewing I felt as if I'd sat through a 3 hour marathon. The acting is superb however. Guy Pierce and Carrie-Anne Moss have amazingly twisted chemistry that unfortunately doesn't run throughout the whole film.

The movie has a lot of great dialogue and great set-up points, told in a unique way that helps you deal with what the character is going through.Leonard Shelby, a man on a vendetta to find the man who raped and murdered his wife, has no short-term memory. He relies on notes and tattoos and photographs to get him through finding out who murdered his wife. But as the film progresses at ten minute intervals that go for ten minutes and then goes on for the ten minutes before that ten, you start to realize that all is not as it seems.The screenplay and the editing were nominated for Academy Awards, and the film was greater than that to deserve just two nominations.

I don't think I have ever seen a movie do such a good job of making the audience feel like they couldn't remember anything either.

Intelligent people are just going to roll their eyes at the stupidity.Besides the ""how can he remember that he can't remember"" flaw, which makes a roll of toilet paper out of the whole movie all by itself, you have the obvious plot twists. Everything is so predictable. It's a twisty movie, so you're looking for, and seeing, the twists. Natalie has bruises on her face when we first meet her? She's going to be hit. Lenny has scratches on his face? He's going to get his face scratched. Teddy starts to get in the old car, not the Jag, but Lenny says the Jag is his car, and Teddy laughs and says fine? We know the Jag's not Lenny's car, and we're just waiting to see how he got it. Teddy says roll up the window, and Lenny can't because it's been shot or busted out? We're just waiting for the shoot-out-the-window scene we know is coming. And on and on and on. And is there anyone, even one person with a triple-digit IQ, who didn't know, upon first hearing that Natalie is helping Lenny out of pity, he thinks, that she's using him? Even one person? IT'S A TWISTY MOVIE! That means that everything you have to believe to keep the movie obvious, can't be allowed to be true, so you know right away that she must be using him.The worst thing about the movie: the ""it's all been *beep* ending. Once you put in a movie anything that says ""it's all been *beep* then the whole movie becomes *beep* How do we know the opening scene isn't a dream? Or any other scene? Because if the narrator is/may be lying/misrembering any scene (as he obviously is re his wife's death) then the whole movie becomes suspect. There's nothing left to chew on. After the very core of the movie--his wife's supposed murder--is exposed as possibly untrue, then what are you left with? Everything he's telling you/showing you might be untrue, might be misrembered or a lie. The opening scene might, if the writer later needs to, be untrue. I can see the Nolan brothers, when confronted with any logical flaws, saying, ""well, see, uh, that part, uh, that didn't actually happen, and you were supposed to figure out that Lenny didn't really kill Teddy, who, if it leads to further logical flaws, didn't exist. Uh, duh, uh, I think."" The absolute first golden rule of movie-making must be: you can not ever say or show that anything we've been shown as movie factual (as opposed to character factual, that is, a character's opinion, or interpretation, as in Usual Suspects), isn't what actually happened. We can be lead to or jump to wrong conclusions that are our own fault (more intelligent twists). But the movie itself can't be allowed to lie to us. Think of how easy it would be to be ""twisty"" (that is, mentally challenging to the average IQ crowd), if you just show X killing Y, and Z investigating, and at the end reveal that the director was just kidding, Q shot Y. It's just stupid, poor writing. And in Memento, a movie told from Lenny's POV, if we're to believe anything, we have to believe that he remembers everything until his wife's murder. So once we see him with tattoos, with her, the whole movie becomes a joke. An idiocy. And it is scary that so few people posting here can't see that.",Memento

In the beginning I thought that Memento might have some levels, but the feeling of mystery involved can all be reduced to the plot, not to the theme, which is just some insignificant decoration on filmmakers' intellectual masturbation, not like in Donnie Darko, for example, in which the complex elements are related to some content.All I'm saying, not a terrible movie, but you gotta be kidding saying it's ""highly intellectual"" or a ""masterpiece"".

1957,Michael-Zanoni,In its own realm,10,14 December 2004,"Just for all of you who seem to have a problem with this movie, I need you to wake up and smell the coffee. I even saw some person complaining that some people see its better than The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and other instant classics. The problem with these people is that their mind is too closed to see the difference between these movies and a movie like Memento. Memento was shot on a low budget. This means actors like Pacino, etc etc... can not be cast easily. For Pearce, this is one of his best performances, hands down. Also, Pantoliano and Moss deliver a completely unique perspective on characters in any film. The best part about the two is the constant flip flopping of good and evil within them. You never truly get a grasp on whether one is trying to help or hurt Pearce on his ""mission."" And if its realism that people are complaining about (Lenny's condition mainly), go back and check your own favorites for realism, I'm sure not every part is factual and actually possible. With films in the independent genre of film, it is important to keep an open mind, and see what the director and writer(s) have to offer you. The reason they are independent in the first place is to stray from traditional Hollywood production values. Everything the directing, writing, and editing throw into this film has a purpose to the storyline. The performances may not be the best all around (except Pearce), but the story makes up for it. It truly keeps you on your toes and (so cliché in saying this) ""makes you think"" but on a different realm. Not only are you trying to piece together what is happening, but why the person in charge of a certain aspect did it that way. That's all I have to say... if you'd like to have an intelligent conversation about movies, I'm game. Drop me an e-mail. What I can't take is the ignorant bashing movies with low production values (like this one) just because they aren't loaded with millions of dollars worth of actors and special effects.

1958,jonah-woodman,Film critique (film school credit),10,25 April 2018,"Memento is a mystery thriller which follows the perspective of the protagonist Leonard Shelby, who is looking for revenge against the people who murdered his wife. During the attack on his wife Leonard suffered an injury resulting in a rare medical condition that does not allow his brain to produce any new short term memory. Other than the memories he has retained before his accident everything else seems to fade over a short period of time, and that produces one of the most entertaining principles in which Leonard's journey is presented throughout this film. 
The story of this film is told on screen in reverse chronological order which may appear as a tacked on gimmick in hopes of receiving more buzz or viewers, however in this case the nonlinear narrative more than just a gimmick in which the story is told but in fact the designing principle of the film and fundamentally adds to the already robust narrative. By developing the story in this style fully immerses the audience to feel the same confusion the protagonist feels throughout the film. This compels the audience to remain engaged to solve answers to the questions director Christopher Nolan expertly stages in every scene of this film, by doing this the director rewards the tedious audience member paying attention to the minor details and subtext within every scene. 
Christopher Nolan has indeed mastered the non linear storytelling, if this feat is not executed correctly this can create a very confusing and discombobulating narrative for the audience. However in this circumstance and with many other Nolan films he's accomplished this non linear story masterfully. 
Another entertaining concept of the movie is the use of colour and black and white scenes. The colour scenes follow the protagonist Leonard Shelby on his current dilema living with his condition and hunting his wife's killer. The Black and white scenes primarily show Leonard speaking on a telephone to a mysterious caller and flashbacks of his life and career experiences that molded him into the character we see in the present colour scenes. Contrasting these reverse chronological colour scenes to the normal chronological black and white scenes gives an amazing perspective to the entire character arc of Leonard Shelby. 
Memento holds a very high entertainment and rewatchable value, and with each view and careful attention the viewer may pick up new details to each scene. Memento gives a fresh unique outlook on the common revenge tale told in many many Hollywood films and is a must own in any film library.",Memento

I'm sure Memento can be found in many movies that have come before it but I didn't find it to be some horrible, cheap imitation and repetitious.Some people complain that this movie was too confusing and that there were too many plot holes.The whole genius of this movie and what makes it different from most that I've watched lately is you have to get inside this movie. You can't just view it from the surface only giving half you attention to it or it defiantly won't make sense. This means you may even have to watch it more than once but trust me it all comes together.Now if you don't like having to play detective while you watch a movie I wouldn't suggest it but never the less it's a good movie.And as for the plot holesI don't pay any attention to them. I rather enjoy a movie then analyze everything that's wrong with it. I do have to agree that its probably not top ten material because I'm positive there's ten other movies that overrate it but I believe it rates pretty high up there.9 out of 10 easy",Memento
1960,bellapangab,Awesome plot,9,15 September 2013,"The very thing that Hollywood most lacks nowadays is originality. In an era where we are constantly being repetitively served with remakes, re-creations, prequels and, not to forget, interminable sequels, creativity surely does not seem to be the main and most essential factor in the vast majority of nowadays films. Hollywood seems like a movie bakery that counts on the same recipe book with certain ingredients over and over again to produce an edible cake to serve. Not to mention tons of explosions, gunfights, and long list of visual effects artists that seem to fill most of today's films. However, there can be exceptions, but they come in small quantities, and at very rare times. One of those exceptions is Christopher Nolan's Memento. ""You need three things to make a good movie: a good script, a good script and a good script."" (Alfred Hitchcock) Christopher Nolan, who both wrote and directed the film, has successfully proved that his work in Memento is an application of how great a script filled of twists and turns with a non-linear narrative structure applied in reverse, meaning that we get to see the latter events of the story unfold at the beginning of the film, can distinct Memento to be one of the phenomenal film ever made.",Memento

Perhaps it isn't the perfect movie for those who prefer light comedies and classic Hollywood entertainment. Memento, on the other hand, is melancholy and thought-provoking. There is a bit of violence, but this only contributes to the overall perfect darkness of the film. I highly suggest renting it, buying it, etc. Just make sure you watch it from beginning to end, (though it is almost impossible not to, as the plot is so captivating).

Today is one of those days so...I'm ready to write the first my review. Really hard to write, because I am not English-speaking, but I think nobody cares, Because there's no one who will read my review. ""Memento"". First, I want to praise Nolan for a very good film name. And this is just one of many compliments for him. He is a god of cinema. He inspired me to write a scripts, more to think about future, who I am, and what I want to be. But I strayed from the theme. The film itself is very original, but only just started watching, I started think ""is Guy Pearce really appropriate for this film?"" And yes. He really is. The acting completed till the end. The film was a very good but not unworthy to reflection. He was just't like the last delicious morsel. Eaten with pleasure, but then forgotten. But of course he deserves all the awards and high places. The biggest plus here was the original script that was not a banal. ""We all lie to ourselves to be happy."" And end. I think not everyone understood it. It's not as simple as if the end of the film which begins and explain everything. And if you don't know what I'm talking about, just watch again.

1964,Arakuss,Good but not Great,7,27 August 2013,"This is my first review here. I just watched Memento last night and was looking at other reviews. I might not have wrote my own but there are way to many people just over rating this movie. Yes was a it good to watch yea. Unique sort of. I know this film was made a while back but the backward story telling or puzzle story telling has been done before. Many have sighted Pulp Fiction. This is just a story telling tool and whether it has been done before or not is not the point. Was it done well. Yes. It also suited the getting into the POV of the main characters head. For this the movie was very well done.As far as acting it is hard to grade for me. Short scenes leave little chance to truly show off what talent may or may not be there. Over all you do get a sense of the chars but its really just a superficial view of them. I think this was done on purpose by the film maker to hide what comes next. Did the actors fit their roles yes but they fit their roles for the moment. The moment of each scene. You see what they are like in that moment in time before who they really are is revealed. This works for the first half the movie and once you figure out things they seem more like actors just saying lines. The true trick or gimmick is not the backward story telling but the fact that every scene... wait spoiler... is built upon illusions and lies. From the very first scenes on is all a series of lies and illusions. This is what actually is very well done and different, because even in lies there is truth. However by the time you get half way through the movie you already figured out where these lies will lead and how they lead back to the first scene. To me there was no major plot twist it was just now following the trail to see how it plays out. This to me is were the film begins to lag and no longer holds any suspense. Two thoughts on this. One is that really in the end the actual story was a weak plot. There was nothing to the story but questions. This could be what the film maker wanted. What is real what is not. Who is not telling the truth who is. Or maybe they are all telling a bit of the truth. Maybe its Leonard who is not facing the truth. That the truth is to hard to face so he creates his own. Or that the world is nothing but the lies which we want to believe. Maybe a mix of it all. OK so it makes you think but I was thinking this half way through the movie. We do get hints that maybe the Leonard and Sammy are one but nothings really answered. Leonard manipulates his world by what he wants to believe by writing it down. Others manipulate him into believing things are not what they seem.It is the ending which I believe is the let down. We are filled with not only the suppose twist with Teddy and what he tells Leonard but we are left with who is telling the truth. All we are left with is that Leonard actually doesn't want to know the truth. This leaves the viewer sitting through 2 hours of film that from the very start the main char is seeking the truth that he never really wants to know in the end. He killed the only one who perhaps knew the truth at the start of the movie. How ironic.One more note. My opinion is the black and white scenes are Leonard's lies he is creating to hide what happened and the color scenes are the lies or half truths the world is showing him. Otherwise he remembers his lies or what he wants to and the color scenes is what the world unveils to him. He reconstructs his world with what he writes down. Unique, different but I would not say brilliant. Good beginning but fades and becomes predictable in the end. You realize the question the film maker is asking and that he isn't going to tell you half way through the film. Writing for first half 10 second half 6. Plot 7. Did it keep me on the edge. 5 Overall I give it a 7 because I liked it. Its is a movie you have to see once just not the type I would see again. To me that is what makes a movie great is wanting to see it again.",Memento
1965,theriotisover,Editing is never random.,9,20 January 2005,"**minor spoilers**---Pieces are shown a number of times with no real linear link between them, just like it would be if we ourselves had a memory disorder, and then they are cut up and edited next to things that happen either before or after it.----The sequencing is actually another part of Memento's masterful construction. The first scene, during the credits, is the only scene in which the action unfolds in reverse. This both sets up the momentum of the film, and sets up the ""fragility"" theme--part of Lenny's existential crisis is that his actions may not be meaningful if the evidence of them, the photos he takes as mementos, can be easily destroyed. Since he is unable to make a memory, he doesn't *remember* anything when he sees the photos, thus they are not *reminders* but *mementos* whose meanings can easily be altered or destroyed entirely. Lenny bases all his actions on his mementos. He chooses to destroy Teddy's photo because that effectively ""erases"" the action of his murder from Lenny's archive of mementos. But I digress...The first scene actually unfolds in reverse motion. Subsequently, all of the color scenes take place in reverse chronological order. The intercut black and white scenes occur in forwards chronological order. The last scene of the movie is actually the middle of the story; the events unfold both backwards and forward until they collide in the middle, at the moment of Teddy's murder. To use the alphabet as an example, after the credits scene, the story unfolds in this sequence: Z, A, Y, B, X, C.... with Z, Y, X... being in black and white and A, B, C... being in color. It's the classic film noir flashback on acid.",Memento

It is a film for the thinking person, one which requires your full attention. The plot (and the way it is portrayed) is one of a kind.

To remember things, he must tattoo notes all over his body, and take photographs of every last person and thing he encounters. Pearce's performance will make any viewer believe this guy really can't remember a damn thing. He is that good. The movie is full of twists, turns, surprises, you name it.

Nevertheless, he desperately tries to find out who killed his wife and made him mentally disabled. So he writes notes on everything, from photos to his body in order to remember the facts Because it doesn't matter what he thinks, it's the details written down that counts There are other people, though, trying to abuse this deficiency of him The movie is directed by the maker of Inception and the Batman trilogy- and we have to mention that it is better than the 4 movie altogether, as this was the movie which have made Christopher Nolan famous, and maybe so thought the jury of the Academy Award as they nominated the film for Best Film Editing and Best Screenplay.We have to mention Guy Pearce, who give a memorably performance as Leonard, the main character. I also liked the camera work and, of course, the directing, which is basically to have control over all aspects of the filmmaking. My only criticism is the language being used in one scene of the film, but it is reasonable because of the plot. Why this movie is amusing is that it has two story lines. One storyline moves forward in time while the other tells the story backwards revealing more each time. It's a dark thriller with an interesting question: Is a man guilty of what he did if he doesn't remember why he did them? All in all, Memento is an interesting, challenging film with an intricate plot, and I guarantee you that it will fix you in your chair for its 113 min length",Memento
1970,owenn_77,Excellent,10,26 May 2016,"Short ReviewMemento is an engaging and beautifully crafted movie. The mystery keeps the audience at the edge of their seats. The twist at the end of the movie is brilliant and deep at the same time. As the movie go, it unravels a thought provoking truth with multiple possible backstory.Detailed ReviewOne of the most brilliant yet unrecognized movies that I've came across is Memento which is released as early as year 2000 and is a ""mystery & suspense, drama movie"" according to rotten-tomatoes. Memento is a brilliant masterpiece directed by Christopher Nolan, the director of The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, The Prestige and Interstellar which made him one of the most critically acclaimed directors today. As of now, the movie has received 2 Oscar nominations, won 50 other awards and has been nominated for 42 other awards.Essentially, Memento tells you a backward story about Leonard Shelby who's in the midst of the search for the man who raped and murdered his wife, but what makes it much more interesting is that he can't make any new memories since an accident, so he's got to rely on his existing memories, notes and instinct to find the killer, and as the movie progress, you'll find yourself at the edge of your seat as each character's traits are starting to unravel. The movie is very mind twisting and since it's a backward movie, you'll find it very unique and fresh. The camera-work, look, and soundtrack is just perfect and immerse you in the story. Plus, the acting is so well done and very convincing.At the end of the day, Memento is not for everyone since the plot can be difficult to stomach at times, but if you're anything like me, who likes to see brilliant twists here and there, then Memento is a must- see.",Memento

First of all we find ourselves trying to understand who is fooling who...is teddy the one? Is Natalie a deceiver? Who knows the truth...we depend on Leonard stuff as well, coz we see everything through his eyes, we perceive everything through his mind where everything is black or white. There's no grey. According to Lenny, Natalie is the good one, and Teddy is the bad one, and this is the same for us for great part of the movie.

To produce something that will have any impact in the medium, you will have to depart from convention. I am not saying it has to be elitist or esoteric in any way, but that people have preferences and forsaking artistic expression to cater to as many tastes as possible is the slippery slope to mediocrity.Though I (and many others) believe Memento is presented in a manner that casual viewers will not enjoy, I do not presume that they are incapable of appreciating it. I feel that as film culture matures with young generations of internet film pirates growing up on easily accessible movies, timeless films like Groundhog Day and Memento will eventually attain the reverence they truly deserve.Memento also has a clear interpretation (unlike say... Mulholland Drive or Enemy) that is easy to derive, though not without effort. It is far from being pretentious in that once you understand the presentation, the reasons for it become manifestly clear. (If I'm sounding snobby or mystical here, it is because I'm trying to avoid spoilers, I hope)Memento is indubitably Christopher Nolan's finest work and will, I suspect, remain so for many, many years to come.Thank you Ser Han for prompting me to do this.",Memento
1981,harleyneiditz,"A brilliant, unique, frustrating film.",7,15 March 2017,"Memento concerns Leonard Shelby, (a great performance by Guy Pearce) a man who suffers from short term memory loss. This leaves him unable to form new memories. Director Christopher Nolan puts us inside the mind of Leonard by giving the film a non-linear structure. This brilliant choice is at times a double edged sword. The non- linear time-line makes the viewer as clueless as Leonard Shelby. We don't know what has happened, when it happened, etc. I give Nolan chops for making that choice. I think it gives Memento its unique quality. On the other hand, the jumping back and forth does not allow Leonard Shelby to develop as a character. As I think more about this, it is actually brilliant. As a character who cannot form new memories, there is no reason for Leonard to have a character arc. The audience member is deprived of the same things as Leonard: closure, understanding, relief. This is definitely a film to see more than once. I bet that I will appreciate it more after viewing it another time. Meanwhile, watch, enjoy, and go along for the ride.

1984,gen3ric,Memento Review (Contains Spoilers),9,11 May 2005,"When we speak of movies that push the limit, are controversial, and contain layers of meaning, not many can fit the bill. Memento isn't your traditional story in any sense. The first time you see this movie you may be confused and perhaps even frustrated with trying to understand the movie in all it's subtleties. However this movie is wonderfully compelling and full of suspense and surprises. The first and arguably most unique feature is in the way the story is told, completely in reverse. It's not that we watch it in reverse, but we get the chronology of the movie in small segments in reverse order. As far as movies go, Memento touched on issues regarding religion (consequences and actions), philosophy (specifically epistemology and certainly issues in metaphysics), and morality. The main character Lenny (Leonard) we discover to be unique for a few reasons. The most striking is his lack of short-term memory. While many of us can say we have bad short-term memory, Lenny no doubt has it worse. His short-term memory loss is so bad that he must tattoo any important information on his body. With any amount of empathy towards this situation, fear and confusion are immediately feelings of which there is no escape. However, Lenny has no choice, he has to deal with all of this with no one to trust and with no idea who to believe. Lenny suffers from a rare brain disease (or brain damage) from the 'incident'. He tells us of Sammy Jankis, the accountant he came across when he was a claims investigator. Sammy had this same disease where he did not have the ability to create new memories; He had no short-term memory. The most complex tasks were done with ease, as long as he had learned of it before his accident. Lenny tells us that there is a difference between himself and Sammy; He has a reason to live. Sammy on the other hand, had no reason, no system. Within the field of epistemology, testimony and memory are important ideas for the attainment of knowledge. In Lenny's condition, due to his inability to form short-term memory, he must rely on testimony. His reliance on notes, tattoo's, and his specific 'system' as he calls it is the way he has adapted to his condition. Also, because of his condition, the consequences of his actions are of no meaning since he will ultimately forget. He creates his own truth, his own meaning, and his own path. Every time Lenny's memory fades away, he's left in a waking state of forgetfulness. Like after waking up from a bad hangover or a deep sleep, he reorientates himself with where he is, what he is doing, and why he is doing what he is doing. The movie is unique in the way it presents the story. First, we see the end of the movie and we form our own conclusions regarding Lenny, Teddy, and Natalie. Yet slowly, the story jumps back into time, revealing yet another piece of what appears to be the final picture. The director keeps using this technique to keep us in suspense. Aside from the unique way in which this story is told, the simple aesthetics of this film are amazing. Many have classified this as 'film noir' from a previous era in film-making and I would have to agree that they share many elements in common. Yet there are features, such as the way the story is told, that set this apart from its predecessors. While the movie is full of suspense and action, the result of this movie is something that makes us think. We leave the movie with questions of our own, wondering about the true nature of man and how we use people to our own advantage. Certainly we wonder how someone can use another person with a server handicap to murder someone else. Nonetheless, Natalie and Teddy take advantage of Lenny and his condition to further their own interests. Without the ability to remember what we have done, do our actions even have meaning? Lenny said, ""Just because there are things I don't remember doesn't make my actions meaningless"". He had set out to discover the truth and take revenge for his wife's murder, but slowly the story turns into a direction where you wonder Did this really happen or is this just what someone told me? This movie is without a doubt a well-filmed and well-written story. The elements of surprise and suspense work well to draw the audience into the story and take an interest in the characters. The visual cues (black and white for the film cues and conversations), amazing use of lighting, and the timing of the jumps fit perfectly in with the dark nature of this film. This is without a doubt a wonderful film.",Memento
1985,Drriera,"Memento , Dennis Riera",9,12 May 2005,"Very well crafted film. This first impression it made on me was how complex it was to write and edit without looking cheesy or inconsistent.Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" carefully threads a forward moving black and white narration of the reasons the storyline events unfold in the way and order which explains the color portion of the film which is showed in retrospect. (Does that make sense?)(Watch the movie and it will)This complex film has a very simple premise, Guy Pierce's character ""Leonard"" is out to avenge his wife's killer. Thats it!.......But wait, this film is shown in a pseudo Jeopardy game format where the answer is given first and the questions are yet to unfold. The scenes are edited in a Terrentino style and Pulp Fictionesse kind of way, whereby you are given vignettes of events which at first don't make sense, until you see the plot unfold after the fact.The fact that Leonard cannot store any new information into his short term memory, gives way to how difficult everyday things are to remember for him, but also how dedicated he is to solve this murder mystery when you can't remember what he did ten minutes ago. This gives this movie an intriguing storyline. The film starts at the end and slowly devolves into explaining what was shown in the very opening. The fading photograph is a great metaphor for how the rest of the film is going to devolve, and unfold the details after the fact. The only saving grace for Leonard is that he remembers  someone (Sammy Jenkins) that he once investigated who had the same mental condition that he has. Sammy Jenkins had provided the road map to the process Leonard needed in order to solve this mystery, as he moved through the storyline. The only saving grace from Leonard is that he learned first hand from Sammy Jenkins that, ""You got to have a system to make it work"". This is how Leonard is able to track and find his wife's killer  through the use of the process of writing everything down and photographing people and places. This process was learned prior to his wife's death and was still in his long term memory. Leonard kept permanent notes tattooed to his body in order to keep from losing them. When questioned about his method of keeping his information Leonard defends his system by saying, by writing down facts I remember, but memory can change a car to a van or the shape of a room. Leonard impresses upon the viewer that his process of orientation is the most efficient and only possible way he can put the pieces together to track down his villain. The director uses a telephone conversation which moves in a forward direction (against the retro tide of the color portion of the devolving film) to explain the events that are showing in a retrospective play by play sequence of events. This telephone conversation is filled with all recalled information which is the only information that is store in his head. Leonard speaks on the telephone in a very lucid and fluid way, which never gave the impression that he had a memory disability at all. This black and white narration explains the process Leonard uses, as learned from Sammy Jenkins. Jenkins taught Leonard to ""learn not by memory, but by instinct"". It is Leonards past experiences in his long term memory and his instinct as an investigator is what takes him to his wife's killer.......Great movie, I need to see it again to test the truths of the movie, very much like the movie The Sixth Sense.",Memento
1986,smaroun,"Great movie, definitely a thinker!",8,12 May 2005,"Memento is not a movie to be taken lightly. Do not get me wrong, it is definitely a good movie to watch, but it is not like many movies where you can watch it, sleep through the middle, and then wake up almost at the end and totally know what happened. These days many movies are like that, but not Memento. This is a very unique, from the way it was written, to the way it was taped, even to the way it was edited. It is a movie told backwards, in all sense of the meaning. You cannot understand the beginning without understanding the end, yet you cannot understand the end without the beginning. However, at the end of the movie, you do not go away with a feeling that something is missing, instead you get the majority of the movie, and you're are so excited to be able to say that, since most of the movie you were so confused, that you settle for the feeling that at least you got the basic idea behind the movie.I encourage everyone to see this movie with someone else, because it is definitely a movie that gets better after a good discussion. There is a lot in the movie, and since it is told backwards, it is easy to forget some things, or to forget to tie two things together. That is why the movie gets better and more interesting after discussing it with someone else, and even watching it a second or third time. The main character, Leonard has a memory disorder, and is unable to convert short term memory into long term memory. This plays out in many ways, but most importantly in the way it affects the people around him. At first one would assume that the people around him are manipulating and abusing him because of his memory problem, but in the end, which in this particular movie was the beginning, there was definitely someone alive and someone dead.Something else to think about when watching this movie is the difference between the black and white parts and the colored parts. At first it may feel that only the colored scenes are giving you the part of the story you want. However this is not true. If you watch the black and white scenes closely, you can figure out many of the secrets that make this movie to intoxicating prior to them being bluntly given away in or towards the end of the film. At first Leonard may seem like a simple guy, but you must realize he is more complex than I can explain without giving too much away. Understanding that even while he has no control over his memory, he still has a large amount of control over his life will make it a lot easier to understand. In the end, my explanation will do no justice to actually watching the movie, so I highly encourage it. But do it when there are no distractions, and perhaps when you have time to watch it a second time, even if it's not until the second day, but trust me this movie gets better the second time, and in many cases even the third time. It is well edited, and except for a few lighting problems, it is very pleasing to the eye. Over all, I think it is a top notch movie, and I do not understand why it took me so long to finally watch it!",Memento
1987,RogishLvr,Memento Review,9,12 May 2005,"Memento starts out in a very peculiar way. It starts out with Leonard shaking a Polaroid picture. The more he shakes the picture, the less developed the picture is. This one scene sets the mood for the movie. In the picture we see a bloodied corpse. Who is the corpse? Why is he dead? Why is Leonard holding a picture of the corpse? Why is the picture becoming undeveloped? All these questions come to mind right at the start. Already we are filled with questions. Also, this subtle un-developing of the Polaroid picture leads into the fact that the movie is being played from end to beginning through the different scenes. Each subsequent scene happens before the scene that the view just sees. The very first scene is even played in ""rewind"" to establish this fact. We see the picture go back into the camera, the blood flow back into the body, the empty cartridge go back into the gun. All these things establish this ""back to front"" feel of the film.In the first ten minutes we find out what makes the film Memento really unique. The anti-hero of this film has this ""condition"" where he can't make new memories. He says he's had an ""injury"" that has impaired his memory. With this condition, he can't remember anything beyond his accident. He goes on to narrate about his condition and how he's learned to adapt to it. However, while he's narrating we watch him wake up and go through a routine by merely following notes he's left for himself. The filming during this is particularly interesting. It's shot all in black and white giving the viewer a much more vivid feeling of being lost. We're put in this generic motel room with no idea where it's taking place. With everything in black and white it just flows together making nothing stand out. All this increases this feeling of helplessness. We don't know where Leonard is or what is going on.One of the peculiarities of this film is the ambiguity of the characters. In the first twenty minutes of the movie the viewer is introduced to the three main characters: Leonard, Teddy, and Natalie. However, the viewer does not know who is good or bad. Teddy seems cherry and helpful;, however, Leonard finds out that he is really named John Gammell. Leonard knows that John G. killed his wife. Natalie gives Leonard information on John Gammell and so seems helpful herself. The question is which side are these two characters are on.One of the interesting techniques this film uses is how it shifts scenes. By showing us the scenes from end to beginning, the film makes the viewer feel as lost as Leonard. Each scene is started with Leonard not knowing where he is. With the film playing backwards, we also do not know where he is or what is going on. An example of this is the scene that starts in the bathroom. Leonard is holding a bottle of alcohol. He turns the bottle over and says, ""Hmm I don't feel drunk."" This shows exactly how he feels. He stops concentrating on what is going on and completely forgets what he is doing. He then has to figure out what situation he's in. With the scenes just starting and not knowing what has lead up to them, the viewer also has no idea what Leonard is doing a given situation. After the scene is played out, the scene in the timeline previous to that one is played. This way, we find out what the reason behind Leonard's placement in such a situation is.This film also shows us how much we depend on our memory. Leonard has learned how to function to some extent by repetition and routine. However, he cannot heal. His wife is dead and, as he says, ""I can't remember to forget you."" Leonard functions only on a minimal level. He cannot pick up new skills and he can't heal old wounds. Everyday he wakes up and his wife's death is fresh in his mind. Also, he can't know who is good and who is bad. Every time he meets someone, it's like meeting them for the first time. This film forces us to acknowledge how much we really do rely on our memory.The final thought Memento leaves us with is that we all lie to ourselves. In everyday life we lie to ourselves to make us happy. There are things we want to forget, and there are things we want to remember. Leonard forgot everything new because of his condition. However, he also forgot some things he should have remembered from before the incident because he wanted to. If he forgot certain things, he would always have a reason to live. We all strive for a reason to live, and sometimes we lie to ourselves to create that reason.",Memento
1988,jacktle,"if we can't trust our own memory, what can we trust? - ""SPOILER""",9,12 May 2005,"Christopher Nolan is relatively new to directing, but created a smash hit with Memento. This film is puzzling to audiences all over the world, and no one can really grasp all of its detail without a second viewing. Memento explores a variety of themes such as self-deception, existentialism, truth and the capacities of our memory. In route of exploring these themes, Nolan is able to play with the very structure of the film and what the audience has come to understand. The main highlight that separates this film from many others is the use of time. This reverse order that is shown to the audience works to put the viewer in the shoes of the main character, Leonard. They live and see what he sees. Viewers only know the events that have just unfolded on the scene and do not know what led to it. This is an elaborate gimmick that significantly gets the audience worked up and makes them question more about what they saw and what does it mean. For instance, only seeing a main get shot in the head will make viewers wonder what lead to that ultimate crime. On the other hand, seeing a man with a gun pointed to his head, they can conclude that he will get shot in the head and so the viewer is already speculating what will happen. This same trail of thought can be observed elsewhere in society. When we meet new people, we see them in the current state of time. We do not know their past, but often wonder what led to the creation of this person that we come into contact with. Where did he/she come from? What has he/she done until this time? Even after getting to know a person, how are we to be certain that what they say is the truth? So the viewer, the reverse chronological order can be seen as normal. It's just the same process they go through in ordinary life, only highlighted in this film. Of the many themes, existentialist ideas can be found throughout the film. The striving idea behind existentialism is that existence precedes and rules essence and that humans have free will and are the ultimate judge. It also states that since we are the bear sole responsibility for our decisions and actions, we must also face the consequences. Leonard's decision to deceive himself can be understood similarly. He choose to give his life meaning, by sending himself on a wild goose chase leading towards this Teddy character. He is fully aware of what he's doing, and only in that moment, because he will have forgotten all about it later. We are never certain as to who Teddy was or even what he was doing with Leonard, but we see that Leonard is exercising his freedom and will face the situation of murder. After forgetting that he had deceived himself, he kills Teddy, and now he's faced the ramification of deceiving himself only ten minutes ago. Another scene that alludes to existentialist ideas is during the narration, Leonard makes the remark that, ""The world does not disappear once we close our eyes."" This follows the notion that with our death or unconsciousness, life does not come to a stop. Human existence continues to be. It follows the idea that there is no higher being and that we exist purely for that reason and that we make of it what we do and decide, and so after you close your eyes, life continues on with whatever decisions or actions you've made. If Leonard closes his eyes, it would not change the fact that he killed Teddy and that fact will still be there after he opens his eyes. It can also be said that we live a very fragmented life. Our society today has evolved into short snippets of sounds and visuals seen on television and the radio. We can never have a complete certainty over any of what we encounter each day. The truth remains hidden by the media. When we watch television, it's only a representation of what really happened, such as images of a crash, we don't know when, how, or why it happened. But we take it without question, the details that are given to us on the screen by the anchorman. We can only have truth in what we experience directly. In the case of Memento, we can only be certain of the live events that take place in color. Its fragmented order reflects how our lives too are in pieces. Only once we placed everything in the order we want will we get a message. It's possible to get more than just one message with different placements of order. For Memento, it's not just any order, it's specifically reverse chronological order. And so we get one concrete idea or theme. Other films such as Pulp Fiction have fragmented order, but not chronological or reverse chronological order. And so they would have a more open-ended theme that will bend and flex with the viewer that perceives it. The film also questions the reliability of our memories. It has been a well known fact that the human memory can be inaccurate and very subjective. Eyewitness accounts usually aren't enough in the court systems and can obscure the truth. Our memories can drastically alter the truth as implied by Leonard, ""Memory can change the shape of a room. It can change the color of your car."" In the case of this film, the viewer must decide whether or not Leonard's memories can be trusted, since he is the one with a long-term memory dysfunction. Nolan's fresh style has won over most of the viewers of Memento. Its unique approach to time is, without a doubt, innovative. The plot is kept relatively simple which helps focus on the main idea of timing.",Memento
1989,mlgirard,Actions speak louder than memories,9,12 May 2005,"While ""Memento"" is a difficult to follow film, it's not excruciatingly difficult. I'm not certain I agree with Teddy's version of the ending (or beginning as it were), but I'm not certain I can disagree with it either. The sequence of events and the way in which they are presented to the audience as well as the reason for this manner of presentation require the viewer to question everything. Not only do we begin to question the events of the movie but we begin to question the events in our own lives and the way in which we recall them. Is it our memories which make us what we are or is it our actions? ""Memento"" is presented as what I find to be the ultimate form of a mystery; however it's a flip version of our usual concept of a mystery. Most mysteries are said to be written by beginning at the end and finishing with the mysterious beginning. These mysteries are then presented to us beginning with the mystery and ending with the resolution. This film on the other hand, seems to have been written from the beginning (if we take Teddy's revelations at the end of the film to be true) where this sequence of tracking down John G. begins and Leonard's reasons for it. Leonard sets himself up to murder who is supposedly the wrong man knowing that he will forget his own setup. But, when we watch the movie this is the ending. We begin watching ""Memento"" from the resolution of the conflict when Leonard decides that Teddy is the John G. who raped and killed his wife and enacts his vengeance upon him. Whenever a film is presented in a backwards form it's not only difficult to follow but difficult to put together and edit properly in the first place. The director used scenes moving backwards but the beginnings and endings of each scene overlapped just enough with the following scene. This method I think is what held the film together so well. It allows the viewer to question what happened just before the current scene while allowing them to see how it connects with the previous scene.Teddy at one point brings up the possibility of Leonard's pictures and notes being false and that he has no way to verify them. Leonard replies by saying that ""Memories are an interpretation, not records."" Are our memories any better than photos? Aren't they just as difficult to verify? The difference between a Polaroid and our own memory is that a Polaroid is more easily shared with another, though we may not share their interpretation of it. Memories also have a kind of emotional attachment to them. Certain memories we block out because we have negative associations regarding them whereas many other memories come to our mind quickly because they fit into our belief system more readily.I think that Leonard's photographs and notes represent our memories in possibly a more manageable form. He does indeed have an emotion attachment to many of them. So attached that he tattoos many of them onto his own skin. He takes photos of those things he deems important. These are the memories he wants to be able to recall. But what of all of the things he sees which he has opportunities to take snap shots of but doesn't? He also alters his memories by crossing out notes on certain photographs and burning others. When he decides that he wants to kill Teddy in the future he sets himself up by writing on Teddy's photograph ""don't believe his lies"". He's purposely altering the photo to associate it with something negative and to lead him to believe Teddy was his wife's rapist. Others also have the ability to alter his memory to their advantage. Natalie seems like a sympathetic person who's trying to help Leonard but we later find out that she has played with his memory to make him believe she needed help. Teddy also manipulates Leonard's memory many times, most obviously by using him as a tool to kill undesirables who could pass as Leonard's ""John G."" Others can alter our memories by displaying to us that which is false, or by manipulating memories we already have but may be vague.A number of times in the film Leonard speaks of action. Is it our memories that make us who we are or is it the actions we perform? Leonard doesn't seem to be a different person throughout the movie. He has the same memories throughout it. His mind always starts off at the same place. But, do his actions in his different points of awareness make him a different person in each? One might argue that since he's acting from the same belief system that he is the same person. I tend to agree with this. Over and over again he's given the chance of killing his wife's rapist. Over and over again he chooses to do so. While he's blocked out the memories of his actions, they all seem to be based on the same set of beliefs. It's like with the case of Sammy Jenkis (or Leonard as we later find out). Every time he gave his wife her insulin shot he did so out of love. He didn't remember that he had done this already and thus she allowed him to kill her, but he was simply acting upon those beliefs which he thought was right.""Memento"" is a true puzzle. I say this because it's not just an incoherent mix of various scenes and various people. Everything is interconnected and it's up to the viewer to piece the puzzle together. This may imply something about our minds as well. We have this collection of scenes and people in our memories and its up to us to decide how we wish to put them into place.",Memento
1990,Luckie033,memento,8,12 May 2005,"Memento is one of those films that one struggles to keep up with because of its many sudden shifts in direction. However, if one can make it to the end of the film with even an inkling of understanding, consider yourself lucky. I first saw this film during its theatrical release, but when I viewed it this time, I still found myself trying desperately to piece together the story.This film is about the main character Leonard?s search for the man who raped and killed his wife. His search has been made especially difficult due to the fact that he has a form of brain damage that inhibits him from creating new memories. (He remembers everything up to the point of his wife?s murder). Leonard is convinced that he can overcome his handicap if he relies on habit and routine. Throughout his investigation, he has collected certain clues and ?Facts,? which he has tattooed on his body. Leonard must place his faith in the notes he has written to himself over the course of his investigation. He has come to adhere to these notes without question because they are the only things he can really know for sure.The film starts with the last scene and proceeds backward as we see how Leonard has arrived at his conclusions. This film questions what is and what is not real. Leonard is asked what kind of satisfaction he can possibly get from avenging his wife?s death. After all, he would not be able to remember it. Leonard?s response is that just because a person closes their eyes, it does not mean that the world disappears. He claims that he is not seeking vengeance for himself but for his wife.Despite the unorthodox beginning and minor confusion as to what was really happening, I enjoyed this movie very much. Perhaps, I will watch it again in order to grasp an even better understanding of it.",Memento
1991,Bismarck33431,Memento,9,13 May 2005,"Memento is the story of a man battling an injury that affects his memory as he tries to uncover the identity of a man who assaulted and helped kill his wife. Memento is puzzling as it develops, rather than after its conclusion, as with some others. We are given enough evidence to speculate in a few directions as to what truly has occurred, but only over limited circumstances and time. Every facet of everyday reality is called into question, as the main character, Leonard, played by Guy Pierce, has a form of brain damage that limits his ability to create new memories. Leonard, a former claims investigator, relies on his investigative ""instinct,"" supposedly controlled by another center of the brain, to tell friend from foe. As we see, this ability is not perfect. The film centers on who among Leonard?s contacts are to be trusted and who aren't, what their motivations are, and what Leonard?s are.The story is told in reverse, in color, and forward, in black and white. In color, we watch Leonard compile his evidence in segments representing segments of his memory, with attention paid to the clues he collects and the contacts he makes, while in black and white we see Leonard relating his story on the phone to someone he believes is a police officer. Leonard believes his truth-sensing ability is contingent in large part upon judging a person's expressions and movement, and as such doesn't normally trust anyone he can't stare down. Presumably, however, Leonard answers the telephone shortly after his memory has reset, and is more likely to be fooled into revealing his thoughts on his situation before he can collect his notes and review his tattoos. Thus, a large part of the ""facts"" we are given on Leonard and his story are told through the forward-filmed segments where Leonard believes he is speaking to a police officer in confidence. Leonard eventually uncovers a tattoo warning him not to speak via phone, whereupon he breaks off this communication.The established story gets weaker and weaker as the film continues. Leonard's story of the police refusing to investigate the case, wanting for some reason want to deny that Leonard was hit by the second of assailants who attacked his wife, begins to make less sense as details are revealed. Leonard?s condition is exceedingly rare, but both he and Sammy Jankis somehow develop it. Several similar discrepancies lead the viewer to question most of the facts by the film's conclusion. Ultimately, we are left to guess at Leonard's motives, as well as his history. When Leonard dooms Teddy to eventual death by manipulating his own memories ('""don't believe his lies""), we are left to guess whether he does so out of a pathological desire to kill or because he sees Teddy as a crooked cop (who may not even be a cop) who has been manipulating Leonard's memory disorder for his own ends, killing and robbing drug dealers, in particular. When Leonard kills Jimmy, who he thought was ""John G."" at the time, only to find that Teddy had set the situation up to cash in on the drug money, it's possible that Leonard considered turnabout fair play, repaying Teddy's betrayal with one of his own. However, Teddy seems to believe he had an agreement with Leonard to split the drug money after the killing, a likely excuse, but possibly true, which would considerably alter our view of Leonard's motives.The director, Nolan, lets the viewer draw their own conclusions. The evidence that Leonard is, in his mind, a righteous killer, I believe is in his own clues. Throughout the film, we see Leonard compile and tattoo clues on his body designed to help him find ""John G."" While the ending confirms that Leonard is serious about the investigation, we are left with the possibility that he, too, is using himself as an assassin of sorts, eliminating his enemies with a clean conscience by setting them up as ""John G."" Of course, this is speculation, but not implausible. While the clues Leonard leaves for himself are numerous and all directed toward ""John G.,"" Leonard can change his goals on a whim based on any assumption, and his goals could be far from static in purpose. While it isn't clear, Leonard may have simply suspected Teddy, with Natalie planting the bait on him and/or Jimmy that lead to their deaths; however, it's also possible that Leonard has been through several ""John G.'s,"" and needs the hunt to give purpose to his life. These are a few of many possible interpretations. In the end, the director chooses to leave many variables undefined, adding to the effectiveness of the film, even if at the cost of some confusion.",Memento
1992,surfwithtom,No Loopholes at all,10,2 April 2006,"I believe this movie is perhaps better well thought out than some are giving credit for. While reading comments, I have come across suggestions that there are loopholes in the script, yet I find none. Let me explain: Loophole #1 If Lenny only has memory up until ""the event"" and currently he can only hold things for a few minutes, why is it he knows he has a ""condition""? The only tattoo visible outside of Lennys clothing is ""Remember Sammy Jenkis"". And it's kind of inconspicuous. That's for a reason (this is possibly his first tattoo). He has placed it there to be the first thing he sees at any given time when he starts from blank. He remembers Sammy's condition and it explains his own situation. Loophole #2 How is Lenny able to explain his ""condition"" and how does he know he is on a mission for revenge? Lenny explains this himself while talking on the phone. He is organized and he has a system. The second tattoo Lenny always see's is backwards in the mirror, enough to get him going in the right direction. Also remember  Sammys condition was psychological.Sammy could not learn through repetition. Lennys condition was physicalLenny can learn through repetition. This explains why Lenny repeats his story exactly the same way every time. Teddy say's it bores him, and Bert says it's creepy. Notice how whenever Lenny gets stuck he always goes for his right-hand pocket to get his pictures? Repetition and instinct. Loophole #3 Why is it that Lenny does not remember that his wife was the diabetic? Lenny explains this in the diner. ""Memory is unreliable; it can change the color of a car."" The ""first"" photograph of Lenny looks pretty old and you get the idea he has been doing this for awhile. He asks himself the question ""How am I supposed to heal?"" by suppressing memories, of course. I think it is also important to notice the flash of Lenny/Sammy in the hospital, indicating that he is indeed confused on some ""memories""these are not ""facts"". Also  take a good look at the flashback of him lying in bed with his wife. He has already started the process of getting tattoos and developing his ""system""yet..the tattoos are different, indication that his memory is not perfect.................

1993,chiragpvg,"Excellent concept, exquisite implementation",9,20 August 2014,"A decent storyline, brilliant characters, and a fantastic climax that will keep you guessing until you go online and look for those blogs saying ""Memento explained"". That's what makes Memento one of the best innovations ever on celluloid, if you exclude some of the other marvels by the same director. If I were to say that memento keeps you glued, it wouldn't be quite appropriate. Indeed, Christopher Nolan tries his best to lose the viewer by a series of scenes that run backwards in time rather than forward; giving the storyline a dramatic twist that totally muddles with your grey matter. Further, the scenes running backwards are interspersed with scenes from a parallel storyline that is actually running forwards; this storyline meeting the other storyline (that's running backwards) in the last scene of the movie.The protagonist here, Leonard Pierce suffers from short-term memory loss and is unable to form new memories consequently forgetting anything that happened more than 15 minutes ago. He has mastered the art of creating tattoos and notes to help him figure out where he is, what he's doing, who are his friends, and who're not. He's on a quest to identify and kill the man who murdered his wife, the murder being the last event in his memory.By running the movie backwards, Nolan puts you in Leonard's shoes, since at every scene you begin with no knowledge of what happened before that scene. Brilliant, eh? The characters interacting with Leonard are kind of fuzzy and mysterious, since you don't really know who they are or what are their intentions. Multiple unpredictable twists and revelations make this movie a real gripper.Go watch Memento in the theaters. Watch it again on DVD to understand it. 9/10 for me.",Memento

Tried to make me spend two hours of my life with good entertainment mixed with a more elaborated history then the Hollywood usual. And even more, i really love when them shows me that a history who not seems to have so much potential at the beginning and accomplished a whole different dimension if showed from another perspective. Memento it's a movie that can full almost completely this description, but if not do so, it's because we can saw in this movie what happened when you have a thousand of ideas, a strong will of executed them, but failed in what matters the most: makes those who watched the movie believe in that history as them believe in their owns. And this can be verified after the half of the movie, when the history, exciting and fresh until that moment, turn to a extreme confuse narrative, dialogs in the limit of the good sense, with characters taking the most strangers decisions in pro of the most complicated and untouchable final a as possible as can be. A common addiction in the post-Tarantino age. And i just can't agree with that.",Memento
1995,iamassachusetts,Memento is a poor man's Fight Club!,7,8 June 2005,"Like several of its ""neo-contemporaries"" such as 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Others' - Memento is told to us in reverse order. Leonard, played by Guy Pearce, kills the murderer of his wife in the film's first scene, and the film then moves backward from that point, in roughly five-minute increments, to let us see how he tracked the guy down, ending with what is, chronologically, the story's beginning. Made with a budget of under $5 million the movie's structure has been oversimplified. Though there is immense thought behind the story, both technically and thematically, one can't help notice that this movie often lacks cutting edge sound, direction or photography to take it to a higher level. This movie has quickly found a hyped cult status among some people. They're entitled to their opinion, but many of the negative reviews make it plain to see that this movie didn't quite grasp what director/writer Nolan wanted to portray. Still, given the way the film business works, critics usually have only one chance to see the film and have to dash out a review before deadline, so even many of the downbeat reviews should not discourage viewers from seeing Memento for themselves. Overall this move is good, but is way too overrated at number 22 all time in the IMDb top 250. This movie can't light a candle to similar structured movies like Fight Club. Can we get some more votes for Fight Club!",Memento
1996,melinda-brown1,Memento is a unique mystery thriller.,9,17 November 2014,"Memento tells the story of a widower-Leonard (played by Guy Pierce) on a mission to find the (second) man responsible for raping and killing his wife. During the attack Leonard was brutally beaten which resulted in anterograde amnesia, a rare condition which prevents his brain from storing recent memories (short term memory loss). Leonard is able to piece together the details of his attack and journey by snapping polaroid's, writing himself notes, and tattooing important facts on his body, the most significant being ""John G. raped and murdered my wife."" As you can imagine this is perfect for paranoia, suspicion, uncertainty, confusion, and betrayal. And that's exactly what you get in extreme doses.The sequence of this film is backwards. The opening scene is the climatic ending. Somehow Nolan was able to pull this off without spoiling or revealing one pertinent detail. Then it proceeds in two convergent narrative lines one from the present (backwards) and the other from the past (forward), untangling itself in brief snippets mirroring the forgetful condition of the tortured lead character. The audience, like Leonard, learns in fragments what's going on. Perfect for those who love to second guess what's going to happen, who's doing what and why.Memento is a unique mystery thriller. The climax of the movie takes you off guard and you keep on thinking about the movie for days. You have to watch it at least twice to understand each and every scene and dialogue. The movie has a great concept, and an excitingly thorough storyline. If you like to sit back and relax, this film is a waste of time. It requires you to follow along, participate and fit puzzle pieces together. Memento doesn't provide any easy or obvious answers. A must see if you are looking for something clever and original.",Memento
1997,m_ionut81,One of the defining movies,10,4 July 2005,"From time to time there appears a movie that redefines your way of thinking about cinematography. Memento is one of those movies. After I saw this movie for the first time, I had to see it again twice in under 24 hours, it was that good.The power of the movie isn't necessarily the scenario, although it is quite original and it had an Oscar nomination. The scenario in itself is quite simple and has a common theme (revenge). The way it's told makes the difference and it manages to make us experience life as it is lived by Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce).Another great thing about this movie is the cast. Every actor, and I mean every actor does an excellent job with his part. If I would of expected that from Guy Pearce, the pleasant surprise came from Carrie-Ann Moss, but then again, probably The Matrix isn't quite the kind of movie to showcase an actors' talents.Overall this movie is the best I've seen in the last 5 years by far and my personal favorite. If you haven't seen this movie you definitely should.Small comment: I've seen a review that wondered how could Leonard remember he has his ""condition"". Well that's easy, he had a tattoo on his left hand that said ""Remember Sammy Jankis"", Sammy Jankis being a man with a similar condition from Leonard's insurance agent days.",Memento

I gave this movie an 8/10, honestly it just wasn't a ten star rating,although it was well directed.

If you're not good at fully committing to a movie, I wouldn't recommend this movie to you. I like a good movie that will make you think of out-of-the-norm thoughts (and this movie certainly delivered!) All in all this was a good movie with many plot twists and a surprising ending!

1999,aearly-02191,Excellent,10,20 May 2015,"Easily my favorite film directed by Christopher Nolan, who is never disappointing. Leonard Shelby is left brain damaged after an attempt to fight the man to who killed his wife. Leonard is stuck with Retrograde Amnesia, in which he can't form any new memories since the incident. Leonard is determined to find his wife's killer, but the investigation is tough with his handicap, so he tattoos himself, takes pictures, and keeps notes to remind himself of his purpose everyday.Memento is suspenseful, thrilling, intense, and highly intellectual. Nolan presents the film in reverse, and it is as confusing as it sounds. As viewers, we see the clues and scenes just as Leonard would, without context, memory and quite a bit of confusion in 15 minute increments. Nolan does an excellent job letting viewers see the world as Leonard would, experiencing the frustration of memory loss. This movie sucks you in from very beginning, and forces you to pay close attention; you have to focus in order to catch the clues and play the detective. In the very fist scene you see Leonard murder his friend Teddy, which leaves you questioning everything within the first few minutes. It's exciting and mind-blowing. A movie that forces you to question your beliefs once you can make sense of it all.I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a good brain teaser.

2002,alexsamstheguy,Nolan's True Masterpiece,9,28 August 2017,"Christopher Nolan is arguably the greatest film director of the 21st century. We all have probably seen his classics such as Inception, The Prestige, or the newly released Dunkirk, but I feel like Memento was his one true masterpiece that everyone started to forget about, probably because it was one of his oldest films.Now Memento is probably Nolan's most frustrating film to watch, but for good reason. This film contains two different sequences that alternate throughout the film. There are black-and-white sequences that go normally, and color sequences shown in reverse order. In order to get the whole story, you have to study the movie to get whats going on in one scene, then the next color scene comes right before that. The two sequences then meet at the end of the movie.This unusual presentation gives it a unique feel as if you were in a dream that makes no sense (and I can relate to that, because my dreams are the same), rather than just showing you another dream that another person is inside (like in Inception which didn't even do the best job with dreams).And what adds on to this already original film is a little twist in the story involving Leonard (portrayed by Guy Pearce) who has to find his wife's murderer, but can't produce new thoughts in his mind, which explains why he has so many tattoos on his body. It is this highly original story combined with the presentation which proves this film to be among the most highly original.One major difference you'll probably notice in the earlier works of Nolan is the music, which David Julyan had composed most of his early films which also includes The Prestige, which his Atmospheric scores sounded nearly perfect for Memento. I will say I preferred the music in the earlier films than the newer ones, but every films scores will fit well in their own ways.Basically, Memento is what I would consider to be among Nolan's greatest, and an excellent attempt at creating an original story combined with unusual film structure. The only downside I would give is that it can be confusing the first time you watch it, but once you get the story and structure, you'll start to realize it's unique excellence that makes this Nolan's true masterpiece.",Memento
2003,adamgardner100,Simply superb,8,27 July 2005,"Momento is one of those rare films that has an original and interesting idea and manages to carry out it execution perfectly. The story follows Leonard (guy pierce) as he seeks out vengeance for the brutal rape and murder of his wife.Where this differs from the usual cannon fodder is that Leonard has no short term memory and relies on tattoos and photos to carry out his investigation as well as to survive in the dark world he now enhabits.The film is short in reverse so your perspective is always from Leonard's point of view enabling you to empathise and the director to keep you on the edge of your seat through out, never knowing who is honest and who is taking the Leonard for ride.",Memento

Memento is written very smartly (credit to his brother Jonathon Nolan) and one of the best mystery/thrillers of all time. Not because of the gore or being action packed, but because of how its set out by being backwards which is connecting us to the main character Leonard (Guy Pearce was also perfect) with short term memory loss and because the movie set out to be confusing on purpose I felt connected to the character and put me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. Note please watch this two or three to have a full understanding on what Memento really means because it can get confusing.",Memento
2005,olivierdikuta,Every end has a start,8,4 March 2016,"Every end has a start. In this review, I would like to examine the game of colors and anti-chronological sequences of Memento that Christopher Nolan uses in order to make his film look like a puzzle the viewers have to reconstitute so that they understand the story. Nothing being left to chance, quite a few sequences of the movie are in black and white, and some others are in color for only one reason : because the film is made of two parts. Sequences filmed in color are related to the main story and the plot whereas those filmed in black and white are placed in chronological order and inserted within the main story. That triggers confusion among viewers, since they have to memorize every sequences, every elements like an investigator in order to understand the denouement, not unlike Leonard Shelby, the main character, who has a poor memory because he was hit on the head. Thus he has to write post-its or get tattoos in order to remember everything. Confusion is inherently part of the editing job carried out for this movie, with the two parts of the film ending up merging into one another, and the end being right in the middle of the story. So every scenes is left to the own interpretation of viewers until the end. Christopher tends to always make movies where every sequences gives a clue to understand the movie, like in one of his others films ""Inception"". However nobody notices it at first which is why his movies should be watched at least twice. The game of colors and the anti-chronological sequences allow us to enter the skin of the main character and feel every situation as if it was actually happening to us.",Memento
2006,vapodrezov-53031,Puzzle,8,12 April 2016,"Love such an unusual movie with a twisted plot, when you enter the story from the beginning and take a look to the end, adhering to the TV monitor or computer not to miss the slightest moment. With Director Christopher Nolan is already quite familiar, or rather with his work, although I wouldn't mind personally to have a talk with him about the secrets of making interesting films. Now, this Director is different from other that creates the true masterpieces of cinema that stand out unusual stories and something new that I haven't seen we in a movie. This not only applies to the trilogy of Batman, but also such films as ""Inception"" and ""the Prestige"" in which there is everything from magnificent plot to the acting, well, plus an unpredictable ending. The movie, ""Remember"" also made a good impression on me, because I have never seen this in a movie, or rather have not seen, how is it possible to make a film on the subject of our memory and thus to create a candy with a twisted plot. The plot of the film tells us about an ordinary guy who killed his wife and he's going for revenge. But that's not all, the main theme of the film is, of course, the memory of the protagonist. The fact that he can't remember what he was like 15 minutes ago and can easily forget events as recent sleep. And here he is to somehow survive began to write hundreds of different notes and to do tattoos all over the body, not to forget for what purpose he lives. Quite a strange disease, the main character, he has to remember who he was, his past life, but did not remember what happened 15 minutes ago. It was interesting to watch as he is constantly on his notes was investigating the murder of his beloved. Another thing I liked is that the film constantly monologue of the hero, although, he says, their actions, this is even more fun to watch everything going on, it's like watching a solid detective. Acting is up to par. The main character was played by actor guy Pearce, who I don't remember much of other roles, only recently saw the film ""Iron man 3"" where he played the anti-hero of some scientist. Also in the film lit up and Carrie-Ann moss is known worldwide for its unforgettable role of Trinity in the ""Matrix"" trilogy. Also very well played and here. In General, I would say that the film is memorable because it's something new, although the movie is old already 97 years old, but still the idea is amazing. So if you liked, say, the movie ""inception"" about our dreams and this film will not disappoint.",Memento

2008,benn4302016,My review for a college class.,9,30 April 2016,"I chose the movie ""Memento"" for my IMDb review. It's a murder mystery suspense that has a tendency of messing with your mind as you get deeper into the plot of the movie. Guy Pearce plays a man named ""Leonard"" who has short term memory loss due to being attacked in a home invasion along with the rape and murder of his wife. Which leaves Pearce from making new memories and trusting only Polaroid's and notes that he had written each day. He teams up with co-stars Carrie-Ann Moss who plays ""Natalie"" and Joe Pantoliano as ""Teddy"" to help piece together a conclusion to who the man is that raped and murdered his wife.This shifty film has parallel stories or a form of cross- cutting that coexist with each other. The opening scene with Leonard killing Teddy is actually the ending of the movie. The movie begins with a Polaroid photo returning to its non-exposed state and returning back into the camera. Giving the viewer just enough time to use their imagination on what just happened to fast forward to earlier that day to explain the events that come to play. Each day trough out the movie is played out like this, end of a scene then a flash back on how they got there. Forcing a viewer to keep in mind facts that have been viewed a way to explain how they came about.In between this backwards told story, a series of black and white scenes actually play out as real time of what Leonard learns as time goes by. Learning while speaking on the phone at his hotel room to a person he does not know besides being a possible police officer. Using this style of cinematography allows the viewer to try and imagine the story in whole. Taking the clues and or facts that have been presented in the colored scenes that are moving backwards and comparing them to the black and white shots drawing the plot even thicker. Just when a viewer thinks they have an idea on what has happened to this mentally crippled man, with his life erased forever, with only the haunting image of his wife dying on the floor of their home a new plot is introduced. With a quick two minute scene his so called help turns against him tricking him into doing something he would not have done if his memories were true. Natalie the one Leonard can trust the most takes any writing device that can be used so to help him remember what happens and uses his disability to her advantage. Calling him names and talking ill of his wife causing Leonard to lose his cool and then striking her causing injury. Once Leonard has forgot what has happened she plays out a different scenario for him to believe another man caused this.The use of manipulation during this film takes the cake. Finding out that a person could take advantage of someone like Leonard is just amazing. Its one thing for Natalie to do it but to find out the Teddy all along is the man he has been looking for that committed this heinous crime is outstanding. Finding out the killer he was looking for actually was looking after him so to make sure he never catches on to the series of lies really takes a real piece of strange to pull off. This movie makes a viewer question if the mental capacity of a human brain could even decipher the amount of confusion to be comfortable with the idea of killing a man. This reminds me of the film ""Shutter Island"" a murder mystery of the same theme but with a slightly different twist. Both great movies, which may cause the viewer to question the very facts of reality itself.",Memento

One of the most genius and creative screenplay by Nolan that never gets you tired or bored with ambiguous and rich dialogue. David Julyan's soundtrack is masterful giving the sense of lost and craving, feelings that builds the rage that Leonard feels and how desperate he is to get that out of him.

It is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. And by thriller, I don't mean Dawn of the Dead.The story is amazing, the cinematography works well. This is a smart movie for smart people who like smart movies. And it doesn't have a hint of pretentiousness. It's not being different just to be different.My biggest problem with movies that have twists at the end, is that the writers/directors spend 95% percent of the movie luring you in, and then the last 2 minutes showing you how at all comes together. This was done well in ""The Sixth Sense"", and done poorly in ""The Prestige"", and ""The Lookout"". Both of the latter movies had serious promise, yet I just wasn't able to buy into them 100%. A non-issue with Memento.The movie's plot is spaced out evenly (by nature of the story) and by the time you make it through one viewing you'll know what I mean. This is possibly Memento's greatest asset. In many ways, this is a caper, a mystery, a who-dun-it. I have seen this movie many times, and I'll admit that I didn't fully understand what I had just seen after my initial viewing.I suspect that most people will need to watch the movie twice in order to have even a clue of what is going on in the movie. The real joy is watching this movie a second time through and piecing the story and chronology together yourself, then taking a step back and realizing what a masterpiece of a work of art this truly is.

Leonard, a guy with memory problems, is played brilliantly by Guy Pearce; it's a nuance performance that only gets better with age. It's a mix of naive brilliance, bumbling complexity, and each glance and facial expression is infused with the quest for knowledge and answers, something we can all relate too at some point in our lives.Memento's main hook of course, if you haven't seen it after all these years, is that the movie is played in reverse, to an extent. The colored scenes are played backwards, representing Leonard's memory struggles. It's really interesting watching a movie like this; the audience becomes armed with information that Leonard forgets as the movie goes on. To Leonard, these colored scenes are advancing normally. It gives the audience the same profoundly limited vantage possessed by Leonard. Leonard cannot remember what happened 5 minutes ago and thus enters every scene ignorant of what has already transpired. Since the movie is told in reverse chronological order, the audience also enters every scene with no idea of what has transpired. If that sounds mind-boggling, that's because it very much is. It makes a lot more sense when you watch the movie, trust me. The movie also has black-and-white scenes which are played chronologically. Eventually, the b&w scenes and colored scenes overlap. The other major characters, such as Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), highly enrich the experience with their great performances as well. Teddy in particular oozes sleaziness, but as you watch there's a lot more to his character than director Christopher Nolan may initially let on.",Memento

Guy Pearce plays the lead in this movie about a man who is determined to find his wife's killer. Head trauma has left Pearce with the inability to make new memories so he is forced to record everything on paper or in the form of pictures. He keeps all of this information with him so he can refer back to it at a later time. He is sometimes taken advantage of because of his unique mental problem and he always finds himself in a very awkward predicament. He tattoos the most important information (those relating to his wife's killer) on his skin so there is no chance of ever losing it.

Really a great movie that will keep you glued to the set. The story is incredible and the actors do an impressive job of portraying each of the characters little quirks. This movie is pretty dark...somewhat similar to the movie ""Mullholland Drive"". If you like ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Fight Club"", this is a definite recommendation! Also check out ""Boondock Saints""!",Memento

2025,midnightstorm_25,Momento: A State of Mind,8,13 January 2006,"Have you ever woken up in a strange room, surrounded by unfamiliar things, and wondered where in the world you slept last night? More importantly, have you ever wondered what exactly you had done? Picture waking up every morning asking yourself these very questions. You know who you are and where you came from but cannot recall any recent details. With this I introduce the innovative film Momento, written and directed by Christopher Nolan.Leonard Shelby, played by Guy Pearce, exists in this constant state of confusion. A massive blow to the head, acquired while attempting to attack his wife's assailant, leaves Leonard with an unusual ailment: he is unable to process and create new memories. Relying solely on a few Polaroids, notes, and tattoos Leonard vows revenge on the villain who he knows only as John G. With virtually nothing to go on and unreliable evidence, he must trust his instincts and pray for the best.Natalie (Carrie Ann Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) join Leonard in this mind boggling ""Who are you?"" mystery. We, the audience are ever watchful of their actions and constantly question their intentions towards Leonard. Natalie and Teddy poke at us, questioning what we really know. We are with Leonard every step of the way, needing to ensure his safety. The creative piecing of the story boasts this accomplishment.Nolan throws us into the story at the end and we witness the events in reverse order, which results in the same confusion bestowed upon Leonard. Never knowing why a particular event takes place locks us in the dark, throws away the key, and keeps us on the tip top of our toes. The ingenious layout of the film's story line compliments the plot masterfully. Receiving snippets of information backwards and in twenty minute increments, the audience remains disillusioned for the length of the movie.With only the Polaroids contained in Leonard's jacket pocket and the ink engraved on various body parts to reference, the audience inhabits Leonard's frame of mind. Overflowing with an abundance of dramatic surprises, revelations, and a handful of comic twists, Momento is anything but ordinary. Pearce captures our imagination and jump starts our psyche with a startlingly eye opening and convincing performance. Moss and Pantoliano reinforce the intense power and unpredictability of this film with elegance and ease. Capturing our attention and contorting it, Nolan proudly clutches our curiosity until the end, or should I say the beginning. This movie should be experienced at least once, if not again and again, but remember movie-goer etiquette and don't spoil the surprise.",Memento
2026,masimone-11709,Captivating yet frustrating,5,22 September 2018,"I did find this film intriguing as it draws you into the plot in pieces. However by the end you begin to realize that some of these pieces really don't fit together, not to mention that none of the characters are remotely likable, so ultimately you end up feeling gypped and disappointed with something that seemed to have great potential. 
And can someone please explain to me how Carrie Anne Moss' character was not the least bit suspicious when simultaneously her boyfriend went missing and a stranger showed up at her bar driving her boyfriend's car and wearing her boyfriend's clothes? Instead she was able to sympathize with him because they had both lost someone. For a film that is trying to pride itself on being clever there are far too many moments like this for it to be believable.",Memento
2027,BrunoFLamino,Masterpiece,10,21 March 2021,"Memento is careful, almost always sneaky when delivering necessary information to the viewer, because it is a film told in a non-linear way, which can be confusing, and it is made for that, and also because he wants you to put on Leonard Shelby's shoes .
The ambition to convey what it means to have a recent memory loss to those who watch it is executed perfectly, making all fear, anguish and care grow every time the film takes a step forward.The more you think about it, the more you notice striking details and the size of the film's depth.I don't remember a film so smart, it affects and touches its viewer and manages to be subtly funny at the same time.Memento is, in a way, revolutionary and confirms that Christopher Nolan is one of the best at what he does.",Memento

2029,nes-00666,Time and Perspective,8,24 September 2018,"Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" will change your perspective on how stories can be told. Being adapted from a short story his brother wrote, ""Memento Mori"", Nolan takes the story and warps it into a completely different experience. With the use of time manipulation and perspective, the viewer is forced into being immersed in this enigmatic tale. 
The story is about Leonard (Guy Pearce), a man who is looking to avenge his wife's murder. After being injured the night of his wife's death, Leonard lost the ability to form new memories making this day the last he can remember. The film starts with the image of a fading polaroid followed by the killing of a man played in reverse. The rest of the scenes are played forwards, while the chronology of most of the film remains in reverse, foreshadowed by the opening scene.
I feel that it's important to explain how the film's timeline works so I can reference it more easily. Throughout the film Nolan cleverly uses two main timelines, as well as flashbacks that happen before the main story to maintain immersion. The first being the main timeline which is being told backwards, and the second being a timeline that is being told forwards. The way that Christopher Nolan explained the timeline was by thinking of it as ""hairpin"" where the timelines meet each other at the end of the film. Scenes chronologically reversed (the main scenes) were played in color and were significantly longer than the sections played chronologically (the alternate scenes), which were played in black in white.
The use of color change here is notable because it creates a contrast that keeps the viewer's attention and makes it more obvious when timeline change occurs. As the film progresses, the main scenes were cut up evenly by the alternate scenes. Nolan made the scenes switch back and forth throughout the film while mixing in some of the other flashbacks when they fit the best. I believe this was done to add rhythm and keep the audience's focus. To get rid of any potential confusion about the chronology, Nolan made each the main scenes and the alternate scenes overlap where they were cut so the audience would know right where they are in the story. However, with how complex this timeline is, the film may not be the right choice for someone who likes stories with more of an external conflict.
To accompany the manipulation of time, perspective is used in ""Memento"" to filter information the same way that Hitchcock does in ""Rear Window"". Very few parts of the story are not told through the eyes of Leonard, which, due to his condition, makes the audience unsure of what exactly is happening throughout the film. In ""Rear Window"", Hitchcock lets you develop your own opinion on the events that are happening because you are seeing the film through the eyes of the main characters. This same theory applies to ""Memento"" in the way that if you saw the movie through Teddy's (Joe Pantoliano) eyes, or any other character, you would have a completely different film where Leonard would probably look more directly like an irrational person and maybe even the antagonist. 
While digesting the movie you must consider the smaller aspects that Nolan felt appropriate to add. For example, when Leonard tries to push the door rather than pull when walking into the Discount Inn a certain aspect of comedy is created. Also, the drastic change in sound whenever the wife's murder is being shown adds an aspect of horror to the film. These smaller details scattered throughout the film make viewers that may have not been entertained by the main aspects of the movie, have some relatability with the film. 
When you combine time manipulation, use of perspective, and Leonard's short-term memory loss, you get the final product. If you are a fan of stories with an internal conflict and a complex plot you are bound to find entertainment here. Even though this film might not be for everyone, the experience is unforgettably unique and will leave anyone thinking for days after you watch it. Every time you watch this film your opinions change, and you notice more and more depth in places you couldn't imagine.",Memento

The best moment in the film is when he is talking on the phone and discover his most recent tattoo...what a total sense of a ""timestopmoment"".

2032,reduct101,"For the reviewers that complain of ""plot holes""",8,6 January 2007,"*** This comment doesn't directly contain a spoiler, but it does reference a website (http://www.memorylossonline.com/spring2002/memlossatmovies.htm) that would spoil the movie for anyone that hasn't yet seen it ***The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was one of the most intriguing films I'd ever seen. However, I didn't think it would hold up to repeated viewing because much of the plot complexity is achieved by careful editing, which surely couldn't work second time around. Also, I thought I had the plot mostly figured out and didn't think I'd gain that much from another viewing (especially since the soundtrack and visuals are nothing special). Note on the editing: the story is not simply told ""backwards"" as some people would have you believe (each scene's time-line goes in the right direction!) but the scenes are placed (mostly) in reverse order. The narrative in Pulp Fiction also benefits from the order in which certain events are told and I still don't find that device having any adverse effect on my enjoyment of that movie. Also, I think that some people fail to realize that the main character is trying to make sense of his recent past and we are seeing events unfurl as he tries to piece together his ""evidence"" and use his powers of logic to uncover the truth (while other characters try to deceive him).I'm glad to say that I was mostly wrong about having the plot figured out first time around, because I'm just as confused this time - I got to the end of the film and came to a different conclusion. I suppose this is one of the strongest features of this movie - there is no certainty. The ""facts"" need to be treated with suspicion and their worthiness needs to be judged. You have to interpret each scene (presented to you not from the main character's memory of course, but instead the result of his applied logic and reasoning). Even then, you can put any spin on it you like. I assumed that I wouldn't be as engaged with the movie as I was the first time, but instead I found that I was analyzing the clues in a different way. The first time I watched it, I expected a big reveal, as in the ""Usual Suspects"" and until now I thought I'd got it.I have just finished watching this movie for the second time and found myself drawing different conclusions from it. In fact, I'm left thinking that I could watch this movie a third time, prejudiced by my second viewing, and still come up with a different interpretation.There are many people who have commented on this film stating that it is full of plot holes. Few of these people care to explain what these plot holes are. Some do, and most of those people take issue with the main character's memory loss in that he remembers certain things, but not others. http://www.memorylossonline.com/spring2002/memlossatmovies.htm Is worth taking a look at if you have already seen the movie and wish to read an informed critique on the way that ""short-term"" memory loss is handled in the movie. To quote from this source: ""Leonard Shelby suffers from profound anterograde amnesia, which is depicted accurately in the film"". The article goes on to infer that Shelby suffers from psychogenic memory loss in addition to anterograde amnesia. This would explain why apparently Shelby doesn't want to accept the truth when he discovers it.Usually, when I suspect the integrity of the premise upon which a work of fiction (or supposed fact) is based, I find that my suspicions are justified. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the research done for the book (upon which Memento's screenplay is based) is accurate and forms a powerful device to enrich the plot and engage the viewer, even for two (or perhaps more) viewings. Still, you can't beat the confusion you feel as you're watching it the first time.",Memento

2034,debireis,Who am I in a Capitalist world?,8,21 June 2016,"Memento Who am I in a Capitalist world?*** This review may contain spoilers *** You watch Christopher Nolan's Memento like you build a puzzle. In a reverse chronological timeline story, each scene is important to the next, but in this case the next is even more important for you to understand the previous scene. Complicated? Memento presents a three- act structure in which the three acts are cut together, whereas its structure presents two linear timelines running against each other, which are cut together and meet in the middle, separated by the transition from black and white film stock to color. The confusing narrative recalls the tension of our daily lives where we are so involved in our mundane personal world that we forget to ask ourselves what is going on. We got stuck in the past, immobile, without any hopes about the future, forgetting living the present. Memento can be seen as neo film noir when it attempts to re-establish the moods and themes of classic noirs flourished in America in the period of 1941-58. Refashioned for present-day feelings, working as metaphor for a symptom of society's evil. In this context, Memento can be seen as the gloomiest of all noirs because it shows anxiety, pessimism, and suspicion as a result of the tensions and insecurities of our modern time. The problems presented are real and contemporary; they belong to us, our despair regarding the world's future. Who are we? And for what purpose are we here? In a capitalist world where the greed and corruption seems to be engulfing us into a decadent society, it shows us another kind of darkness: the psychological torment where our minds are stolen to the capitalist service.",Memento
2035,geojulien8,Worst movie ever!,1,19 March 2006,"I sincerely don't understand why so many people find that movie so good and have ranked it so high. I am pretty sure that's because they mostly are impressed with its originality (only good thing i can say about it) and the fact that they don't know much of cinema classics. I am sick and tired of people pretending they are real cinema ""connaisseurs"" always referring to mostly recent big American blockbusters which by the way are getting worst and worst for decades... I recently discovered the IMDb site and was very satisfy with its content at first. But the comments are mostly made by north American residents (wich i am by the way, living in french speaking city of Québec) who rarely see foreign countries films... That ignorance of foreign cinema led people to rank ""Memento"" in the top 10 of this database. I mean come on and please do me the favor to open your eyes a bit! If you don't want to commence by viewing old black & white classics which could seem boring for young audience, please try with contemporary directors as Austrian Michael Haneke or French François Ozon who made wonderfully original movies like ""Code Unknown"" or ""Swiming Pool"" which are i think even available in dubbed versions for an English audience. So make an effort and search for it instead of being crazy about nonsense movies such as ""Memento"" or Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr."" Otherwise, do like me and watch old fashion classics from Orson Wells, John Huston or H.G. Clouzot...etc.Julien in Quebec city.",Memento
