0,TheLittleSongbird,Not quite shimmering inside fear,7,28 March 2018,"Saw 'Annihilation' because it was recommended by a friend, and also the idea was absolutely brilliant and one of the most unique for any film seen recently and the trailer showed a lot of promise. Also have a lot of appreciation for sci-fi/horror, Alex Garland's previous work is very interesting and Natalie Portman has given some great prior performances.Can definitely see why 'Annihilation' has proven to be so polarising with audiences and IMDb reviewers. Had problems with it myself and it didn't quite match up to the brilliance of the idea, but had also a lot of admiration for its brave if imperfect execution and bold ambition. It almost does live up to its idea, but doesn't quite. As somebody who has seen her fair share of films with potentially good concepts marred by underwhelming, and in a lot of cases terrible, execution, that was refreshing. 'Annihilation' is uneven and has problems. Most of the characters, apart from Lena and to a lesser extent Ventress (there was a little with Cass but only for two or so lines in one short scene), are underwritten archetypes, Josie was not very memorable and there was absolutely no point to the man in the stuff with the affair. Lena's back-story was mixed. It is very nuanced and affecting in the scenes between her and Kane, but is far from successful in the stuff with the affair, which felt out of place, pointless, came out of nowhere when introduced, was ended very quickly and never heard from again. The dialogue is very clunky at times, particularly with Anya and some of the back-story, while there are some less than logical character behaviours and some bogus science, especially the explanation for the mutated insides (beyond moronic and nearly ruined one of the film's most stay-with-the-viewer scenes).Not entirely sure what my stance on the final half an hour is. It is choreographed cleverly in movement, is visually stunning, is an atmosphere whirlwind and does probe though and discussion. It is also one of the strangest last 30 minutes of any film seen in a while and it takes a lot for me to be confused, this portion of the film was a head-scratcher for me and the aftermath discussion with my sister didn't really clear things up. If it was meant to be ambiguous or open-ended, it for my tastes was taken too far, don't mind being challenged but being confused is a no-no (in no way intended to be snobbish).However, 'Annihilation' looks wonderful, one of the best-looking films seen by me recently. Some of the landscapes are pretty spectacular, as is the look of the shimmer. The creatures are very well done, especially the bear creature, and evoke a great deal of creepiness. It's beautifully and atmospherically shot and stylishly edited. The music is haunting and ominous, doing a great providing slow-building suspense and mystery without making it too obvious prematurely. Some clever use of sound too. Some of the dialogue is thought-provoking, like with the interrogations. Regardless of any reservations with some of the storytelling, 'Annihilation' is a triumph in terms of atmosphere and as an experience film. There is a slow-building tension that doesn't become dull, enough of it is thought-provoking, tense and emotional and there is a subtle tension. Two scenes stand out, and are two of the most disturbing scenes of any film in a long time. One was with the mutated insides, word of warning- don't watch this while eating, being someone who made that mistake. The other was the second bear attack, a creepy build up then crescendoing in a way that was unnerving and truly frightening. The film is also thematically interesting, familiar themes in both the genre and in Garland's previous work but built on a grander level.Most of the acting was good, especially the astonishing Natalie Portman giving one of her better performances since 'Black Swan'. Oscar Isaac and Jennifer Jason Leigh are the best in support and Gina Rodriguez fares quite well. Tessa Thompson is too underused to make an impression and her character too bland. Garland directs with great skill.Overall, not quite brilliant and sometimes frustrating but ambitious, admirable and interesting. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Annihilation
1,Leofwine_draca,Weird and not entirely successful,5,15 March 2018,"ANNIHILATION is Alex Garland's follow-up to his EX MACHINA and, although not perfect, a film I enjoyed a little more than that science fiction picture. This one's a fantasy/science fiction/horror production about an expedition to a remote installation, where an all-female team of scientists discover the presence of something very, very odd which has the power to alter and transform nature itself for the worse. It's a heavily derivative production, short on plot and heavy on cool visuals, copying the likes of THE THING and Lovecraft at times, although never quite as interesting as its forebears. Natalie Portman makes for a dullish protagonist and the supporting cast aren't much better, Oscar Isaac included, although I got a kick out of Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance. The film utilises some surprisingly poor CGI at times but it also has some very gory interludes you don't normally see in a mainstream picture. It's weirdest at the climax, which is the part of the film I liked the best.",Annihilation
2,SnoopyStyle,intriguing but flawed,6,16 March 2018,"A meteor strikes a lighthouse. A shimmer descends and slowly expands. It's three years later. While a cover story is maintained, the military has been unsuccessfully investigating the phenomenon. Lena (Natalie Portman) is a biology professor and former army soldier. Her military husband Kane (Oscar Isaac) is damaged after returning from the Shimmer. He is the sole survivor of his expedition. At the military base, psychologist Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is leading the next expedition which is all female. Lena decides to join them.This is Alex Garland's next film after Ex Machina. It is fascinating sci-fi but also flawed. There is no denying the visual imagination and moody atmosphere. At times, it is great horror and quite frankly, I want more body horrors. There are ideas and images never seen before. The bear cry is incredible. The flower people and the glass trees are beautiful. It is all to Garland's credit that this has his signature vibe. This is a great unique vision but the flaws do hold it back.First, the flashforward wrap-around gives away too much of the ending. The movie does insert a little uncertainty with the climax but it would be so much more compelling to leave the finish without any clues. The flashforward gives no additional tension and only acts to drag down the pacing without being useful. Second, three years is too long. It's hard to believe that the secret could be kept for three years. What about birds and sea life that migrate away from the Shimmer? It seems logical that some birds would mutate. By squeezing the time span to something like three days, it would increase the logic and the intensity. It gives the crisis immediacy. One would also expect the military would figure out some basic stuff. They should at least have a menagerie of mutant creatures. Third, the lighthouse is right next to the ocean. One would think it's easier to travel there by boat. I assume flying would be too dangerous but the movie should deal with a fast boat idea. Finally, this has a nice horror vibe but it could have been truly disturbing. Garland has a better eye for beauty than horror. He is more concerned with visual rather than plot logistics. The movie is beautiful and moody but the writing is sloppy and the pacing is halting.",Annihilation
3,claudio_carvalho,Weird and Flawed Mess,5,15 March 2018,"When the viewer reads in the cast of a sci-fi adventure the names of Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh, he or she would certainly expect an enjoyable film. Unfortunately ""Annihilation"" is a weird and flawed mess, with the most ridiculous attitudes. Kane is missing and when he comes back home, Lena kisses her husband and notes he is coughing up blood. However she does not take any medical care. She teams up with four women that have no military training but they go to the shimmer with heavy weapons and not escorted by military. They do not carry any masks, gloves, breathing apparatuses or any other protection. The biologist Lena touches the flowers and other mutations in the shimmer without mask or gloves. One of the girls is attacked by a mutated alligator in a house nearby the swamp. They kill it and use two canoes to explore the swamp. Is it necessary to the story the pointless affair of Lena with the African American Dan? Why she lies to her two mates telling that the shortest way to leave the shimmer would be close to the lighthouse? There are many other flaws and a disappointing conclusion. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Aniquilação"" (""Annihilation"")",Annihilation
4,nogodnomasters,I don't think it wants anything,8,19 March 2018,"A meteor crashes near a lighthouse and creates a spreading magnetic zone that is mutating life. Lena (Natalie Portman) a John Hopkins biologist joins four other women to go into the magnetic zone, known as ""Area X"" to gather information. Other people that have entered never came out, except Kane (Oscar Isaac) Lena's husband. This was a decent science fiction film with neat special effects. I was sucked into the film, like I was ""Yellow Brick Road"" being the only person on the planet that liked it more and wished this film had ended the same way. Netflix still had ""made for TV"" dialogue that lacked any kind of zip. Guide: F-word, sex, no nudity.",Annihilation
5,kosmasp,Looking good,6,19 June 2018,"Visually this is stunning or rather completely speaking from a technical point, I don't think you can find (m)any flaws here. And it also is clever with its timeline. Keeping the audience on its toes and having us guessing where this is going and also keeping us in the dark about things, that actually should be clear at that point in time (because it already happened you see?).It still feels like something is missing to make this big. Maybe I would have been more impressed if I had seen it on the big screen - unfortunately we were not given that choice, since a cinematic release was scrapped. But Netflix got the rights for the movie and at least we got to see it in good quality. Acting wise this is really good and there are some surprises at hand - if that is what you are looking for",Annihilation
6,Sleepin_Dragon,"Stunning to look at, just doesn't satisfy.",4,16 March 2018,"Im starting to think this site is set up to contradict my reviews, each time I seem to like a film it has a bad rating, and vice versa. I'm stunned by this films review both here and on Netflix. Of course it's well acted, it's imaginative, and it's visually dazzling, but ultimately it just doesn't satisfy. The start is intriguing and well executed, but as it develops it just seems to lose its thread, and the last third of the film is virtually impossible to follow. I kept thinking of Under the skin, very Avant Garde, very visual, just fails to fully engage as you watch.",Annihilation
7,classicsoncall,"""We're all damaged goods here.""",7,11 March 2019,"Well, it had a promising start and the physical aspect of The Shimmer was impressive, but as the story progressed it just seemed to meander in a way that suggested that the script writers were working on the fly. Which is what would have explained things like the ginormous mutant crocodile and weirdly convoluted bear creature. Speaking of which, did anyone else consider it somewhat foolhardy that the expedition party would take off in boats through the swamp right after the croc incident? Talk about poor judgment, but maybe it's just me. The concepts explored in the film were rather unique, like the corrupt mutations of form inside the Shimmer boundary, and the DNA refractions giving rise to all sorts of inventive looking plants and animals, but again, that goes to my earlier comment about winging it with any idea that sounds good on paper. I kind of compare this one to 2016's ""Arrival"", another film I felt had no consistency for internal logic but was considered monumental by a lot of viewers.So if we take this story to it's logical conclusion, then it's the mirrored Kane (Oscar Isaac) that makes it back to civilization following his ordeal in The Shimmer, while it's the 'real' Lena who reunites with him in the isolation chamber. And yet they embrace in total acceptance of each other for having survived their respective nightmares. Seems if it happened to me, I'd be a little creeped out by the whole prospect. And regarding Lena's affair with her boss, what did that have to do with anything? For this viewer at least, the only one who got it right was Jennifer Jason Leigh, who explained at one point that the remaining members of the expedition were disintegrating, which in an apt comparison, was exactly what happened to the story.",Annihilation
8,BA_Harrison,"As Natalie Portman replies during her interrogation scenes in Annihilation, 'I don't know'.",4,7 July 2018,"I don't know what writer/director Alex Garland was thinking. I don't know what the point of the film was. I don't know how so many silly plot holes could have made it into the final script. I don't know whether I ever want to see another Garland film again. I don't know what Jennifer Jason Leigh has done to her face. Natalie Portman plays biologist Lena, who volunteers to join a dangerous mission into the 'shimmer', a mysterious, expanding zone caused by an alien force. Inside the zone, Lena and her all-female cohorts encounter strange mutated creatures and fear that their own DNA is being slowly assimilated.A boring build-up to the mission; some brief excitement involving the mutated animals; a smattering of gore; lots of introspection and ponderous pretentiousness; plenty of scenes that take an awful lot of swallowing; and an ending that makes very little sense: Annihilation is the perfect companion piece to Danny Boyle's even more disappointing and even more perplexing sci-fi Sunshine, which was also penned by Garland.One thing I do know: I won't be giving this one a second watch anytime soon.",Annihilation
9,paul_haakonsen,You might be annihilated from boredom...,3,9 June 2018,"I found this movie by random luck on Netflix. I decided to give it a watch solely from what the synopsis read.I didn't even know who was in the movie, so it was a nice surprise to see that they actually had some interesting choices of actors and actresses in the movie. However the cast could only do so much for the movie, because it was horribly mauled by an abysmal script and ludicrous storyline that the movie was just fast sinking without any chance of rescue.The visuals in the movie were phenomenal though. Lots of nice details and that undead bear was especially amazing to watch. But special effects only carry a movie so far.The characters in the movie were one-dimensional and the lack of proper storyline just cut the movie down short and sent it spiraling downwards fast.I even dozed off twice along the way, because the story was so pointless and ridiculous. I did manage to stick with it to the end, but even the ending didn't even make any attempt to correct all the wrongs throughout the entire movie.This is definitely not a movie that I will be watching a second time around. Nor is it a movie that I would willingly recommend to anyone.",Annihilation
10,Coventry,Portman in mutation-Wonderland,4,3 October 2021,"To put it short and rather bluntly, I'm sure there exists an audience for ""Annihilation"" but I'm not a part of it. I'm also convinced the film deserves its place in horror history, right now as well as in many years from now, but I'm not likely to ever watch it again. Movies like ""Annihilation"", and probably even the entire repertoire by Alex Garland, require a specific type of patient and open-minded viewers. It's slow paced, extremely convoluted, philosophical, and constantly raises more questions than any screenplay could possibly ever answer.I found most of the film rather boring, quite frankly, especially the long build-up to the expedition and the exaggeratedly psychedelic last half hour. The middle section contains a handful of powerful and exhilarating moments, notably the ones involving mutated animals (like crocs and bears) and bonkers ecological phenomena, but gets ruined by supposedly clarifying flashbacks that clarify nothing at all. There are some bright ideas in the basic premise, the visual effects are impressive, and the cast is excellent, and yet ""Annihilation"" is a very frustrating effort.",Annihilation
11,george.schmidt,One of the year's best and the best sci-fi film since 2016's Arrival,9,23 February 2018,"ANNIHILATION (2018) ***1/2 Natalie Portman, Oscar Isaac, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tuva Novotny, Tessa Thompson. Smart and spooky sci-fi thriller with Portman as a biologist who enlists on a mysterious, secretive military involved project in the aftermath of her soldier husband (Isaac) returning only to go into a vegetative state from exposure to the alien 'shimmer' he encounters and apparently the sole survivor. Filmmaker Alex Garland shrewdly adapts Jeff VanderMeer's novel with élan and inventiveness (i.e. the platoon sent are all female and barely a scoff or comment on the fact) while employing some practical and impressively cosmic acid trippy visual CGI f/x to boot (sparing no gore either so the squeamish you've been warned). Scanned elements of past genre classics like John Carpenter's The Thing, Aliens, and even dare I say A Sound Of Thunder whereby nature takes a turn for the worst...or does it. One of the year's best and the best sci-fi film since 2016's Arrival (come to think of it a kissing cousin).",Annihilation
12,view_and_review,Nearly Nodded Off,5,11 March 2018,"A shimmery presence appeared near some swampland in the U.S. and it began to grow ever so gradually. Like with all mysterious presences and appearances the military is all on top of it. Every person that has gone in never returned except one individual. Desperate for some answers the military then sends in a team of female scientists--well three scientists, a psychologist and an EMT. Immediately they began experiencing weird things and things only got weirder.This movie never drew me in. Of course there's a slight intrigue with the new shimmery amorphous thing enveloping the area around it but it was nothing new. Cinematically we've had plenty of unexplained and unidentifiable entities show up at our doorstep. Even once inside the foreign glow the science fiction of it wasn't mind-blowing either. The movie was light on the science fiction, OK with the action and light on the story in general. The actresses did a fair enough job but it's nothing I'll be taking time to watch again.",Annihilation
13,neil-476,Visuals triumph over story,5,25 April 2018,"Lena is a geneticist whose husband reappears after going missing on a mission a year ago. All is not well with him. Lena and 4 other women follow in his footsteps into a phenomenon called the Shimmer (from which he is the only person to have re-emerged in its 3-year existence), something which is growing from the site of a meteorite hit. Strange things happen.Natalie Portman is Lena in Alex Garland's follow-up to Ex Machina, a cerebral sci-fi mystery. There is good and bad here. The good is mostly visual: there is fantastic use of locations and effects, and terrific cinematography.The bad is that the story seems to think it has great depth, but I couldn't see any. It seems to think it's pretty brainy, but I thought not. It contains things like flashback sequences which ought to be reflected in what's going on presently but, if so, I couldn't see how. In short, I found it a straightforward story which went on far too long, and with an incredibly jumbled conclusion.I was impressed with the look, and some intense emotion in the first 5 minutes, following which it dragged.",Annihilation
14,evanston_dad,What a Mess,3,20 September 2018,"A convoluted, murky screenplay and poor execution dulls any effectiveness this cerebral sci-fi horror movie might otherwise have had. Natalie Portman plays perhaps the most morose character ever put on screen, who joins a bunch of other volunteers to go exploring in a sort of radioactive bubble that has already brought insanity and death to others who've entered it. Okay, so she has a pretty good reason to be morose, but still. Would it have killed the filmmakers to give us a joke or two? What they find in this bubble cannot be explained by anyone who is telling you the truth about their experiences watching this movie, though one thing that I can tell you with certainty is that the visual effects used to conjure them are awful. The ending I suppose is meant to make us gasp in surprise, but my attention was diverted by the paint drying on my walls so I unfortunately wasn't able to give the makers of this movie the reaction they wanted.""Annihilation"" evokes ""Avatar"" in its production design (except for a late scene that rips off the look of ""Alien"" wholesale) and ""Apocalypse Now"" in its ""venturing into the heart of darkness"" psychology. It would have done better to avoid evoking any of those movies, because it made me just want to watch one of those instead of finishing this one.Grade: D",Annihilation
15,bombersflyup,"Five women walk into a bar, no make that a mysterious zone...",3,18 November 2018,"Annihilation is indeed a joke, with one interesting idea amidst hours of pain.What's the purpose of the film? People will sit through annoyance and nothingness for one creative idea, but trash a great new film like ""Life"" because they think it rips off ""Alien."" The film fails, jeez. It's nothing more than a girly drama, having me ask questions I have no interest in knowing the answers to. Maybe, put a bit of focus into the characters and the dialogue and stop needlessly jumping in the timeline with things you don't even care about enough to make time for. Every performance other than Portman's, unworthy of my time.",Annihilation
16,trashgang,it's not going to be for everyone,7,20 March 2018,"Be honest, everybody is talking about this weird sci-fi flick. And once it came out it was available on Netflix so the whole world could watch this. And so I did and was it worth the hype. Welll, those who can dig arty flicks it's one for them. It's slow-paced and it doesn't have some action to make it an action flick. On the other hand, being a sci-fi even that is so weird because the shimmer is in fact the rare thing that is on earth. What it does is explained all over the flick and for some the explanation can be to hard to understand. But it's also filed under horror.On that part I can agree on so many ways. It's never scary and you can see it coming when the creepy parts are there but the effects used for the horror are really top-notch gore. Being a rather gory flick makes it not watcghable for the squeamish. If you can stand a slow-paced flick with a weird story and nice effects overruled sometimes by pure gore it's surely is one to stream on youtr Netflix account. The gore did it for me and the effects but being so slow is what takes it a bit down on my rating.
Gore 3/5

17,deloudelouvain,Refreshing atmospheric sci-fi story.,8,15 July 2018,"After a week of watching nothing else than stinkers I finally got to watch a movie that I liked. I wouldn't put Annihilation in the horror genre but in the science fiction instead because that's where it really belongs. A well filmed story with good visual effects. A story that was for once completely new and refreshing, and not the usual stories we watched over and over again. The soundtrack gave the whole movie a weird atmospheric ambiance, sometimes a bit creepy, and that was a very good move in this movie. The cast was also well chosen, nothing bad to say about anybody. Apparently some reviewers want some logic when they watch a sci-fi, and that's the proof they should just not watch sci-fi's and just stick to drama's. Annihilation might not be everybody's cup of tea but it for sure is mine.",Annihilation
18,siderite,"Weird fiction, indeed",7,15 March 2018,"I read the book, first in a trilogy, before I watched the film and in that review I bet that the movie will be better than the book, which I found pretentious and opaque. Well, I can't say if I won or lost that bet. The movie is certainly different, with many ingredients added and a lot of them removed. I thought that the acting was OK and that the visuals were very good. The only issue I had was with the story, which only ponders on things, without actually explaining or expanding on any of them. That is not a bad thing, pondering, but I guess I had to be in the mood to understand the intent of the writer/director in adapting a book that I equally didn't understand. Perhaps my knowledge of programming and AI made me like Ex Machina a lot because I understood both people and non-people in it. In Annihilation I didn't get either.To paraphrase the character in the film, Alex Garland didn't intend to destroy the story with this film, he just wanted to change it. I don't know into what and I don't feel he even knew I was there. Of course, that may be all me.",Annihilation

This is A Spell-Binding Sci-Fi Film, that brings its mysterious world with a thought-provoking twist.'Annihilation' Synopsis: A biologist (A Terrific Natalie Portman) signs up for a dangerous, secret expedition where the laws of nature don't apply.'Annihilation' has too many themes & yet Garland, a well-deserved Oscar-Nominee for the unforgettable Ex Machina, brings a sense of doom & humanity to the intense & at times, scary proceedings. 'Annihilation' is not merely a Sci-Fi flick with a horror element, this is a deeply poetic & heartbreaking story, that deals with life, death, self-destruction & the consequences of life. I won't give away all any spoilers here, as this is a film, that needs to be viewed with all its might. Also, considering the amount of themes & ideas 'Annihilation' has to offer, everyone viewing this film, just like me, will have his/her own ideology of the film. And that's the beauty of Garland, who creates a scary & beautiful world, where violence, grief & realization play a big part. I was hooked all through.Garland is master. 'Annihilation' isn't an easy film to write or direct, but Garland takes the challenge & delivers one of the strongest Sci-Fi Films of recent memory. This is spell-binding stuff, that challenges its viewer to think beyond the general. Garland's Writing & Direction, both, are top-notch. Rob Hardy's Cinematography captures the unsettling mood, with brilliance. Barney Pilling's Editing is bang-on. Art & Costume Design are fabulous. Visual Effects are sharp. 
Ben Salisbury & Geoff Barrow's Score is haunting. Performance-Wise: Natalie Portman's portrayal of a troubled protagonist looking out for answers, is one for the ages. Its a magnificent performance, that shows the Oscar-Winner at her brightest. The superb Jennifer Jason Leigh brings depth to her part, proving once again how underrated she is. Gina Rodriguez is in top-form. The actress commands the screen. Tessa Thompson & Tuva Novotny lend remarkable support. Oscar Isaac, as Portman's husband, is in superb form.On the whole, 'Annihilation' is brave, absorbing & challenging. Just sit back and behold.",Annihilation

Clearly it can be classified as a mystery sci-fi type drama with a horror blend feel to it. Plus the all star female cast rocks with good on screen chemistry as Natalie Portman, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, and Jennifer Jason Leigh make a smart and sexy elegant cast.The story centers around Lena(Portman) a biologist who goes on a wild adventure and expedition after her husband strangely vanishes. Along the way this new explored area is like a disaster zone as it's like an environmental plague. Helping Lena on her fight and journey is Dr. Ventress(Jennifer Jason Leigh) Anya(Gina Rodriguez) and Josie(Tessa Thompson). Along the way this battle comes a battle of wills and determination to live and survive as the battle is a combination of science, psychological matters, and emotions that even involves battles against alien like creatures and monsters. Plus the trio of Lena, Ventress, and Josie all become damsels in distress as they are tied up and gagged during this crazy trip. Overall this is one sci-fi film that makes a viewer think and wonder about the afterlife, and other world beings that exist as everything is connected to life, environment, and the mind.",Annihilation
21,lasttimeisaw,an amalgam marries a sui-generis brainwave with a less ground-breaking template,7,18 March 2018,"The follow-up to his enterprising AI thriller EX MACHINA (2014), novelist-come-filmmaker Alex Garland's second feature arrives sequentially in cinema first, then to the Netflix platform, a unique distribution exigency borne out of the ongoing profit re-shuffling feeding frenzy between old guards and future norm, boisterously in the name of the art of cinema. ANNIHILATION, an adaptation from the first novel of Jeff VanderMeer's awards-reaping SOUTHERN REACH trilogy, structures its narrative in the time-honored trope of an (all-women) expedition team entering a terra incognita shrouded by extraterrestrial might (aka. The Shimmer, a slowly expanding electromagnetic field hitting our planet like a bolt out of blue), coming in for both extrinsic and internecine perils, until the last remaining human contending with the cosmic unknown and metaphysical transformation against all odds, and is furnished with an open-ended coda to mine the seed for a possible sequel (that uroboros tattoo is repeatedly flagged up to elicit piquant fan theories). But conceptually, ANNIHILATION upholds an invigorating idea of random DNA synapsis in its core, catalyzed by the improbable phenomenon of prismatic refraction, and substantially surmises a possibility that the highly intelligent alien life form could be also flexibly amorphous, and it messes up all DNAs within its territory, knocking out animal/plant hybrids through haphazard genetic splicing and mutation, all the way to a physical replication of our doughty heroine, the biologist Lena (Portman, a relentless standard-bearer of true grits), which seemly consummates its nefarious mission of infiltration with a scorched-earth annihilation appearing more baffling than its scientific info-dump in the words from the physicist Josie Radek (a scare-easy Tessa Thompson), prior to her philosophical acceptance of her own botanical transmogrification.As a Sci-Fi food-for-thought, the film wisely refrains from over-applying cheap jump-scares and unsightly shocking images to spook audience, and its SFX team fairly dreams up an unworldly biome with breathtaking futuristic grandeur and presents varicolored, cannibalized flora-and-fauna bricolage to handsome effect, albeit one might cavil that occasionally its hue feels solarized. Heralded by the psychologist Dr. Ventress (a peerlessly detached, unforthcoming Jennifer Jason Leigh), the forlorn-hope also including Anya Thorensen (Rodriguez, fraught with agonized paranoid in a fanatical about-face), a gay paramedic and the geomorphologist Cass Sheppard (Novotny), is composed with a quintet of damaged goods, each is scarred by the disenchantment of their respective lives, which points up a meta-reference of human's self-destructive frailty, that resounds with a tint of hard-earned poignance. Rounding out its female-fronted cast is a terrifically enigmatic Oscar Isaac as Kane, Lena's soldier husband, whose mystical return from the Shimmer after a nearly one-year-long disappearance is the stimulant of Lena's own involvement. On a whole, ANNIHILATION is a welcome expansion of our obsession with the mighty, unknown life force, an amalgam marries a sui-generis brainwave with a less ground-breaking template, moderately vamped up by a state-of-the-art mythical touch.",Annihilation
22,sddavis63,It Gets Progressively Weirder As It Moves Along,3,29 May 2019,"I watched this because of Natalie Portman. I'm a fan of hers and have generally enjoyed her work, but found ""Annihilation"" to be one of her weaker films. The entire cast, in fact, left something to be desired - to me at least. It's largely an all female cast, following five ""soldier-scientists"" on a mission into a state park to investigate a strange phenomenon known as ""The Shimmer"" which seems to be gradually expanding and swallowing up everything it encounters. But the five women seemed to have little chemistry with each other. Portman's ""Lena"" is the central character. Her husband was sent on a previous expedition to investigate ""The Shimmer"" and was presumed to have been lost, only to mysteriously re-appear a year later without explanation. So Lena volunteers to go on the next expedition. The first hour or so wasn't bad as it established the basic mystery, but as we went deeper into ""The Shimmer"" with the team, the movie became weirder to the point of being just plain weird by the end.""The Shimmer"" causes plants and animals to mutate and seems to act as some sort of mirror or prism as it reflects what it discovers back by creating new - and often dangerous - forms of life. We see (until the last 20 minutes or so) mostly mutated (or mirrored?) animals. They're created by CGI and frankly I thought the CGI effects left a lot to be desired.Although we do find out essentially how ""The Shimmer"" works, its origins and its purpose are left largely unresolved - which was perhaps deliberate. Maybe there simply was no explanation. It was just a mysterious phenomenon that will never be understood. But the lack of explanation and then the open-ended ending left me with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. It was yet another example of a movie (and, more correctly, movie-makers) that simply seem to presume that a sequel will be coming regardless of the critical response.If a sequel does appear, I personally won't be watching it. I found this disappointing in the end and - after that first hour of establishing the mystery - largely unfocused and often barely coherent. (3/10)",Annihilation
23,Hellmant,"Very dark and bizarrely beautiful sci-fi masterpiece, but I can also see why some don't like it.",9,23 February 2018,"'ANNIHILATION': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new science fiction horror flick from writer/director Alex Garland (who also performed both duties on 2014's 'EX MACHINA'). It's about a biologist who volunteers to lead an expedition into a dangerous environmental zone, after her husband comes out of the zone seriously injured, and the sole survivor of his expedition. It's based on the novel, of the same name, by Jeff VanderMeer. The film stars Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Tuva Novotny and Oscar Isaac. It's gotten nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, but it also performed really poorly at a test screening (which prompted a Netflix release overseas, instead of a theatrical one). I think the film is a very dark and bizarrely beautiful sci-fi masterpiece, and I can also see why a lot of people won't like it. A year has passed since a team of soldiers entered an environmental disaster zone, and never returned. One soldier, named Kane (Isaac), suddenly reappears, much to the desperate relief of his biologist wife Lena (Portman), but he doesn't remember where he's been or how he got home. Then he has a sudden medical emergency, and is rushed to a hospital. In an attempt to help him, Lena decides to join a team of all female scientists, on an expedition back into the environmental zone. Things of course don't go as planned.The movie is very hauntingly beautiful, and it's especially highlighted by an awesomely haunting score, and some breathtaking visuals. The story is interesting, but it's definitely slow-paced, and the climax is much more of an intellectual payoff than a spectacular action scene (which many viewers might be hoping for). So I can definitely see why some people would hate this film, but I loved it. It's one I definitely won't forget anytime soon too, and it's great to see Natalie Portman (my old favorite actress) back in top form!",Annihilation
24,cherold,Atmospheric,8,8 June 2018,"After watching this film I read the reviews voted ""most helpful,"" which all were long lists of plot holes and logical inconsistencies. They are absolutely right. I didn't think about it while watching the film, but when it's pointed out, yeah, nothing in this movie makes much sense.But I still really liked it. It's creepy and atmospheric and more concerned with the psychology of people on a suicide mission than on the nuts and bolts of scientific investigation. It's often intense , usually beautiful, well acted, and had some really weird and mesmerizing moments. I won't argue that you should forgive it for its plot holes, or that it has any deep meaning, or anything like that. In fact, it's probably easier to make a convincing argument against the movie than for it. I'm just saying, I really liked it.",Annihilation

26,MOscarbradley,A waste of the acting talent involved.,5,10 January 2019,"I'm all for more good roles for women n the movies; that's just stating the obvious but does re-inventing the roles once played by men in the horror and sci-fi genres really mark a step forward? Surely the talents of the actresses in these films could be better served than in such fare as ""Bird Box"" or here, in ""Annihilation"", a kind of feminist take on both ""Stalker"" and ""Predator"" from sci-fi aficionado Alex Garland. It ought to be as pretentious as hell and for most of the time it is, (the po-faced performances certainly don't help), although if you accept the film's ridiculous premiss it is quite imaginative at times and even quite beautiful. Of course, I would still prefer to see the likes of Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh in real roles that stretch their dramatic talents rather than simply marching through the jungle as the female alter-egos of Arnie and Vin Deisel but then, hey...if they are enjoying themselves and earning a buck who am I to spoil their fun.",Annihilation
27,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"For all its flowers, it doesn't even stop to smell the roses.",4,22 July 2018,"For all its pretences of being 'highbrow', meditative and 'smart' science-fiction, 'Annihilation (2018)' relies so incredibly heavily on overt and repetitive exposition that it would be difficult to call any aspect of it 'ambiguous'. This becomes very grating, very quickly because all of its ideas are spelled out through stunted delivery of a subpar script, one that's over-explanatory, repetitive and totally not representative of how actual people speak to one another. For example, ""it's not like us... it's unlike us"" is a real line and there are plenty more like it. Overall, there's little to like here, considering that the actual experience is a dry and dull one regardless of its eventual payoff (or lack thereof). The visuals, which are supposed to be a big draw, don't even work all that well, with some instances of copy-paste CGI and sometimes generally subpar digital work standing out strongly and making the world even less believable than it already is. Plus, the cinematography is generally too bloom-heavy and slightly muddy for my liking, despite its purposefully 'UV-filter' feel. In general, it feels as though the film is perhaps aiming too high, trying to convey a 'mind-blowing' concept that just isn't there, and it ends up feeling pretentious and aloof because of it, unable to withstand the pressures put upon it by its own creators simply because it isn't well conceived, or executed, enough to do so. It seems to be asking us to wait through the less interesting segments because it will have a reveal that will make it all worthwhile, but there are two problems with this. Firstly, the 'reveal' (which isn't so much one big thing as several small ones) isn't strong enough to retroactively remedy the picture's weak points, not the mention the fact that several of its plot-points lack a consistent logic and don't stand up to all that much scrutiny. The second problem is that this way of thinking is flawed in the first place. No matter how great a final reveal is, no matter how much it changes the narrative in retrospect, it can never make up for a boring experience. If the picture is good, it will be entertaining the first time around, even if it is more so the second (with the knowledge gained from having already seen it). This flick decides it is okay to be dull because it reveals information periodically and has 'big ideas' it wants to explore, but there's nothing all that complex and everything is explained anyway. A second viewing wouldn't be anymore 'rewarding' than the first. There's always the possibility (or probability), however, that this wasn't on purpose. It's not entertaining simply because it fails to be so. It's so concerned with its underlying themes and ideas, and hammering them home to us to the point they become obvious, that it actually forgets to be enjoyable. 4/10",Annihilation
28,bowmanblue,"Interesting, high-concept sci-fi",8,16 March 2018,"'Annihilation' is certainly an interesting film. Not just because it's a sci-fi flick that does more than just pit humans against monsters (or some other tired and unoriginal premise), but because it also takes a snapshot of the film industry today. Apparently, the film was released in America and didn't do too well at the Box Office. Therefore, it's now been released on Netflix and suddenly it's a hit. This is great news for Netflix (and I guess the film company who made it?) that their film is gathering such unexpected momentum, but it does ask the question whether many companies will bother releasing films to the cinema when they do so well on the (new) small screen?Anyway, another reason why the Netflix audience got so excited at 'Annihilation's arrival on their platform was that it stars Hollywood heavyweights Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaacs (and, no offense to Will Smith, but I'm guessing you could say that they're the - current - 'biggest' names to ever go (almost) straight to that platform). So why did the film end up there?As I said, it's science-fiction, so that already makes it a 'niche' genre which doesn't always guarantee that the film will be bankable ('Star Wars' franchise excluded!) and it's not all out action. A large bubble of weirdness (known in the film as 'the shimmer') appears in America, swallowing up the land mass it's landed on. No one knows what it is, where it's come from and every attempt to send a team in has produced no returns. Therefore, when biologist Natalie Portman's soldier husband (Oscar Isaacs) becomes the first and only man to return from this place, only as a shadow of his former self, she decides to become part of an all-woman team to find out what happened in there.Now, don't get me wrong, just because this has a few more 'higher sci-fi concepts' than your average action flick, doesn't mean there aren't the odd shoot-out or monster, so don't worry, it's not constant talking all the way through. The five ladies have to use their machine guns as well as their minds in order to navigate what waits for them inside the shimmer. That's all I'll say about the plot, as there are plenty of interesting moments that you may not see coming. I've seen some criticism online about how it's 'too hard to understand.' It's not. It's actually pretty straightforward, however the ending is a little 'interpretational' and I couldn't help but think of '2001: A Space Odyssey' when looking for a comparison.It's written by Alex garland, who's most famous for his other 'thinking' sci-fi film 'Ex Machina.' I think if you enjoyed that you should appreciate this (even if they're not much alike!). The special effects are reasonable. Obviously with sci-fi if you're looking to create a world truly unlike our own, you're going to have to employ the use of CGI. Mostly it worked, some times it looked a little too 'Phantom Menace' if you know what I mean. If you've seen either Natalie Portman or Oscar Isaacs in anything latterly, you'll know their acting is top notch, so it's always worth watching for them. Don't expect an action epic, but, if you're a fan of slightly slower, more deeper science fiction then you should definitely give this one a watch - especially as now you don't even have to queue at the multiplex to see it!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Annihilation
29,ThomasDrufke,Gorgeously Terrifying,9,1 March 2018,"Once again, I have to reinforce how much I love original science fiction films. Yes, Alex Garland apparently took some liberties with the source material, but the feeling I had watching Annihilation was unlike anything I have had in quite some time, perhaps since seeing Interstellar in 2014. The wide range of tone and emotion this movie can display is unbelievable. I went from being invested in the intellectual elements of this sci-fi feature, to beyond terrified of the creatures that inhabit ""The Shimmer"", to fascinated by the mind-blowing choices the film makes in the third act. In every sense, Annihilation is a unique piece of art.The main story thread sees Natalie Portman's 'Lena' team with Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason leigh), Anya (Gina Rodriguez), Sheppard (Tuva Novotny), and Josie (Tessa Thompson) in an attempt to figure out why no human life form seems to come back after visiting The Shimmer. It's both a science fiction adventure film, as well as a psychological horror/thriller. All genres are equally as compelling to see play out here.While it can be a slow moving film at times, its methodical pace plays into the epicness of the ending in my opinion. You may not be as impressed or as shocked by the events of the third act if you don't get a confusingly plodding first hour and a half. And I say that in the most affectionate way possible. I don't like building up the suspense or anticipation for a film to people who haven't seen it, but it's worth noting that I'm still buzzing after it's been 5 days.There's no sense in trying to explain some of the events of the film or what it means, considering I myself am still trying to figure out beat for beat, and it's better to go into this film completely blind, as I mostly did. However, I can say that the performances (by an all female lead cast) are terrific, the special and practical effects are terrifying and beautiful, and the direction is brave. From a science fiction perspective, you can't really ask for any more than that.9.5/10",Annihilation
30,Cineanalyst,Tarkovsky-esque,7,27 May 2020,"As others have pointed out, ""Annihilation"" bares striking similarities to the films of Andrei Tarkovsky, such as ""Solaris"" (1972) and ""Stalker"" (1979). For a picture about an alien ""shimmer"" that works as a prism refracting and recreating already established sources, that's rather appropriate. Moreover, the prominent placement in the narrative of video cameras and doppelgängers reinforces this reflexivity--a movie about creation, about movies. Too bad the rest of the narrative, its framing, the psychological problems of the characters and the time-shifting plot is bland. Following a title card introducing ""the shimmer"" with a scene of extramarital sex was an especially unfortunate choice. And that's in addition to the unrealistic nature of medical professionals and scientists who don't don gloves to collect samples, let alone hazmat suites to enter a known contaminated area, playing soldiers with automatic rifles that only one of them seems familiar shooting with. The CGI environment looks pleasant enough, though.""Annihilation"" has taken on added resonance today, as of this writing, due to the real-world pandemic. The shimmer here is initially treated as potentially radioactive or as a sort of virus, as it slowly moves to cover and contaminate more and more of the world. Such a picture of shared, interchanged DNA, including the particularly horrifying melding together of a bear-like creature with their prey, has become especially relevant in a real world where quarantines, social distancing and personal protective equipment is being widely used to prevent real viral interconnection.",Annihilation

There were lots of groans in the first half from those I watched it with, and I don't think director Alex Garland helped himself with the way he told the story. It was pretty cool to contemplate an alien presence that interacts in such a fundamentally different and unexpected way, which was reminiscent of Lem/Tarkovsky's Solaris, and I also imagined a subtext of death being an annihilation of one's atoms, returning them to the universe, where they live on in myriad other forms. There's no poetry here though, just an Americanization of Solaris and Stalker, and I just wish it had been better executed.",Annihilation

35,Bored_Dragon,Beautiful pretentious crap,6,3 April 2019,"If you've watched the movie ""Ex Machina"", you may notice that ""Annihilation"" is the work of the same author. Although thematically they have nothing in common, the style of Alex Garland is quite recognizable. The movie has quite an original premise, or at least I've never encountered anything like this, and it is visually beautiful, therefore in the theater, it is probably breathtaking and diverts attention from the fact that it has nothing else to offer. Characterization, which in the previous film was Garland's main asset, here is almost non-existent, so the characters are unimpressive and do not provoke sympathy. ""Annihilation"" is an SF drama-adventure with a touch of horror, but it is neither particularly dramatic, nor exciting, nor scary, yet it is full of holes and illogicality. I can not say I was bored, but with characters whose fate I did not care about and a story that did not keep me at the edge of my seat or woke up any emotions, it left me quite indifferent. There is a possibility that I did not understand the film, but it somehow seems to me that the problem is that the author himself did not have a concrete idea of what he wanted to achieve with this film, so he just let his imagination run wild without any particular goal, blurring the lack of essence, and even a common sense, by excellent cinematography.6,5/10",Annihilation

38,tabuno,"Even with various weaknesses, offers up a refreshing focus on new dazzling images",8,28 January 2019,"This mystery monster thriller is visually daring in its set design and goes a fair amount towards exploring the more substantive mental gyrations of hard core science fiction. Even with its various weaknesses, this movie's offers up a refreshing focus on new dazzling images such as evoked in Avatar (2009) ground breaking look and patience in providing screen time for cognitive and emotional insight into humanity as explored in Arrival (2016).The flaws uncovered in this movie include the minor omission of the likely absence of recording keeping even with the field explorers experiencing apparent amnesia, the exploratory team's surprising lack of team camaraderie for such a venture, surprising weapons ability among all specialists on the team, the allowance for only one person to go on a rescue mission, and the introduction of apparent divergent specialists on the exploratory team and their under-utilized presentation of their different skills. A better presentation of more realistic team building can be found in the sci fi television series Defying Gravity, 2009 and Michael Crichton's Sphere (1998). The strange creatures that inhabit this movie can be found in a compilation of other movies that in some ways are even more imposing and threatening as depicted in the 2005 sci fi television series Threshold, John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) as well as Ghosts of Mars (2001), Serenity (2005), The Devil's Tomb (2009), Phantoms (1998), and Epoch (2001). The creative and captivating set design and the eerie alien environment has echoes of elements found in Solaris (1972, 2002) and Lost in Space (1998). The ultimate reveal loses some of the power of the feminine presence on screen as the movie seems to fall back into the macho stereotype and the resort to power, panic, and destruction instead of the more relational connection to curiosity and hopefulness as suggested in Alien: Resurrection (1997) and Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) or even the fascinating progressive evolution as typified in Oblivion (2013) and Moon (2009).

43,paulclaassen,This one will make you think...,7,10 June 2018,"The first thing you notice about 'Annihilation' is the stunning visuals, and then how very different this film is to mainstream sci-fi movies. Lena (Portman) is by far the strongest character and the most likable, maybe because she's in it for very different reasons than the others. She's in it for revenge and to find answers. For the other characters it is just a mission. Once inside the Shimmer it gets really interesting. The film's color is just so brilliant! Inside the Shimmer, we experience what appears to be the next step in evolution, only much faster than is scientifically possible. The Shimmer is creating a New Earth, a perfect world the way it was supposed to be before Man intervened. Notice how the film constantly shows cell splitting - from the opening scene until the end. This is essentially what is happening here, in my opinion: the Shimmer is Earths way of 'splitting cells', thus creating the new world. This was completely and utterly beautiful and food for thought. I can't help but wonder 'What if...'.As the film progresses, we see nature start to inhabit the human DNA, the human voice and even human behavior to a certain extent, yet it is clear the new world has no place for humans, and therefore will try to annihilate them. The Shimmer was supposed to be the beginning of this annihilation, but as we later discover Man once again destroys nature. By obtaining a blood sample from Lena, the Shimmer splits these cells and creates a new human specimen, only more superior, as it mirrors Lena in her actions and even thought. This completes the next step in evolution. In this new world, everything is connected in perfect harmony, though, so when the core of this world is destroyed, the new world is now being annihilated. But ultimately - as is the custom with nature - it finds a way to sustain. I won't spoil the ending, but it was absolutely awesome!",Annihilation

45,tomgillespie2002,Cannes should really reconsider their stance,9,4 April 2018,"The debate surrounding Netflix's validity as a cinematic platform was in full swing last year, with Cannes Film Festival announcing that the streaming service will no longer be able to enter their original movies into competition, following a negative reaction by audiences who jeered and booed whenever their logo flashed on screen. Should only movies released in cinemas be classified as 'true cinema', or is this just blatant, ignorant snobbery? Great directors such as Steven Spielberg, Ingmar Bergman and Rainer Werner Fassbinder have all produced fantastic work for the small screen, so should films be judged on their quality alone, regardless of how they were released to the general audience?With The Cloverfield Paradox, Netflix have proven they can offer an alternative to a production company sweating on the success on something they have poured millions of dollars into. The fact that it was a steaming pile of hot mess aside, Cloverfield drew far more viewers than it would have ever dreamed of if released on the big screen. With Annihilation, director Alex Garland's first film since 2014's fantastic Ex Machina, Netflix were used a compromise when Paramount weren't happy with the film's ending, which they were concerned would be 'too weird' for a mainstream audience. Garland stuck to his guns, and Annihilation is now available to us as the director intended. Despite the mass of crap they produce on a monthly basis, the billion-dollar company clearly love cinema, supporting artists without being too concerned about whether or not it will make money, as the subscriptions will still be paid regardless.The strongest argument is that when the final product is as thrilling, engaging and original as Annihilation, who the hell cares if it was projected onto a cinema screen or not? (It did receive a limited release elsewhere, but not here in the UK) Garland's second movie backs up the idea that the 28 Days Later and Sunshine scribe is one of the most important voices in science-fiction at the moment. Loosely based on the novel of the same name by Jeff VanderMeer, Annihilation sends a group of women into an scientific anomaly known as 'The Shimmer', without making a big deal of the absence of a male lead one would expect from such a genre piece. Our protagonist is Lena, played by Natalie Portman, a cellular biology professor grieving over the year-long disappearance of her husband Kane (Oscar Isaac). Believed to be long-dead, Kane suddenly reappears one night, unable to recall where he has been or how he made it home. After he starts to cough up blood, they are both abducted on the way to the hospital at gun-point by a special government unit and taken to a secret facility called Area X.It's here that Lena learns of The Shimmer, a mysterious oily dome covering much of the southern coast and constantly expanding. Many have made their way into the otherworldly place, but none, save Kane, have made it back out. Communication cuts out as soon as anyone enters, so the one overseeing expeditions, psychologist Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh), is just as clueless as anyone else. She plans to join the team recruited for the next expedition, which consists of physicist Josie Radeck (Tessa Thompson), paramedic Anya Thorensen (Gina Rodriguez), and anthropologist Cass Sheppard (Tuva Novotny). Keen to uncover the truth about Kane's time spent within the Shimmer and how he made it out alive, Lena persuades Ventress to allow her to join the group, using her military background and scientific expertise to plead her case. Things quickly turn weird as they pass through the seemingly inexplicable border, as the unit wake up to find they have been in there for three days and cannot remember a thing. As they venture further into the Shimmer and towards a lighthouse believed to be sheltering the source of its power, they witness the law of physics increasingly defied and reshaped.Annihilation had the same effect on me as 2016's Arrival. It feels important to a stagnating genre, offering both riveting set-pieces and exploring areas of science that will have you constantly engaged in order to have any hope of understanding the story's revelations. As plants start to interbreed, strange animals emerge as terrifying amalgamations, and time feels like it has no place or purpose, the film offers convincing explanations. You may not work them out until days later - and Annihilation will likely linger for a long time afterwards - but it will all make sense, even if the climax offers one of the strangest, most beautiful, and undeniably creepiest scenes in recent memory. But this isn't just for science boffins. A found-footage moment that brought back terrifying memories of Event Horizon and an encounter with what can only be described as half bear/half wolf with a scream to give you nightmares only heighten the growing sense of unease as the movie progresses. Garland has the courage to run with his ideas and glory in the ambiguity of it all, and he can only be commended for refusing to alter his vision for any gutless studio heads. Cannes should really reconsider.",Annihilation
46,Thanos_Alfie,Mysterious zone...,6,27 June 2020,"""Annihilation"" is an Adventure - Horror movie in which we watch a biologist, an anthropologist, a psychologist, a surveyor and a linguist going into a very bizarre zone where many strange things happen and they cannot be explained.I liked this movie because it had a very simple but interesting plot, with some plot twists that I could not predict and very good interpretations made by its cast. I also found very interesting the idea of creating a movie like this, with such a mystery and suspense which was combined very well with with mystery. The interpretations of both Natalie Portman who played as Lena and Tessa Thompson who played as Josie Radek were amazing. Finally, the direction which was made by Alex Garland who is also one of the writers, was very good and he presented very well the history behind each character, something that made very clear for the audience which was their purpose and their main goal in the movie.",Annihilation
47,cruise01,A stunning direction and cast but very slow moving.,6,24 February 2018,"Rating 3 out of 5 stars. (Fair)Annihilation is suppose to be a smart science fiction horror film with a sharp direction and a plot that has themes that the audience can discuss right after it ends. It is a fair film. The direction is sharp and done by Alex Garland, whose previous work was Ex Machina which was a great film that also had a theme in there. Annihilation is at times beautiful with its set pieces on a landscape were laws of nature does not really bide by the rules when it comes to mutation. The cast ensemble was also decent as well. It is not Alex Garland's best film, as this sci fi movie does require a lot of patience with its slow moving story.Lets talk about the pros about this film. Annihilation is definitely one of those films that audiences will either be liking or hating it. Especially with its plot. I do not want to give away much details or spoilers about it. Besides it is about a group of military scientists led by Jennifer Jason Leigh, Natalie Portman, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, and Tuva Novotny. They enter a mysterious zone known as Area X, were there is this force field wall called the shimmer. They enter it to locate the source and origin of this quarantined zone which seems to be growing. Once inside, they discover that landscapes and species mutations are beyond their imaginations. There is some creatures or cross breeding's with the animals. The plants are growing on an indifferent cycle as it evolves. But the scientists questions only remains about what happened to the previous several expeditions? Why has only one survivor from the previous expedition made it out? What is the purpose of the shimmer? The plot is mysterious and there is a twist that may throw the audience off course with the film. I like the twist. Sure, when it came to the third act of the movie, the climax was very trippy and visually stunning to look at. It is very unsettling and disturbing at the same time. The cast ensemble was great. Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, and Tuva Novotny were great. Every one of there characters were not perfect and all had a connection of some kind on why they were chosen to enter the shimmer. Oscar Isaac's only had a short on screen time, mainly seen in flashbacks. The set design of the colorful plantation landscape was stunning. The visual effects were okay. Alex Garland unsettling direction was good too. What I did not like about the film. It is a slow moving film. You might even be asking yourself during it. If anything is going to happen at all. The group enters the shimmer, they are losing their awareness, and are traveling to get to the source of the shimmer. But going from one set piece to another and to stop and observe does go a long way. Nothing happens for most of the film until the climax. It does get boring. Then, there is flashbacks with Natalie Portman's character of her and her husband (Oscar Isaacs). Than the film flashes forward with Portman's character explaining the events in the shimmer. It does mess with the pace of the film and slow things down even more. I also felt like barely anything happened during most of the movie. The group come across a crocodile that has teeth like a shark. They come across mysterious plant life that is forming a shape of a standing person. And they see footage from the last expedition which may be disturbing. And than a giant sized mutated bear looking thing. But there was no suspense or thrills. I am sure the climax was suppose to be unsettling awe moment. But it was trippy and weird. But it missed the opportunity of being exciting. Overall, Annihilation is a fair science fiction film. The cast was good. The visual effects and set pieces were fun to look at. The direction and plot was sharp and driven with themes that may have people talking about. If you have the patience to sit through unnecessary flashbacks and its slow moving pace with nothing happening for a long running time. Than you may enjoy it. I will recommend the film as a rental, unless you're a huge fan of the sci fi genre and enjoy films like Arrival or 2001 Space Odyssey than I say see it in theatres.",Annihilation
48,zkonedog,Pure Science Fiction,9,13 June 2018,"In today's moviegoing culture, I feel as if pure science fiction tales are heading the way of the dinosaur. Don't get me wrong...there are plenty of films that are set in sci-fi type environments, but most of those either lean heavily on the ""science"" in sci-fi or end up being little more than character pieces. I believe there is room for a return to science fiction in its purest form, and that is exactly what ""Annihilation"" provided me.For a basic plot summary, ""Annihilation"" primarily focuses on Lena (Natalie Portman), an ex-Army veteran (now biologist) whose husband still serves. After being absent for close to a year, that husband (Oscar Isaac) suddenly walks through the door to their home. What Lena discovers is that he has been inside ""The Shimmer"", a top-secret project to find out just what in the world has materialized seemingly out of nowhere and is spreading at an alarming rate. Lena herself enters the Shimmer with a team of women (Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tuva Novotny, & Tessa Thompson) in hopes of finding answers both biologically and otherwise.What I absolutely love about ""Annihilation"" is that it is filled with great visuals and ""what-if?"" moments, to me the essentials of strong science fiction. Does everything necessarily make sense or can easily be explained? Certainly not. But if it could, it would cease to be science-fiction. As viewers, I think we are so used to being over-explained or relying on hard science to bolster our enjoyment of these types of movies that we forget about that ""what if?"" factor. These are the types of films that aroused my curiosity as a child, and apparently they still do to this day.Besides the great, intriguing visuals and interesting plot, the acting is also top-notch. It's especially great to see Portman back in a leading role, as she is such an incredible acting talent. ""Annihilation"" could actually stand up as almost the blueprint for making a female-centric film in Hollywood these days (very much a hot-button issue in the industry). Never once is it pushed or preached, but 80% (or perhaps higher) of the film's scenes feature exclusively women. Never once did I think ""I wish this had more of a male presence"" in the slightest. I think it just goes to show that if you conceive a good enough film and cast solid female actors, the results can kind of speak for themselves.For the second time now, director/writer Alex Garland has caught my attention with a science-fiction flick (the first being ""Ex Machine""). Like I've mentioned, these are the types of films I sought out as a younger man (full of wonder and possibilities) and am always ""up for"" even today. Garland's work, then, will continued to be closely monitored by this film fan.Thus, I have nothing but praise for ""Annihilation"" and hope that it does well in streaming & home video rentals (it kind of got pushed out of cinemas fairly quickly). While perhaps not quite as good as ""Ex Machine"" or ""Arrival"" (similar-fare flicks), this one is very, very close.",Annihilation
49,Floated2,Confusing and ultimately boring,3,22 February 2020,"With a relatively interesting concept, good visuals and a solid cast, this film was anticipated by many prior to its release. Annihilation started off quite decent and unique but as the film progressed ave as more characters came into the picture, it became slightly more off put and confusing.Also relatively boring and not as entertaining or action packed as expected. This film feels as if it tried too hard in being intelligent and smart and the end result resulted in it falling short. A step down from Ex Machina.",Annihilation
50,eddie_baggins,Another Sci-Fi win from Garland,9,13 March 2018,"It's a shame as a cinemagoer living outside of America that the only way in which I get to see Alex Garland's sophomore feature film (arguably his third behind the camera if recent articles about the British writer/director helming most of 2012's Dredd are true) and Ex_Machina follow-up Annihilation is in the comfort of my own home via Netflix, after the film's international cinema release was forgone in light of a nervous studio fearing a large scale cinematic schedule was not the financially viable option.I'm certainly not complaining about the fact I get to watch Annihilation so soon after its financially disappointing release in America, as Garland's adaptation of Jeff VanderMeer's well-regarded book of the same name was my most anticipated film release of 2018, it's just that a sci-fi/horror hybrid as unique and visually stunning as Annihilation is makes one wish you got to take in the experience in the format these type of experiences are made for; the big screen.Rants aside, Annihilation proves that Garland is no one hit wonder and the man who's been responsible in some way or another for some of the great sci-fi's of the modern era (Sunshine, Dredd, Ex_Machina) has with this haunting and captivating ride well and truly established himself as one of the most exciting filmmakers working in the industry today.In an era where so many films feel cut from the same cloth and originality is harder to come by, Annihilation sees Garland deliver a narrative that all at once feels fresh, intriguing and captivating in its entirety and while not everything within this visually dazzling experience clicks together perfectly, there's little denying this intellectually rich and mind-bending ride will stick with you long after the credits have rolled.Following Nathalie Portman's ex-soldier turned biologist Lena's journey into a seemingly extra-terrestrial in nature phenomenon known as The Shimmer with a collection of fellow female comrades, Annihilation offers Garland a chance for his imagination to run wild as the true nature of this world unlike we've ever seen before begins to make itself apparent.Led by the always committed Portman, Annihilation creates an almost constant tension and palpable feeling of uneasiness as Garland's colourful visual palette melds together with some striking visual effects and an atmospheric and surprising score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury and while Annihilation is foremost and foremost a sci-fi thriller, Garland's ability to combine that with genuine horror chills is quite masterful with a scene concerning an untypical-bear likely to remain one of the year's most unsettlingly creepy cinematic moments.It's not the only cinematic moment within Annihilation likely to stick with many viewers throughout the year, as like Ex_Machina, Garland has crafted an unpredictable and memorable final act with Annihilation's latter stages, a collection of surprising and narratively rich moments that are likely to cause Annihilation to be one of those sci-fi events that remains in the consciousness of much discussion in the years to come.Final Say -A hauntingly beautiful and richly constructed narrative help make Annihilation a sci-fi like we've never been before and while Garland reaches for heights he sometimes can't quite grasp, Annihilation's ability to surprise and mesmerize makes it one of the years must-see experiences and a new addition to the top-class sci-fi efforts of the modern era.4 ½ phosphorus grenades out of 5",Annihilation
51,leplatypus,Another rising star annihilated (web),1,29 March 2020,"After the clothes hanger acting talent of Monica Bellucci, now, with those last reviews, i settle the accounts with bourgeois Natalie Portman!In the beginning, Natalie was fresh, kind, strong, tender and had inspired choices to do powerful movies (Anywhere, Heart, V, Goya, ...).But since her oscar, her wedding to a Frenchman, she has fallen into (and not access) the big celebrity Ghota and her career becomes worthless: only Bo-Bo movies (Planetarium, the 2 Malick), hollow ass licking soup about elites (Jackie, Dior ads), harmless pseudo rebellion (Vox, Eating animals), brainless Ubermensche brawls (Thor)...Unlike true activist colleagues (Leonor Varela for example), Natalie has become the parrot of good liberal conscience without much thinking about it! Not a single word about social inequalities and for sure Dior & Jackie can't help her! Vegan crusade: it's bad to eat animals? a chance she doesn't live in Prehistoric time! and how do you nourish an overpopulated earth?But with this movie (at last i come to it), she twists the neck of 2 more fights: guns & timeisup masquerade!Very concerned about guns control in public, she previously did a gun-slinging movie called JANE GOT A GUN! HE, Natalie, be smart & think! either the guns are bad or they are good but you can't do hypocritically a movie like this (with a gun, i kill my problem) and says the contrary after! Here, in this poor sci-fi, it's the same thing in worse: again with a gun on the poster and again a gun to solve the problem!Next, this all women cast is stinking; especially in the military world! Again, in a more wise past, women didn't do military not for discrimination but just because WAR IS UGLY! What do you prove killing other human beings! Bravery, Liberty ??? well, look Weir's Witness and then meditate! And what about this imposed feminine cast? Nobody believes it and this fake belief just bores every one! Humanity is not brave women + stupid men! And for sure, women are discriminated in US, Hollywood? Again an assumption that means nothing: Jews were discriminated by nazis, Blacks were discriminated in Apartheid! Even your own country discriminated blacks with segregation! Your Goya movie was about Christian inquisition which in the name of a loving god, murder innocents! That's discrimination, that's pain, that's suffering! What do you wait to do movies about this ???

52,TheMovieDiorama,Annihilation thematically conveys the entirety of life and humanity's own self-destruction.,10,9 July 2018,"When your directorial debut is 'Ex Machina', the enormity of the pressure that follows rises at an extraordinary pace. To actually better it would be an achievement so rare that it would cement Garland as one of the best sci-fi directors working today. Ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves the third perfect film of the year. A group of military specialist scientists enter an expanding quarantined zone known as 'The Shimmer', where their own sanity is put to the test. Mutating landscapes, transmogrifying creatures, psychological paranoia. On the surface, this seems like a traditional sci-fi mystery which, by the time the conclusion proceeds, will confuse many viewers. However, beneath the vibrancy of the colourful mutated flora and fauna, is a multi-dimensional conceptualised story that attempts to tackle some very heavy themes. Humanity's effortless inevitability of self-destruction, the mind's susceptibility to grief during times of loss, the intoxicating enormity of life itself. The symbology used throughout, particular the representation of flowers, is nothing short of genius. Genuine thought-provoking science that entranced me at every second. Garland seamlessly intertwined unadulterated character development with intelligent themes to create a complete story. The perfect equilibrium for science fiction. His directing techniques captured the resonant enigma of 'The Shimmer' and the characters' real time consciousness equally, thus crafting an utterly memorable piece of cinema. The cast were phenomenal at continuing the mysterious undertone that Garland intended to create. Unknown to reasoning until the last chapter. Words cannot describe the sheer beauty and captivation that the last chapter withheld, my body was perched on the sofa and my jaw hit the floor. Hardy's gorgeous cinematography accompanied by Salisbury and Barrow's eerily calm score produced an entirely foreign environment within our own world. Needless to say, Annihilation is phenomenal and undisputedly obtains the perfect rating.",Annihilation

In my view it is always rather an indicator that some piece of art did something well and interesting, if the audience is divided in its evaluation/assessment.I like some of Alex Garlands stories/movies a lot (Sunshine, 28 Days Later, The Beach, Dredd) - so I like Annihilation.

56,matthewssilverhammer,Ambitious Disappointment,5,1 March 2018,"Remember when alien movies were just about little green men or robot humanoids coming to conquer Earth? Annihilation is another in a long line of modern sci-fi films to be more interested in the philosophy than the practicality of extra-terrestrials. But unlike Under the Skin or Europa Report, its ponderous nature never quite reaches its point. It's definitely a metaphor for something, but what? Aging? Marriage? Dementia? Time? Death? Perhaps a second-viewing would clear some of this up, but then I'd have to slog through this movie again.
An unknown object has crashed onto earth, causing a slowly growing ""shimmer"" wall that seems to make anyone who enters it disappear. In so many ways, it's just a lesser version of classic films. Like Tarkovsky's Stalker, it's comfortable with saying ""I don't know"", but more out of confusion than intrigue. Like Villeneuve's Arrival, it uses alien beings to talk about humanity, but with little emotional impact. Like Carpenters' The Thing, its unexpectedly and brutally gory, though not as technically impressive.
However, it's a hard movie to write-off or be complacent about, given its strangeness and ambition. The bursts of horror are fun and unique, with cool creatures and a steady directing hand. Most of all, it's visually striking cinematography and often quite beautiful production design are undeniable. Most of its issues seem to stem from the writing, which isn't just thematically unfocused, but also just full of cliched dialogue. 
With Ex Machina, Alex Garland made a strong impression with that debut. And even with all of Annihilation's script problems, his camera's eye and brainy tendencies keep him as a filmmaker worth watching.",Annihilation

58,southdavid,Total Wipeout.,4,5 June 2018,"Following on from ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" and ""Mute"", ""Annihilation"" is the third in the trilogy of ""Risky Sci-Fi ventures sold to Netflix because the studio wisely thought that they would lose money on a wide cinematic release"" and unfortunately, despite some nice ideas ""Annihilation"" ends with such a disastrously awful third act it makes avoiding the glare of the paying public the right decision. So, Lena, (Natalie Portman) is mourning her solider husband Kane (Oscar Issac) who has been M.I.A for a year, when he inexplicable shows up just long enough for an evening of being enigmatic, before keeling over with massive internal trauma. As he lies in a military hospital, Lena learns that he's been part of a team sent to investigate inside the Shimmer, an area of swampland that has been enveloped by a shimmering light source that doesn't allow communication out and has so far seemingly claimed the lives of everyone who has entered. Desperate for answers, Lena volunteers for the next expedition. There are some good aspects to this film. Alex Garland's direction is capable, and there is a visual edge to the film that can be truly breathtaking at times. As the team enter the Shimmer and get closer to the centre, the weirdness of the creatures comes to the fore, and the horrific screaming skull bear is a memorable creation. The cast perform well, and it's nice to see a couple of the actresses perform against type, with Tessa Thompson and Gina Rodriquez having roles that you might have thought would have suited the other actress better. It's Natalie Portman's film though, and we experience the whole story from her point of view. Lena is a layered and flawed character, who's given a lot to do but Portman performs all aspects of it well. It's a shame then, that the film is entirely undone by an ending that is somehow both inexplicable and obvious, incredulous yet boring. It's up there with ""AI: Artificial intelligence"" as a generally enjoyable and thought provoking film that's entirely undone by the decisions made for the last half hour. Unfortunately, this must fall at Alex Garland's feet too, as writer director - not the first time a solid film he's worked on has unravelled at the end, I'm thinking ""Sunshine"". It's another example too of a film where the explanations don't work within the internal logic of the story. I'm writing my review without spoilers, but there are a number of questions that came to me subsequently, even some the characters in the film specifically ask, that the ending doesn't really explain. (Maybe the two further novels that the film was based on may cover those, but they are unlikely to be made now). Sadly, it's the last impression that sticks with you regarding ""Annihilation"" and that one is a mess.",Annihilation

Some actors perform below par, making this movie a half hearted attempt at making something special.",5,19 July 2019,"NOT horror and not a real thriller at all. Kinda mysterious plot, which keeps the suspense barely alive to watch it through till the end. The sci-fi special effects are really rather unimpressive and sometimes even plain silly. I mean, when I wanna see a sci-fi picture I wanna be able to believe in another futuristic world, but instead I have to watch these quite unconvincing cgi effects. Real bummer.What's not enjoyable either are some of the supporting actors, who honestly act below par and would be better of in a tv movie. Oh hang on a minute, this is a tv (netflix) movie. Well it has that typical politically correct narrative, which wants to please everyone and consequentially turns out to be quite bland. Nathalie Portman, Oscar Isaac and Jennifer Jason Leigh all act really great though, but that cant save this movie from slowly going down the drain.The story: Nathalie Portman (ex-military/biologist) strays off into the woods with a team of scientists to discover why a mysterious coloured cloud kills everybody who dares to enter.

But what awaits them at the lighthouse, the epicenter of it all?I have heard good things about the VanderMeet novel and some glimmer of that can be seen in this film. The various characters have interesting backstories, the weird mutations and acceleration of evolution caused by the Shimmer are equally interesting and look even better on the screen. Furthermore, there's some decent action, the actors are for the most part talented and there's nothing outright wrong with the film.And yet I cannot help but admit that I was disappointed. Mainly by the pacing, I'd say. For example, all the interesting backstories are gone over pretty much in a single scene and then they never play any part in the story, with a few very minor exceptions. I get that you have to trim away the fat when you're making an adaptation. But in that case don't allude to the fat that used to be there. Especially if you're going to be this blatant about the fact that you had to cut it because of time constraints.The ending is also pretty out there and doesn't make as much sense as it probably does in the novel, once again because of the lack of time and proper storytelling.That being said, the film looks very good, has some good imagery, some good scenes and overall it's not that bad.

As the movie opens, Lena is being debriefed upon her return of a trip, the sole survivor of an expedition to figure out what is going on in ""Area X"". We then go back in time: we witness something from outer space hitting a lighthouse (but we don't know what exactly), and then Lena's husband Kane returns home after having been away for 12 months on a covert mission and Lena thinking he had died. Kane is clearly very sick, and when Lena takes him to the hospital, government forces intercept the ambulance and the are both taken to a compound called the Southern Reach... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Alex Garland, who previously brought us the excellent sci-fi ""Ex Machina"". Here Garland does another sci-fi project (working from Jeff VanderMeer's novel of the same name). It's quite mysterious as to what exactly is happening. When Lena tries to extract some basic facts from the doctor-psychologist, she simply tells Lena ""Many theories, few facts"", and that will have to do it. The first half of the movie muddles along, and it isn't until we reach the second half that things really take off, as we start to understand what is really unfolding. There are some terrific (and terrifying) scenes in that second half that will have you holding on to your seat... (I shan't say more). Natalie Portman is wonderful as Lena. Oscar Isaac seems bewildered as her husband Kane. Jennifer Jason Leigh is almost unrecognizable as the doctor-psychologist. The movie's photography is a bit heavy on CGI special effects. Last but certainly not least, there is a spectacular original score, courtesy of composers Portishead's Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury (they also scored ""Ex Machina"") that I plan on seeking out.""Annihilation"" opened this weekend, and I was looking forward to catching it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (less than 10 people in huge theater), and I can't say that it surprised me as it seems the movie is struggling to create an identity while also trying to escape the attention-grabbing blockbuster ""Black Panther"".

Even though I can understand why it can create some impressive film concepts, it always bothers me that no one holds the writers to account. They can make anything happen in their universe that suits their story. That's far too convenient and an easy cop-out in my opinion. 'Annihilation' is a very heavy film. There are no efforts made at any point to make the audience laugh or even get the slightest chuckle. It takes itself very seriously.The question you have to ask yourself after watching a film like this is whether it is legitimately thought-provoking or simply complete nonsense hiding behind some clever dialogue and pretty scenery. It has to be said the dialogue in the film is its strongest aspect. It's well written and is worthy of further thought. The story concept on the other hand, less so. Call me cynical but when a film goes this far outside the box, it really doesn't demand a lot of time and thought be put into it. It's just too easy to do whatever you feel suits the story at any time.This won't be a film for everyone, nor will it be disliked by everyone. It seems to be quite polarising in that sense.

Although perhaps some kind of cancer metaphor, the film doesn't really make a lot of sense and there is little exposition. Despite tossing off technical cell biology terms such as 'Hayflick limit', the 'science' in the film ('refracting DNA'??) might as well be magic (even if the basic premise was sound, the developmental time course makes no sense). There are some outstanding visuals, notably the crystal trees toward the end, which reminded me of J.G. Ballard's book ""The Crystal World"".

It should. It was done before, and better, by the great Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky in his film ""Stalker"", which was itself an adaptation of the novel ""Roadside Picnic"".Being that this is not an original idea, ""Annihilation"" really cries out for some kind of new, original approach to its familiar material. It does not happen upon one. I failed to mention above the fact that all the scientists and soldiers who enter the forbidden zone are female. Why did I not mention this? Because it harly seems to matter. Who cares what the gender of characters in a sci fi movie is? You watch it to have your mind blown with special effects, and your imagination dazzled with the impossible.The reason why I mention the gender of the protagonists now is because I fear that the filmmakers thought that having the main characters all be women is what passes for ""novel and original"" these days. Nope, lads. 'Fraid not. We're not all gender studies professors. Most people don't care about that. Seeing women on the screen isnt that mind blowing.

Things that go into the shimmer, do not come back, neither animals, people or even radio signals. Natalie & Oscar are a married couple and Oscar is chosen to go on the next mission inside. He is in the military, as was Natalie, but she has retired and is now teaching. Of course, no one returns from that mission, either. Then, one year later, just as they are preparing their next incursion, Oscar appears at home. But, he is disoriented and knows nothing about how he got home and then proceeds to have some kind of episode-he starts spitting up blood and passes out-and is taken to a medical center-notice, I didn't say hospital? Jennifer is in charge of the center-it's not a regular hospital-and tells Natalie about the shimmer and her husbands part in exploring it. Natalie decides that she wants to be on the next excursion into Area X-the new name sounds more official than the shimmer-Gina tags along on the all girl team. Each one is a scientist in their own right; a biologist, psychologist, etc. What they find is both beautiful and puzzling, at the same time. Plants and animals seem to be mutated into hybrid combinations of different species-there is a crocodile with sharks' teeth-and they find answers to what is really going on inside the shimmer, I mean, Area X. Is it some freak space virus or maybe an alien invasion? Think about the name of the movie and it could go either way.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, bloody images and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes.

68,drqshadow-reviews,"Thoughtful and Interesting, But Far From Perfect",7,1 May 2018,"A joint scientific/military probe explores an unseen alien force that's taken up residence in the Florida swamplands and begun altering the wildlife. As you can probably surmise from the trailers, this is more of a slow, melancholy wander through the unknown than a guns-blazing action thriller, though there are some moments of noisy chaos.Natalie Portman gets the close-ups, in a downplayed, nigh-emotionless role, but the unseen, undefined foreign creature has the heaviest presence. Fundamentally unfamiliar with our flora and fauna, it's been inspecting local life at a biological level, toying with genetic code and producing circus-mirror amalgamations that are just as confused about their own existence as we are. In many cases, the results are a beautiful sight to behold, but there's always a lingering sense of unease, something off and disturbing about what's unfolding before us. The worst of these experiments manifests when the human invaders are at their most over-stressed, an unsettling evening showdown with a lumbering, wailing behemoth. Not to give anything away, but it's the first time in years I've felt legitimately terrified by a monster on film.There's a lot to unpack here, some tricky territory to navigate, and for the first hour it feels like we're walking in mud. Hurry isn't a word in Annihilation's vocabulary, even when it's being chased, and I think many viewers will find that off-putting. I'll confess that it does ultimately bear fruit, though the quality depends upon your interpretation. I enjoyed it more than the book, which gradually lost track of what made the concept so interesting in the first place, but it endures different troubles. If anything, I felt numb by the end. Slowly beaten down by the slog, the bland, frank, matter-of-fact leads and the lack of real answers.",Annihilation
69,alindsay-al,An awful indulgent film,2,29 March 2018,"This film has ad some buzz building about it so I have now seen Annihilation and i feel like this is a film you are either going to love or hate and I am one of the few people that hated this film. The plot of this film sees a group of women search an unknown location to work out what is happening there. Natalie Portman plays the lead in this film and she does an okay job, she does her best to try and get the best out of her character. Unfortunately, her character is just so bland and boring, there just isn't much about her that makes her interesting or to make you care about her character and her plight. The supporting cast has a lost of big names in it such as Oscar Issac, Tessa Thompson, Benedict Wong and Jennifer Jason Leigh.But none of these big performers give anything to their characters to make them interesting enough to care even though they are recognizable actors. and actresses. The story in the film is both familiar but also confusing and nonsensical, seeing this group of women together makes you think of more interesting movies where you actually care about the members of the team. Towards the end of the film this film just gets ridiculous and laughable to lengths i can't explain because I am not really sure what was completely going on. The script has very basic drama in it that as mentioned before doesn't make you care enough, and with no humor in this film this script is incredibly weak. The style of this film in a visual sense is absolutely breathtaking with luscious backdrops, but this doesn't make a good film. The pacing of this film is really slow and I was bored for the majority of this film meaning i checked out and didn't particularly follow the bizarre ending. Overall as mentioned earlier, some people might like this film but I just found this film very indulgent and a waste of potential.",Annihilation

(America's House of Horror--Universal--would never make such a goof!) ANNIHILATION contains some very early exposition dialog stating that ""The Shimmer"" has closed a U.S. National Park for THREE YEARS! Yet, this Shimmer incident is subject to far more secrecy than such Real Life matters as the C-in-C being a Russian Spy. No one outside of a few hundred American Special Forces (an estimate based on the size of their base and the scores of folks kibitzing on ""Lena's"" debriefing) seems to have a clue that there's an extraterrestrial cancer gobbling up the U.S. East Coast. Dozens of elite soldiers go missing, but there's not a peep of complaint to the media from their survivors. ANNIHILATION does not take into consideration the Real Life Fact that the U.S. National Park Service sells annual ""all-access"" passes, as well as passports which tourists can have stamped at EVERY site, all of which have been listed in guide books and highlighted on maps for many decades. Only Russian Spies would think that they could capture the attention span of U.S. movie audiences with such absolutely senseless plots (unless a film is billed as a spoof of Russian Cinema in the first place!).",Annihilation

The film is based on the life of Lena who is a biologist and former soldier, she joins a mission to uncover what happened to her husband inside Area X which is a mysterious zone.To be honest the film has very great concept but the major drawback is it's execution and it's dead slow speed, the first half of the film is boring, slow, looked half-baked and wasn't going in any direction but comes back strong in second half but by then most of the viewers might have already lost interest in the plot, it doesn't means that the film must be fast to be a gripping film but has to made in a way that the interest of the viewers shouldn't get diverted.Acting in the film is strong and Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Gina Rodriguez were very impressive and effective, Óscar Isaac. Looked great in his limited screen presence.Screenplay as mentioned is very slow and can be a major spoiler for the film, the first half is boring and directionless but second half is interesting, the main part of the film that although it's been shown that the meteoroid had hit earth resulting in unknown zone Shimmer but no alien is been shown in the film.Sci-Fi lovers might like the movie, can be watched once.",Annihilation
73,kluseba,Jumping on the bandwagon of contemporary intellectual science-fiction cinema,7,7 March 2018,"Annihilation is a calm, intellectual and surreal science-fiction film in the key of recent successes such as Arrival, Ex Machina or even Blade Runner 2049 to a certain degree. Based upon a recent novel by Jeff VanderMeer, it tells the story of a mysterious and expanding extraterrestrial entity known as The Shimmer that seems to transform, mutate and copy its natural environment. Several groups have gone inside The Shimmer to investigate the phenomenon but none of them have come back as all of them were apparently killed, killed one another or went crazy and got lost. One year after his disappearance, a soldier named Kane suddenly comes back home to his wife Lena. Kane doesn't seem to be himself however. He is emotionally distant, seems to suffer from dementia and suddenly starts to feel very sick. On his way to the hospital, a government security force intercepts the ambulance and brings Kane and Lena to a secret area near The Shimmer. The security force wishes to interrogate Kane but he is in a coma. The security force then decides to send one last group into The Shimmer, consisting of a worried Lena who is a biologist and has been working for the military for seven years, an obsessed and strict psychologist named Doctor Ventress, a physicist with borderline personality disorder named Josie, an alcoholic paramedic called Anya who has anger management issues and surveyor and geologist Cass who mourns the death of her daughter who died of leukemia. The five women set out on a suicide mission as they soon lose track of time and realize how the mysterious entity not only transforms their environment but also themselves mentally and physically. In a last ditch effort, the group attempts to find out the secret of the entity and annihilate it before it annihilates them.There are several elements that make Annihilation a worthwhile experience. First of all, the film has a constant gloomy and mysterious atmosphere from start to finish. Secondly, the movie has an intellectual plot that makes the viewers speculate until the very end and beyond. Thirdly, the five female lead characters are very interesting in their own ways and their inner demons only add to the menacing tone of the movie. Fourthly, the overall calm film is occasionally shook up by a few sudden battles and gory scenes that never feel forced because they tell us more about the strange entity and the fate of the lost groups. Fifthly and maybe most importantly, the film is visually stunning. The animations, colors and light techniques make the extraterrestrial entity very spectacular and especially the film's climax is an unforgettable dream-like experience. Finally, the film's ending is quite controversial as some people might praise it while others could despise it. It's definitely something worth discussing. You should watch this film if you have an open mind for an intellectual experience. If you are just seeking passive entertainment, this movie is definitely not for you.Annihilation also has a few negative elements of course. In my opinion, it's much too close to movies such as Arrival and seems to jump on the bandwagon. This might also be the reason why I happened to find the movie's twist quite predictable which lowered its intensity quite a bit. Even though I'm aware that this is fiction, I disliked the fact that five characters that would never be chosen for this type of mission in real life got teamed up together. Some of them, like the extremely selfish psychologist that would clearly need a psychologist herself or the overtly aggressive paramedic who is a danger to herself and anyone around her, feel sketchily exaggerated, even given the circumstances that the extraterrestrial entity has an impact on the characters' psyches. Some more subtleness regarding the characters would have suited the movie's tone better.In the end, you might appreciate Annihilation even more if you haven't watched movies such as Arrival and Ex Machina before because it would be your first impressive contact with this type of intellectual science-fiction movie. If you have watched those two movies and others of its kind before, you will probably realize that Annihilation is inferior to those films and simply a good intellectual science-fiction movie. The visual components and the intellectual story are still good enough to watch this movie at your local cinema but the film's impact isn't as big as I would have expected beforehand.",Annihilation

Previously, she was a biology professor mourning her husband who went missing after some military operation a year ago. The day she decides to paint the bedroom a different color he shows up but can't give any explanation and doesn't say much at all. When he starts bleeding he's taken in an ambulance but man in black show up. Next thing we know Lena is in some other facility where she's told what's going on.After the meteor crashed some colorful gooey transparent wall appeared which is expanding over time. They call it ""the shimmer."" Whatever goes through it doesn't come back--except for Lena's husband but he's in a coma now. Running the show is some psychologist for some reason. She's recruiting people for yet another mission through the shimmer. She assembles an all-female cast (in what universe is that cool?), Lena among them of course, she volunteers because she thinks she owes it to her husband. In any case, off they go. On the other side it looks like a normal jungle. Except that eventually they see odd colorful vegetation and mold. Lena concludes it's some mutation. The find a house and are attacked by a crocodile. When they kill it they realize it's also a mutant. Then they are attacked by some bear-like creature. They find the place where the previous group was station. They left a tape where Lena's husband opens up another guy's abdomen to reveal some slithering inside--perhaps the guy's intestines, perhaps something else.Our team notices that something goes on with them as well. One girl's fingerprints move; Lena examines her blood and the cells are mutating. And of course they start going bonkers attacking each other. They find abdomen guy exploded on a wall covered with the colorful mold. Farther away they find plants in the shape of humans. One of the girls comes to a realization. Just as the light reflects, so does everything, including DNA. That's why all the mutations. She does something extraordinary. Instead of wanting to face or fight whatever IT is, she gives up. The plan is to go to the lighthouse, but by now the number of team members is dwindling. Lena of course makes it to the lighthouse, finds another videotape involving her husband and a surprise. She goes through the hole where the meteor landed. Are here the filmmakers didn't shy away from he sci-fi but give us something of an explanation. I won't reveal what goes on but it's pretty fascinating. At the ending there's somewhat of an expected surprise but it's an unsatisfying one because it goes against what we saw earlier.Annihilation is a slower, longer, but satisfying sci-fi movie.

77,peterp-450-298716,I'm becoming a Netflix Originals fanboy.,7,20 April 2018,"""Blackwater National Park reported that a lighthouse was surrounded by something they termed ""a shimmer.""
One of the wardens went in to investigate.
Never returned.""Let me get right to the point. ""Annihilation"" isn't exactly an easy SF. This horrifying SciFi can join the group of ""the more intellectual looking SF films"" where ""Arrival"" can be found as well. The more subtle form of SF, where you wonder all the time what is actually going on (just like the protagonists in this movie). And in the end you still have a lot of questions. In terms of imaging, it looks like ""Predator"" mixed with influences from ""Invasion of the body snatchers"". And it all takes place in a giant soap bubble. One moment the group of five women stumble through a jungle where they are attacked by grotesque, mutated predators. The next moment it looks like a fairytale forest with strange, colorful vegetation and exotic flowers. I guess this group of women don't know exactly what they are looking for. To be honest, they are complete lost and their sense of time and place is off.It all starts with the impact from a meteorite, close to a lighthouse somewhere off the coast of the USA. And before Lena (Natalie Portman) realizes it, her husband (an American soldier who was MIA) is back siting with her in the kitchen, she's taken to a military base and she's informed about the mystery that now exists after the incident with the meteor. After that impact a huge zone has arisen, which they call ""the shimmer"" and where no one has ever returned from. Except for her husband, who came back in bad shape. This first part is already difficult to get through. It's terribly slow with a lot of flashbacks. Not exactly easy to follow, but fascinating enough to arouse curiosity.This is yet another original SF that Netflix tries to launch after ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" and ""Mute"". And this time it's exclusive for the viewers of Netflix, because you can only see it in a limited number of cinemas worldwide. Maybe that's a point of discussion. Wouldn't it be better to watch this movie on a big screen ? Because the scenery looks exceptionally beautiful at times. And it's also very exciting and super mysterious. The footage they see on a camcorder, looks bizarre. The discoveries they make at the military base are really frightening. No surprise that there are some who want to pack their bags as quickly as possible. The only question is where to go. Disorientation and mutual mistrust aren't exactly helpfull aspects. And when they start to encounter all kinds of murderous creatures, there's the obvious comparison with certain action-packed scenes from the ""Alien"" series.""Annihilation"", a film directed by Alex Garland who's responsible for the magisterial film ""Ex Machina"", can certainly be called successful. Maybe it's a tad too complicated and you scratch your hair several times. Yet this film is unique in its way and as a viewer you can interpret it in your own way. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece though. The group of women who volunteered for this expedition, may look like the jungle version of those that hunted other ghosts in ""Ghostbusters"". But this film is of a different level and certainly not as disastrous as the latter. This quirky SF has made me an even bigger fan of the Netflix Originals.",Annihilation
78,Agent10,Abstract AF,7,30 June 2021,"How do you describe this movie? Personally, start by ignoring the idiots that relentlessly roast this film for not spelling everything out for you. There used to be a trope in cinema where you had some ability to determine the ending of the film, thus allowing you to make your summations. But alas, everting has to be spelled out.Anyway, Annihilation is not an easy story to dissect. Basically an entity has taken over a spot of land known as The Shimmer, and despite the best efforts of many researchers, nothing has been found. It's only discovered that an all-female team might find some better results and thus a small unit is sent in to check out the abject oddity within the shimmer. Oversized animals, sentient plants, zombified animals and even crystalline trees make the world seem alien and horrifying, covered up perfectly under the sheen of sparkling lights and bright colors.Now the story is not supposed to make a whole lot of sense. Sorry to the anti-SJW Nerds who hate fap all over this film (and yes, those are the ones leading the charge) who just can't get that idea into their closed mind. I won't go on a limb and say it's the best sci-fi of all time, but for those that liked 2001, Stalker, THX-1138 and other relatively bizarre science fiction films, then you will feel at home. We never truly receive an answer as to why The Shimmer is here, for the ending really gives us few answers. Like I said earlier, it's meant to allow you to come up with your own conclusions.Is this a perfect film? No. Is it watchable? Yes. Is it good to watch with your sci-fi loving girlfriend...most certainly. I will say the only thing I did not like was the fact they somewhat vilified Portman's character, having her engage in an affair just kind of made her less sympathetic and turned a story looking for answers more into a story that was trying to seek redemption for being a cheater. I felt her initial motivation was fine enough.Anyway, ignore the haters and make the decision for yourself.

81,truemythmedia,Ahead of its Time,10,10 May 2019,"There is so much good here, but first, let's start with the visuals; shall we? The third act of this film will draw many comparisons to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and that is totally fair. This film, much like Kubrick's masterpiece, slips from a sci-fi adventure film towards a psychedelic, quasi-existential, super-metaphysical meditation in the end. The result is magical, bizarre, and, in a way, terrifying. Throughout the film (before we loose our minds completely to the world of Area X), the visuals are utterly compelling; the film is unlike anything else I've seen. In a way, it's indescribable until you see it for yourself.
In the book, Lena's character is known primarily as The Biologist (likewise, the other characters are also known primarily by their occupations); the biologist has a hard time connecting to anyone; in fact there's a scene when the biologist is asked what she would do if she were infected by Area X, and she responds saying she'd take a sample of herself. She is cold, calculated. She has a hard time caring for anything other than what she's working on. There's a scene in this film when Lena is speaking with Daniel, he says that it's not him she hates; it's herself. She responds by saying, ""No, Daniel, I hate you too."" That line captures the essence of the novel perfectly. Portman's distant portrayal of Lena matches exactly how the Biologist would react. I believe it's brilliantly executed. But, for those looking for warmth within characters, don't come here.
Garland's direction, too, is pretty impressive. For those unfamiliar with his other work, check out his directorial debut, ""Ex Machina"" (2014), for which he received a Best Original Screenplay nomination. Garland's career is already quite impressive; he's penned a few very notable scifi films including ""Sunshine"" (2007), ""28 Days Later"" (2002), and ""Dredd"" (2012). He was also, reportedly, paid a million dollars for writing the Halo movie, which never seemed to get off the ground. The stylistic choices Garland made in ""Ex Machina"" are elaborated upon in this film; there's plenty of subtle symbolism (and some not so subtle). His ability to create an atmosphere much like Vandermeer's books was what really blew me away. Upon reading the Southern Reach Trilogy, I thought the books were essentially unfilmable, but Garland has proven me wrong, and I'm very happy he did.",Annihilation

83,jadepietro,2018 Space Oddity,8,26 March 2018,"GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A strange nifty little sci-fi thriller that was wiped off the face of the earth due to bad distribution, and it is not its fault.JIM'S REVIEW: Alex Garfield's Annihilation is a 2018's sci-fi oddity. The backstory of this film is as compelling as the story seen on screen. Perhaps more so. Originally,Netflix purchased the film rights and distribution for this alien thriller. After gaining some positive critical reviews and also some preview audience's negative reaction, the studio lost faith in the movie and disbanded the film in movie theaters less than a month after its premiere. To compensate for a loss, the company then made it a part of its streaming services worldwide (with the exception being its U.S. outlets). The director cried foul of this controversial release method and so did most of the Hollywood elite. He was right.That said, the film itself is a tad odd too. It may not enrapture a mass audience as it tells a well-worn formulaic story of scientists discovering an alien life force that mutates in a section of Planet Earth. Called ""The Shimmer"", this glowing quarantined zone is soon being explored by Army Special Forces organized by Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh). After months trying to contain this area and all living plant and animal life within. another crew is assembled. This includes Lena (Natalie Portman), a biologist and former soldier whose husband Kane (Oscar Isaac) had previously entered this Area X. Others in this all-female platoon include Anya (Gina Rodriguez), Josie (Tessa Thompson), and Cass (Tuva Novotny). This MeToo Movement quickly becomes a WhoseNext Movement as they battle supernatural forces in a test of survival. So much for women's empowerment!Also strange is the lack of interest by sci-fi fans and moviegoers with this latest journey into the unknown, as it is a well-made and scary little thriller that deserved more attention. (Only 6 other people were in the audience when I viewed the movie.) Sure, there are leaps of logic...many. (Some randoms thoughts: Since others had gone before without any survivors, why was this female quartet better equipped to handle this mission? Shouldn't these scientists be trained to know they are in a contagious area and dress for success? Nary a latex glove in sight. Since the team only traveled with backpacks, where does all the extra gear come from? Does anyone in this movie understand the meaning of the word, ""quarantine""? Wouldn't other war technology such as planes, drones, or jets with missiles be more efficient means of travel? Without sounding too sexist, wouldn't one or two male soldiers be more advantageous for some physical muscle power on this unknown mission? Why is it always so hard to stay with the group when in peril?) Questions left unanswered or poorly explained.The adapted screenplay by Mr. Garfield is based on Jeff VanderMeer's book. Too much time is spent on narrative exposition about genetic science and trying to add some dramatic elements about Lena's human story, which does bring some character development but it also seriously impedes the action. It also takes far too long to finally enter the anomaly, about a half hour into a film that is barely two hours in length. Still, kudos for giving a standard sci-fi thriller come nice dialog, fine acting, and gravitas to this mix.Where the film excels is in its CGI visual images, sound design and Mr. Garfield's artistic flair. The music score by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow adds that eerie moodiness and the movie is well edited by Barney Pilling for maximum suspense. The director creates an intelligent and taut creature feature. As his film progresses, many moments are nerve-wrecking and fraught with tension. His memorable climactic showdown between our heroine and the alien life form becomes a lyrically freakish ""dance of death"", well choreographed and stylishly realized. Annihilation won't morph or change the sci-fi fantasy genre, but this strange and odd film deserved some love and admiration.NOTE: The end credits are a wonderful light show of extended colors and hypnotic swirls. Stay for it.",Annihilation

It just doesn't deliver on an overall good premise according to me. It was very, very slow in a lot of places and lost my engagement throughout the viewing.If the movie stops being entertaining and engaging and simply continues to drag on and on only towards a climax as per the script then it's a waste of time.

Let's get started!LIKES:The World Building: Within Annihilation, lies the anomaly called the Shimmer and within it a world that has been mutated by some unknown force. As our ""heroes"" for lack of a better word venture into the gasoline mixed with water looking border, the world contained within is a wonder in itself. Our world's natural flora and fauna are bizarrely twisted into these contorted visuals that look natural, beautiful, and a true representation of the genetic crossing that we all studied in school. The world's scientific art continued to grow only deeper and darker as they traveled further into the void, the animation and creativity being unleashed into the chaotic skew with no limitations. Some of these creations are stunning in terms of color, while other times they are the things of nightmares, whose movements and designs will leave you huddled in your chair. Science Fiction Thrills: In addition to the world itself, Annihilation is all about the true Sci-Fi adventure. An unending suspense hovers over the air, the tension always mounting at what lies within the glades of this weird dimension. The mystery of what is causing this continues to build across the course of the movie, as well as if our heroes will make it to find the answer. Annihilation's threats do exist outside, but even more dire is the psychological warfare the Shimmer plays on our girls. Disturbing imagery is only one assault to their psyches, as they are pushed from all fronts to confront whatever it is eating them inside. And in addition to bringing suspense, the characters get some major development, shelling out their background information and helping them adapt to the ever-changing world around them. This culmination is very entertaining and truly worthy of the sci-fi mantle in terms of plot. Deep: A good science fiction movie makes you think, and Annihilation has got you covered in this element as well. As you try to solve the mystery of the movie and the fantastic twists that get thrown in, you'll find deeper meanings behind the actions of the movie. Many of these are head scratchers, trying to figure out just what the Shimmer is doing. While not as complex as Arrival or Matrix, Annihilation still has plenty of tricks up its sleeve to bend your mind and get you trying to process all the weird information it throws at you. As you process this, you may uncover deeper, morale dilemmas, horror filled thoughts of the future, and even the fragility of order are all up for questions. This artistic flare is certainly a score booster, though fair warning that these deeper meanings are also disturbing at times too. DISLIKES: Savage/Disturbing: With a title like Annihilation, one needs to be ready for darker undertones and source material. However, this movie goes down a very graphic path that was able to penetrate my desensitized shell. Found footage reveals some rather violent outcomes for previous teams, with little to no censorship of details that are capable of causing some to lose their lunch. The savage nature of the beasts and the violence held within just about everything in this film throws no punches, again choosing to display the gory details that fail to dampen. Flashbacks: The flashbacks are certainly for character development and some of them set the story up nicely for the bombs to be dropped. Others however, are unnecessary details that did little other than show the suffering we already knew she held and expand the run time. Complete as it was, I didn't quite pick up on the significance of some of these wasted scenes and could have held better storytelling elements to help build the suspense. Not all of these have to be eliminated, but editing could have used some tightening up to make everything more relevant. Deeper supporting characters: The movie is primarily about Natalie Portman, shocker there, and at the start it showed some promise that the other members of her team would be more integral to the mission. Yet, things decrease fairly fast to where the other characters soon become rushed plot lines, trinkets to tax Leah (Portman)'s conscience and further push the psyche limitations of everyone. Had they given some better relationships, a little more teamwork, and integration of all characters, perhaps then we would have had even stronger development and thrills to enjoy. The Weird Ending: You know that feeling you get when after the big wait the ending turns out to be something you didn't/or maybe never wanted to expect? Well Annihilation was kind of like that for me. The twist at the end was great, bringing relevance to some of the flashbacks, and really blowing your mind. However, the entity itself is not quite as awe-inspiring or terrifying to say the least. The source of the trouble is abstract, creepy, and very hard on the ears as it tries to communicate in sounds you have heard in the trailers. This final scene is super prolonged, and quite uncomfortable at times to watch as this dance of perverted awkwardness commences. Is it unique? Yes, but it still didn't quite match what I wanted. And for those who don't like abstract thinking and deciphering the conclusion yourself, hate to break it to you, but you won't get all the explanations you might be looking for. Yeah, it's weird.
The VERDICT: Annihilation may have looked weird, and it's true it is an odd spectacle to behold to the general audience. However, it is a true sci fi thriller in meaning, thought provoking, stunts, and world building, to the level that fans of the genre will be pleased with what the studio brought out to you. It's weaknesses for me come in it went a little too far down the weird pathway, going too savage and abstract to provide a clear picture at times. The use of flashbacks was stylish at times but overdone as it sacrificed the chances for other characters to get some more time on the screen. Still, if you are looking for that dark, story that makes you scratch your head, then Annihilation is the movie for you to check out. For those who qualify, this movie is worth a trip to the theater, but for others kip this as long as you can to avoid disturbing those with sensitive constitutions. My scores are: 
Adventure/Drama/Fantasy: 8.5
Movie Overall: 7.0",Annihilation
86,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Annihilation,5,22 March 2018,"With some serious sci-fi mumbo jumbo, a look of sterile beauty, a good use of multidimensional space, and moments that are not for the squeamish, I give you 2018's Annihilation (my latest review). In truth, I think Annihilation is a lot of things as a movie. Sadly, entertaining is not one of them.Annihilation's story involves four scientists and one paramedic. With machine guns, foot soldier gear, and flawed dispositions in tote, these five women venture into an area called ""the shimmer"" (if you've seen a Coldplay music video you'll know what I'm talking about). In ""the shimmer"", they eventually lose their memory, their sense of time, and they encounter nasty mutations of various animals.Annihilation, which seems to ask more questions than an audience member can answer, feels preachy and contains a swift ending that has the emotional impact of a gnat. The film is frustrating and choppily edited, harboring a loud musical score, trite found footage clips, varied flashbacks, and shoddily acted flash-forwards.Annihilation is like Aliens without prototype aliens, John Carpenter's The Thing with an all-female cast, and 2016's Arrival without its characters getting totally mutilated. If I had my druthers, I'd still watch the pics just mentioned as opposed to taking in another viewing of Annihilation.Anyway, Annihilation's director is London-born, Alex Garland. Although wet behind the ears, he is indeed a visionary and a sort of mimeographed version of David Lynch. His camera is constantly roving with most of his scenes shot from ground level. As for his general direction, well it seems a little more assured than his script. Overall, Garland tries too hard to reinvent the science fiction wheel here. His Annihilation is artsy-fartsy and overwrought, with sumptuous visuals and odious violence that can't compensate for a continuity-free narrative.The troupers in Annihilation are comprised of Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Oscar Isaac. Their performances aren't necessarily phoned in mind you. It's just that they come off as blase more than anything else. Annihilation as antiseptic light showiness, may be headache-inducing but it still contains more of a pulse than Natalie, Jennifer, and Oscar can muster. Bottom line: Annihilation the word is defined as a ""total defeat"". Annihilation the flick? Well it's halfway there. Rating: 2 stars.",Annihilation
87,justin-fencsak,"Bizarre, confusing, yet sexy and scary and fun!!!",6,12 September 2018,"From the director of Ex Machina comes Alex Garland's first big studio movie, Annihilation. Starring Natalie Portman in her first lead role in a sci-fi movie since Revenge of the Sith, this trippy film is pretty good.",Annihilation
88,Rob_Taylor,Annihilation: Pacing Not Included,5,13 March 2018,"So, when a trailer paints an action-horror adventure picture of a movie, you can be forgiven for expecting that when you go to see said movie. Annihilation is not an action-horror adventure.What it is, is someone's (Alex Garland's, presumably) idea of a cerebral scifi horror, with allusions to exploring what it is to be human and body shock horror thrown in for ""good"" measure.Now, firstly, I hate being misled by trailers. I've almost come to expect it by now, but it colours my view of the movie when I realise I have been duped. Secondly, I also hate pretentiousness in films and Annihilation has this in great supply. It wasn't enough to simply give us a good scifi horror movie, it had to pretend to be deeper than it was. It failed at that.Any depth it might have had was thrown to the wall with the lamentable editing, which seemed designed to slow the movie's progress to a crawl to fill out the two hour runtime. There are, at best, only three or four important set-piece scenes in this movie but they are spaced out massively and the gaps inbetween filled with utterly redundant flashback scenes and filler content. This is, essentially, a short film padded out to feature length.The effects are good, and the acting decent, but the story is full of holes and inconsistencies. Set decoration is variable, with some scenes looking truly amazing and others looking like the props manager raided the moth-eaten floats from some flower festival for lurid paper flowers to stick at random on trees and scenery.The Shimmer has been on Earth for three years, we discover, yet in that time all that has happened is that people have been sent in and have not come out again. From the context of the film, this appears to be the only strategy that seems to be available to the investigators. We are also supposed to believe that all this has been kept secret for that length of time.In the course of the movie, the comms gal tells us that her equipment is working, but that no signals get out of the Shimmer. Great, so technology works but not comms, so why haven't they sent in autonomous robotic machinery? Have it go in, record information, maybe even take samples, then come back out again. Machines can use dead-reckoning navigation far better than humans. No compass, or satnav required. There is no requirement within the story parameters as defined that they needed to send people in at all.Nor is it explained, ultimately, what is going on. This is one of those ""The audience should make their minds up about what is happeneing"" kinds of deals. I always dislike these movies, simply because if you have something you want to say, then say it. Don't leave the audience to figure it out.Alex Garland has gravitated to these sorts of pseudo-intellectual shams of late, what with this and Ex Machina. Needless to say they have received rgeat critical acclaim, but only middling success at the box office.I don't have a problem with scifi being thought-provoking. In fact, I prefer it that way. But this is not thought-provoking, so much as head-scratching. An attempt at being clever without looking at your product and realising most people don't have your level of knowledge of it. I'm sure both the script and the book upon which it is based were much more satisfying than the film ended up being. As it stands, the movie is a disappointment and not a movie that most people will seek to re-watch in the future.SUMMARY: Padded out short story that is not engaging and not at all as sold in the trailers. Some good scenes, but too much dull filler and a score that does little to draw you in to the tale. Not recommended.",Annihilation
89,JuguAbraham,Suicide or self-destruction?,7,6 February 2019,"Is it suicide or self-destruction? The novel and the screenplay are not as convincing as the original screenplay of the director Alex Garland in his earlier work ""Ex Machina."" The strength of the film is limited to its visuals.""Ex Machina"" was superior to this film in many respects, including the choice of the cast. A small feather in the cap was the choice of the song 'Helplessly Hoping' by Crosby, Stills, and Nash.",Annihilation
90,yoggwork,Very psychedelic plot and picture,6,18 February 2019,"Very psychedelic plot and picture, but carefully feel that the plot rhythm is not good, there is little suspense about the metaphor and mystery before and after. The early stage of the team is not well paved, and the later stage is also strange. The plot slowly goes beyond logic. Now that the monster has seen an incendiary bomb, why would he pick it up by hand?",Annihilation
91,jellopuke,Solid Sci-fi movie,8,25 February 2018,"It's not about gun fights or laser swords, but about smart people going into an unknown situation and dealing with weirdness. Methodical and well shot, it's a great little movie that doesn't tell you everything.",Annihilation
92,mhorg2018,Undecided,3,12 March 2018,"Much like the cattle overated blade runner 2049, I found this movie tedious to get through. That it's intelligent, there is no don't. But I felt no connection with the characters. And what story there is explains virtually nothing. There are a lot of plot. Why an all female ram? Did they get weapons training before seeing it? Natalie was in the military, so that was explained. I'm a little tired of movies that take the viewer along to a nowhere ride. I much prefer Ex Machina.",Annihilation
93,shakercoola,Visually impressive but narratively stunted,6,3 February 2019,"This sci-fi mystery provides iridescent visual wonders and a visceral feel. It is an impressively ambitious exploration of challenging themes such as genetic mutation and deconstructionism.
A good performance from Natalie Portman helps to keep the story interesting and Jennifer Jason Leigh's return to the screen is impressive - her part as the psychologist was good casting.
The strange mind-bending mystery, and the creatures and action along the way keep up the tension quite well but its the production design and cinematography that sustains the viewer's interest. The film drops a notch by the end because the story is left unresolved - a vagueness that either is purposively reserved for a sequel, or worse - a lack of imagination.",Annihilation
94,zhyarTheChosen,Nah,6,14 January 2021,Nothing special at all and logic is straight to garbage,Annihilation
95,arungeorge13,"Alex Garland conjures up yet another strangely beautiful sci-fi epic. Though, I must say, I enjoyed 'Ex-Machina' more! [+71%]",7,26 March 2018,"As is the case with most Alex Garland films (when I say films, I'm referring to the films he has written - 'Ex-machina' is the only other movie he has directed so far) such as '28 Days Later', 'Sunshine', ' and 'Dredd', his latest directorial venture 'Annihilation' also treads the 'sci-fi-with-a-message' path. He narrates stories in which visibly strong (but intrinsically weak) characters try to deal with the existence of alternate realities. While Garland follows the same skeletal structure in 'Annihilation' as well, the film still manages to maintain its singularity.The film is told from the point-of-view of Lena (played by a nuanced Natalie Portman), a biologist (with a militaristic past) who signs up for a covert expedition into an otherworldly zone (known as 'The Shimmer' where laws of nature are seemingly twisted. Lena has her own reasons to partake in this quest, which ultimately leads to bizarre findings that blur the lines between real and surreal.What the viewers are in store for, isn't a straightforward sci-fi flick where answers are served on a silver platter. A lot is left to the judgment of the viewers - they can comprehend the proceedings however they feel like. This brain-teaser of a movie barely resorts to compromises in storytelling and leaves viewers to determine the solutions using their own interpretive thinking skills. The visuals by Rob Hardy are complemented well by the terrifying visual effects by 'Double Negative' a.k.a DNeg. Dangers arrive in the form of mutated alligators and bears and trust me when I say they're not pleasing to look at. The musical score by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow subtly signify the eerie tone of the film. Natalie Portman carries her 'bewildered biologist' character with ease, while J.J Leigh as Dr. Ventress (the leader of the expedition) puts up a convincing show. Oscar Isaac shines (as always!), in a sort-of extended cameo. Verdict: Give 'Annihilation' a watch if you relish ambiguity in films!",Annihilation
96,Terryfan,The first movie I ever I mean ever walked out of the theater on.,1,31 March 2018,"After ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" I learn a very valuable lesson and that is if the movie is going to keep getting worse just walk up and leave and that's exactly what I did for AnnihilationI went to see Annihilation in theaters and it now ties with Transformers The Last Knight as the worst movie I ever saw in theaters I walked out on it 30 minutes into the movie and I am using the word Movie loosely.I mean once again you try to take a gamble on something you think will make a lot of money but I got my money back on this movie because honestly this is one of those movies that should have said ""A money back guaranteed"".The acting in this movie is just dreadful and awful I've seen video games with more realistic acting then this movie it has one of the worst scripts that isn't worth being used as paper towels. The cast was just a sloppy mess they clearly show signs of disrespect.The protagonist is one of the worst to ever had been created she is just one that should have never been thought of and she makes me sick.They try to combine Science fiction and horror and they fell miserably they focus too much on the gore and even going so far as to cut a man open on screen that was when I got up and left the theater because I don't want to see that kind of junk in a movie it was just disgusting. They of course added a sex scene that should have never been added and a puke scene why do they love having that in the movies I'll never know but those three were enough to say I had enough.
 
There is just nothing that would even make it worth a rental and I really wish we had a rating for Zero on here because that's what Annihilation deserves it is one of the worst movies I ever seen in my life and I will be sure to avoid this one at all cost.I give Annihilation an 1 out of 10",Annihilation
97,omendata,Oh dear another disappointment,5,13 March 2018,"What is it these days - the directors seem more interested in the style over the content of movies.Started well, some nice set pieces and the visuals and aural soundscape were well done but the story was another kindred to the awful ""Arrival"" where us ordinary folks just didnt get it apparently.
It was slow and lugubrious with the only things of interest being the colourful visuals and very little story, character development or acting ability - I hate to disagree but I have always found Natalia Portman to be insipid and utterly without merit as an actress and most of the rest of the cast were forgettable too - Now Michelle Rodriguez or many other talented actresses I could mention would have blown this lot out of the water and actually made the film more enjoyable.So us ""not as intelligent as you Scifi experts just didnt get it"" - Not really its typical of the Anal Sci-Fi brigade that believe if you didnt understand the movie or ""get it"" then you are just not part of the cognoscenti of Scifi nerdula! Some of the reviews on here with their pontification much like the ones on ""Arrival"" really make me laugh!If you have nothing to say then tis' better to say nothing and this movie said absolutely nothing to me at all. Such a disappointment too as I was hoping for something but with Portman being the lead actress that kinda set the scene for this overhyped ""Butterfly Effect"" short story and movie ripoff. Been done before and much better with less money!",Annihilation
98,Troy_Campbell,"Enthralling, challenging, intriguing, beautiful.",9,17 March 2018,"Writer-director Alex Garland has always leaned towards intricate ideas that ask a lot but answer little, mainstream audiences be damned. So it's no surprise that Paramount Pictures got cold feet and sold his latest trippy sci-fi to Netflix for international distribution. It's a double-edged sword though: whilst it's great to see Garland's mind-bender relatively quickly after its cinematic release Stateside (a release here would've undoubtedly been delayed), this visually spectacular film would've been an amazing big-screen experience. To attempt a suitably informative plot summary would not only be futile, but would diminish the impact of the narrative and thematic Pandora's box so carefully constructed by Garland (adapting from Jeff VanderMeer's novel). It's as close to undefinable as a movie can get. Suffice to say; however, that we follow a group of complex women - led by Natalie Portman's regret-filled biologist Lena - as they embark into what may or may not be another realm. Toying with time, space and the very fabric of humanity, it is a filmic hallucination that demands your unwavering attention as it subtly weaves in and out of reality, keeping the viewer as off-balance as the leading lady. Moments of pure beauty are juxtaposed against sporadic bouts of visceral terror, the sudden and seamless switching between the two (helped with flawless CGI) maintains a high level of tension until culminating in a hypnotic and unnerving finale that is simply awe-inspiring. The meaning of the climax, as with the movie as a whole, is of course open to interpretation, while the emotional connectivity will depend on one's willingness to ride Garland's wave, but there's no denying the ambition - and dare I say, genius - on display. Annihilation does what every great sci-fi tale should: intrigue, enthral, provoke and challenge.",Annihilation
99,pyrocitor,Moldy phoenix,9,29 March 2018,"When it comes to cinematic alien invasions, our poor planet has been bombarded with onslaughts ranging from ET adorable to War of the Worlds sinister, and everything in between. And yet, in the face of 'take me to your leader' overexposure, we've never seen anything quite like Annihilation. Appropriately building from what is known into something fundamentally new, director Alex Garland fuses equal parts Big Questions science-fiction (the film's closest spiritual sibling is 2016's Arrival and its rendition of a sentient consciousness that is fundamentally non-human) with inventively disturbing body horror, and intertwining, fatalistic environmental and psychological allegories, all stitched together through a slow, Kubrickian creep into the metaphysical. And if all of that hasn't deterred you, you're probably ready for the deep dive into the Shimmer, and to press the pause button on reliable sensory intake and reality for a feverishly engrossing two hours. Those familiar with Jeff VanderMeer's novel - the first of his 'Southern Reach' trilogy - are right to be suspicious: it's hard to picture a more medium-specific text relying more on surreal, dreamlike ambiguity, unreliable narration, and the unseen to convey its sense of infectious terror. Thankfully, director Alex Garland shows a knack for cinematically transmuting the dreamlike dizziness of VanderMeer's prose, with atmosphere and mise-en-scene so evocative the theatre air feels damp, and sticky, and our skin begins to itch. Garland's 'Area X' is as innocently beautiful as it is almost imperceptibly grotesque, with gorgeously unobtrusive FX lending the lush foliage a subtle sense of unease. As cameras airily drift through with a disconcerting innocence and sickening sense of dread, we begin to doubt our senses: is that nauseatingly fluorescent lichen speckling the trees moving, or was it just a trick of the light? Surely that wasn't an almost inaudible cry of terror in the peaceful breeze...? That flower assuredly didn't have a human face. That woman had all of her facial features intact... Right? The discomfort is woven uneasily together with Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury's unexpectedly zen musical score - an almost folksy guitar strum - that feeds into the film's tone of beautiful tranquility feeling nauseatingly 'off,' before showing its hand and imperceptibly morphing into a dread-inducing, spine-tingling drone that will haunt your conscious mind for hours to come. Naturally, some things are lost in translation. Although Garland impressively avoids caving to easy Hollywood closure (though he does throw us a couple of bones of clarity to anchor the plot on - probably more nuggets of certainty than VanderMeer sprinkles through his entire trilogy), there's a distinct skeleton of conventional structure and contrivance that makes proceedings feel just a whit overly familiar (particularly in the climax) - especially in the face of the freshness of the unrepentant, unhinged ambiguity of VanderMeer's Southern Reach. It's tantalizing to imagine what cinematic boundaries might have been pushed by a slightly more daring auteur - a Tarkovsky, Jodorowski, or even Kubrick himself, all of who imperceptibly flavour the film - let loose in VanderMeer's wacky, macabre playpen. Regardless, Garland is a master of the inventively harrowing set piece, and his film's horrors are sparse but chillingly memorable, and just as effective in their anticipating as their execution. Garland's sensibilities are anything but cheap: each jump scares, gory dismemberment, and horrific mutation feels appropriate and strangely elegant in their grotesquery. Ultimately, however, Annihilation is less preoccupied with fright than destruction and rebirth (individual and collective), digging into a mature, existential examination of change, not as an ultimatum, but as an ongoing, morally transcendent process. Natalie Portman's propensity to infuse dead-eyed flatness with such churning intensity makes for the perfect (un)emotional anchor amidst the throbbing madness that ensues, her unyielding, flinty making it her strongest work in years. Supporting her, Oscar Isaac* adeptly subverts his customary charisma with a queasily 'off' emotional disconnect, while Jennifer Jason Leigh commands the screen with an alarmingly coy sphinxlike grimness. Tessa Thompson, conversely, offsets the creeping nihilism of her surroundings with a soft-spoken, brittle sweetness, perfectly counterbalanced by the volcanic, combustive emotion of the scene-stealing Gina Rodriguez, cathartically the only character who seems properly perturbed by the encroaching wrongness of Area X. Don't be thrown by the film's tepid marketing and the insinuated lack of studio confidence in a simultaneous Netflix release. Annihilation is bold, clear-headed, and unmissable for all science-fiction stalwarts, even if its chilling warp into brain-bending surreality may be anchored on just a couple too many nuggets of accessibility to fully capitalize on VanderMeer's feverish tone. Regardless, Garland has crafted one of the most atmospheric, inventively creepy, and existentially haunting movie romps of the past several years, sure to itch and nibble at viewer's brains with images and ideas long after the jarring reversion to normalcy once the credits roll. -9/10

I'm extremely impressed by it. I've fallen in love with it.The swamps covered with colorful fungi, crossbred animals and plants, plants that assume the shape of a human being, fungi that feed on dead human bodies in an empty pool and bears that scream for help with the voice of its victim. The bear attack scene was super weird and brutal. It ripped the lower jaw of the girl who tied the rest to chairs off and it was super gory. The best part was the lighthouse scene. It was surrounded by salt structures at the beach and it turned out his husband who's the only person that managed to get out alive was an alien. He exploded himself with a bomb on camera at the lighthouse. The group leader Ventress turned into cosmos at the black hole and a drop of Lena's blood made another Lena who'd mirror the real Lena. What we saw was the real Lena gave the bomb to its hand and burnt it along with the lighthouse and everything out of this world but at the end when he hugged his alien husband in quarantine, I couldn't be so sure about that.Jennifer Jason Leigh and Natalie Portman are amazing as always and so are the visual effects and the script.",Annihilation
104,Richie-67-485852,LIFEFORM THAT IMITATES,7,12 November 2019,"Intriguing little sci-fi dished up for those that love the genre and if one pays attention this movie has the ability to cause you to pause and consider another way, lifeform and existence and not necessarily like our own but similar in ways. What one has to know and it would help to know this right away is that a meteor crash lands and brings microbes of a sort to earth that just take-off in different directions on this planet. It knows to imitate and mix but not necessarily make sense of what it is doing but just to do what it does is sufficient unto itself. It doesn't think or use intelligence but it can manipulate on biological levels and have those experiences. Fascinating because the highest life form on the planet is us and that is when the story gets interesting. It tries to mimic/mutate a human because it recognizes it can but it is not a perfect human as we are but as close as it can come. It doesn't have a soul is the best way for me to describe it. It is alive, has awareness and it is driven to duplicate itself through cellular duplication successfully. What it takes over however doesn't survive except for a few molecules here and there at least temporarily. There is a part in this movie where this alien microbe learns to self-destruct from someone that is teaching it that and does so however not before it learned to do other imitations as well. The ending will have you pausing for discussion. This movie manages to keep you in scene after scene quite well. As viewers we want answers and we wait patiently to get them until the very end where we end up having more questions than answers. Sci-fi that makes you think doesn't disappoint. This is that movie.

Was an absolutely enthralling, smart sci-fi film that worked on so many levels. Naturally, I was very excited for Annihilation when I first saw the trailer. Natalie Portman is also one of my favorite actresses and one of the top performers working today so this was something I couldn't wait to see. Having seen it, I have to say I'm still processing the film but its very good.Lena (Portman) is a biologist who goes to explore a mysterious area called ""The Shimmer"" with four other women. Her husband recently came back after a year of being in the Shimmer and he has been acting and reacting oddly. Lena soon realizes that the world within the Shimmer is odd; plants and animals mutate unnaturally and the landscapes are ever changing. There's much more to talk about plot wise in this film bt I'd rather not spoil anything at all.First of all, visually this film looks great. As Garland says, its made for the big screen. I'm not that crazy about films premiering on Netflix and stuff so it sucks this film won't get an international release. Second, the film is slow but brooding and thriving in its complexities. It sort of reminded me of Arrival at certain stages. The film takes you on a visual and conceptual journey, whether you are coherently following along or not. Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh shine, as usual.I can tell a lot of people are going to write this film off as bad. I can already see that the right people are praising it and giving the film the due it deserves. Garland delivers an unflinching smart sci-fi thriller that stays with you. Its well acted and has interesting concepts that don't always make perfect sense, yet are mind bendingly entertaining. Ex Machina is a better film but Garland follows up with something close in quality. I'm certain that after a re-watch this film will get an 8 from me.7.5/10",Annihilation
110,phanthinga,We need a sequel,8,15 March 2018,The first time I watch Ex Machina it left me speechless with the shocking revelation near the end and the similar case happen with Annihilation the latest movie directed by Alex Garland.Annihilation is a good sci-fi thriller movie with many very questionable stuff need to be answer so I will be really happy if there a sequel but to be honest because critics hyped this movie too much I'm sure many people will disappointed with what they get,Annihilation

I love it!p.s. they overthought it/hate the timeline hate the drama hate the slower parts/couldn't they have just started the movie with the discovery of the shimmer at the lighthouse then fill in all the blanks with like 1 or maybe 2 at most flashbacks then maybe bring a few more deadly weapons like grenades being that every single previous other team of soldiers who went on into the shimmer is dead in an insane way but the end is nice but why not just let the weird alien shapeshifting thingy just be instead of whatever the hell that weird alien thingy likes doing mimicing and morphing/have you seen aliens?/i love jennifer jason leigh and gina rodriguez and tessa thompson and annihilation/natalie portman rules",Annihilation

113,petra_ste,Was it carbon based?,7,20 March 2018,"Annihilation is a tough sell. Fans of fast-paced action movies who just want to watch Natalie Portman shooting monsters in the face may be irked by the film's slow pace and reliance on atmosphere. On the other hand, admirers of weighty, cerebral science-fiction may consider Annihilation too pulpy; there are not many violent or horrific scenes, but what violence is there is quite gruesome and what horror is there is fairly disturbing. Nitpicky moviegoers will complain that many things here (both character choices and scientific stuff) don't stand up to closer scrutiny; it's not quite Prometheus bad, but it's sometimes baffling (funny how all these scientists handle the most sickening, pestilent-looking specimens without gloves). Fans of the source material may be disappointed by changes; I haven't read Jeff VanderMeer's novel but I understand writer/director Alex Garland took many liberties with this adaptation.Me? I liked it just fine. Annihilation is not on par with Garland's remarkable Ex Machina but it does scratch my itch for creepy science-fiction/horror made with craft and care. This feels, in tone and themes, quite Lovecraftian.In fact, the premise is reminiscent of Lovecraft's underrated The Colour out of Space. A mysterious biological entity from space infects a region of the United States; flora and fauna start mutating, mixing different species, with an uncontrolled proliferation like a giant, ever-expanding tumor. Five female scientists venture in the zone; among them is protagonist Lena (Natalie Portman), seeking a way to help her husband (Oscar Isaac), a Black Ops soldier who came back from the zone sick and deeply changed.The movie looks great in spite of a slim (for Hollywood standards) 40 millions budget, with excellent, creative production design. While it's not as intellectual or abstruse as some reviews may lead one to believe, Annihilation does put enough spins on familiar tropes to feel fresh and novel; it's not the usual Aliens clone. I did find the very ending a little obvious though.Still, the film builds up the tension nicely to some unsettling moments, like found footage of a previous mission or an encounter with a monstrous hybrid. I also like how the mutations are not always a source of horror but occasionally also of awe and beauty; again, it feels very Lovecraftian.Finally, a special mention to the climax in the lighthouse, which I won't spoil; it's creepy, unexpected and feels unique in terms of confrontations with extraterrestrial entities seen in movies.7/10",Annihilation
114,bankofmarquis,Just didn't work for me,4,24 February 2018,"I like ""Intelligent Science Fiction"". You know, like Alex Garland's other Directorial effort 2014's EX MACHINA or Jeff Nichols' involving 2016 film MIDNIGHT SPECIAL. These are the types of films that uses the backdrop of Science Fiction to delve deeper into character, concepts or ideas, leaving time for the audience to take it all in and to really think about what is being shown on the screen and to wrestle with the concepts brought forth. So, I was really excited when I found out the Garland would be helming a film of the first book in Jeff VanderMeer's SOUTHERN REACH trilogy, ANNIHILATION - a trippy sci-fi book series about an alien presence that starts tearing away at the very fabric of human existence. I was convinced that this marriage of source material and filmmaker would create another cinematic gem.Boy, was I wrong.ANNIHILATION fails in all the ways that these types of films could fail. It is self-indulgent, favors style over substance, mood over momentum and has long, long, loooong scenes of dialogue (or non-dialogue) that is supposed to convey a sense of dread and, for me, just made me want to yell at the screen ""get on with it!""ANNIHILATION tells the story of a group of women who comprise the 12th group of explorers entering ""the shimmer"" - an unknown phenomenon in a remote part of the US that is growing and will soon start engulfing populated areas. None of the other groups have returned (save for 1 soldier). This 12th group, led by the mysterious Dr. Ventres, tries to get at the heart of what the shimmer is and succeed where others failed. Once inside ""the shimmer"" the group must fight with their own nightmares and what makes them human.Sounds like a really good premise for an intelligent Sci-Fi film doesn't it? Unfortunately, Director and Writer Garland is more interested in the sights, sounds and moods of ""the shimmer"" and fails to create any interesting characters - or circumstances - for the audience to follow.Natalie Portman stars as Lena - a biologist (and former military) who's husband (the great Oscar Isaac) is the lone returning solider (though not all of him, mentally, has returned). The pairing of these two strong, interesting actors should have been enough to propel this film forward, but all they do is stare at each other and ""not say"" anything. They look at each other like something is wrong, but the never say or do anything. Compounding things is the weird portrayal of the weird Dr. Ventres by Jennifer Jason Leigh - an actress not known from shying away from weird. Her portrayal would have worked, I think, if she had some ""normal"" folks to play against - or if her character had some sort of climax, but she doesn't, she just sort of peters out. Joining these two are Tessa Thompson (losing the goodwill she earned in THOR:RAGNAROK) as a physicist that ""has secrets"" and Gina Rodriguez (channelling her inner Michelle Rodriguez) as a gung-ho ""kick-ass"" paramedic (you can guess how that is going to turn out). Only Tuva Novotny as scientist Cass Sheppard has anything approaching an interesting character, but she is on all too briefly.Also wasted in this film is Benedict Wong (DOCTOR STRANGE) as the ""Basil Exposition"" of this film (explaining things to the audience) and David Gyasi (INTERSTELLAR) as a pseudo-love interest for Lena.Maybe I'm just not ""artsy"" enough to enjoy this. If you are and you enjoy this, let me know what I missed. As it is, I have an early, leading contender for ""Worst Film of 2018"".In the meantime, I'm going to rewatch EX MACHINA or MIDNIGHT SPECIAL, two intelligent Science Fiction films that work.Letter Grade: C4 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Annihilation
115,Ruskington,Full of logistical errors but some slick editing and reasonable character development pulls it through,6,30 November 2020,"Despite some rather sloppy plot developments and nonsensical practicalities, Annihilation delivers just enough suspense and intrigue to hold your attention.",Annihilation
116,spookyrat1,A Heroic Failure!,7,15 January 2020,"I really wanted to like Annhilation and there is plenty to like about this sophomore production from director/writer Alex Garland. But overall I do have to agree with many of the reviewers on these pages, in that I think the professional critics have been a little over-generous in their collective praise of Annihilation. And ironically the main weakness of the movie in my view, is the screenplay, which is normally one of Garland's great strengths.The film looks great for an ambitious, mid-budget sci-fi project. The soundtrack is also a winner ranging from the very appropriate use of some early Crosby, Stills and Nash material, to a mind-expanding tonal smorgasboard in the latter stages of the film. I have no problem either, with what I believe is the fairly unlikely scenario of a 5 women unit group of (mainly) scientists who enter ""The Shimmer"", a mysterious quarantined zone of mutating plants and animals caused by an alien presence. It's just that the execution of the story just didn't ring true in a number of important ways.The Southern Reach has already sent a number of groups over 3 years into The Shimmer with Lena's husband Kane being the sole survivor of any of the expeditions. Why should this one be any different? Did they actually train as a group? Thorensen for example seemed really surprised that Lena could use an automatic weapon. Surely the character of Dr. Ventress, the group leader, needed more exposition. I don't blame Jennifer Jason Leigh for her portrayal, but Ventress appeared to be the most unlikely expedition leader one would ever come across and significantly didn't appear to give a hoot about the welfare of the other expedition members. More than once she appeared happy to just rock off by herself without caring whether the others followed or not. Supposed suicide mission or not, it was just bizarre behaviour from the OIC.Then after the group has managed to kill a giant, hybrid crocodile, why would they then immediately jump into tiny tinny canoes and then proceed to paddle through the swamp presumably inhabited by those same crocodiles. It goes without saying that the lack of scientific process displayed was very obvious, from the non-use of any protective clothing including the basics like gloves, to none of the group members, apart from Lena doing anything much scientific at all. Thorensen the medical expert, when confronted with an extremely challenging medical related video, crazily comments that the images were caused by a trick of the light.I could handle the regular flashbacks but was bemused by Lena initially saying she couldn't remember anything and then suddenly blurting out all these details which make up much of the movie's content. Perhaps the reason was she was the only ""original"" human to return from The Shimmer. And again I could even accept the unlikely proposition that somehow an exploding phosphorous grenade could shut down The Shimmer. But if that was the case, why didn't the first one, that we see exploding on the video, cause more destruction?Annihilation is certainly different from your typical sci-fi fare It's atmospheric, mysterious and even very exciting at times. For those reasons I do believe it's worth seeing, but I do wish Alex Garland hadn't been quite so slapdash in his script preparation. I believe it showed, to the overall detriment of the film.",Annihilation

118,dave-mcclain,"engaging, scary, creative and thought-provoking",7,26 February 2018,"""Annihilation"" (R, 1:55) sounds like it should be a sci-fi - horror - action movie. As the musical prophet (Meat Loaf) has taught us: two out of three ain't bad. This movie is firmly in the sci-fi / horror camp. There is some action, but the focus is more on the characters - a female cast, atypical for the genre.Oscar winner Natalie Portman stars as Lena, a medical school biology instructor and former U.S. Army soldier, whose active-duty special forces husband (Golden Globe winner Oscar Isaac) goes missing on a top-top secret mission - for a whole year. When Kane suddenly shows up in the hallway outside his old bedroom, he's... not himself. After an emotional embrace, Lena demands answers from the practically catatonic Kane, but he doesn't have many. Then, he experiences a severe medical episode which lands him - and Lena - in a top-top-top secret government facility just outside a gradually expanding land and shoreline area called ""The Shimmer"", hidden behind a colorful curtain of light through which drones, animals and people have been sent, never to be seen or heard from again, well, except for Kane, that is.Rather than sitting on her hands while Kane may be dying in that building, Lena talks the facility's psychologist (Oscar nominee Jennifer Jason Leigh), into letting her come on the expedition she's about to lead into the Shimmer, along with three fellow scientists, played by Gina Rodriguez, Josie Radek and Tuva Novotny. Since the male military teams haven't been able to survive the Shimmer, maybe, just maybe, female scientists (or, simply, scientists, as one of them points out to Lena) will be able to have more success. They each have their own reasons for volunteering for what may well turn out to be a suicide mission, and they each have their own struggles surviving an environment in which strange, new plants and animals exist - and rapidly... mutate - as do the bodies and minds of those in this expedition. With ""Annihilation"", ""Ex Machina"" writer/director Alex Garland adapts the novel of the same name (the first in the ""Southern Reach"" trilogy) by Jeff VanderMeer and helms the film as well. As in Garland's previous work, the character development is excellent, the acting is great and the optics (the visual effects and the creatures) are stunning. This film is engaging, scary, creative and thought-provoking - Alex Garland at his finest. Framing the story in the context of a post-expedition interview does little to enhance the story and it actually reveals more of the story (told in flashbacks) than necessary - and the pace of much of the film is a bit slow - but ""Annihilation"" is solid, inventive and entertaining enough to make up for those minor flaws.

120,markthomassintek,"Interesting, what would happen if evolution took a different course?",5,12 March 2018,"REVIEW - ANNIHILATIONInteresting, what would happen if evolution took a different course? Or lets imagine that there is only so much matter in the universe so when matter passes from one state into another it gets reused. Grass for example is matter that gets eaten by a cow which changes that matter into milk which we drink and is absorbed into us to give us protein which is another form of matter, lets imagine if all matter was like milk and could be absorbed, what would happen? How would evolution been altered? In essence that is the story behind this film, we are everyone and everything and everything and everyone is us.Interesting story but slow. Certainly go and see it but don't expect too much compared to the Arrival for example, which this film I fear tries to mimic but unfortunately fails. Rating 5 out of 10",Annihilation
121,jrarichards,"Only dubiously a ""cult classic""",7,12 April 2019,"Considering both his screenplays (Never Let Me Go - to name but one work of genius), and his directoral achievements on the exquisitely-good ""Ex Machina"", Brit Alex Garland is a person whose work can never be sniffed at. Here with ""Annihilation"" he's giving - quite pretty and indeed at-times atmospheric - effect to a work by Jeff VanderMeer. So maybe the latter bears some of the blame for a story that, despite its intellectual pretensions, still looks wafer-thin in parts.To cut that longish story short, and to spoil it greatly, there's a strange alien force that's already taken over a chunk of the USA, bringing a far-reaching, mutation-induced reworking of terrestrial biology in its wake. It is spreading, can be stopped by nothing and has put a sticky end to any who have attempted to explore inside the zone it occupies, of the so-called ""Shimmer"". Yet when last survivor of an implausibly all-female team of scientists Lena (played by Natalie Portman) finally reaches the zone's epicentre, one phosphorus grenade is all she needs to finish off the whole phenomenon!Yet nobody thought to call in the United States Air Force, which currently has 1840 fighter planes looking around for just this kind of task...How could a film trying so very hard fall at such a ludicrously low fence?
Is art really more important than content?
Is sci fi content to live without the sci?Given that Lena is a biologist like myself, I both empathise with and envy her when she first gets the chance to try and make head or tail of the new biology she encounters in the zone - and here the film (all too briefly) reaches its zenith of (scientific) innovation. But despite a reference to hox genes, and one or two other bits and pieces, this work is never more than superfically valid as biological sci fi, despite the moments when the effects look impressive. A crocodile with shark's teeth and a ""bear"" that isn't one don't give us too much for our money, though the plant life has a slightly better look about it.Frankly, Portman is only barely able to carry this off anyway, but the plot comes to such a crunch ultimately that one does tend to end a watch of this film with a big Why? And while ""Annihilation"" probably fares slightly better than that other arty piece of science fiction of recent times ""Arrival"", ultimately it smacks of much the same faux-portentous atmosphere, and that ain't good.In contrast, another piece of British eco-sci fi that explores similar themes to ""Annihilation"" is Gareth Edwards's ""Monsters"" made 8 years earlier - on a shoestring. And for me the latter is the far better film, much to be recommended. Alternatively, if it's people gradually going crazy in the face of weird natural/supernatural phenomena that you crave, well you've got things like ""YellowBrickRoad"", ""Cube"", ""Triangle"" and many other pretty-ingenious quality movies to choose from.",Annihilation

A lot of dough was spent on set design alone, including their psychedelic forest and Alien-like cave. The writers fell asleep on the story, though. There were too many holes to make the film truly believable, the biggest one being that everyone around the Shimmer site is wearing hazmat suits except the ladies who venture helplessly into it.

The plot is normal. As they have stated it's a drama, so, the first 23 minutes is so boring. I wanted to stop watching and I did last night. After having enough sleep, I could finished it this morning. The performance are basically fine. Unlike Mu Ji Zhe, a Taiwanese film I've watched, they couldn't make the audience excited (I mean background sound) even there were some exciting scenes. That's not what I expected from American films. The video effects were quite amazing. That makes me wonder one thing. How could the wild animal that attacked Anya make Cass' ""help me"" voice? I really don't know how.One thing they have in common whenever the film has a forest is the same forest. When I saw that forest that Lena walked into, Twilight film came into my mind because they are the same. But this is the fact that I randomly said it and it doesn't count in the review.All in all, it's kind of boring for me. But it's not as boring as Blade Runner 2049 and it does have a point. At least the audience knows what is that Shimmer thing. There's only one part I don't get was the final scene. Kane and Lena's eyes were glowing. Does that mean whoever survived from that Shimmer thing infected with some kind of virus or whatever? They didn't explain and made me wonder. That's why I said it's a combination of Blade Runner 2049 and 7 Guardians of the Tomb. A little boring like Blade Runner 2049 and it's final scene is like the final scene of 7 Guardians of the Tomb.

126,kjproulx,"A Slow, Yet Powerful Story",10,24 February 2018,"Writer/director Alex Garland has been in the game for quite some time. Writing fantastic movies like 28 Days Later and Sunshine, his knack for filmmaking has always been present but was taken to another level in 2014 when he wrote and directed his first feature film in Ex Machina. Being one of my favorite films of that year, I found myself extremely excited for his next directed project. Annihilation has just hit theatres and if you're not someone who enjoys a slow burn in order to reach a worthy payoff, then this movie may not be for you. If you're up for anything and can embrace any sort of sci-fi story, then here's why I think you'll probably end up loving this movie as much as I did.Going into detail about the plot of this film would truthfully ruin it, so I'm going to explain this premise as simple as I possibly can. After having to deal with a tragic personal incident, Lena tasks herself with a group of women who plan to enter a forcefield area that has been created after a meteor has hit. Learning that they may not all come out alive, they strive forward to find the answers. Yes, that sounds very vague, but it's hard to talk about this movie to someone who hasn't seen it. For a premise like this, you need a few key things to make it work; A great screenplay, a great cast, and a nice through-line of direction to hold the movie together.Annihilation is a film that places its characters first before anything else, and while that definitely works in its favor, if the story surrounding them doesn't work then the overall film will fall pretty flat. Although it takes itself very seriously and many of the scenes are very slow-paced, you can tell that Garland has created a film that will slowly reveal itself as it goes along, providing insight into the backstory of each character as well as providing answers as who what exactly they're trying to uncover. Flashing back and forth between the past and the future, answers are given at the most opportune times in order to benefit the film.Natalie Portman remains a powerhouse when it comes to dramatic performances. I've always been a fan of her in pretty much any dramatic role and this one was no exception. That being said, she's not the only one who shines here. From Gina Rodriguez to Tessa Thompson, each of the supporting members seemed to have their time to shine and certain inciting moments had me on the edge of my seat. There are some truly thrilling moments sprinkled throughout this movie and I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. I know I'm a sucker for great sci-fi films, but this is just another one to add to the list.In the end, while I can't say everyone will love this movie because I'd be lying if I did, I believe that everyone can at least admire the attempt at being different and unique from most mainstream movies out there today. Annihilation takes risks and doesn't give itself up to a generic conclusion. It chooses to be different from most films and never lets its foot off that peddle. Wonderfully directed, very well-written, and beautiful to look at, I can't really come up with any huge complaints. Yes, some will complain about the pacing and few may even complain about it being too bizarre in its final act, but I found these aspects to be a great addition. Annihilation is a fantastic movie and I wouldn't be surprised if this film ends up in my discussion for best films of 2018 at the end of the year. The year is still very young, but I can't recommend this movie enough. Go in with an open mind and you may just love it.",Annihilation
127,kuarinofu,Rather good but overloaded with unnecessary stuff,7,15 April 2018,"This was an ok movie. There's lots of very negative reviews giving this 1-2 stars, don't believe those, it's not horrible. It just has some issues that heavily decrease the amount of enjoyment you can get from this.
I'll focus only on bad parts. But it has good stuff as well.
1. It's overloaded with unnecessary scenes that add nothing. 50% of Portman scenes feel tonally different from everything else. These are mostly flashbacks about a hard woman's life with a husband missing. These just don't fit the context of the movie overall.
2. The movie tries to be Science Fiction but in fact it's totally divorced from reality and any particular science. They didn't want to overcomplicate things, but even past that, it is full of outright dumb stuff (scientists carrying automatic weapons, wearing no protective gear, no military in the group, using water transport after encountering a hostile reptilia etc.)
3. The ending is ambiguous, but not in a good way. It's not open edned, it's just shot in a way that makes it unclear what happened. Some people compare this to original Solaris and Stalker yet these feel much more complete. It never gives you enough stuff to actually think about.
4. Tone and pacing. It's very different tonally, feels like it doesn't know what it is trying to be. Starts very slow (like good movies do), but the slow is caused mostly by unnecessary scenes that add nothing and are mostly pretentious. Like the movie is trying to act smart but fails. It gets sort of good by the end reveal, but then falls flat again with an ending that fails to provoke an interesting thought. 
5. The look. Most of the time it looks good, I did dislike the lens aberration though, it was hard to see things at times cause of that bubble effect they've used. But this is just a minor complaint.
Movies like this one should plant a seed in your mind, making you think it over and over again for days. I've seen it 2 hrs ago, and the charm is gone.

As an aging white male, was I ready to see a small band of young, sexy, bad-ass chicks fighting monsters and saving people while the men folk lie around looking weak and scared and confused? Could I handle an action packed adventure epic where tough, competent women pull off what the men folk can't?But fear not! These chicks are not competent, let alone overpowering. They have no clear-cut mission, they don't work together as a team, and nothing is clearly resolved one way or the other. There's a lot of fuzzy talk as they lazily paddle their canoes, about ""we're all searching for something,"" and ""she's a lost child,"" and ""she drinks,"" and ""she's confused about her sexuality,"" but you'll find you can barely tell the five women apart, anyway.Then the monsters attack, and it's like, instead of feeling terror you just sit there thinking, ""okay, what's next? How about . . . a kangaroo covered with porcupine quills! A raccoon with the wings of a bat? Just how much COOLER can this story get?"" And then our super sexy, brave chicks just put their M-16's on full automatic and blast forty or fifty rounds into the creature till it groans and falls over dead. Because women, you know, are more creative and sensitive than men. A male team wouldn't even think to shoot at the beasts, they'd just, I don't know, kill them with their bare hands. Or something. Don't imagine any of this has a point, because it doesn't!Oh, because the jungle scenes aren't monotonous enough, every fifteen minutes or so we cut away to random scenes of Natalie Portman having sex with different guys. You can actually count every button in Natalie's spine! That's the kind of thing you notice when you're bored, and you'll notice it a lot. If you know what I mean.So at the end, what did we learn, Charlie Brown? Girl power doesn't save the day. The girls are petulant, whiny, back-stabbing hoes, and they turn on each other within hours.

130,msbreviews,Rating: B+,8,13 March 2018,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Alex Garland brings us the movie adaptation of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach Trilogy, which tells the story of an expedition team who goes inside The Shimmer, a strange disaster zone that is expanding each day that goes by and it is threatening life on the planet.Natalie Portman (Lena) leads with the help of an all-female supporting cast, plus Oscar Isaac (Kane).Annihilation is one of my Most Anticipated Movies of 2018 and I didn't really enjoy the fact that it was released on Netflix. The producers said that the film is ""too intellectual"" for mainstream audiences and even though I don't (entirely) disagree, Garland made this movie for the big screen. I feel disappointed that I didn't watch this sci-fi story in a movie theater and I think films like this should be supported instead of just throwing them into a poor-quality screen.There are two main reasons why this movie should have been released wide in movie theaters: its visual effects and its score. Visually, this film floored me. It is always mind-blowing when a movie is able to create something never seen before and Annihilation does it. Everything feels astonishingly imaginative and unique. It is a whole other world inside The Shimmer and I can feel it just by looking at it, every single shot heavily drops visual beauty with its colorful and eyegasmic cinematography.The special effects are undeniably innovative and wonderful. Additionally, the score is also extremely addictive. It starts with an acoustic vibe and it gradually ""mutates"" itself when our characters go inside the mysterious zone. It not only supports the story but it elevates the suspense and tension levels, giving it a very cool sci-fi mood. It is so exceptional that I can't stop listening to it (guess what I am also doing while writing this review).Some sci-fi films have their story carried entirely by the characters. They are the reason why those movies are good or bad. Alex Garland writes such a captivating and intriguing premise that the characters are almost secondary to the screenplay. Even though the slow pacing drags the film too much during the second act, the main premise is so damn interesting that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.Every scene has a purpose. Every apparently random shot of a tree or of an animal, every line of dialogue ... There are so many metaphors and very superficial plot details which make the viewers think. I understand why the producers said that the movie was ""too intellectual"" for the general audience, this is not a film which you can leave the theater and that's it, it is over.You have to think through it. You have to be focused and open-minded to understand the bigger picture. The premise might be too scientific for some people (it is based on science notions that I don't think most people have) and that is definitely something the producers had in mind when Netflix arrived on the table of alternatives. I think it is a very smart concept and it is executed in the most fascinating and creepy way possible. However, the screenplay is also part of my issues with the movie.I am going to be as vague as possible to not spoil anything. Garland does an overall great job: good camera work, the exposition scenes are well-written and the editing is seamless. Nevertheless, he chooses to build a narrative around Lena in a way that takes away any sense of urgency and it turns every character's path very predictable. Even though I am always on my back foot regarding sci-fi films which always carry a twist of some sorts, each character has a pretty obvious storyline.From the moment the second act kicks in, I know that the movie is going to follow a certain route regarding the supporting characters and it never fades away from my expectations. The ending will be thought-provoking for some and it will be underwhelming (or overwhelming, depending on the viewer's mind) for others. For me, it is definitely an ending that needs some time to think but even after that, the expected payoff feels short for the slow-burn I had to go through.Genre-wise, it separates itself from the pack. It is not trying to copy anything, it is its own thing. I can't say I've seen any part of this film in some other work. It is very different, it follows an uncommon story filled with very puzzling plot points, elevating the movie's interest. It always feels new and innovative. Its tone is very well-balanced while its pacing could have been better controlled (I guess it really depends on how much the payoff compensates the rest of the film for you).I love ambiguity and contrary to The Cloverfield Paradox, this movie has a good amount of it without becoming overwhelming and confusing. This is a much-needed type of film nowadays, it is something people will keep discussing after its end due to its several interpretations, which only the great sci-fi movies are able to achieve. Truthfully, the more I think about the film the more I like it, but there are some minor plot details that are showed and never mentioned or explored again, which makes them feel unnecessary to the overall storyline.Finally, the cast and their characters. Natalie Portman brilliantly leads this movie and I am thrilled that she is able to effortlessly carry such a heavy one. She displays tons of emotions and delivers a seamless performance. Her character, Lena, is very compelling and exciting to follow. Her backstory and personality are the most developed and the team's chemistry is undeniably remarkable.Everyone has great performances, especially Gina Rodriguez (Anya Thorensen) and Jennifer Jason Leigh (Dr. Ventress). Both have standout moments where they shine, while the other two are part of my other major issue with the film. I couldn't care less about the supporting characters. Anya and Ventress have something more to them than the others, probably due to the actresses' excellent work, but all of them feel very depthless.Cass Sheppard (Tuva Novotny) and Josie Radek (Tessa Thompson) are just ... there. Cass helps to develop Lena and Josie serves to explain what is happening, so they become pure plot devices with no real personality. Oscar Isaac mysteriously portrays Kane, Lena's husband who means more to the story than the female supporting characters, even though he has a very short screentime. Basically, I only cared about Portman's character and having in mind that everyone else's path is pretty clear, this is a huge problem ...All in all, Annihilation is a thought-provoking, unique sci-fi movie, which does not stop after its end credits, generating a much-needed film discussion. The visuals effects are mind-blowing and the score is remarkably addictive, elevating an already amazingly imaginative and intriguing premise, which kept me captivated throughout the whole runtime. However, a strange narrative choice surrounding Portman's character (who she portrays flawlessly) plus an underwhelming payoff, break any sort of mystery surrounding the under-developed secondary characters and some minor plot details become unnecessary and unexplored. It is still a good job from Alex Garland, who is able to use his technical abilities to improve the movie's overall quality.",Annihilation

133,RussHog,It had a few good moments -,6,24 February 2018,"This film should have been better, but there are a handful of good moments in the film. It is about some alien force that exists in a quasi-Garden of Eden and spreads its DNA to mutate life as we know it into something biologically different - more of a mirror world - or a reflection of our own world. And along comes this professor lady with a machine gun and her crew. It's not entirely stated but the professor seems to have some inner journey dealing with her own reproductive biological situation - and her encounter with this alien force delves into that. The dialogue in the movie sucks hardcore and the acting is not very good. The third act of the film is quite strong, however - and so I recommend this movie.",Annihilation
134,MrDHWong,"A strange, thought-provoking, and often surreal story about a mysterious journey into the unknown",8,22 March 2018,"Annihilation is a science fiction film starring Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac. Directed by Alex Garland (Ex Machina) and based on the novel of the same name, it is a strange, thought-provoking, and often surreal story about a mysterious journey into the unknown.After a strange meteorite impacts near a lighthouse, it engulfs the surrounding area in a bizarre glowing energy field, which expands in size over time. The US government dubs the phenomenon ""The Shimmer"" and sends in a group of soldiers, led by Kane (Oscar Isaac) to investigate this anomaly. One year after the soldiers mysteriously vanish, the government send in Kane's biologist wife Lena (Natalie Portman), along with a group of scientists to discover what happened to the missing expedition.Told in a non-linear narrative, Annihilation dares to challenge its audience's perception of storytelling, with its dark themes and intriguing characters. This is a proper science fiction movie with actual scientific dialogue and very few action scenes, much in the vein of 2016's Arrival so this is definitely not for the casual filmgoer. Director Alex Garland showcases stunning visual effects juxtaposed with the underlying social commentary of human nature and humanity's place in the universe. Natalie Portman shines in the lead role, further proving her range as an actress, and her performance leaves a lasting impression on the viewer, as does the film itself. I rate it 8/10",Annihilation
135,Alexander_Blanchett,Visually more than stunning,8,13 March 2018,"Intersting follow up project of Ex Machina from Alex Garland, a true creative mind. The story is a mix of adventure, mystery and philosophical Science Fiction epos. The film contains some truly breathtaking visuals. The cinematography is close to Oscar worthy. Garland ensembled a very good cast of mostly actresses. Natalie Portman leads the cast and gives one of the toughest performance of her career. The character she plays works on different layers and she does it all extremely convincingly. 
Jennifer Jason Leigh also has a memorable appearance. Gina Rodriguez more and more developed into a very interesting actress. She and Tessa Thompson have scene stealing appearances. Fine performance by Oscar Isaac but he was a bit too wooden here. Yes it was intentional, but still a bit irritating seeing a usually vivic actor like Isaac being so restricted.
The score was very smooth and effective. The visual effects really great and memorable. The film had many terrifying moments and more than once brought me on the edge of my seat. Its surely a film to watch multiple times to really gather the whole essence of it. But its a treat for all your senses even if the plot is sometimes a bit confusing, Quite memorable if you are looking for original and creative projects.",Annihilation
136,TheTruthofItIs,"So much potential, but just doesn't deliver",3,15 July 2018,"Great concept and some of the execution was really good, but much of it was kind of dumb. Take for instance the all female team sent into The Shimmer. That's a bit too much grrl power and ultra-feminist to be plausible. The pace of the film and the wait-till-the-end-for-the-payoff was very similar to ""Arrival"" which I also didn't like, but wanted to. Look, I'm biased to like these sci-fi films but they keep failing to deliver and that's borne out in its revenue, only $32M domestic and not even released internationally. It also proves that Natalie Portman is NOT a box office draw, but who's surprised by that?!",Annihilation
137,cardsrock,Ambitious sci-fi,8,17 January 2019,"Carried by a haunting score, Annihilation puts forth thought-provoking ideas amidst a mysterious atmosphere. The themes explored in this film are rather interesting and are brought to life with brilliant visuals. Alex Garland clearly has a knack for this genre and I cannot wait to see more of his films.",Annihilation
138,Jithindurden,Very good but didn't reach its full potential,8,13 March 2018,"Although not as good as Ex Machina this is a really good sci-fi and with the obvious influences from Stalker. I don't understand why the women ensemble is not a thing since a lot of films that aren't nearly politically important is celebrated on such basis. The complex characters are convincing enough for the themes of self-destruction and in a way, this works as the antithesis to 2001: A Space Odyssey but not nearly as great as it is. But in all of its great side, there is a lot that doesn't really works. This is the kind of film that could have taken a little more time to explore more of themes. The scope and ambition of the film are not completely justified with the end product, there could have been a lot more that feels untapped but exist in there. The visuals that are not CGI are great to look at but feels rather fragmented in a way that they are underutilised and the CGI looks quite outdated. But the outdated look may be due to the design they decided on which comes back to my point that the production design was confused with overused and fragmented visual ideas that really made the film a lot lesser than what it could have been. But even with all these problems the brilliant details used at each point of the film even though not fully visually realised are amazing. It feels like the brilliant script had to make some compromises in its transition and yet the Netflix involvement shows that even such compromises are not enough in Hollywood.",Annihilation
139,CANpatbuck3664,Appropriately Tense and Scary but Not the Complete Package for Me,7,26 February 2018,"The thing that caught my attention with the Annihilation trailers was the unique visual design the movie had. Dark and moody sci-fi set on Earth rarely has such a vibrant colour scheme. One of the best parts of Annihilation is that it does do something unique with the visual effects and the environments. The creatures within the Shimmer are frightening combinations like if you got to do a Build-a-Bear with monstrous, human-killing animals. You have this alien life that populates the screen with bright colours, but they manage to make it look sickly and scary even. This was an element I needed, with the slow pace of the movie it kept me engaged.So Lena is our protagonist who ventures into the Shimmer with her team to discover the origin and the threat level of what lies within. Lena (Natalie Portman), Kane (Oscar Isaac) and the team are all given compelling backstories, but I think I ended up liking the actors and actresses more than the characters. Lena isn't particularly interesting or easy to care about. She's very detached (that's by design) and her lack of emotion wasn't endearing, especially when we find out more about her. Its the same with the other characters, the actors and actresses have to do the work to get you invested instead of the writing. The only one who gets continued development other than Lena or Kane is Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and she's also deliberately cold. The rest of the team gets the initial character motivation description and the movie just moves on.The other reason I wanted to see Annihilation (other than Garland's name being attached and the good reviews) was that the movie featured a lot of people I like in the cast. I think Natalie Portman did about as good of a job as she could have, I liked her just not her character. Oscar Isaac did a fine job, I wondered why he signed on to this, he gets some solid screen time, but he isn't given a chance to do much. It was nice to see Gina Rodriguez again, she's the most emotional of the team but her reactions help sell the horror of the situation. I was a little disappointed Tessa Thompson wasn't given more to do. She's been really stepping out lately in stuff like: Thor Ragnarok and Westworld and while she does her job, I wish she also had more to work with. Jennifer Jason Leigh does well as Dr. Ventress and Tuva Novotny might have been my favourite doing an even-keeled job as Cass Shepherd.A lot of great science fiction isn't concerned about moving at a brisk pace. That's not a bad thing always, there's a lot of buildup in this movie and there were some quick moments that showed how horrible the Shimmer was. So, waiting for the payoff at the end didn't bother me. The problem I had with Annihilation was the ending doesn't have the punch I wanted. There's so much tension and when we finally get there... I thought it just fizzled out. I think the intention was for you to be a little more attached to the relationship between Lena and Kane but the flashbacks showing them was the weakest part of the movie. I haven't read the book, but I wouldn't have minded if the parts going back to Lena explaining the fallout and the bits of her marriage were just cut in at the end. Considering some of Garland's past work (Ex-Machina was great, and it ended on a surprisingly satisfying twist), it was a little disappointing. In a more minor complaint, I thought the score was overbearing. The song they decide to use in those flashbacks works but the rest of it blares and it was more of a distraction instead of helping things along.Despite my negative reaction to some of Annihilation, I did like this movie. I never turned on it or found my interest waning. I just got a little caught up in the hype around it and the final product was decent to me, instead of amazing. Garland is still one of the better directors working in this genre and I'm eager to see what he does next. Most of my problems I think come from the source material instead of his script or his directing anyway. If you loved this movie, I don't have a problem with that. A lot of people were calling this the next Arrival and I don't think it reached that level. I'll just be waiting for the Blu-ray or its release on Netflix instead of going to the theatre for my next viewing of Annihilation.",Annihilation
140,apryla-58795,The people who greenlit this should be annihilated,5,12 January 2019,"I gave this 5 stars only because I like Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac BUT I gotta say they both phoned it in and I expected better. I'm surprised they took these roles.The affair made no sense. If Natalie was supposed to be so in love with Oscar why did she sleep with that other guy?!Tessa Thompson...am I the only one who thinks she's overrated? She's in everything as of late but I'm like why though?! She's bland and boring.Gina Rodriguez was so extra in this. I like her but she overacted in this and it was silly.Jennifer Jason Leigh is past her expiration date and looks straight busted. She is so hard to look at. I never considered her a looker but wow! All those years of smoking have taken their toll. And what's with that angry mumbling act? She does it in every role. She's over as far as I'm concerned. She's just annoying now. No one is checking for her anymore. She needs to just quit. I doubt anyone would notice if she stopped acting. She brings nothing to her roles. She's very one note.This went on for way too long. It had potential and kept me engrossed but if I wanted to watch two hours of something going nowhere I'd stand in my garage and look at my parked car.And the ending? So I'm guessing NEITHER one of them came back. The glowy reptilian eyes? Amirite or nah?You know how when you add a certain movie to your watchlist on Netflix (like this one) and when you look for a movie to watch you keep passing over that one cause some kind of red flag is raised subconsciously?

Unfortunately, the story within that world felt awfully derivative, like a cross between Predator, Sphere, and a million other ""some scientists/soldiers face an existential threat"" stories.

THen where did the magic come from? People forgetting 3 days of time is magic in my book...Yet its basically never touched on again. And in the beginning, Kane says he saw her and came to her...This pointed toward a higher plane of existence that is also never touched on again. THe creature was as powerful as a god or perhaps what create life in the first place. Yet in the end, nothing comes together..it could have all added up together but instead it keeps its ideas seperated from each other...something i did not like",Annihilation
144,ronakkotian,"Plot holes aside, this is a very thought provoking movie",7,8 April 2020,"After watching Ex Machina, I immediately saw Alex Garland's next feature Annihilation and it was one of the most interesting films I've seen.Annihilation is about five scientists that sign on a dangerous mission into The Shimmer, a mysterious zone that's unlike anything on Earth.When the movie finished, I couldn't help but think about it for a long time. Yeah there are a few plot holes which I couldn't ignore but there is also so much that this film offers that makes you want to talk about and that's one of the best parts of Annihilation. This is a sci-fi that will really stick in your head. Like Ex Machina, Alex Garland implements many themes and ideas that will get fans of the film to analyse in immense detail.The movie also looks incredible. The look of The Shimmer is gorgeous and once we actually go inside it, the experience is further enhanced by the fantastic cinematography. There are some really suspenseful moments especially one including a bear that increased my heart rate and kept me on the edge of my seat. The execution of tension is done really well. The music towards the end is great and adds a great amount of intensity and atmosphere to what's taking place.The performances weren't amazing but they weren't terrible by any means. I enjoyed watching Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh as I thought they did a good job. Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson were fine. I thought they could have been a bit better. Oscar Isaac was also really good.Despite its thought provoking story, this film is nowhere near perfect. There were a couple times where I questioned characters' decisions but thankfully it didn't ruin the experience as a whole. The pacing could have definitely been better. All the events that happened before they entered The Shimmer felt a bit dull due to how slow everything progressed.Annihilation had caught my attention without a doubt. It certainly has its flaws with its pacing and some plot holes which are hard to dismiss but I love what Alex Garland is doing with the sci-fi genre. Both his movies aren't perfect but they do raise interesting questions whether it's related to AI or nature.",Annihilation
145,garethcrook,"We're in firm sci-fi thriller territory, but it lacks an edge.",5,18 May 2018,"A straight to Netflix film, there's now calls to get this a theatrical release. So is it worthy? We're in firm sci-fi thriller territory, but it lacks an edge. The darkness not quite dark enough. Portman and Jason-Leigh are good albeit a bit empty... perhaps purposely so, but there's a lot riding on Portman, with not enough made of the other characters and ultimately it suffers for it. Slow stark dialogue, long lingering shots, low rumbling drone sound effects, all seem a bit laboured, as does the shimmer effect (a character of sorts in itself) looks a bit like fairy liquid in the sink. I'm being harsh though, the premise is good, a mysterious growing haze taking over an American forest area (always America) with a lighthouse at its centre. Once inside 'The Shimmer' things improve, but it shows it's hand too soon and although there are still engaging events through to the end, the arc is clear. It's a bit like Predator meets The Land That Time Forgot and in the third act it all gets a bit prophetic and jumbled as it tries to help make sense of its increasingly weighty and abstract themes. There's some good ambitious ideas here and credit to Alex Garland for attempting something so grand, but it struggles in bringing them together. Apparently this has divided audiences and I can understand why, it fell short for me. The end titles though are beautiful.",Annihilation

Based on the first book in Area X: The Southern Reach Trilogy: Annihilation; Authority; Acceptance , Director Alex Garland decided not to make the film an adaptation, but a ""dream of the book."" Like most dreams, this film feels incomplete and somewhat unsatisfying in the end.Critics seem to be falling all over themselves with this movie, but the audience I sat with hated it. Some people saw that I was writing notes for a review, so when we walked out, they asked me what I thought. More importantly, I asked THEM what THEY thought. One guy shouted, ""It sucked!"" Several admitted they were disappointed and felt they had just wasted 2 hours of their lives. They were mostly guys looking for a sci-fi action flick like Alien. The good thing was that audience members wanted to TALK about it. I love that.The best description I've heard of this film is ""sci-fi modern art."" It's one of those polarizing movies that some people will love and others will hate. Tips for parents: 
Some bloody, gory, disgusting deaths.
Tons of F-bombs and profanity.
Twice you see the naked back side of Natalie Portman while she's having sex. 
Marital infidelity.
Creepy skeletons.
Uplifting theme: 
Humanity
Resistance to change
Trust
 Things I liked:
I adore Natalie Portman. She is both beauty and brains.
There is a similar scene in this movie that made Sigourney Weaver famous in Alien, where she is side-by-side with a sharp-toothed monster. Viewers who are expecting the entire movie to be another Alien will be disappointed.
It was good to see Jennifer Jason Leigh in something again, although it annoyed me that she was always playing with something between her fingers in the first half of the movie.
There are mostly women in the movie and they all do a great job. 
Director Alex Garland also did Ex Machina, so people were really expecting elevated material from him. He is great at providing social commentary and getting audiences to think.
Beautiful, delicate, colorful images. The ""shimmer"" is beautiful to look at and definitely creates that dream-like feeling that the director was going for. The environments are an interesting hybrid of heaven and hell.
I have really enjoyed Gina Rodriguez in Jane the Virgin: Season 1 and she does a great job in this film. What I didn't enjoy is that she drops F-bombs almost every time she opens her mouth. We get it...you're tough now.
Surprisingly, this movie is going to be released on Netflix outside of the USA shortly after the USA theater release.
The musical score is noticeably good. 
 
Things I didn't like:
It is no Arrival. I loved that movie for so many reasons. That's a movie that was expertly crafted to REALLY make you think. You can read my movie review of Arrival here.
There were moments when I was actually bored. It's a slow burn for sure.
Extremely cliched, disappointing ending.
I felt like I was watching a frustrating episode of Lost - The Complete First Season where a lot of questions are presented with no answers.
The film goes back and forth in time, which could be confusing and frustrating for some people.
When are people ever going to learn that it's not wise to go off alone in a , unknown territory?
 
Interesting lines:

""It's not destroying. It's making something new."" - Lena (Natalie Portman)
""God doesn't make mistakes. It's pretty much key to the whole God thing."" - Kane (Oscar Isaac)

148,dragokin,better than Avatar,7,7 January 2021,"It's been a while since an SF movie appealed to me as Annihilation did. If I recall well, the last has been Europa Report (2013), although not to the same extent. Therefore the number of reviews disparaging Annihilation surprised me somewhat.This movie is better than Avatar, the current gold standard for all SF outside Star Wars and Star Trek franchises. Admittedly, I streamed Annihilation and saw Avatar in 3D at a movie theater. Therefore I'm even ready to concede that Avatar had better special effects. Yet it's generic and predictable Hollywood blockbuster plot pales in comparison to Annihilation.The main protagonists, in particular Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh, outperformed what's expected of the genre. The rest of the cast did a very good job. Even Oscar Isaac with his trademark poor performance wasn't able to ruin the things.The story is suspenseful until the very end, which is, in turn, as close as it gets to a happy ending. What amazed me is that although some things in the movie were left abstract, everything was explained, as much as abstract thing may be explained in two hours of a movie.If you want to compare, Arrival (2016) which shares some motifs with Annihilation, did a much poorer job and, for that matter, left a weak impression. And if you really want to see what it means to leave abstract things unexplained, check Upstream Color (2013) by Shane Carruth.",Annihilation
149,andrewroy-04316,Another intelligent and atmospheric sci-fi movie from Garland,8,5 July 2018,"Annihilation properly lives up to the significant hype. With excellent visual effects, the shimmer felt unique and bizarre as it was intended to. Good performances, Portman is great and Garland brings his meticulous, tense style again. It definitely leaves me with plenty of thoughts. My understanding of the general theme is: there is some being or force that arrives and the shimmer surrounds it and grows outwards. The shimmer area refracts light and DNA, and also interacts with everything in it. So when people enter it, their biology is fundamentally changed and their cells multiply aggressively. DNA also interacts, as we see in the plants and animals of the area. When Kane and then Lena interact with the being at the lighthouse, that causes a duplicate of themselves to arise.The ending is a classic ambiguous but precise ending. First, the scene with Lena dancing/ fighting with her clone was brilliant and wild to watch, with lots of thematic depth. In the end, consistent with the central theme of self destruction, she escapes by giving her clone a bomb and burning down the lighthouse and the being. When the being is destroyed, the shimmer shuts down and the shimmer cells in other living things stop the aggressive reproduction they had been undergoing. This saves Kane. The ambiguity arises in Lena - many theorize that because we see her eyes flicker like Kane's, that she was actually a duplicate. This would explain why she didn't have clear memories from the trip, I think she had the emotional memory that indicates she was the original Lena. Of course she was fundamentally changed by interacting with the shimmer, but I think that shimmer addition to her DNA is what causes her eyes to look that way. The flash in their eyes just shows the presence of shimmer DNA, not that they were created in the shimmer. This movie is thematically brilliant, and the more I consider it the more I appreciate it. The extension of the cell tendencies to multiply from her initial lecture were obvious. The movie definitely has messages about cancer and what biologically defines a person. At its core, I think it's about the human nature struggle between aggressive replication and self destruction. This is a film that raises a lot of questions and is truly art, with so many relevant themes and possible takeaways. While I would've liked even deeper understanding of the characters (especially the psychologist), and the ambiguous ending can be frustrating, it's very intelligent and, like Ex Machina, feels like each scene is deeply atmospheric, holds significant weight, and contributes to both plot and themes.",Annihilation
150,bgar-80932,Decent,6,12 January 2019,I loved the premise I just felt like it fell flat a bit. A soldier who's the husband of Natalie Portman who's a former soldier and current biologist comes back from a zone of the earth that screwed him up. It's all hush-hush but it's messing up the world and causing most people who go into the zone to die. She joins an expedition and tries to figure out what's going on. It's a little slow for me but it's interesting to see the animals that got changed aka they got refracted by the lighthouse. They should have introduced concepts faster though but the idea of the movie is great.,Annihilation
151,bregund,They were zombies all along,9,12 January 2019,"I'm not sure when this style of acting became popular, but someone needs to tell directors that having actors stand perfectly still while speaking in a monotone makes the film LESS exciting. I needed subtitles for the emotionless asian guy, who i suppose is thrown in for chinese audiences. Overall the characters come off like mindless zombies, not real human beings faced with the prospect of the end of humanity. The alien's motivation was unclear...it goes out of its way to distort everything within the shimmer but then has no problem looking exactly like human beings at the Adam & Eve ending. What does the alien want? Natalie Portman doesn't know. If you don't know, why should I care? An ambiguous enemy isn't terribly frightening. Also, the affair served no purpose and didn't advance the story at all.",Annihilation
152,PyroSikTh,I Don't Know,9,12 March 2018,"Annihilation follows Lena, in the midst of grief from losing her husband a year ago. She's cut herself off from friends and co-workers and leads a sad existence. That is until her husband appears in her bedroom, with no idea how he got there, and appearing distant and vacant. They're both taken to a lab where Lena is introduced to The Shimmer, a bizarre optical film that's enveloped itself around a large region of swampland, originating from a lighthouse. No-one knows what caused it, or indeed what's going on inside. It could be extraterrestrial, metaphysical, or even religious, and every team and probe that has been sent inside has never been seen from again, until Kane. It's not long before Lena and a team of women enter The Shimmer to find out for themselves.What they're greeted with, after the initial lapse of time in their memories, is a place not too dissimilar to what you'd expect, initially. As they travel further in they find specimens that should not be possible, like multiple species of flowers growing on the same plant, and animals with unusual mutations like crocodiles with shark teeth. It wasn't long before I came to the conclusion that this was definitely a movie I wish I saw in the cinema, as the film's visual identity was uniquely beautiful and nightmarish in equal measure. The use of visual effects and camera trickery creates a world within The Shimmer that truly feels dreamlike. Every scene inside is augmented with an almost oily appearance from the refractured light. The further they travel inward, the more bizarre and crazy the mutations get, like trees made of glass, and plants shaped like people, and the combination of CGI and production design exquisitely brings it all to life.But there's a lot more to Annihilation than it's visual achievements. This isn't just a movie where our characters travel deeper into more bizarre lands, face some unstoppable antagonist, and then get the hell out of dodge. Instead Annihilation poses questions with no answers, and layers metaphors over symbolism. Dig a little deeper beneath the surface and you find a wealth of themes rarely touched upon in such an imaginative and creative way. Ultimately Annihilation is a film about self-destruction through evolution. Some of the opening lines of dialogue are about the nature of cancer cells, which is a motif that recurs throughout the film. What's inside The Shimmer is a cancerous, self-destructive nature that's chaotic without being inherently evil. It is both a dream and a nightmare, both beautiful and horrible. I wish I could delve deeper in this review, but I really don't want to spoil anything. There's so many layers to this that I could talk about it for paragraphs and paragraphs.The third act kicks it up even further, dialing the bizarre up to eleven and delving into the psychedelic leanings of 2001. It manages to effortlessly evolve the themes of self-destruction and chaotic nature into themes of identity. What does it mean to be you? What really defines who you are? We as people are constantly evolving and changing, both physically and mentally. You are not the same person you were yesterday, and the person you'll be tomorrow is not the person you are right now, and yet we are still us. At what point do we stop being us? Or conversely, at what point does someone (or something) else become us? Is it possible to become someone else? And like a cancer, the ideas get ingrained and you can't shift them no matter how hard you try.In this utterly peculiar movie I also want to point out the score, which is an atmospheric cacophony of soundscapes and motifs that would make the late Johann Johannsson proud. It weaves in a peaceful, calming acoustic guitar motif in with a nightmarish soundscape of synths and noises, and the sounds of the climax are so alien to the ears that they truly enhance what's going on on the screen in a way no other films have ever achieved. So bizarre are the sounds that I can't even describe what they sound like, or how they were made, but they somehow manage to remain oddly melodic as well. There's also some exquisite use of sound design throughout, creating an atmosphere inside The Shimmer that's truly unsettling. There's one scene in particular that is one of the most terrifying moments I've seen outside of full-on horror movies, and it's all thanks to the haunting sound design that turns what's already quite a scary creature into pure nightmare fuel.On the note of nightmare fuel, Annihilation has no shortage. There's a surprising amount of gore and body horror on display here, from a guys gut being cut open to reveal weaving intestines like snakes or worms, to plants growing from scars, skeletons methodically placed in sand almost ritualistically, to a corpse torn apart from mould and moss unlike any other. If the sound design doesn't thoroughly creep you out, the body horror certainly will.Annihilation is not for everyone, I can fully understand that, but it is absolutely for me. It's about as weird as film can get, unsettling and dark, with subtext both deep and extremely well developed. It's narrative is tightly paced, weaving together its themes in a such way that is impressively seamless. It's a film that sticks with you for a multitude of reasons, making it yet another overwhelming success for Garland from an artistic viewpoint. I give Annihilation a resounding 9/10. Watch it. Absolutely watch it. I just wish I could watch it in the cinema.",Annihilation
153,CinematicInceptions,"Original for sure, but dissatisfying.",7,3 October 2018,"I was pretty excited for this when I saw the trailers for it. I really liked Ex Machina and trusted that Alex Garland could deliver another original and interesting sci-fi movie. Natalie Portman was another draw since I loved her performance in V for Vendetta. The trailer itself also looked interesting in the sense that the whole shimmer thing was made to look mysterious and dangerous, but it was hard to tell whether it was actually sinister. So basically, there was a pretty solid premise for this movie, not one that was totally original, but one that was at least presented in an interesting way.There was definitely some delivery on this premise. The world within the shimmer was indeed dangerous, but not evil. The lack of concrete information we were given about the shimmer was good in that it made the movie have constant tension and mystery. However, it was really disappointing that we never really found out whether the phenomenon had an end game or the nature of it. It was cool to see Lena have to fight her mimic at the end, but that seemed to be the closest thing to an explanation that we got. I feel a little bad complaining that I want movies to have satisfying endings, but hey, endings are important.The story is definitely lacking in character. The team of explorers was distinct enough that I could tell them apart, but not enough that I was invested in them. Even Lena wasn't that compelling of a protagonist. It seems like there should have been more time spent displaying some of her skills, and her motivation for entering the shimmer wasn't one I could totally get on board with. As soon as she said she ""owed"" her husband, I was pretty sure that this meant she had cheated on him, and was disappointed to be have my theory confirmed. Yes, it makes sense that she would feel guilty about cheating on her husband, but it was still a generic motivation and made Lena feel like a more generic character.Credit must be given to the author, Alex Garland, and the visual effects department for creating a very stimulating and unique visual world for the movie. I would definitely hire the vfx department that worked this movie if I were a producer or studio executive. And even though my opinion of Alex Garland was lessened after seeing this, I will still pay to see more of his movies. Overall Rating: 7.3/10.",Annihilation

155,sweidman-28016,Yet Another Overlooked Gem,9,28 October 2018,"Yes!Annihilation was amazing! It was such a great sci-fi movie. I was very hyped to see this movie. It was visually stunning. The effects were really well done. The cinematography was beautiful. Probably the best this year. I also liked the score for the film. It worked well with the tones and sequencing in the movie. Some of the scenes in the movie were chilling. It captured what was happening and my heart was beating faster. It was a violent movie, but the violent scenes were really good. Alex Garland did well adapting the book into a movie. I really liked his previous film, Ex Machina, and I think it was under appreciated. It did win an Oscar for Best Visual Effects and Annihilation could too if we don't see anything better this year. Natalie Portman did well with her performance. This is one of her best roles since Black Swan. I liked Oscar Isaac's character and he did well too. As for flaws, I didn't like Jennifer Jason Leigh's character. She didn't have much with it and her tone of voice just bothered me. There were a few other characters that I liked, but didn't feel for them as much as I thought I would. That's pretty much it for flaws. This movie was amazing. You just have to be open for some weird stuff, confusion, and questioning. It's a mind bender. Some people didn't like the ending, but I thought it was great. That's where you have to be open to some confusion and questioning. I think this movie should be seen as it has been recently put into the top 100 best sci-fi movies of all time. Definitely see Annihilation!

158,nitzanhavoc,Alex Garland presents: How to destroy a film that could have been great,4,16 June 2018,"You know how sometimes you really want to like and enjoy a film, but it simply doesn't let you? Annihilation is a perfect example. As a devout Horror fan who's normally on good terms with Netflix films (despite the usually mediocre level at best), Annihilator's trailer really got me excited. Natalie Portman in a Horror film featuring a natural environment and mutated predators similar to the best features of Avatar? What could possibly go wrong?! Unfortunately, the answer is everything.Annihilation is two different films at least. The first 90 minutes portray an excellent story with a compelling plot. Portman, a former-soldier current-biologist, follows an all-female crew into an unexplained phenomenon codenamed ""The Shimmer"" in order to discover what about it has made her husband (a soldier who recently returned from there) suffer from complete organ failure. The acting is excellent, the characters are relatable and the all-female cast is far from being a political statement (this isn't a ""women studies film"" nor a ""chick-flick""). The ambiance is suspenseful and eerie, as you find yourself actually concerned for the future and welfare of all characters involved. As the predators become increasingly dangerous, one can't help but cheer Lena (Portman's character) on as her commitment to her husband aids her in overcoming all obstacles.And then? The final 25 minutes or so completely, utterly and unorthodoxly destroy the film. And by destroy I mean shatter, crush and evaporate any and every good thing about the story, plot and overall sense and mood. It feels like the screenwriter and director had absolutely no idea what they were doing and how to conclude the plot, so they decided to drop a little LSD and let it dictate the colors, soundtrack and general occurrences of the final scenes. I honestly have no idea why they would do that. The film was great, it was working, it was achieving all the goals the build-up had set up. Why allow for such a clumsy and extreme shift from suspense and horror to forced sci-fi? Honestly, why?! I haven't seen such a waste of talent and potential since the legendary Michal Jordan became a Baseball player.All in all, I can't find it in me to objectively rate this film. The first 90 minutes are a solid 8 in my opinion, with the final 25 deserving a zero, if not a negative rating. The resulting rating of 4 feels unjust for the first part and way too forgiving for the 2nd. Honestly, the cast didn't deserve to have their project destroyed so. Annoying, disappointing and truly sad. So, if you're a student or scholar of film, cinema, sound, philosophy or the sorts and are looking to study and analyze a piece - this film might be just right for you, your professor would probably appreciate an interpretation drawing from social, behavioral and existential theories. However, if like me you're just a common spectator looking for a fun viewing experience - do NOT watch this. I'm sorry, Natalie, you sure deserved better.",Annihilation
159,MovieCriticOnline,Not good...,1,13 March 2018,"Several problems with this film.First the writing. Too confusing, missing information. Lack of build up of character and relationships. This is always an issue with plot driven films. Not much to care about, and many times the writer over intellectualizes the plot so that it becomes overly written. Second, the directing. When you allow wooden acting get by, you are not a director. No one in real life speaks the way a lot of films portray them as speaking. Slow, monotone, and dramatic.Third, the casting. This cast is straight out of SJW Central Casting. It's okay to reflect real life and have men go into danger. Woman in charge, and all women go inside. Sorry, don't buy it. If you make a conscious decision what gender, race etc should be in your film, you are basing it political correctness and social justice, not talent or common sense.There is nothing wrong with any specific race or gender starring or carrying a movie, but don't beat us over the head with it, or make it the primary function of the film. There are plenty of great films starring a woman or other minority where it didn't feel like it was the reason behind it. Alien franchise comes to mind.",Annihilation

161,stevenrotherforth,Multiple viewings required. Sadly I'm just not that invested,6,17 March 2018,"AnnihilationAlex Garlands latest cinematic offering wasn't offered at the cinema at all. Well not at least in the UK.
A pleasant surprise then when scrolling through Netflix content I find the movie available to stream instantly. 
Winner winner chicken dinner!
From the emergence of this movies teaser trailer I for one was looking forward to seeing it.
Especially since I thoroughly enjoyed Garlands last movie Ex Machina and I thought his work on Dredd was excellent.Annihilation tells the story of a biologist played by Natalie Portman who signs up for an expedition to go into an area that's believed to be an environmental disaster zone.
The Shimmer as it is known is a growing environment where the laws of nature don't apply.
Think of this film as a serious version of the 2001 movie Evolution crossed with Aliens and John Carpenter's The Thing.This film tested badly at pre release screenings deemed too intellectual and complicated.
So it seems Paramount binned it off on to Netflix when the studio and director couldn't come to agreement.
However after the movies release actual reviews have been mostly positive.
Annihilation is definitely a much better film than the Paramounts other recent Science fiction movie The Cloverfield Paradox.
That too mysteriously finding its way on to Netflix prematurely.Annihilation isn't a bad film but for me it is trying to be too clever.
Like a good novel the film does start out in a gripping page turning manner.
However the movies intertwining subplots do detract from the meat of the story. I believe certain aspects could have been simply explained rather than devoting long drawn out scenes.
Perhaps this is where studio executives would have liked to have taken a pair of scissors.
Director Alex Garland was having none of it.
When the film does concentrate on the actual story we do get a rather tense and nail biting horror thriller. A particular scene involving a kind of mutant bear is most satisfying.Portman's performance is very good as you'd expect from her whilst supporting cast are a little under developed.
A dialogue scene involving Portmans characters and another woman in a small boat is the only attempt I remember at developing any of the supporting cast. The fact that I can't recall the characters name merits this gripe.
Super talent like Tessa Thompson is under used and it seems apparent that Oscar Issac crammed this movie in whilst taking a coffee break from filming Star Wars.Annihilation is a beautiful looking movie. I watched it on a large tablet with a good pair of headphones. Really I owe it to the films production crew to stream it again on a large screen in 4K HDR to truly appreciate the stunning visuals.
The problem is that the movie just does not compel me to watch it again.
I do hear all those reviewers who demand that this film requires multiple viewings to fully grasp the directors vision. Sadly I'm just not that invested.
I must agree that there's some
great concepts here and for a movie made on a fairly modest budget it does look and sound fantastic. But it didn't wow me in the way I thought it would.
Maybe it's me. Maybe I am missing the point.
Take the original Bladerunner. That particular movie took time to be truly appreciated.
Maybe Annihilation will do too.",Annihilation

165,Mike_Devine,Could have been a sci-fi event film,5,3 March 2019,"Natalie Portman has an impressively diverse filmography. From Amidala to Evey Hammond, she can pull off everything from friendly girl next door to badass chic. In 'Annihilation,' Portman aims more for the latter, but what could have been a promising sci-fi drama ends up getting bogged down in the swamplands of the panhandle where it's set.Clearly situated at the crossroads of dissatisfaction with her personal and professional lives, Portman's Lena is thrust into an experience she wouldn't wish upon her worst enemy. Ultimately, the warped scenarios she and a crew of outcasts (Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson) come across are a mix of disturbing, fascinating and breathtaking. While 'Annihilation' suffers majorly in the character development department, it somehow makes up for this in the cinematography, art direction and what can only be described as a score that would have been birthed if '2001: A Space Odyssey' and '1984' got together.When the plot finally constructs (or deconstructs, depending on how you look at it), it's clear the limits of Alex Garland's vision are tested...and overstep their bounds. Cliffhanger ending be dashed, the execution was unevenly paced and messy - not in a Picasso way, either. Meanwhile, Portman and on-screen husband Oscar Isaac deliver zombie-like performances, with Jason Leigh coming off colder than her haunted Dr. Ventress should be. Thompson perhaps gives the best effort, but that's not saying much.It's true that 'Annihilation' could have been in the realm of an 'Arrival,' but those hopes will clearly never be realized.",Annihilation

In its early days it needs dealt with and female scientists may hold the key.Inside 'The Shimmer' we find a world where DNA is 'refracted' in such a way that flora and fauna swap DNA and the resultant organisms range from extremely beautiful to hideously malformed. These along with a breakdown in the scientists' own DNA and organ tissue (leading to madness) form the threats to their existence as the seek the source of 'The Shimmer"".In many ways the concept is pretty close to standard fare but it is treated intelligently.

168,coreyjdenford,Annihilates your brain,10,13 March 2018,"This review of Annihilation is spoiler free***** (5/5)IF YOU EVER need a well-drawn, super-smart and thought provoking sci-fi (and in this world of identikit sequels, remakes and films we've seen done before we definitely do) a film that will take you on a ride of mystery, the paranormal and take you to a whole new world, then writer-director Alex Garland is your man. Though this isn't the first time he's taken you down this road, his brilliant Oscar-winning debut Ex Machina did pretty much the same thing, which had him take us on a winding road through super-smart thrills involving robots basically it was his vision of A.I. Now, we get his visitation of an alien world. Annihilation is Garland's version of Avatar, and in it he makes true to the different sci-fi tropes while still making it feel solidly original.First off it sets itself as a women-on-a-mission story - a five strong team of scientists each of them with very different skill sets (there's a biologist, a physicist, a geologist, a paramedic and a psychologist) they are sent on a secret, potentially dangerous mission to a crashed meteor site causing different changes in an area of Florida. But that's just the throwaway plotting, as throughout Garland (loosely adapting the best selling novel by Jeff VanderMeer) in it he tackles routes of grief, depression, loneliness and insanity. And with it he's created a story that could change the routes of typical sci-fi. Natalie Portman is Lena - a cellular biologist who suffers from grief after the mysterious disappearance of her husband (Isaac), she also suffers from solidarity and she always feels that her world is not going to be the same again. Normally it would be difficult to find an actress who can portray this kind of personality with such strength, such sadness and such feeling that can make you feel for her, and it looks like Garland has found his true calling in Portman. Of course you have to praise her co-stars too, who each take their roles (with Garland's magnificent guidance) and they each play them beautifully. There's Jennifer Jason Leigh as a sort of general type in charge of their mission, secondly there's Tessa Thompson who's another world beyond the strong warrioress in Thor: Ragnarok etc. And each of them bring the story to the ground. 
 
With that it helps that Garland and his visionary creative team make this world feel as authentic as possible, once through the shimmering purple shield like material it's almost as if Garland has placed our heroines on another planet, a world where evolution has escalated to 11, the animals have changed their features, tree like vines grow on buildings, there are different colours of flowers in the same batch. In short it's a world where nature has no rules, a place where time and space are irrelevant. At the same time Garland gives the audience the big questions; what happens in this place? Is it dangerous? What happens to people in the world? etc. The mysteries are relentlessly unfolded. Here Garland has conjured a world that's beautiful and will have you in constant awe. To be fair, it's best if you just go with it as the film drags you in. Garland was late coming to the director's route; Annihilation is only his second film yet it feels he's been directing for his entire life, but he hasn't been, he started out as a novelist (he wrote the novel to The Beach), later he turned screenwriter going on to write film's such as 28 Days Later and Sunshine to name a couple - this was all years before he took the plunge to write and direct his exceptional debut which was only three years ago. Whatever made him take his time to make these two films it's all been worth it, this is worthy follow-up to Garland's directing career essentially proving that his debut was no joyous accident one that soon saw him become a recognizable figure. And we can't wait to see what he does next.

This seems to be the overarching premise of the fascinating and fantastic sci-fi drama ""Annihilation"".What is indisputable is that the five actresses who play the leads in this film are individually and collectively exceptional. Don't call them bad ass babes. And don't you dare call this a ""chick flick"". What these ladies, in real life and by way of their fine performances, SHOULD be called, as a wise man of few words, my beautiful father, would say, is ""substantial"".And Dad would mean that as a supreme compliment.",Annihilation
170,dr_clarke_2,Cerebral science fiction that is happy to indulge in lashings of body horror,9,13 October 2021,"Having made his directorial debut with the excellent Ex Machina, Alex Garland followed it up with Annihilation, an adaptation (which Garland wrote) of Jeff VanderMeer's science fiction novel of the same name. As in Ex Machina, Garland favours cerebral science fiction, but Annihilation is nevertheless a very different beast, with more action and a larger cast, as well as a more epic scale, as per the original novel.Annihilation stars Natalie Portman as Lena, a scientist and army veteran whose husband returns from an expedition into a mysterious phenomenon known as the Shimmer, only to lapse into a coma. She promptly agrees to join a scientific expedition into the Shimmer to try and find out what happened, whereupon she and her fellow team members discover an environment riddled with mutated plants, monstrously altered animals, and a threat to the very fabric of their being. The film shares with Ex Machina an intellectual approach to storytelling, with an ambiguous ending that explores themes about identity, and there are interesting themes about suicide versus self-destruction.Garland again displays a knack for characterisation, which is teased out throughout the screenplay. Partly, this is achieved via a non-linear narrative that reveals Lena's affair with colleague Daniel, but not exclusively: Anya's growing fear and paranoia unfolds gradually and believably via the scripted dialogue, whilst the revelation that Ventress has terminal cancer suddenly makes sense of many earlier scenes.Unlike Ex Machina however, Annihilation boasts lashings of body horror that would make David Cronenberg proud, as the Shimmer starts to alter the team members' DNA and they discover the mutated remains of previous expeditions. The film footage of Kane performing field surgery on one of his fellows and showing his intestines moving like snakes is spectacularly revolting, and there is plenty of gore, for example when the mutant bear rips Anya's jaw off. Garland handles all of this with aplomb, and the result is often quite creepy, as Lena and her fellow scientists move deeper into the Shimmer and discover increasingly weird and grisly findings.The casting is exemplary, with Oscar Isaac reuniting with Garland to play Lena's mysteriously reappeared husband Kane, but most of the cast consisting of women, led by the ever-impressive Portman. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives an excellent performance as drawling, frosty psychologist Dr Ventress, whilst Gina Rodriguez's facial acting as the increasingly paranoid Anya says more about her character's state of mind than the script does. Garland reassembled many of the crew members from Ex Machina, most notably Rob Hardy, whose cinematography is, again, stunning, right from the establishing shot of the lighthouse. The film's visual aesthetic is further enhanced by the same VFX team as on Ex Machina, whose attention to detail is remarkable. Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow also reunite with Garland to provide a lovely, often quite poetic score.After only two films, Alex Garland is establishing a reputation as a director whose filmmaking perfectly elides with his talents as a writer, his literary influences showing in Annihilation via such flourishes as the use of on-screen titles to divide the film into chapters. Annihilation became a box office bomb on its release, but it is intelligent, exciting science fiction that doesn't deserve to be underrated and should leave the audience eagerly anticipating Garland's next directorial effort.",Annihilation
171,asb_deutsch,Could have done better with a proper script,5,4 October 2018,"It is like a serious Ghostbusters meets Arrival. Ending was over-directional. The director needs to respect the audience's EQ. Too many plot-holes...
They acted serious but wear is all the suits needed to protect yourself inside The Shimmer? Just to show that girls can also kick ass like men?Another example of forced feminism. In the end, Natalie Portman was going to be the heroine, no doubt. NP was ticking in bed like a teenager...atleast there should have been a proper bed scene!",Annihilation
172,DeBBss,Loved Every Bit...,8,29 May 2018,"I see a lot of reviews talking about how it's ""Confusing"" and ""It made no sense"". I mean come on! It's supposed to make no sense. It's supposed to be confusing. The reason why it made no ""Sense"" is because something from another world is changing and fusing DNA; it's a very simple story (For people who pay attention). The argument, ""Confusing"" is more reasonable than ""Not making sense"". This movie is meant to be ""Confusing"", and it's meant to make you think, and I respect that direction, because sometimes it's good to have an unexplained ending. I also see a lot of ""Boring"" in other reviews, and I get it, some people want to see action, but I loved the pacing, and I'll explain later. This movie really does appeal to a certain type of audience; people who love Sci-Fis, Thrillers and a bit of Horror and people who have patience, as this movie does have a slow start. Except from a few little issues, this movie is a really good Sci-Fi.Story: 9/10I like how the story doesn't explain things, and you learn more and more when the characters are learning more. But some subplots aren't explained good enough though, like how Lena is cheating on her husband. That subplot is more important then you would think, as it is the cause of Lena's husband (Kane) to leave and join this mission. The pacing affects the cheating subplot, so you really have to pay attention to what's going on. This is one of those movies that explains what happened in the past as the story is progressing, and I think that's why people are so confused. I liked how the movie doesn't go into detain about the alien, or the hole in the lighthouse, and we really don't know anything about everything. One of the biggest issues I have is at the very last scene, where we see Lena's eyes glow, if there was atleast five minutes more to explain just a little more then I guess it would be okay. Now the Shimmer. The idea that all the cells are changing and developing something new is one of the most original ideas I've seen in a long time. Seeing some of the characters change physically and mentally because of the Shimmer is really interesting. Overall, the story is creative. Sometimes a little too confusing, but it's balanced. But one of the subplots could've been done better.Characters: 7/10The story really doesn't focus on the supporting characters, and because of that, the characters are weak. All of the characters are explained of why they joined this mission, but not explained into detail. I already forgot most of the characters' names and why they joined, that just goes to show how poor the character development is. I think the characters are so weak is because the characters are used to show the dangers of the Shimmer's environment. Like how Josie was used to show how the mutations affect her, Sheppard and Anya were used to show the dangers of the mutated animals, and Dr. Ventress was used to show the power of the alien. I do think the romance between Lena and Kane was weak, we mostly see them in the subplots rather than the present. Overall, the characters are below average, and the romance is weak, but I liked how the deaths of the characters show how dangerous the Shimmer is.Action: 9/10This movie is a mix of Sci-Fi, Thriller and Horror, which is common in Hollywood, but the direction this movie took really makes it unique. As I said before, the Shimmer is one of the most original ideas that has come out in a long time. Using that idea and putting it into a Horror is a great idea. Most Horror movies nowadays rely on jumpscares to startle you, but this has no jumpscares at all, and it's even more scary because of that. One scene, when a bear is in a room walking around beside the tied up crew members, the bear makes a noise. That noise is the voice of Sheppard, how died by the bear. We hear her screams of pain through this mutilated bear. That scene was so intense and frightening that it made me cringe the whole time. The visuals are great, and everyone should atleast agree on that. The pacing is also great, it really keeps me excited for what's happening next. There's that mystery of what could possibly come next. I did hope to see more monsters though, if there was more monsters, then that would've been the icing on the cake. Overall, this is a scary movie (With no jumpscares), the visuals and directing is great and the pacing always caries a suspense.Overall, Annihilation has to be one of the best horror movies of 2018. And I know people are going to say; ""it's not a Horror movie."", but it did make me cringe, because of how scary it is. For me, everything is perfect, except for some little issues. I loved the suspense and how this movie never goes into detail about certain topics. I really do recommend Annihilation. You could watch it on Netflex in some countries, but in others you can't, but if you have the time, try watching Annihilation.",Annihilation

It seemed like she didn't even wanna be in the movie. There were so many weird plot holes that it made me think ""did they even watch the movie after finished working on it?"". The whole movie just felt like it was rushed and not written carefully.But.. The world was very pretty when they entered ""the shimmer"" and had that cool ""zone"" feeling from the stalker. I really liked the progressiveness of the world as they got closer to the lighthouse and the ultimate face-off was neat. I kinda wanted the movie to be longer and wanted to spend more time in that environment. It's about 5 scientist entering a zone called ""the shimmer"" which alters the plantation and all living life.

Think I got 30 or 40 minutes in, looked up from my computer and realized that awful pretentious psychiatrist was still droning on to Natalie Portman about some pretentious babble in the facility. It was nothing like the trailers made the film out to be. Natalie Portman should not be cast as the lead in movies anymore, she does not care about acting anymore, hasn't since she finished Leon. It's sad that she continues to get jobs when other actresses can't break into the industry. I really like Alex Garland's writing, but as a director, he's horrible.

but it was no better than ex machina.
it was a very different movie Alex Garland's head is really hard to understand this guy is in a very different size then i can't imagine how the next film will be but great.
If we go to the film at the beginning of the film still can not understand Kane show up,five women come into the glow they all have their own reasons so far everything is good but It is not known what a complete complexity it is.
We already knew from the very beginning that only lena would be survive from glare we just watched how other women would die, and it seems to me that they all died in a ridiculous and meaningless way.

The film initially felt clunky and disjointed. After this last watch most of the issues washed away. I still don't think it's perfect, far from it, but there is A LOT that I competely missed the first time. My second watch felt far less disjointed and the pacing was a lot tighter. After just my second watch the experience of the film was far more enjoyable and I got a lot out of it.

179,MogwaiMovieReviews,Sci-Fi Fan Fiction for Much Better Films,4,11 November 2020,"I actually just got round to watching this movie today, and it's an odd one to try describe, neither as deep and profound as its rather silly defenders would have it, nor as unremittingly awful as the fandoms on the internet would tell you.Basically it's a bunch of recycled concepts from better films (Stalker, The Thing, Arrival, Under The Skin, 2001, etc) tried out in a new setting with just about no story stringing them together: an alien cancer starts spreading in an anomalous zone known as the ""Shimmer"". Five extremely unprepared women are, for no good reason, given guns they don't know how to use and sent in after a bunch of far better prepared soldiers had previously gone in and died. They find a landscape where people have turned into trees and other things, and nature in general is mutating. There is an incredibly brief showdown with the alien thing and then the film's over, with the suggestion that it is the alien that has survived and escaped into the outside world.Every single character is forgettable, vacuous and dull, along with every line of dialogue they are made to speak, and yet the mood summoned up is at times quite compelling, and the visuals sporadically dazzling. The problem is just that they are in service to a story that goes nowhere and has nothing clear or important to say, about people we can't warm to or care about, and don't feel we got to know in any way by the end of the movie.So it's a definite failure, but I'm still glad Alex Garland tried to attempt something more challenging than another dumb alien invasion action movie, even if it turned out little more than half-thought out teenage fan fiction for the previous films I mentioned.",Annihilation
180,Mcduff3601,More like a drama that has some sprinkling of horror and action,6,21 October 2019,"There were things I really liked about this movie, like how it strived to be slightly different and beautiful in some ways. The visuals were well done, the music score set a tone of unease and wonder at the same time. The acting was fairly ok. The idea behind it was intriguing and makes me want to read the book it was based on. However....There were some pretty big plot holes that were hard to forgive, I kept thinking, well if this was real the military would do things this way. There was a made for tv vibe when it came to the ""horror"" aspects and I think it's because there was so little of it and spread so far apart that it felt slow, hence why this feels more like a drama.There are a lot of unexplained things in this movie that don't really resolve to a statisfying point and at one point I thought well I guess that is kind of the point of this movie. It's a bit of a philosophical noggin scratcher so if you are not in the mood to question the meaning of your own existence and how life as we know it is a construct of our own psyche then skip this one and watch Predator (a straight up shoot em up sci fi action. slightly horror movie).All in all I was entertained by this movie but I can see why people don't like it.

181,pkpera,Is there hope for human race with scientists like this ?,3,3 May 2018,"This would be 3rd movie where scientists in main role act like idiots most time, what I had misfortune to see in last year. Other 2: Life, Alien Covenant.
Beginning was not bad, and it promised some interesting voyage into unknown.
But, when I seen how 5 females walk toward 'Shimmer', with riffles in hand, I started to not like it. And it just got worse. Going to certain bio-hazard area without protection ? And main actress even knew that is 'infected' little later.
On top of stupid things it became very slow in many scenes. And so on ...Now, this movie made me thinking, no, not because good movies make people thinking (criteria failed), it is just me, who was reminded on some other recent movies. So, I think that if time will come to abandon this planet, and go to some other one (to destroy it too ???), we should exclude all those with Dr. before name , except medical doctors. And I will say now: I'm not going to Titan. I prefer global warming to -200 C. 
What is life ? Destroy, or be destroyed. With scientists we have high risk to not only destroy own home, but being destroyed by single entity. In one movie (don't remember now which), human race was compared with viruses - as only species which destroy environment what gives them conditions for life. So, we have a lot to learn from most of animals. They are indeed smarter. Why ? I guess because they don't watch 'Sci-Fi' movies :-)",Annihilation
182,CountJonnie,(Self)destruction.,7,5 June 2018,"Natalie Portman is on a mission to enter the glimmer. A strange area that deforms nature, from which no one returns, except her husband who is changed. Now Portman goes in, to search for the extra terrestial cause and to stop the expansion of the area until it covers everything, and changes everything, including her.The movie works in an abstract way, but if you look past the visuals, the message is simple. Total destruction, by self destruction. If nature doesn't kill mankind, than humans will. This becomes obvious when the alien object starts copying people's looks and behaviour. It copies movements, including attacks. Which means that it attacks humans, not by choise, but merely by copying human attacks at it. Eventually, when the transformation is almost complete, the alien even self destructs by ""accidentally"" setting everything on fire, destroying the glimmer and the cause.Every act of horor in this movie (except for a few mutated animals) can be brought back to human behaviour. Even the alien who starts copying human behaviour has a human cause of destruction. In that way, this is a rather pessimistic movie, with an almost realistic message, in a beautiful package that makes the message looks more attractive than it really is. And the acting by Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac is near flawless.",Annihilation
183,themadmovieman,"Boldly unsettling, visually beautiful, and full of brilliant tension and drama throughout",8,20 April 2018,"If you're looking for a tense, unsettling and powerfully atmospheric sci-fi complete with stunning visuals, enthralling drama and mind-blowing thrills, then look no further than Annihilation. With his signature style, director Alex Garland creates an absolute masterpiece with this film, providing not only a visually beautiful sci-fi, but also a film with such ingenuity, and such an affecting atmosphere that your eyes will be glued to the screen at every moment.There's so much about this movie that will send shivers down your spine, but the majority of that can be attributed to just how powerful an atmosphere is created throughout every single moment. Much like his previous work Ex Machina, Garland is able to craft a both elegant yet powerfully unsettling vibe around the entire film, and in tandem with the film's jaw-dropping visuals, there's something so affecting about the film that you can't get away from at any point, pulling you further and further into the bizarre and mysterious world being created before your very eyes.What's even more impressive is how the film manages to combine various genres in a both innovative and cohesive manner. Its sci-fi elements take centre stage throughout, but alongside that, there's a distinctive haunted house-style vibe surrounding the scientists' journey into 'The Shimmer', creating great tension that far surpasses typical horror movies, and makes for an even more thrilling watch throughout, as you feel deeply unsettled by the potential for danger in this new world alongside the wonders and marvels that have been created.And then on top of that, the film does a brilliant job of being an engrossing character-based drama as well. Although not all of the main group of five are as interesting as one another, Natalie Portman's character is indeed a riveting lead, bringing emotional depth to the story as well as an endless curiosity that drives you, the viewer, to want to venture deeper into The Shimmer, something that makes what would normally seem like stupid horror movie decisions feel a lot more understandable, and much easier to relate to.In all truth, I won't say that Annihilation is on the same cerebral level as the likes of Ex Machina or Arrival, but the way it goes about its story, at its core a conventional adventure into the unknown, with such bold ingenuity and endless imagination is absolutely stunning to watch from beginning to end.From beginning to end, the film is powerfully unsettling, even featuring what I can call one of the most stunningly disturbing scenes ever put to film, but it's still an entertaining and engrossing watch throughout, thanks to beautiful visuals at every moment, engrossing characters, a very strong lead performance from Natalie Portman both on a physical and emotional level, and brilliant tension and sci-fi intrigue that will definitely have your jaw on the floor come the end.",Annihilation

The Shimmer has been completely blocked off by the U.S. government. Many teams have the entered area previously, but none have yet returned. This time the team has changed and we have a group of female scientists (Including Lena) who will now investigate. ""The Shimmer"" is also something that appears to be growing more and more, so time is of the essence. Lena is someone who has had army experience as well as currently being a biologist. Will they survive the unknown area? What is the cause of The Shimmer and where did it come from? And what happened to Lena's husband?!Director Alex Garland (Best know for his previous work directing the sci-fi film, Ex-Machina) returns to write and direct this new film. Like his previous work, this film has the genre of Sci-fi, but with a higher level of Thrill and Horror elements. We are very fortunate to have this film go directly to Netflix Australia considering the film's talent both in front and behind the camera. In some states, this film is being shown in cinemas before a digital or physical disc release.The picture and audio is a sci-fi fan's dream. ""The Shimmer"" is amazing to look at, but also has enough ""unknown factors"" for us to enjoy all elements. Some visuals may come across somewhat basic, but the creativity and thought process that has gone into this film is something to admire and respect. Creepy electronic music also stands out to create suspense and feels rather fitting throughout the film's duration.This is also a film that will require your 100% focus as some elements may make viewers frown at the film. I personally enjoyed not knowing what was going to happen next as each scene was overall unpredictable. I sat and watched with many possible outcomes in my mind, not sure which one of them would be correct. It's nice to enjoy a film that is not so obvious that we spoon feed all the details. The film also focuses more so suspense and gore rather than being a non stop ""Predator type"" action film.I personally felt Natalie Portman was a great choice to play Lena, but I do feel her presence in the film's 1st act was a tad weak. Another note to mention is that during critical and horrific moments, you will find some of characters exploring ""The Shimmer"" will give little to no expression based on the situation. At times all characters can look so dull and plain or even worse- some frighten and some not at all. None of characters felt consistent in regards to their actions. There are other minor moments one could point out but when it comes to sci-fi, how picky can we get?Overall I enjoy the concept of this film. It's new, it's creative and tries something different from just being just another sci-fi film. Seeing Natalie Portman take the lead in something different for her was also refreshing. Considering how many films have gone to Netflix, this is definitely one of the better films I've seen go straight to Digital. Perhaps it would upset the creators of the film (Paramount) when they realise how many people would have been glad to pay for a ticket to see this in cinemas (including myself). The fact you can watch this film on Netflix right now means we are rather spoilt...7.4/10

186,williampsamuel,"A Mind Bending, Horrifying, and Sadly Overlooked Sci-fi Masterpiece",10,15 March 2019,"Annihilation is many things. Beautiful. Otherworldly. Unsettling. Terrifying. Bizarre. Any many more. But above all it is brilliant. As horror, action thriller, high concept sci-fi and deeply introspective psychological study it works on every level. It's not a movie for the casual filmgoer, or one that is easy to wrap your head around. But for experienced viewers prepared to have their minds blown, Annihilation is a real treat.The premise is that Natalie Portman is Lena, a biologist who has lost her husband and travels into an area of altered reality called ""the Shimmer"" to learn what happened to him. No one knows to expect when they go in, because only one barely conscious person has ever returned. But nothing could prepare them- or the viewer- for what they find inside.They're on Earth. There are touches of the familiar all around. Abandoned shacks, bayous, alligators. But at the same time the inside of the Shimmer is in many ways a beautiful and alien as Pandora. It's not often you feel compelled to comment on the vegetation in a movie, but the flowers and trees they encounter are simply gorgeous, filling the screen will a whirl of colors completely at odds with the film's tone. The creatures on the other hand are pure nightmare fuel. They're recognizable animals but twisted in horrifying ways that hint at the deeper corruption all around them.Most of the best horror movies work because they stand as a metaphor for our deepest and most common fears. Alien was Rape. The Babadook stood for overwhelming grief. And Annihilation is about guilt, paranoia, and utter mental and emotional breakdown. It's fascinating and more than a little unsettling to watch how each of the main characters slowly become unhinged as they try and fail to come to terms with what they're experiencing. Some display an ever-growing sense of fatalism. Others flat out denial, or overpowering suspicion. In a movie where so much is utterly alien, their breakdowns are surprisingly realistic and nuanced. This could have worked solely as a psychological horror film.But of course the filmmakers weren't content to stop there. There's extremely frightening imagery and bits of gore, used sparingly enough to retain their full impact. The found footage from a previous expedition is literally stomach churning and will probably be too much for many viewers. There are even good jump scares. And oh, how the movie can build suspense. As they go deeper into the Shimmer the tension builds and builds and is held so long as to be almost unbearable.And the ending is simply beyond anything most viewers have ever seen. There are no words to adequately describe it, and to even try would spoil it. Suffice it to say that you will be in a state of utter wonder and bewilderment. There are many things about it I don't understand. But then they're probably not meant to be understood, or even possible to understand. The final act of this movie is Akira level mind-bending. It makes 2001 or Inception look simple and unambiguous.I have my own interpretations of some parts, which I think are what filmmakers intended. But for so many aspects there are no firm answers, only endless possibilities and the questions they create. And that may be the true genius of this movie. For all the terror, the wonder, and the wonderful acting, perhaps what Annihilation succeeds at the most is how much it will make you think.",Annihilation

Each character is actually diagnosed with cancer (not in a direct way, but the way they deal with the situation in the Shimmer is actually the way people deal with cancer), but it is said that only Ventress has cancer. Some fight it, some face it, but some give up and die without trying. In the end, Ventress hits the last stage of cancer and dies, but Lena fight off the cancer.

This movie many things it's cerebral and philosophical, it has horror aspect, action drama. It a sci-fi movie not really geared towards everybody. Beneath it's stunning and somewhat surreal visuals theirs a meaning to it, as to what exactly the theme and the meaning is more up to interpret. I feel really does a good job and makes you wonder, question discuss about what you just saw makes you see sort of a bigger scope of wants reviewed as dangerous or evil. So it has those elements it's not just a bunch of women going around shooting monsters, though you set get a fair amount of that it doesn't over saturates the movie. The design of the shimmer really does stand out for. The film it does really feel otherworldly. Nothing's in order abstract visuals , animals are evolved. During the day everything's bright and green. Lastly the characters overall they all do a good job Natalie character is compelling you can understand to her and the building with her and Oscar Isaac. There's only one thing that was rather pointless and doesn't really add to her character and I'm sure you'll know what it is when you see it.

Boring and slow, even the 'action' scenes seemed drawn-out and did not create excitement or tension.

190,darkreignn,A really intriguing story makes for an endlessly entertaining experience,8,12 November 2021,"In many ways, this movie is similar to alcohol - when the film starts and your eyes take their first sip of the gorgeous cinematography, when your ears first hear the euphoric score, the experience is immediately rapturous. However, as time moves forward and goes on, the experience has the potential to quickly devolve into chaos and confusion. In the case of ""Annihilation,"" however, the chaos and confusion is simply part of the fun.""Annihilation"" is a film that struck a chord with me as soon as it started; the too-bright, borderline oversaturated look of certain scenes, and the indie-esque music playing over them, managed to catch my interest right off the bat. And then the plot started - and I was officially hooked. The film follows Natalie Portman as Lena, a professor and a biologist whose husband, played by Oscar Isaac, was presumably killed in action during his time in the military. But surprise, surprise - one day he returns and effectively throws Lena's life into disarray. How did her husband return? Where was he? And what was he doing there? All of these questions, and more, are asked, but are they answered? You'll have to watch to find out.What I loved about ""Annihilation"" is the fact that it isn't afraid to pose questions to its audiences that may or may not have clear answers to them; this mystique only adds to the intrigue and watchability. It sets up mysteries that you'll want to solve, and strings you along on a story that's ripe with suspense, especially when the science fiction elements begin. Alex Garland, director of ""Ex Machina,"" is no stranger to sci-fi, and it shows here in almost every aspect of the film. Garland makes ""Annihilation"" a movie that feels like it actively wants you to explore it; so as the characters discover a world full of wonder, you're right there with them, wanting to figure out more.To put it simply, there are just so many interesting things that happen in this movie, and everything that happens begs to be questioned and thought about. ""Annihilation"" is not an action film, nor is it a horror movie, even if it does have elements of both action and horror. At the risk of sounding cringy, this is truly a cerebral experience that demands viewers pay attention. All at once intriguing, thrilling, spooky, and entertaining, ""Annihilation"" is a sci-fi movie that, I believe, you'll enjoy; I certainly did.",Annihilation

192,Maleplatypus,What a bunch of Hollywood bulls**t!,2,9 January 2019,"This movie is not complicated. To the contrary, it's very simple and stupid. I did not read the novel so let's concentrate on the picture. It is visually interesting but that's about it. For starters, the story (or some substitute for it) is insulting. What kind of idiot sends anybody in any kind of anomaly without a HEV suit and with M16? Here we have some lousy variance of body snatchers but without an apparent purpose. Time inside the anomaly passes slowly than outside of it, which is a nonsense per se - no pace warping or singularity that would cause this. So called scientists do not use any of their specialty for anything useful and their talk is childish. Most of the film actually nothing happens, except for one of the girls (physicist?) becomes a plant and some shots are fired into the CGI monsters. None of the characters react naturally (curious? fearful? angry? whatever?) but like dolls, and cliches are used abundantly. Really, if this movie is an allegory - what does it really show? Acting is far below any acceptable level. Never liked Ms. Portman but this is even below her ""standards"". If you wanna watch a true SF movie, meaningful and with a clever message, watch ""Arrival"". This one: skip or forget. It won't be hard in either case.",Annihilation
193,Aly200,"Thought-Provoking, Tense and Provactive",8,27 February 2018,"From Alex Garland, director and writer of 2015's ""Ex Machina"", comes the on-screen treatment of Jeff Vandermeer's bestselling science-fiction novel. Natalie Portman stars as a biologist who decides to enter the mysterious 'Shimmer', a colorful invisible wall cloaking a dark and possibly dangerous secret, to find out what has caused the sudden illness of her militant husband (Oscar Isaac). Director Alex Garland has crafted a strong female lead in Alicia Vikander's Ava in his debut feature and even with adapting a screenplay the director manages to keep his female characters strong and the film's casting helps. With Oscar winner Natalie Portman (alleged whitewashing rumors aside) as leading heroine, Lena, the actress provides both a naivety but also fierce courage to the intelligent biologist. Lena knows so little about her husband despite how much she says she loves him, but her drive for knowledge leads her to inspect the mystery of the Shimmer after her husband goes comatose. Portman does not allow her character to become a whimpering mess when faced with extreme peril within the Shimmer; she fires her weapon to help protect her comrades, uses logic to try and assuage their fears but is willing to admit there is much they don't understand and in the end her relentless nature helps keep her alive. The talented supporting female players help round out the core players and clashing personalities to Portman's Lena. Character actress Jennifer Jason Leigh plays psychologist Dr. Ventress, a mysterious/secretive woman who is unwilling to tell her comrades the truth of why the group is actually going into the Shimmer. Her secretiveness ultimately leads to the demise of several characters and Ventress is unremorseful for what her actions and lies have done to others as long as she benefits and try to succeed in solving the mystery. Gina Rodriguez as Anya is one of the more damaged members of the group as she quickly succumbs to paranoia within the artificial environment despite the best efforts of Lena and fellow member Josie (Tessa Thompson) to calm her. Her bond with the soft-spoken Cass Shepherd (Tuva Notovny) seems to be the only happiness Anya knows in her life. Tuva Novotny has the smallest amount of screen-time of the female players, but shows her worldliness in such a small amount of time. Cass knows that she probably won't return home and makes vague remarks to Lena throughout the film, but provides the most human element of her companions till her time does run out. And then there's Tessa Thompson as the troubled Josie, a kind and soft-spoken soul like Cass but has endured more pain than the others. Josie like Cass also knows her time will run out before the mission is over, but she has made peace with the idea and when her moment comes she calmly accepts her fate. The film's visuals are primarily subtle, but haunting and stunning. The Shimmer is simply a mesh of light colors like pink, green and white and glows or shimmers (like the name implies) but its influence is felt throughout the environment by the viewer and characters. Motion-capture is even used for the hybrid creatures such as a monstrous crocodile that tries to dispatch our heroines. The narrative is overall straightforward, but comes with some twists and turns particularly by the final act. The mystery of why our heroines are in the Shimmer appears to be answered, but the answer isn't so simple as the teams' own mental states come into question as they trek further into the Shimmer. Even the reveal of what happened to Oscar Isaac's Kane is not what we thought actually happened and we share in Lena's anguish at the truth. However the film's greatest mystery comes with the final shot of the actor's eyes and makes you wonder if the Shimmer is still alive and influencing our survivors.",Annihilation
194,austin0731,A missed opportunity with a brilliant first half,7,17 March 2018,"Admittedly I had high hopes before watching Annihilation on Netflix no less as the producers have suddenly decided not to release the film in cinemas in my country. Sadly, I did not find this to be an amazing film, it was good but I just expected so much more especially after being hyped up as being ""Too smart for most audiences"". Now this might sound like the film is in fact too smart but I just don't see that as the case. High concept films like this have a tendency of ambiguity and suspension of disbelief, in most cases I see myself as one who tends to be more lenient and overlooking of such absurdities as in the case of Interstellar's final act which remains one of my favourite sci-fi films. Yet Annihilation just doesn't do it for me. I've heard and deciphered that the overarching theme of the film is this self destructive tendency of humanity and the symbolic nature of cancer cells in their ability to corrupt but also their existence as a natural biological error. Certainly an interesting concept to be paralleled with the symbol of the shimmer, the careful foreshadowing of the refracting effects of the shimmer and other slight symbols that the film drops along the way. However, by the end I can't help but think, so is that it? Now, obviously that final confrontation between Natalie Portman's Lena and the alien humanoid thing was absolutely insane and intense, there just doesn't seem to be that much of a purpose or message behind it. And unfortunately even the 'twist' that the film leaves us with of whether or not the Lena we see remains the same Lena as the one we were introduced to does not save the film. However, this aside and the somewhat awkward dialog aside Annihilation was a very beautiful film visually. The characters were interesting enough and I very much enjoyed the slow burn first half of the film. But, as we approach the second half of the film when the pace quickens I just felt that all of that slow intensity just went away and we are left with irrational characters doing cliched horror movie character things. To me this was a missed opportunity but because of its amazing first half I believe annihilation deserves its praise. And, whether you agree or not with my interpretation of the films ending at the very least Annihilation is one that is bound to spark conversations.",Annihilation
195,asifahsankhan,"A ""Heart-Popping"" Thriller!",9,17 April 2018,"A few months from now, there will a daily heat index to monitor and football derbies to watch and weekend beach trips to plan. And you'll still be thinking about the closing moment of Annihilation.I would not dare delve into it, only to say that it's one of the sci-fi thriller's many searing images. This is the brand of film that moviegoers should crave: Cerebral in its story and heart-stopping in its pacing. You thought Alex Garland's previous film, Ex Machina, was wickedly disturbing? The English writer-director delivers a similar meditation on the cutting power struggle between man and science - only now he's been given a sky-high budget. The result is a stellar, dazzling wowzer that opens itself up to theories galore. That's the mark of a true Thumbs Up.Annihilation is a ferocious, feral, female-centric update of fearsome monster classics like The Thing and Alien. Garland shows an unerring hand in building a sense of unease about what evil lurks in a forest that's been taken over by some kind of ""other,"" and then making it pay off. An enjoyable film for most of you. 
But a ""Must-See,"" surely.",Annihilation

The parallels between the two films are striking, but Annihilation falls short in comparison, despite having two strong legs to stand on.

197,carlos37andre,Good,7,15 June 2019,"Technically speaking the movie is great. The acting is good, the CGI is awesome, the cinematography is really really good, and etc. It has good questions within it, with my favorite one being what exactly is evil? Cause throughout the whole thing, we see that this isn't a hostile type of alien contact, things are ""evolving"" in a certain way inside the shimmer, they are not destroying everything, they are changing it. I love that part.I found hard to care about Portman's character tho, even more when we find out that she has being cheating on her husband.There are other notes I've took throughout the movie, and I just gonna leave them here.At one point she says ""I know what I have to do"". I mean, do you, really? So, do you need to risk your life in this alien-ish thing just cause you cheated on your husband?One issue I have with the movie, is that I feel that it throws a bunch of stuff on the wall, and doesn't answer almost any of them. Like, why don't they remember setting up camp in the beginning? What's the reason for all that part?At the end, I just felt like the alien was really stupid. I mean, dude, haven't seeing fire at ANY POINT in your intergalactical trip? For real? Why would you just lie in the ""roots"" (or something) of your hole base in the planet. As almost like it was trying to screw everything up.Also, makes no sense at all that she is an alien at the end.7/10",Annihilation
198,FairlyAnonymous,Criminally underrated and superior to Ex Machina,9,15 February 2019,"I'll be honest, I really didn't want to like this movie. I watched it with low-expectations because I had been doing catch-up on ""sci-fi movies I've missed over the years"" and after seeing ""Arrival"" and being thoroughly disappointed by its failed attempts at trying to feel attached to the characters I kind of expected the same from Annihilation:""Here we go, another sci-fi movie with a female scientist/professor who gets whisked off to some strange alien location to solve the mystery and naturally the mystery won't really be solved but it will be ""deep"" and open ended.""And... yeah... the movie is like that.I would be lying if I said the first half of the movie REALLY GOOD or interesting. It doesn't stand out too much except for the good cinematography and the mystery doesn't appear to be all that complex. The characters are okay but they don't stand out too much as a lot of their backgrounds and motivation seem pretty standard: Dead kid, dead husband, I'm going to die, etc.. yadee yadee we get it. Everyone has a tragic past or future. However, the big difference between this movie and Arrival is that I legitimately CARED about our protagonist's relationship with her husband. The movie gave us reasons to believe they have/had a good relationship and that this relationship is something worth fighting for. I understand our protagonist.The movie chugs along with nothing too interesting happening, but then the final act comes along...The ending of this movie is why you should watch this film.Everything about this ending is perfect and makes the film work as a whole. It symbolically and literally encapsulates all of the themes and ideas that have been built up throughout the film and the way it tells you this is through visuals alone and little to no dialogue.Fortunately, this movie has a bunch of little hidden clues in it if you watch it a second time. Certain elements that seemed weird on the first watch through now make a bit more sense on the second. It's kind of like watching The Prestige (though not as big of a twist) where you are looking for all the little clues and what not.Go watch this movie.",Annihilation
199,harrylosborne,"Promising start, frantic middle and muddled ending",6,15 April 2019,"Annihilation was always going to be an ambitious task, adapting Jeff VanderMeer's defining novel into a suitable cinematic experience. On initial viewing, you think this has been accomplished: swathes of exotic environments, bright colours and curious organisms fill the scenes, providing a surreal but ominous backdrop for Lena (Natalie Portman) and her expedition. Some of the graphic effects are amazing, fully conveying their intended dread. However, as the story progresses, this magic begins to be lost - only so much CGI can be used before becoming oversaturated, a gamble which this film decides to risk.In terms of acting, the all-star cast (Portman, Oscar Isaac, Tessa Thompson) all lend their own devices to building suspense and mystery, with Portman being given the bulk of the difficult material. This becomes difficult to appreciate, however, after the plot begins to give way to gratuitous violence and fight scenes. Soon after, the story seems to fall apart completely, culminating an an ending that is as dissatisfying as it is nonsensical. Annihilation is worth watching purely to give credit to the visual effects on show, not to mention if you are partial to a sci-fi flick. Beyond this, however, a shallow plot prevents this film from really separating itself from mediocrity.",Annihilation
200,kevinxirau,Dare to journey into the unknown?,7,9 June 2018,"It has been a while since I saw a film that challenged me intellectually or one that straight up messed with my mind. Well, here's one that does both, ""Annihilation"", based on a book by Jeff VanderMeer. Plot: Natalie Portman stars as Lena, a former soldier turned biologist who joins a five-woman group sent to investigate the source of the Shimmer, an expanding otherworldy force altering the landscape and wildlife in radical ways. As the group draws closer to their goal, they themselves undergo changes both mentally and physically. This is a story H.P. Lovecraft would be proud of in terms of a cosmic force twisting the perception of those in contact with it. The affected land combines awe-inspiring beauty with unsettling horror, especially where the few creatures seen are concerned and the effects used to bring them to life combined with the natural setting are a real beauty. The explanation of how things work is equally interesting and the source of this bizarre phenomenon is treated with an ambiguous, less-is-more nature. Lena's personal journey is pretty well-crafted, though I feel that there's one aspect regarding her marriage with Kane (Oscar Isaac) that could've been handled differently. Most of the film has this quiet, somber feel with little music used, allowing the atmosphere to settle in and put you in the characters' positions, walking a blurry line between marvel and uneasiness. My main criticism would be while the acting is fine, some of the cast don't leave much of an impression, especially Jennifer Jason Leigh as the rather lifeless Dr. Ventress. Another one would be one or two decisions made by members of the group being shortsighted and rather predictable.All in all, ""Annihilation"" is a mind-boggling, thought-provoking venture into the unknown and a nice piece of pure sci-fi storytelling. If you can handle a little disturbing imagery, then you may find enjoyment in this adaptation.",Annihilation
201,Lewis_Heather787,So many questions but no answers!,7,12 March 2018,"Where do you start with this film?? There is so much going on in this film, this is not an ordinary run of the mill film, ordinary is the polar opposite of how you would describe this film. Firstly Alex Garland who is now on my radar as a director, this film is definitely pushing the boundaries for the genre and for film making in general. This is only his second film he has directed!! I personally wasn't a huge fan of ""Ex Machina"" thought it was good but not much more, ""Annihilation"" on the other hand is a better film, for me personally. He has not only pushed the boundaries in terms of directing but the story as well, going to places that are definitely not usual. Does every risk in this film work??????? NO, but I respect the attempts and efforts made by Garland to try and make something new, fresh, different and challenging to watch. Overall he has done a great job.The film is extremely well cast, as if the characters were written for the actors. Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tessa Thompson, Gina Rodriguez, Tuva Novotny and Oscar Issac are all really good and solid in their respective roles but obviously there is one standout of the film and that is the central character played by Natalie Portman. She is simply fantastic in the film bringing a great emotional heart beat to the film throughout. As soon as the film gets going you, as the audience, instantly gravitate towards Portman as a person let alone the mission she is about to get herself involved. She is faultless throughout and works perfectly as the audiences eyes through the mission in the shimmer. Also the fact that the whole crew going into the ""Shimmer"" were all female was never really mentioned apart from maybe once if I can remember. The film doesn't need to mention it or make a big deal about it because these are all extremely talented individuals going in to do a mission, it doesn't matter about their gender. The film handle this potentially risky subject matter really well from overshadowing the film, praise goes to the whole female cast and Alex Garland. Other positives are the sound and cinematography which are both haunting and mesmerising at the same time. Both elements are breath taking throughout the film and do a great job in heightening tension or showing the false beauty of the ""Shimmer"".The main negatives with the film are the story and the pacing, both of which at times are incredibly slow and for the story over complicated. Now I like a good slow burning Sci-Fi film like ""Blade Runner"" , ""Arrival"" or ""Interstellar"" but this film, in its quite moments, really did absolutely nothing. It is as if the whole film just slows down in the middle act and just wanders around pointlessly. Nothing really happens to move the film along in the middle, its just really confusing. 
This links to the story which for the most part is interesting and fascinating to watch and go along with, however when the third act arrives it drops the entire film into bizarre confusion. This film definitely gives out more questions than answers which I like about films in general, I like to be challenged as an audience member than rather have everything handed to me on a platter. However this film goes for it too much and tries to give to many questions without any answers. Two Oscar Issac's?? Glowing person?? Glowing Eyes?? What I am trying to say is that the film is trying to hard to be ambiguous and clever for its own good. I don't think it answers a single question brought up.... I could be and probably are wrong.Overall 75% out of 100 or 7.5 out of 10 this film is good almost very good, its is not an ordinary film and is 100% not for everyone you've got to like challenging films to enjoy this. Has some fantastic elements but some also puzzling ones that make no sense. Great cast and directing, worth a watch but its not easy!!",Annihilation
202,mr_bickle_the_pickle,A Good 2/3 of a movie.,7,15 June 2018,"A good 2/3 of a movie. Its a stunningly beautiful looking film. I think Alex Garland has a great eye. It did a good job of setting up the mystery. And I genuinely wasn't sure where this was going or what to expect next. The atmosphere worked, it definitely had this dream-like quality to it. However, I feel like the third act is where it starts to get messy and convoluted. There was a couple of times where the film reminded me of another recent sci-fi film Arrival, but unlike that film I didnt walk away from it with this feeling of profoundness. Also, it never made sense to me that they went into the Shimmer without any kind of hazmat suit on. I mean they make a big point in the movie that they have no idea what it is and how nobody ever seems to come back out, you think they would take some precaution. I get they don't want to film the majority of the movie of people in suits but they could easily shoot a scene where the test the air on the inside and deem its ok to take off the masks and suits. And when they collected samples, they never put on gloves. I know that may seem like a small gripe, but it just wasn't that believable. Natalie Portman is really great in this film. Tessa & Gina were good too but they also didnt have as much to do. I mean, this really is Natalie's movie. Jennifer Jason Leigh though just looked bored for 95% of her screentime. And I get her character is meant to be more aloof, it just...I don't know...didnt come off properly for me. I'm rating this movie a 7. If they had changed the third act up, I would have for sure rated this higher. Because besides a couple of small gripes I was really enjoying this movie and mystery and eerieness behind it. And I thought the story/plot was good up to that point. I wouldnt mind seeing this movie pop up around awards season for some tech noms as well cinematography. I don't know if it will. But I think its deserving of that. I also think Natalie Portman would be deserving of a Best Actress nom, but not only do I think thats very unlikely of happening, I also recognize there is a still a lot more performances to see and so that might change.",Annihilation

205,Jared_Andrews,The Visuals and Sound will Take Your Breath Away,8,28 February 2018,"Alex Garland loudly and impressively announced his presence in the directing world in 2015 with his debut film, Ex Machina. His follow up doesn't disappoint, as he once again showcases a talent for boldly bringing sci-fi to the big screen in a thoughtful and visually awing way. With that said... this movie isn't as clean as Ex Machina. It's clunky in its delivery of the film's message, which is foggy. I'm still not certain what this movie is about.Is it about the different ways that we self-destruct? What we do to hurt ourselves without even necessarily being aware of it? Or is it about life and change? What at first seems like destruction or annihilation is actually just an alteration or even an evolution. Again, the answer is unclear. But the good news is that didn't bother me. I enjoyed the heck out of this movie!Does every scene work? No. Are certain plot lines about main characters' relationship issues necessary? No. But none of the flaws mattered much to me because I found the rest of the movie to be so magnetic. The visuals and music attached to this magical, dreamlike place-the shimmer-sucked me in and left me in awe for extended sequences. Certain scenes, especially moments in the movie's second half, are so captivating that the flaws and underdeveloped aspects that make up the rest of the movie seem irrelevant. The movie takes your breath away in different ways. Sometimes it's terrifying. Other times it's spectacularly beautifully original. Other times it's befuddling. I enjoyed it all.That's why I look past the story's weaknesses. I've opted to focus on the mesmerizing depiction of the area/the shimmer. Bringing that to the big screen feels like a spectacular feat of filmmaking. The performances from the actors are all fine. Nothing wowing, which is a bit disappointing considering how the loaded the cast is. Tessa Thompson is an absolute comet. Natalie Portman is well-respected for good reason. Oscar Isaac crushes every movie he's in. He does an admirable job in Annihilation. All the actors do. I certainly prefer charismatic, sparkling eyes Isaac, but he flexes his versatility here by playing a spacey, confused dude. An odd moment worth mentioning: Oscar Isaac vacillates in and out of a southern accent in one scene. It's jarring and inexplicable. But most viewers probably won't notice that. There's a chance that I imagined the whole thing. This movie can mess with your mind (in a fun way).

I walked into this knowing nothing about this movie. it's rare that I see a film without doing copious amounts of research on it first, but a friend strongly recommended it. I must say I'm immensely impressed.Annihilation falls into a weird category of movie that encompasses elements of a sci-fi thriller, horror, philosophical drama, and a odd acid trip. The initial setup of the movie is relatively simple. A woman goes on a mission to investigate a mysterious area in an attempt to help her sick husband, from there all hell breaks loose.I love the way the movie Incorporated so much in its run time. The Sci-Fi elements felt fresh and original, taking a unique spin on a recycled concept. The horror elements at times remind me of John Carpenter's The Thing. Brutal and horrifying at the same time, but very well done.The setting of the movie reminded me of a haunting dream. It had moments of absolute beauty and intrigue, while other times morphing into a twisted nightmare. Acting wise the movie was well done all around. Natalie Portman was a outstanding protagonist. The entire cast was packed with strong female leads. There really wasn't a bad performance.The movie was written and directed by Alex Garland who is known for writing 28 Days Later and directing ex machina. So of course with Annihilation there were huge philosophical implications. The movie brought up interesting ideas regarding the nature of humanity, evolution, and the concept of self. It asked quite a number of very intriguing questions. It is definitely a movie that will leave you thinking on many levels.I really enjoyed this movie, but it is not without its flaws. The ending is very open ended and Incredibly ambiguous. At times the movie brings up more questions than it answers.

No, don't even start with this movie being deep and thought-provoking or somehow a psychological masterpiece, it is none of that. This movie consists of one completely illogical action after the other. If this was a somewhat real setting all the characters would be dead within 5 minutes of entering the ''shiver''. I simply can't fathom how can you have an amazing premise like this and run it down the drain by an absolutely idiotic and illogical plot. At this point i am starting to think Hollywood is doing this on purpose, there is no other explanation. There's heaps of precedents to learn from, there's an over-whelming amount of knowledge on creating films and writing stories within Hollywood, there's amazing actors like Natalie Portman starring in this movie and still it comes out absolutely horrible, how can this happen? And this is not only the case with this film, almost everything coming out now is an absolute load of bullcrap, as if these movies are getting made for 3 year olds to look at the funky imagery, really disappointed. Yes, you could argue that the scenery was outstanding and beautifully done throughout, i won't deny that, the cinematographers have done their job right, atleast, but by no means does that make up for the enormous plot holes and absolutely non-existant logic in this movie. This movie really reminds me of ''Gravity'', which had the same thing going on, amazing graphics with an extremely weak plot. The only way to enjoy this film is having it play in the background while you are doing something just to catch a glimpse of the funky scenery once in a while, if you are someone who likes to analyze and thoroughly understand movies, this is surely not for you, as soon as you begin watching questions of confusion will arise and they will never stop until the ending, which is really weak too, the ''twist'' if you can even call it that is so pathetic a toddler would laugh at it. 3/10 for the cinematographic achievement.",Annihilation
211,jhmoondance,Second time watching this movie!,6,26 March 2019,"Had to watch it again, I think now it's more of a movie about female empowerment. I must stress that I am a female myself!
It's too focused on the voyages of female friendships than being about a sci-fi movie.
No edge of seats spooks n even when the renegade crocodile appeared it was more of a visit to the zoo!
Good film nonetheless but definitely not worth delaying coronation Street for.",Annihilation
212,tigerfish50,Annihilation of a Decent Idea,1,5 March 2018,"A meteorite strikes a lighthouse on the southeastern US coast and a mysterious 'Shimmer Zone' begins expanding from the impact point. The government keeps the event a secret and sends military units into the area, but none of these personnel ever return. After about a year, the special forces husband of an ex-Army biologist called Lena suddenly shows up at their home, remembering little of the previous twelve months and immediately falling seriously ill.After this 15 minute prologue, Lena joins the next all-female expedition. The five women enter the zone, discover their communications devices no longer work and witness some disturbing events. Rather than return to base and report these discoveries, they push on, arguing among themselves and making foolish decisions like a bunch of dim-witted teenagers in a slasher pic. The military and scientific background becomes increasingly unbelievable as action sequences and some uninspired CGI overwhelm the film's grown-up possibilities.Many sci-fi fans will recall JG Ballard conceived the original idea of an expanding zone where the laws of nature are transformed and human psychology reconstructed. Compared to Ballard's 1966 novel 'The Crystal World', Garland's movie version of Jeff VanderMeer's copycat concept is an ordinary adventure yarn spiced up with some sci-fi mumbo-jumbo. 'Annihilation' ends up as inconsequential as Garland's 2007 'Sunshine' screenplay - and after 'Ex Machina', it's a major disappointment.",Annihilation

214,hunter-friesen,Intriguing setting and atmosphere capped by poor characters,7,25 March 2018,"Alex Garland has slowly built up a cult following in the last fifteen years. He started out as a writer doing appreciated independent films such as 28 Days Later and Sunshine. He went more mainstream by writing and allegedly directing (according to Karl Urban) Dredd in 2012. The film surprised both critics and fans with its great writing and atmosphere. Garland now had the freedom to create his own projects, which is exactly what he did in 2014 when he released his biggest hit as a writer and director, Ex Machina. He's back in 2018 with another well made and ambitious sci-fi film, Annihilation. The film starts out introducing us to Lena (Natalie Portman), an ex-marine who is now a biology professor. One day, her presumed dead husband Kane (Oscar Isaac) returns from his secret mission, but he's not the same as before. He quickly becomes deathly ill and is forcibly transferred to a military hospital. It's revealed there that Kane's secret mission was a recon assignment within a mysterious place known as ""The Shimmer"".The Shimmer doesn't come from Earth and it doesn't follow the rules of our planet. Unfortunately for humans, The Shimmer is expanding and is seemingly inhospitable to us. Lena and a crew of fellow women must venture into The Shimmer to understand and stop our extinction.The film can be described as action and sci-fi oriented. There's an aura of mystery carried throughout that keeps us hooked as we beg for new information to be revealed. The women all receive the same information we get and none of them know more than us. This immediately connects us to their fate as we watch them embark on an expedition that could only be classified as suicidal. The Shimmer itself is the best part of the film as it is treated as a central character. Within it, reality bends through spins on the laws of science. Animals are crossed between species, time is diluted, and cells react differently than what was thought possible. Everything is interesting to watch and think about, and it is all grounded enough to be believable.Garland gives the film a philosophical theme about human nature and how we deal with the unknown. The whole way through we watch as Lena and the crew react to the unknown world around them. All the character react differently and some react more. It's a careful examination of what about us makes us human and what separates ourselves from everyone else.Garland has written a great premise with amazing atmosphere and setting, but he didn't really write good characters for us to follow along with. Lena as the main protagonist is pretty good, but her supporting cast pales and is barely tolerable. Each of the supporting women in the group is all one dimensional and have little to no with original traits. I couldn't tell you their names immediately after hearing them. The characters also didn't have good chemistry and always felt too distant. I know the women didn't know each other before the mission, but their relationship never felt developed.Just like the characters, Natalie Portman is the only person here to give a good performance. She's fully invested in the role and quickly adapts her performance with the circumstance. Her facial expressions are key to us for understanding the complex material. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives one of her worst performances as Ventress, the leader of the expedition. She's extremely onenote as the commanding officer and becomes frustratingly annoying by the midpoint. Tessa Thompson, Gina Rodriguez, and Tuva Novotny have all done better work than this as each feels way out of their element. Alex Garland has created his most ambitious and interesting film yet, packed to the wall with sci-fi elements that constantly make you think and wonder. While he didn't fill his world with interesting characters, Annihilation still ends up being a smart film that delivers on its puzzling promises.",Annihilation

Fantasy,adventure,horror,sci-fi,thriller,mystery. We needed a movie like this to come along its been pretty stale. I had high hopes for this film and too many times do they under deliver by either not being exciting as the previews or just npt making any sense and the endings don't deliver, This film delivers and it even has beautiful women in the movie who are obviously attractive but not once were they objectified for they're looks.. It's a brainy movie but you don't have to be a rocket scientist to keep up. It even makes sense as far out there as it gets you can kind of figure it out without thinking anything is dumb or stupidly written if u know what i mean. Do yourself a favor it's A must watch if your into these genres. Not slow it has a Good pace so the mystery unfolds beautifully. One of my top picks.",Annihilation

217,WubsTheFadger,Annihilation,8,13 March 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerAfter seeing the trailer, I was thoroughly intrigued and had to see this film. After watching the movie, I was utterly confused at what I had just seen. When I got home I looked up an explanation video on YouTube and it helped clear things us immensely.The story is very complex and detailed orientated which makes it hard to follow. The sci-fi and mystery part of the film is great. The horror aspect of the movie is nonexistent because it is not very scary. The build up to the ending is the best part of the film. The ending is weird and very strange to say the least. I personally believe that this film has a lot of personal interpretation to it. The ending can mean what you want it to mean. The science aspect of the film is also a high point of the film.The acting is very good. Natalie Portman delivers a stunning performance as a woman in search of redemption, answers, and finding her true love. Oscar Isaac, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tuva Novotny, Tessa Thompson, and Benedict Wong all perform very well. Gina Rodriguez performs the worst. She is a cliché female side character who thinks she is badass and tough. She is painfully annoying and I was happy when she died.The pacing is great. The film slowly builds up the tense and the story. The runtime is a little overlong.Pros: Complex and interesting story, good combination of sci-fi and mystery, the building up for the ending was great, Natalie Portman's performance, good overall acting, and good pacingCons: A somewhat too complex story, weird ending, Gina Rodriguez and her terrible performance, and an overlong runtimeOverall Rating: 7.8P.S. I would highly recommend watching an explanation video on YouTube. It helped clear things up immensely.",Annihilation
218,Semisonic,Yet another sad sci-fi,6,6 October 2019,"It's funny how we love categorizing things, as if putting a label on something makes it easier to understand. ""Science Fiction"" is one of those labels which makes us think we know what to expect. But sci-fi films may be as different as a horror movie and a Mickey Mouse documentary. There are serious sci-fi's like Terminator or Alien, there are epic sci-fi's like Avatar, there are even yeehaw sci-fi's like Back to the Future.And there's this genre I'd call SSD. Slow, Sad and Disturbing. Something sad like Nocturnal Animals, something slow like Arrival, something disturbing like Enemy, but joined together into a single pseudo-hypnotic experience.Annihilation isn't gonna annihilate anything but two hours of your time spent on watching this. What it can give instead as a semi-bitter and semi-disgusting sense of wading through treacle of the author's convoluted imagination and troubled visions.It can also give you some food for thought and imagery abstract enough to stir your own desire to interpret things. Which may be the major goal for any art form. In this sense, Annihilation does indeed not destroy, but instead just changes what exists and creates what hadn't existed before.If you find this text difficult to interpret and not too pleasant to read, that's probably a good thing, because it's giving you a sense of what you'll probably feel watching this film. So it's up to you to decide whether you wanna volunteer for such a task. However, one thing is certain: if you are tired of banal stories and superheroes with blasters, then Annihilation would certainly become a refreshing experience.",Annihilation
219,Come-and-Review,An 'intellectual' sci-fi horror,8,25 August 2018,"This film isn't at all a light one to watch. Very tense, at some point genuinely terrifying, devoid of an immediate explanation for most of the story elements, and deep in meaning, it is a fairly good science fiction (maybe even horror) film.The plot centers around a scientific expedition in Area X, a region where laws of nature apparently don't apply and supernatural events happen. Something I really like about this film is the semi-absence of expositional dialogue. Most of the information is implied or provided visually, and the amount of dialogue is reduced to the minimum. I consider this to be a positive thing in a visual medium like film.Alex Garland's previous film had an overall gloom tone and tackled with deep themes. This film does the same, but at a magnified grade: towards the second half of the film, the flick provides a huge rate of anxiety to the viewer, while it focuses mainly on psychological themes, such as self-destructing tendencies and depression (hence the title). Visually, Annihilation is wonderful to watch, end credits included. It has a distinct visual style, which makes it very appealing, and a tendency to blend in well practical and computer-generated effects. The all-female lead cast seemed to me all right. I wouldn't say it was a particularly challenging film to act in, which also means there weren't any relevant performances, but I can say that the actors where rightfully cast for their roles.When I first heard about this film, I immediately thought of it as a 'Stalker' rip-off. It has numerous similarities to both the 1979 film by Tarkovskij and the book that inspired the soviet film (""Roadside Picnic""). It still sounds to me very odd that the author of the Southern Reach Trilogy (from which this film was adapted), as he claims, invented by himself such a similar premise and story for his books without knowing about ""Roadside Picnic"" or ""Stalker"". I won't get into details, but there are numerous, starting from the features of Area X (the 'Zone' in the russian novel and film), the supernatural events that occur in the place, the institution studying the phenomena and so on.Annihilation is a stunning and meaningful film, and so far one of the best ones of the year. Definitely it's a memorable netflix original, even though, in my personal opinion, it isn't as thematically deep as its soviet counterpart was.",Annihilation
220,pontram,It Could Have Been a Masterwork,6,12 August 2018,"Based on the experience watching it, I would have given ""Annihilation"" 8 or even 9 stars. But based on the many things where this movie fails, I can't give more than six stars.
Where it shines:
-Fantastic music and scenery
-Great Digital effects
-Atmosphere, sense of wonder
-Full of Tension, good pacing
Where it fails:
-Lacks any plausibility
-Making no sense at all
-Completely missing character development
For the positive attributes I feel no need to explain them, for the negative the following has to be said.
If you want to make a film that lasts in the audience's memory, you have to minimize the amount of ""suspension of disbelief"". If a movie is entirely constructed to fit the needs of the production and not the needs of the audience, something went wrong.
""Annihilition"", while utterly beautiful, haunting and fascinating, during its best moments, suffers of very unbelievable premises. Remember, there is an event that is unpreceded in history, and even today it would not be possible to hide a growing anomaly that huge for a year. Further, the idea to send a platoon of armed women into the anomaly, without the possibility to report their sightings directly, is completely ridiculous. Even, or just because there were other teams before, which did not return. Who wants to waste people ? You could keep sending teams, until the alien lifeform consumes a continent, with no success.
There should be countless other, much smarter options to get a picture of the situation, but of course we have to follow the dumbest of them for only dramatical purposes.
However, on the inside, there are some completely unnecessary violent encounters, which are only there to create fear and a kind of tense that should not have found its way into this movie. I did not take ""Annihilation"" for an ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" horror-action thriller, but more in a ""Solaris"" or ""Stalker"" direction. 
The idea of an experimenting nature, without any other primary purpose or a mindset like ours, is a great one, and executed properly, but only in fragments and in the end. I wonder if the movie wouldn't have benefitted from another thirty minutes of exploration and transformation. 
So, while everything could have been great with a bit more overthinking, ""Annihiliation"" only partially succeeds in being impressing. On top of it, it gives us only a bit of a definition for the main charcter, the others are only shadowly persons.
In the end, you may feel tricked, as you think you have seen a good movie, that is in truth not such a one.",Annihilation

All five women were stellar with Natalie Portman proving again why she's one of the best working actresses in Hollywood. This is mainly a Sci-Fi film but does stray a bit into action and horror. The scene with the bear/wolf with a screaming woman's voice is some of the scariest and tense moments I've seen in any horror in a long time. The final scene between Natalie Portman's character and the metallic doppelgänger just fills you with dread and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The way it moves and reacts to her is mesmerizing and so unnatural that it makes you feel almost off. Other than that, the film is visually stunning to the point that it feels like a massage for your eyes. I'll probably end up watching it again!",Annihilation

Fortunately some awe-inspiring effects and a wave of energy towards the end keeps it from being a real stinker, but the problems remain. What problems? You could call it ground-breaking to cast a bunch of actresses in the traditionally male roles of a team of scientists and explorers checking out an unexplainable phenomenon, but in this case you could also call it boring and unbelievable. There is zero chemistry between the romantic leads (Portman and Isaac) and Portman seems pretty detached throughout. She and her team are called on to inspect some sort of anomaly (the shimmer) that appears to rewrite the genes of animals and do other weird things. The movie is clearly influenced by J.G. Ballard's weird phenomena stories, SF horror flicks, and especially by Tarkovsky's ""Stalker."" At the end you will still be scratching your head over what took place, but it is not likely you will care very much.",Annihilation
228,plasticanimalz,Pretty Good,7,30 May 2018,"I enjoyed it more than I did the book. Surprisingly, it had the skeleton frame of the book but was otherwise very different. Though, I only read the first book and not the entire trilogy, so there could have been some stuff worked in there. I would say you could read and watch the film and get almost two different stories. The film had a nice pace to it while the book ambled along not giving much payoff. It was sort of The Maze Runner for adults, but much more literary and not a rough draft of a book that somehow made it on the shelves.I most enjoyed the performance by Gina Rodriguez, whom I didn't recognize from Jane the Virgin, given her performance was such a departure. Tessa Thompson...I just like her performance from Thor: Ragnorak, so I'm going to like her regardless. The movie mostly centers around the women, the mystery, and the other world, so, the actor's performance is the most vital, as is the look of the film. They all did a great job. I personally hate Poe from Star Wars, so, it will be hard to package Oscar Issac to my liking, but, whatever, yeah, he's in it too.It had good tension, good mystery, looked great, good to great performances, and the overall film is an interesting take on the whole invasion concept which is typically involves lasers or alien possession. More of an interesting thought piece. I don't remember the whole biology angle playing in the book that much, other than she was a biologist...but that could be because I was bored of the book ambling along, but I did think it was interesting in the film, the whole concept of splitting cells. They even weaved it into being a bit poetic, intermingled with the horror-type elements.Not great like the new Blade Runner, but a decent enough film.",Annihilation
229,gcsman,SF films keep extending their reach,7,18 March 2018,"I see the pro critics generally like this film a lot, and it certainly does have lots of plus marks to note. It's a bit frustrating to watch in places, but it's visually striking and gets more so as it goes on, as we get further and further into the center of the mystery called The Shimmer. I also see that numerous viewers didn't like the fact that not everything is spelled out for them in the plot. This was never going to be a film that had mega-box office appeal, but that's no indicator of either its quality or its importance in the developing history of SF films. Sure enough, in the plot of Annihilation not everything is explained: some things that happen to the exploration team just -- happen. Exactly what they are after and what they are supposed to do when they reach the lighthouse at the center of the Shimmer where the unexplained phenomenon started, are never spelled out. 'How' and 'why' are not questions that are always addressed, all the way through to a somewhat ambiguous and vaguely unsettling ending, although the principal hero (Natalie Portman's role as Lena) does rather clearly succeed in triggering the Shimmer's self-destruction in the end. (With apologies to Virginia Woolf, a subtitle for the main episode inside The Shimmer could be called To The Lighthouse.)One thing I liked was the way that a major stereotype of such films was turned on its head. The team of five agents put together to go into The Shimmer is all female, played by Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tessa Thompson (almost unrecognizable here compared with her recent turn in Thor: Ragnarok), Gina Rodriguez, and Tuva Novotny. If this had been a movie from a decade or more ago, we'd have seen a team of five tough-guy Marines marching with machine guns at the ready into the misty forest of the Shimmer. But hero teams like this have changed with the times, and nowadays, it's become standard for them to have a woman or two and of course some ethnic diversity. But here? We have five *women* in fatigues marching into the misty forest, machine guns at the ready. This was very strange, and also very refreshing. Each of them is there for different reasons (in Portman's case, she is driven to find out what happened to her husband, a lone survivor from a previous team who has come back out (again, we don't find out how) in a near-catatonic state.). All of them are capable in their own ways, but because of their various personality flaws all except Lena fall victim to to what the Shimmer has to throw at them. Bottom line? Absolutely worth seeing, and a worthy new extension to the expanding range of the SF genre. It's virtually at the opposite end of the spectrum from Star Wars. Here, the setting, the ambience, and the mood are almost the main point. This is rare, but it's not an absolute newcomer to this kind of style. To me, it resembled the moody and mysterious 'Solaris' (the one from 2002 starring George Clooney, which is also worth seeing if you haven't. I admit I haven't seen the earlier classic Russian version of Solaris from 1972, which is a gap I need to correct as soon as possible.). Just settle in and let it take you along. A lot that you will see will stick in the mind.",Annihilation
230,PotassiumMan,"Unreal, insane journey into the metaphysical",9,18 March 2018,"Alex Garland has given us quite a memorable piece of cinema with this new sci-fi/horror work. The storyline centers around a former soldier-turned-academic who ventures into a scientifically mystifying and inscrutable zone of supernatural activity in the aftermath of her husband's troubled return from a mission into that area, which has been festering and expanding for years. She joins a group of fellow scientists/military personnel in the hopes of finally ascertaining just what the zone is and what goes on inside it.Natalie Portman is terrific as the biologist whose core motivation is understanding just what happened to her husband (Oscar Isaac in a small but effective role). Jennifer Jason Leigh is compelling as a psychologist who is in charge of the mission that Portman joins. She is iron-willed in the face of a zone that becomes more dangerous and terrifying as the mission progresses. Strong supporting performances from Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson add to the mix. In the process of the mission, questions of ethics, existentialism and the human condition are raised, albeit tangentially. Human frailty and its occasional conflict with scientific understanding also comes into play.I found this film extremely compelling and even if some scenes were a bit protracted, it didn't take away from the film's effect or achievement. The exquisite visuals contrast sharply with spare but ferocious moments of brutality. It epitomizes a world that science knows quite well- the wonder and the horror of our existence and how we are sometimes left with more questions than answers. The film's vision of scientific rules being bent is imaginative but not overindulgent. Viewers who prefer something concrete and definitive in its storytelling might not take to this, but for those who like a film that raises challenging issues and is alternately placid and scary, I highly recommend this.Postscript: I would advise the studio that produced this film to not conspicuously advertise the fact that it is already being released on Netflix. In my view, that really cheapens the release and makes it look like a made-for-television movie, which it is not. There is a definite audience for this, but perhaps not the masses.",Annihilation

234,AnishMisra,Annhilation Review,9,30 March 2018,"Annhilation is a film written and directed by Alex Garland. I watched the trailers for this film and was impressed by it. Before that, I had followed the film for over a year as I loved Alex Garland's Ex Machine. And I can definitely say the same for this film too.Plot Lena signs up for a dangerous, secret expedition into a mysterious zone where the laws of nature don't apply.Story and direction: This is the kind of science fiction film that not only has a great story but also does challenge your mind. The film builds every minute. Not a single minute felt dull. the characters of the story were great and you could actually connect with each of them. Each of them had some sort of pain or loss that makes you feel for them. A salute to Alex Garland for giving us a compelling story and women (lead) characters that don't feel like sugar coating. The film is left open ended which I liked because I could keep thinking about this film, which I wan't from any film that I see. The VFX for the film is awesome. This goes on to show that no big money is needed to create some great VFX. But I did feel a little disconnected at one aspect of the film. It was the scenes between Dan and Lena. That could have been avoided as that did nothing much to the forward the story.Performances: Natalie Portman was great in her role. She especially excelled in the emotional scenes. Jennifer Jason Leigh was great too. And so were Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson and Tuva Novotny. Oscar Isaac acted with great ease with what was given to him. This film is all about the women and I can say that this was quite a riveting women-centric film in recent times.Favorite Scene: No spoilers, but it would be a scene in the lighthouse with Natalie Portman and another character. The struggle, the VFX and the acting was what took my breath away in this particular scene.Verdict: Alex Garland is one of the best sci-fi directors out there and with this film he has certified that. Great performances and visuals make this film a treat to watch.I am going with a 9/10.",Annihilation

I thought the line ""So it is alien"" near the end was one of the worst film lines ever. Yes, it's alien, imagine that, it could so easily have been from the far aisles of Tesco Metro (sarcasm alert).I was engaged throughout, I thought the main spousal characters were enigmatic and intriguing. The progression of the story made sense within its own set up and still provided surprises. There was horror and paranoia along with camaraderie and self-development. The monsters were monstrous wth a twist. The science was comprehensible and plausible. There was, in my view, poetic imagery which was pleasing to the eye.All in all a very good sci fi / fantasy watch.",Annihilation

The analogy to cancer is the only thing that it brings, and that to an extent, but is otherwise totally derivative of much superior classics like The Thing, or Aliens etc. Even the reviews are skewed because of the hype. This thing failed at the box office for a reason. It is neither intelligent, nor innovative, it is far from anything original even its pretensions are stale. This is not going to be a cult classic, there is much more outstanding sci fi out there, this is Hollywood rub ish at its worst. Not worth your time.It is also offensive how it uses science buzzwords, like HOX genes or refraction. Few sci fi movies insult intelligence of the viewers to such an extent, but it is just another proof of failure of its lazy, unimaginative, industrial production like aftertaste or rather, distaste, that is best, and thankfully easily, forgotten.

241,hoernkeem,"Annihilation (2018, Alex Garland) Bizarre adaptation of a bizarre novel",3,11 February 2021,"Annihilation (2018, Alex Garland)
Garland generated a lot of praise around his under the radar, highly regarded directorial debut, 2014's 'Ex Machina'. Based on that effort there was a lot of buzz regarding his sophomore effort which is an adaptation of a science fiction novel by Jeff Vandermeer. The trailer initially looked creepy and promising, and then I read the book. I really try to give film writers and directors some latitude with adaptions and this was one that would require some leeway as the book is very cerebral and long on meditation and short on action or answers. The film abandons all but the slimmest fragments of the overall story or perhaps the better way to say it is just the broadest concepts of the story which involve a boundary appearing somewhere near the coast and those who would determine what it is, what it means, etc. At this point I will abandon book comparisons as that is just a huge wormhole. The only other point I will make is that I was not a huge fan of the book but I at least could feel the author had a vision and he executed that vision. Here I don't think Garland was able to maintain a clear vision or ultimately, if this was his vision, it just wasn't that good. In the film Natalie Portman plays a biologist named Lena who's husband is a military man played by Oscar Isaac. He goes on a top secret mission and vanishes for a year and then just reappears at home. Shortly after returning he falls ill and a shady government agency takes possession of him and his grief stricken wife. Lena meets Dr. Ventress who seems to run the agency and is played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. Here Lena discovers the existence of a mysterious boundary that in the film they refer to as ""the shimmer"" which seems like a dumb name to me but whatever. It is revealed that Lena's husband was on an expedition into the area and all word was lost. Lena joins an expedition of five other women to enter the area looking for answers to The Shimmer's nature. Lena is looking for something to save her husband. Once inside the area things don't quite go as planned although the entire project seems unfocused and poorly explained. They throw elements of a monster movie in although those are silly scenes just to provide some action in what would otherwise be a movie devoid of pretty much any action. The characters bat around theories regarding the nature of the area that went by me or over me. They descend into a sort of madness as they march toward their ultimate destination. The last part of the movie turns into more of that cerebral meditation as the author tries to capture some grand message and put it in a '2001: A Space Odyssey' type package. The problem is that all the set up and narrative is so sub par that by the time you get to the end you aren't really invested in any of the revealed information and instead you just raise an eyebrow and are kind of like ""I don't get it."" Not only ""I don't get it"" but ""I don't really care to get it"" and that includes a twist that isn't a surprise. The director seemed to want to capture something here and I guess I applaud the attempt but from Garland I would have expected something much more coherent.

242,elenaphysics,What a horrible and boring movie,1,23 August 2018,"I had high expectations from this movie. 
But it was horrible.
So boring, so silly. The actors seemed bored too. There was no emotion in this movie. I had a difficulty watching it because it was so idiotic. 
For example, they go to this place to get answers , they walk into the terittory, things don't go well. They can not even remember the first days they were there but they do not even try to get the hell out of there. The go to that deserted base, they see the people dead from something like a fungus and they do not even attempt to go to other places. The characters are boring as hell. They die and you don't even care about that because you can not feel empathy or sympathy for them. The idea of it could be interesting but it was not well executed. It is like watching a sad documentary. At the end of the movie you do not get answers. If the alien entity ceased to exist just because it fullfilled its purpose by just taking over 2 humans, why didn't it do that earlier? For 3 years it was there. It could take over some scientists who went there, then disappear and let them go out of that place. It makes no logic staying there and killing all its potential carriers. Anyway, nothing made sense. The movie was boring. The special effects were not good at all. There was not even one moment when I cared of what was going to happen. I do not understand why the movie is rated so high.",Annihilation

That's not to say it was way to difficult but i do find some films difficult to fathom out.Basically the film is centred around an area of land where a meteor has crash landed and something very strange has occurred where a group of Soldiers have been killed and the story opens with Lena (Natalie Portman) at home and her husband returning from that mission and all seems fine, then he's health deteriorates and he is rush to this facility for observation and immediately put into isolation. while they investigate what is wrong Lena volunteers to go in with 4 others to see what is happening around this piece of land and ultimately the lighthouse at the centre of it all. so we have these two events in the film flashbacking to the first and then it splits again into the after she gets finished with her investigation and finally we have flashbacks of her husbands time in there and what actually went on.it is hard to follow but its a great sci-fi film and in the last 30 minutes the parts all stitch together and we are presented with the reasons and all is clear. it really is one them films (for me at least) where i will need to see it again knowing what i know to enjoy it more. i did like this and gave it a 9 because it was a great watch... i am holding back a little on what goes on because it will give things away but it does have a great story and content to enjoy",Annihilation

Annihilation the book is nearly completely about a team of scientists meandering through a nightmare landscape, but the nightmare is in your head, the book is not using cheap effects to create it. The movie puts to much focus on Lena and her husband - just short flashbacks in the book - on shock effects and on putting aliens in a story where they never actually show in the book.So all in all this is rather disappointing for someone familiar with the books.

It came from outer space, it refracts DNA, and the results are underwhelming, especially the special effects. It is worth noting the special effects from 2001: A Space Odyssey are still better, made 50 years ago, all without the aid of computer animations.The acting is straight from the Joey smell-the-fart school, perhaps combined with method acting, because no doubt the Shimmer is filled with refracted farts, one dividing into two, two dividing into four, four dividing into eight, and ultimately filling the world with an entirely new kind of fart.",Annihilation

Falls a bit flat.,4,3 August 2018,"I support producers and writers who try to push the sci-fi envelope into less frequently traveled paths. I think the right directors, writers, and producers could have made this film better than it turned out to be. Unfortunately this group missed the mark.Casting could have been better. Writing and story line were horrible. I tried to stay engaged versus just watch the film go by. It took will power to do so due to the pace and a host of relentless disjointed flashbacks. Also, I get the whole doppelganger vibe. Unfortunately it was portrayed like a Michael Jackson music video. Would have made a cool video but falls short for a film.They had a blank canvas allowing them to paint anything one could imagine. However their imaginations were more focused on shocking the senses versus writing a cohesive, well paced story. The flashbacks with the husband (or boyfriend) character became increasingly annoying because they served no purpose and the film was already disjointed without the added flashbacks.Another aspect that I found disconcerting was people simply wandering off making the story even less coherent. Initially they have the semblance of a team. I was beginning to buy into it. Pretty soon it was every person for themself as they wandered off. So I stopped caring about the ""team"". Just when they almost had me hooked, they blew it with the everyone simply do your own thing regardless of this potential end-of-the-world stuff we have been entrusted to look into. Also, some of the nuance scenes in this film seemed forced and in your face as in ""Hey! See this nuance!""There are a couple of decent shock-and-awe scenes.

There are more questions than answers and while there is a satisfying ending (with no sequel fishing, thank the Lord), the movie is designed to leave you wondering. I loved Garland's first effort, 'Ex Machina', and 'Annihilation' shows that film was no fluke. There's an underlying sadness to this movie. And I don't mind saying I didn't understand all of it, because we are not meant to understand it. What happens when you deal with an other world presence that doesn't think like a human? Well, probably human observation and analysis is going to be ineffective. We are left to work it out after the final credits role, which gives the movie resonance. The Shimmer is very surreal and the protagonists walking through it are borderline somnambulists trapped in It's dream. There's some stunning images here and luckily they weren't all spoiled in the trailers. Portman is great as the woman on a mission to find out what happened to her husband. The rest of the cast is top rate. The cinematography is dark and moody in it's interior shots and foggy and dreamlike with the exterior.

It dealt with strong issues concerning artificial intelligence and, even beyond that, it talked about the capacity of human love.

Now Lena and group of female scientists Anya (Gina Rodriguez), Josie (Tessa Thompson), (Cassie Tuva Novotny) led by Dr Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) begin an expedition into the 'Shimmer' to reach the source of the anomaly, the lighthouse.At the center of the film is Natalie Portman, a charismatic scientist a solider who's journey deeper into the 'Shimmer' draws us deeper into her mind. Carrying a determined personal mission to understand what has happened to her husband, Lena is a looking glass into the mysteries that the Shimmer contains. Opposite her is Jennifer Jason Leigh a puzzle herself with her own unknown reasons for the mission but whose screen presence is somehow misused.But what illuminates and grips us into this journey is the stunning visuals splashing blends of colour and shapes, beautiful but also sinister. Inside the 'Shimmer' we find unimaginable sights nature and life evolving in a extraordinary but disturbing fashion when the team encounter various creatures and plants.Carried through this excursion is also the unsettling growls and wails of Ben Sailsbury and Geoff Barrow's score. Sailsbury and Barrow's sound for my mind took me back to the loud drowning noises of Los Angeles from Blade Runner 2049 (2017) with the atmosphere of Arrival (2016). I wonder whether Denise Villenurce and Alex Garland get along in their common approaches to the science fiction genre. Annihilation does splendidly entertain in this manner as well as being a thought provoking concentration of ideas. The film journey to reach this may seem ambiguous to some and also confusing but fundamentally works in a stable form.With Netflix's rise to power increasing, its a positive to see that they are getting their hands on strong material but still steals the chance to see something that is born to be a cinematic experience, which I feel would have left a stronger impact.",Annihilation
270,tmpsvita,A great journey within an ambitious and intelligent vision,9,14 March 2018,"I love strange films that constantly confirm to me that there are still stories thanks to which cinema can continue to amaze me; while science fiction has always been a genre that I have favored for its ability to push the cinema where other arts can not reach and with time this is only strengthening thanks to the many cutting-edge technologies that are able to make something, that before could only be a dreamed or imagined, almost a reality.
""Annihilation"" from this point of view is one of the best examples; a film that succeeds, thanks to an amazing technical and artistic sector, to make credible ideas born from a mind full of imagination and to make, almost completely, tangible theories and affirmations, ranging from physics to biology, from science to astronomy, probably absurd but cinematographically brilliant.
The result is the creation of a microcosm, the one surrounded by the ""glow"", absolutely fascinating, disturbing and which is very striking for its extremely suggestive aesthetic appearance and for the praiseworthy artistic care of every little detail to be admired in every frame.
Thanks, above all, to the special effects that, despite the reduced budget, amaze the public with extraordinary environments and extremely original creatures, such as the mutated bear that produces the cries of one of the victims that is really something incredibly disturbing and brilliant at the same time, even if its realization, unlike everything else, suffers a bit from the aforementioned relatively low budget.
Unfortunately, the typology of narrative approach prevents a total involvement from the viewer, although this approach has its positive aspects, for example it facilitates the immersion within the science-fiction context that presents numerous quite complex aspects, but they lack a little 'feelings , for this reason I would have preferred that the story be told in a more ""classical"" way so that it could excite and, in fact, involve more.
At a first glance I do not even think I have understood everything that is said and that is shown but I also believe that the meaning of the film is contained in each of us, like for each film, also because the reading plans are very many, and I do not even know if I will be excited and involved more or less at a second time; but for now I am satisfied with what I have tried looking at it to describe it as a real experience, a journey within an ambitious and intelligent vision that gives the public a series of incredible images, with beautiful colors and lights taken care of by the excellent cinematography, which they won't forget so easily even in a few years.",Annihilation

In terms or atmoshpere, tone and the subject matter Annihilation is the kind of movie that is rarely released as studios now generally prefer to play safe with dumbed down Popcorn Sci Fi. Hollywood now typically sticks in some action, explosions and a few comic relief gags, tries to appeal to a broad base of viewers and release yet another crummy cookie cutter 'sci fi' movie.I don't mind slow, moody movies especially if they make you think outside of the box and make you uncomfortable. Annihilation definitely fits that bill.Where everything comes apart at the seams is the continuous stupidity shown by nearly all the major characters. It's difficult to really get into a movie when you're exclaiming ""why on earth are they doing that?"" for the 50th time the first of which being why on earth were the most unhinged people posible being chosen to confront one of the biggest threats the planet has ever faced?Others have listed the string of stupidities in Annihilation so I won't list them yet again..

278,ccamp89,"A mixed bag bolstered by a fantastic finale, striking visuals, and challenging themes",7,2 March 2018,"Annihilation is another solid entry in the dark, cerebral sci-fi genre for director Alex Garland, though compared to his debut (Ex Machina) it is decidedly less consistent. The film's somber atmosphere and otherworldly visuals are its major strengths. There are some truly striking and memorable images in this film that manage to be alien, haunting, and disarmingly beautiful, often all at the same time. The final act of the film is certainly its centerpiece and is where its most powerful and piercing images reside. These final 20 minutes are where the film reaches its full potential, offering up a nearly wordless denouement that is hypnotic, visually spectacular, and unsettlingly bizarre. It's certainly worth seeing just for this sequence.What comes before the finale is more of a mixed bag. I get the sense that the core goal for this film was to capture that warped, uncanny quality of like-minded classic sci-fi films like Tarkovsky's Stalker while exploring the nature of identity and other philosophical and psychological themes. It is at its best in its most uncompromising and avant-garde moments that dive head-first into achieving that goal. However, there are a considerable number of sequences in the film that feel more traditional and comparatively uninspired, more along the lines of what you would see in a less heady and ambitious sci-fi thriller. Given that Garland was picked up by a major studio (Paramount) for this release based on the success of Ex Machina, which was a much smaller and more independent production, I have to wonder if these were concessions made to the studio to make the film more accessible to a wide audience.On further investigation, there is some evidence to support this idea as Paramount reportedly nearly forced Garland to significantly alter the finale due to poor test screenings, fearing the film was ""too intellectual"" and would not play well to a wide audience. Ultimately, Garland fought and won the battle to keep the film unaltered, though the result was that Paramount backed out on giving it an international theatrical release, shifting the rights to Netflix instead for regions outside of the U.S., Canada, and China. This kind of pressure from major studios is so often what suffocates the artistic integrity of directors and, although Garland succeeded in keeping the film unaltered for a hefty price, it's possible that this pressure influenced the film and contributed to the clash between the more uncompromising elements and the somewhat mundane, typical thriller sequences.Still, the film at large succeeds as a worthy addition to the genre even if it doesn't quite reach the artistry of a film like Under the Skin (a much more uncompromising modern sci-fi classic that I highly recommend if you enjoyed this). Although I didn't love the whole film, I wholeheartedly recommend it to fans of the genre based on the strength of its visuals and its fantastic final act. It certainly further establishes Garland as a talent to watch and I'm excited for his future output, especially if he's able to work with a studio that is willing to trust him with full creative control.Strong 3.5/5",Annihilation
279,jeannefrancoise,Not a mind-blowing enough,6,18 March 2018,"Dear readers, Annihilation is a phenomena movie in my country, Indonesia, because everybody talked about it but just few people review it. I'll review it here. Well, I know Alex Garland with its previous movies, The Beach, Deus Ex Machina, and Never Let Me Go and for me, those movies are amazing. They are showing from other perspective other than the eyes of human being. The effect of all those movies is quite essential for film history, because Garland is brave enough to explore the unknown world and how to make this idea being understood broadly. There are many haters of Garland. I am not a hater, but I criticize this movie Annihilation as the movie of not a mind-blowing enough. We understood about teleportation, mutation, dark essences, etc in Fringe's JJ Abrams, so the main story of this movie is not quite original. The alien attack and the changing-mixed DNA between flowers, human, and animal are already discussed by H.G.Wells. So for me the main story in this movie is not original and the plots are not so surprising. The ending is not as expected and there is no mind-blowing or twist plot at all. Natalie Portman is of course doing her best acting to be military scientist, but he can not lead the main story to be loved by religious people. The image of her is now atheist and non-God believer. If there was other cast, maybe the audience will relate that religious figure who is brave enough in this Sci Fi movie. Garland, himself, for me maybe want to change the idea of Alien, that was seen as the threat, but the hero, whose DNA is better for human. Cinematography for this movie is great, but yet, this Sci Fi movie is not a mind-blowing enough for me.",Annihilation

Annihilation is very much in the same vein as Ex Machina, it is a thinking person's artsy sci-fi film (with horror elements). That genre does not appeal to everyone, but if you like sci-fi like Arrival, Blade Runner, Star Trek, 2001: A Space Odyssey, THX 1138 or, of course, Ex Machina, you will probably get a kick out of it! I actually don't know how much detail I want to go into about this movie, I went in completely blind and was very pleasantly surprised! It only had a short theatrical run before being dumped on Netflix so I never saw any trailers or any promotional material. I had never even heard of it until recently, so I recommend that you just watch it without knowing anything about it. You'll be glad you did! It's a hidden gem!

286,richarddillomes,"If the movies Arrival and Ex-Machina had a baby, this would be it.",7,22 March 2020,"When Annihilation came out last year on Netflix of all places, it has been on my list to go and watch but aside from starring Natalie Portman, there was little buzz around it so I put it under the ""Watch Later"" category. Read that the reason it was released directly to Netflix was due to creative differences between the producer and distributor. Back then direct to Netflix sounded like a death sentence and for this movie it was, only getting a theatrical release in the US, Canada, and China since the director did not want to change the movie because the distributor found it too intellectual and therefore not accessible. The movie bombed and even failed to breakeven but is it a testament to how bad the movie is? Not necessarily.We follow Lea (Portman) who takes over the mission his husband (Isaac) ""survived"" from, unable to give her answers after being gone for a year and suddenly comes back like an empty shell of his former self. Lea along with a team of women, damaged in their own ways, set out to find anything they can from this mysterious glow that started engulfing a certain area in the US. Portman, as expected, delivers while Isaac was shooting this and the Last Jedi back-to-back like literally, he would walk from one studio to the next if he had to shoot scenes for both movies on the same day. Tessa Thompson has been everywhere (Thor, Westworld) but she brings in something new to each character. Gina Rodriguez did okay but I thought Michelle Rodriguez would've been more imposing.So, the final verdict? The distributor wasn't wrong that Annihilation may come off as too intellectual and therefore the audience might distance themselves from it. But the producer and director were also right to keep it the way it was. The movie moved slowly but it was engaging enough that it will keep you wanting to find out what's going on even if you know it will possibly lead to your demise. Which is the theme of the movie really, the propensity of humans for self-destruction. We see it in our eating habits, on how we disregard nature and the propagation of fake news. No matter what we do we are going to die, it's just a question of whether you will run towards it, or have readied yourself to face it when it's your time, or if you will fight it. My only regret is not watching this on a bigger screen. The visuals will have your mouth watering.",Annihilation
287,Amthermandes,A cerebral and visually striking thriller,9,18 March 2018,"In order to enjoy this movie, you must enjoy/appreciate movies that do not explain everything, and that leaves the audience to ponder what the heck they just saw. You must also like sci-fi, thrillers, and have at least a small taste for horror. Those who enjoy this movie possibly also enjoyed (or would enjoy) movies like Gone Girl, 10 Cloverfield Lane, Jurassic Park, Arrival, The Thing, Sphere, Interstellar, Prometheus, and of course, Ex Machina. Annihilation is a film based off a novel by Jeff VanderMeer. It's about a woman searching for answers when her husband mysteriously reappears after going missing during a classified military operation. A biologist, she enters with a small team of women into a world created on our own by what appears to be a fallen meteoroid. This world defies logical biology in quite fascinating, and horrifying ways. So many questions need answering, such as: What is it? What is it doing? What are the effects on the environment? On humans? And while some questions are answered, others appear to be unanswered, or at least, answered cryptically. Admittingly, I myself am still confused about a few plot points of the film, but it's exciting to think about it and discuss with others.It is quite bizarre, and the cinematography is quite stunning and beautiful. Acting is nothing special, nor is it bland. The basic ingredients for an effective and entertaining film are met here, with no major complaints. It's quite different, those worried about predictability shouldn't be worried. It can get intense. Those who say it's ""boring"" must be impossible to please. Personally, I've seen so many horror movies I have thought I was too desensitized to be ""scared"" anymore, but I found myself absentmindedly tearing apart my lower lip in trepidation by the events on screen. Sure it may have some slower parts, but let's be honest, what movie DOESN'T have slow parts? In these scenes, situations are discussed, discoveries are made, mysteries are explained, and tension is prepped. There really are no dull moments, and the movie keeps you wondering throughout. It's a fun, exhilarating film. I imagine most who see it would walk away satisfied, but if you hated every movie above that I compared it to, you should probably skip this one. Which is a shame.

Aside from the eyecandy: Natalie Portman and swedish Tuva Novotny, nothing can save this weird mess. *SPOILERS AHEAD""Lena (Portman) is locked up and questioned by a man in in a contamination suit about what happened inside the shimmer. I get to that later. Flashback to Lena at home crying over her supposedly dead husband. We see flashbacks to them having sex. The husband shows up, but he acts weird and out of character. Later he gets sick. On the way to the hospital the ambulance is attacked by masked men who take Lena and her husband with them. Lena wakes up in a prisoncell inside some mysterious governement facility. Her husband is dying. And she goes with some other women into ""the shimmer"". Some portal to another world, much like the portal in ""Stranger Things. Some of the women have been in the facility for months or years. They are being held their against their will. Or so it seems. And theyre fine with that. Theyre not asking questions, theyre not trying to escape.. They just accept being captives there. And they accept going into the Shimmer, knowing all former expeditions have dissapeared. And later as it turtns out, they have all been killed. This makes no sense what so ever. In the shimmer all the women lose track of time and have collective amnesia. They find weird animals and bushes that looks like they were once human. One of the women is killed by a weird animal. The women start to turn on eachother. More of them are killed. During all this we see Lena in flashbacks. cheating on her husband with some black guy. Who he is and why she cheats on her husband is never explained. Evventually Lena gets to some lighthouse, that is the goal of the expedition. She finds a videocamera where she sees her husband killing himself with a grenade. Then a clone of him appears in the video. Inside the lighthouse is a tunnel to a cave. Inside the cave she finds the womant hat had her and her husband abducted to the facility. a. Some weird crap happens. And a humanoid creature apppears out of nowhere. It follows her out of the cave. And it start to change its appearance and it clones Lena. Lena makes it hold a grenade that kills it (I think) At that point the movie is beyond grotesque. Lena escapes and somehow makes it back. Atthe end she is reunited with her husband. We see them hug and we see Lena's eyes are not human eyes. Wether its the creature or her being turned into an alien by the creature is never explained.This movie is goddamn bullcrap!!

291,urthpainter,Science Fantasy Blender,6,10 April 2018,"I would never say this is a bad movie. There is a ton of merit including solid production, good acting... interesting? Sure.I haven't read the book, so I can't speak to the interpretation of the film makers - however, one aspect of this film really is a red flag. The monster. This is Gene Wolfe's Alzabo from his seminal 'Book of the New Sun'. Not just what the monster is, but also how it behaves, and the dialog about it's behavior. It's a strait up lift. Except Gene Wolfe's monster, scenario and outcome is better in every single way. The monster does provide one of the best scenes in the movie - a very graphic attack upon the main characters.If one has read the Light trilogy by M John Harrison? There's the shimmer - except more defined, interesting and entertaining.Blindsight by Peter Watts? This book is 2/3's a discussion on trying to investigate and understand something truly alien, either an entity, their realm and how this is interpreted by our limited minds and senses. A lot of the ideas in Blindsight are also in Stanislaw Lem's Solaris & knowing Gene Wolfe through his work and research? He likely visualized his alzabo monster beginning with some mythological beast from classic literature. What I'm saying is everyone draws content from somewhere, but as an artist? Gotta make it your own, take ownership and avoid an obvious theft of material.All three of these books are way more interesting and deep than this movie, which is common (almost to the point of being a rule). Not to mention the source material may well be completely different and better as well.To drop my cynicism, if this movie is genuinely enjoyed? I strongly recommend reading some of the above science fiction/science fantasy.But to get back to my film critique, the last kick to the groin would be the films 'Usual Suspect' ending that throws the entire movie into doubt. Clearly we, the viewers are supposed to believe the main character is in fact a duplicate, like her romantic interest - which could only be true if she lied during her debriefing. The movie is a visualization of her debriefing. So what really is the truth? I'm not a fan of this loose, foggy take on content.I believe there are some questions regarding how gender is handled in this film, but I'm not going down that rabbit hole... well maybe a little ways. The end of the film hints at the event making a change. Clearly the destination in the film, the lighthouse, is a womb metaphor, from which a new version of humanity, one man, one woman, emerge. I do wish the film would have gotten more into how peoples thoughts were altered by the alien environment, and the importance of conscious thought in resolving the situation. This content is implied at best - absent at worst.One could certainly argue that all the unanswered questions fit - that the event feeds into the mystery, feeds into the conclusion. I just think there is a better approach to convey these ideas. M John Harrison, Peter Watts might agree.well made (mysterious) movie with copy and paste ideas, 6/10",Annihilation

I guess they do not matter? all lives matter and this movie does the classic only the white girl matters and saves the day. sad how certain cultures down grade others and does not try to level them equally. on another note What is the deal sending 5 scientist without ELON MUSK'S mars suit? Trust me if there was anything like this on earth today Elon Musk would have donated all 5 suits for those women! nope lets send them in unprotected. heart breaking.",Annihilation
299,pcrprimer,Beautiful movie that lacks an effective ending,6,10 September 2018,"As a fan of Alex garland's past work like ex machina, I was immediately interested in this movie upon hearing that he was involved. Natalie portman portrays the role of a professor who is trying to cope with a recent tragedy well, and the rest of the supporting cast also does a good job in their roles. With recent movies like Ghostbusters trying to go with all female main cast members and not achieving success, this movie shows that it can be done. I had not even noticed it was an all female cast until somebody else pointed it out to me after having already watched the movie. I think that's a sign of good casting and the actors are perfectly chosen for their roles. The shimmer is truly beautiful as creates a vibrant world. I wish more time could have been given to exploring the worldand characters. The movie also has some very creepy scenes and a haunting score that reminds me of under the skin. Ultimately the ending of the movie is the main issue. I understand that it was meant to be open to interpretation, but this wound up being very confusing and seemed to be more of a demonstration of cool visuals rather than actually bringing closure to the story.",Annihilation

The strongest aspect has to be the interesting and disturbing story that is a bit slow (that doesn't mean it's a bad thing), but the pacing does get better in the middle and it's great from there to the end credits. Unfortunately the movie does suffer from weak and wooden acting, fake CGI and bland screenplay. Natalie Portman's character is the only one that i cared about, while the others are very uninteresting, even when they start dying one by one you don't feel nothing for them. The cinematography was great in many areas, but there are also weak or very standard shots, most of the music is fantastic and the sound is amazing. The things that the movie succeeds in is where the direction is great, but other than that it could have been better. I will definitely see it again in the future.",Annihilation

You know the story already, if you don't watch the trailer, and even the trailer doesn't even scratch the surface of the mind being descent into the unknown. I found the pacing and structures of the film to be well made, as well as the direction, the soundtrack only enhanced the unique visuals ans scenes of intensity. While the story seems vague and predictable, but the film takes a hard right turn, blowing your mind. I can't tell you how much I wanted to clap at the final twist.I have a feeling many people won't fully understand, as the film is highly sophisticated when it comes to scientific explanations about whats supposedly going on. You will have so many question while you watch the film. Te only real things a disliked was the opening and some of the sub-plots. I found the opening an odd choice by the director and expended different, and there were several sub-plots I found to be unnecessary.

305,shivamt25,"Beautiful, unique and captivating",8,23 March 2018,"Annihilation is a movie about a team which goes into the Shimmer - this eerie place which suddenly appeared on earth one day and is now spreading its range. The team's objective is to find out what is happening inside which is making the previous teams to never return. The task seems simple enough but its not though. The movie is directed by Alex Garland from the fame Ex Machina. With only two credits to his name, Alex has achieved wonders. Annihilation is as beautiful as it is engaging. The movie has the precise amount of obscurity which is essential for it to stick to audience's mind and persist for a long time after watching it. I was really disappointed when they decided to halt the worldwide release and make it available on Netflix, because the visuals are amazing. Natalie Portman was astonishing as a soldier scientist who goes into the shimmer out of curiosity to know what happened to her husband, the sole survivor who does not seem himself since he returned. Apart from her, I really liked Jennifer Jason Leigh's character portrayal.
Annihilation is like Arrival (2016 movie by Denis Villeneuve) in so many manners. It is not quite an alien invasion flick. For most part, you don't know a lot of things but you're so enthralled by the movie that you will most definitely stick till the end to clear all your uncertainty, even come back to some of the scenes to gain clarity.

Nothing more.The story is indeed ""heady"" and if like to be challenged in any kind of cinema, this one will leave you thinking, and frankly, that's what we need more of; balanced film making.Brings forth a nu-weird-fiction story line to fruition with and succeeds where other visionary directors go to their safety nets and the wheels come off, Garland takes the reigns and makes this film special. It's HIS film, not some studio fluff, much like his minimal approach to his previous film Ex Machina, it feels real. His ""world"" here in Annihilation feels real, personally I was captivated from it's first introduction, swept into a unique otherworldy experience paired with amazing sound and score. The film turned me into a mouth breather not once, but at least three times. This is the wave of what I hope to see more of...directors with vision that remain true to their work and leave a stamp of integrity on important genre cinema. Garland has done that here.

308,Beachbum2018,"Interesting, great potential, but a bit slow",7,22 March 2020,"Wasn't sure what to expect when I started watching it after reading some reviews but I was pleasantly surprised and annoyed at the same time.
Surprised because this is the first sci-fi I've seen in a while that's got something original to say, reference to ""the alien"", and some really unique CGI, the last was Arrival!
But both suffer from the same slow pace and annoying subplots about the main characters's personal life. In this movie the sex scenes were totally unnecessary and add -20 to the rating..... when will producer's ever learn good believable sci-fi has absolutely nothing to do with human drama, nothing ever, ziltch, nada, zip, naff all, zero! It always feels like its a concession to some backer who insists there has to be something to appeal to everyone else it may annoy the audience.... well that's a human determination, not an alien one..... and it starts to confuse the plot and btw annoys the viewer.
If this was really about an alien invasion what the character did before is totally irrelevant. In this case I accept the husband is needed to make basic structure for the ending, but there's other ways to achieve this surely.
Next, we're back to to the stereotypical oafish military characters, in this case it's the obnoxious, loud mouthed, busty female, low cut top wearing, musclewoman...... who is actually supposed to be a scientist or something right... all very confusing.
Also didn't get why this has to be an all female insertion group, in reality wouldn't those in charge send in a team of both scientists and military guys?
Lots of plot holes, slow pace and poorly defined and confusing characters put it into a death spiral, but excellent graphics and a great concept save this movie and actually make it quite memorable!
Potential to be great, but would need a hell of a lot more thinking and input to achieve that kind of recognition.
On a par with Interstellar (easy) and Arrival (just), better than Prometheus (not difficult), but a long way adrift from Contact or 2001 quality wise!",Annihilation

So why didn't they just drag a hardline into the danger zone?

It is sad that a differing opinion/review still can't be some sort of help, even if you disagree with it.
I have never read one word of a review that has one or two stars, and will continue like most rational people to avoid what is basically a temper tantrum. If you really don't like a movie, that's ok, we all like different things. But if you want to be taken seriously, start with 3 or 4 stars. One or two just look like a childish reaction, like holding your breath, or stomping your feet.

The ideas explored have been covered better by other films and TV series. The plot bumbles around repetitively drawing a picture that the viewer understands the first time, and essentially tells you the ending of the film well before you get there.I got the feeling the film was striving for the intellectual achievement of 2001: A Space Odyssey but scores low with a Spongebob Squarepants.See at your own peril.",Annihilation
313,veinctor,I never thought I would give a movie 1 star!,1,15 June 2018,"Some random internet guy suggested this as a good movie. So I went for it.It starts well. Decent cast, decent mystery, and even the biology lessons in the beginning were pretty accurate. I can buy that a weird energy blanket expands and it's about to consume everything. Sure, soldiers and drones sucked into it never return. Interesting premise.And then the nonsense starts. The military keeps secret that world ending threat (for no good reason) instead of sharing it with the scientific community. 5 women get there without protection suits and masks. The ""blanket"" is just for show, it's immaterial and anyone can get in and out without problems, so telling us that nobody ever returns is a lie. Helicopters could get in without problem and yet, these women have to walk for 8 days to get to the center.The movie trolls you with irrelevant flashbacks just after chapter titles invade your screen. Instead of the women going back to report what they found, they just keep going further. There are many ways to solve the radio signals goign out of that blanket. Try wires for example! The whole procedure is very amateurish for a world-end scenario. They dont even leave a trail behind them.It's laughable that they have maps but they dont know where they are going even though there are distinct landmarks, like lakes and houses. They dont even have clocks and calendars, so they need to count their food to know how many days are in there. They know that nature is messed up and yet they touch contaminated water and they never do anything smart. I'm not a smart scientist as them but it took them 8 days to figure out the problem that it was obvious from the first 30 minutes!In the end, they whole story could end withing hours, if anyone with a helicopter could go in there and throw a grenade into a hole. And as silly story have it, if you kill the source who caused all evil, then everything wrong returns to normal. Just like that SouthPark episode where they had to kill the original zombi to save everyone else. Only this movie wasnt trying to be satirical.Needless to say, even the title is misleading, since there is no annihilation, just the threat of it. Just like in Geostorm.",Annihilation

As Alex Garland wove this tapestry of genetics, physics, religion, and philosophy, he pulled no punches. No idea was dumbed down to the lowest common denominator. Every shot, including the CGI monsters, was a visual treat.I may be so bold as to proclaim this amongst the best movies ever written. There are no more than a couple of excusable logic holes.

I personally found it to be horrifying. The concepts are really freaky, creepy and earth shattering. If you're someone who only likes to turn their brain off and let a film literally spell out everything for you and explain every little detail of the science behind the fiction then you're not going to like this movie. You must go into this ready to make your own conclusions, which makes it very Lovecraftian.If you don't know what I'm talking about when I say Lovecraftian, skip it. Or at least read some HP Lovecraft, and if you like it, then check out this movie. We're talking about the fear of the unknown here and you're going to half to draw your own conclusions. I found the entire movie to be a giant metaphor for the senseless purpose of cancer... but hey, that's just me. It's a tripped out movie.I want to mention that two scenes in this film really just scared the crap out of me. The scene with the ""bear"" is brutal, so strange and so friggin' awesome. What a great scene, and what a strange monster. Brilliant.The ending also really freaked me out. Wow. What an awesome ending. The music score here REALLY shines. What's funny is often people think that the score here is actually the sound fx of the ""being"" but it's not, it's just super tripped out electronic strange music and it fits the scene perfectly. It's so rad, weird and scary. If you aren't ""getting it"" though, it will all seem very silly to you. I found it so scary and weird, but then my ""simpler"" friends found it to be just a silly skinny lady wrapped in tin foil doing interpretive dance... which I admit, looking at it that way is pretty silly and funny. But I also believe if you truly understand the trip this story is taking you on, it's quite horrifying and beautiful at the same time. I loved it.So basically, don't expect everything to be spelled out for you. This is a slow paced movie made to put you in a hypnotic state and get you to think about horrifying concepts you've never really considered. Seeing all the hateful and stupid reviews on here for this one just reminds me how lazy people are when it comes to watching movies. I mean, I love a great movie that lets me turn my brain off too, but sometimes I wanna use my brain. Annihilation really flipped the switch for me and left me turned on. It's a sick movie.

317,StregaAsuka,Annihilation without Ripley,7,29 March 2018,"This director left us with a wonderful feeling after watching his previous masterpiece ""Ex-Machina"". This is his next work and although it stays short regarding its predecessor, it doesn't leave you indifferent, but it leaves you pondering after you finish watching it.The story takes you to a biologist whose husband went into a mission and after one year missing he returns to her but he doesn't look quite the same. He left on a mission inside an area surrounded by a mysterious light and from where no one except him has ever returned. Therefore, she among other scientists embark on a journey to discover what the mystery is inside the area. This sound like the typical science fiction meets horror movie, and I couldn't help myself but be reminded of Alien. I know, it's not the same, but the concept about horror in space but more like the Prometheus movie is present thru the whole movie.The movie is based on a book and one gets the feeling of it, but also one gets the feeling that there are some changes, although you haven't read said novel. The movie goes slow, and at some points you start wondering what is about, but the more you keep watching, the pieces start to fall into place. The mystery starts to unfold and although at some point the surprise factor is given away beforehand, you still want to keep watching it.In this movie what gets our eyes are definitely the visual effects. They are simply beautiful and the music helps enjoy them more making you feel a peace with yourself but still feeling on edge of what may happen. It's true that there are some aspects of the movie that make you think: why are they doing this? This is not how this should be made? WTF?

Slow paced but never boring with lush photography and solid performances. It will probably appeal to fans of films with a dark and ominous atmosphere and beautiful visuals with mild elements of horror. But if you expect a full on action packed sci-fi than this is probably not for you. There have been some complaints that it does not make much sense. It is true that a lot is left open but the film was obviously deliberately made that way. It actually makes you think about what you have just seen and you have to make sense of it.

I have to add that both those movies were classics and frankly I see no reason that this shouldn't be.
Contrary to some reviews I believe that the acting was great, Natalie Portman does what she does best, convinces me she is really there (isn't that what they are supposed to do?). I agree that some of the supporting actors leave a tad to be desired but not bad acting, just not as good as Ms Portman's.
The special effects are okay, nothing to write home about, and the 'sets' are sort of believable, the set special effects crews did a pretty good job, ironically often similar to other sci-fi movies (you'll see what I mean when you watch it). The final scenes special effects are great.. then not so great, maybe the budget ran out or the cgi guys were bored! but that didn't ruin the movie, it just meant that the actors had to be better at those times.
Would have been 10/10 but for the flashbacks. Some were tedious, some pointless and often confusing. It is as if the producers insist on something a little edgy and frankly they may get the rating up from a 12 to an 18, but why? Am I the only one that feels that way?

326,realityinmind,This movie annihilates logic,6,26 June 2018,"So many extremist reviews..... either its the best movie ever made and gets 10 stars (with no explanation other than ""this gave me a religious experience!"") or its the worst movie ever made and gets 1 star. Cmon, this movie is not a 10 star movie or a 1 star movie. It realistically gets a 5 or 6. First of all, the plot is devoid of any logic. Hardcore military personnel couldn't find out what is wrong, so they decide to send in 4 girls with little to no military experience in order to see what is going on? Why not just send the 4 girls WITH the military? Then after they collected enough scientific data to at least explain what happened to the other teams, instead of turning back and delivering that data so that future teams can be properly planned, the girls just keep going forward with no rationality. Why? Because these 4 girls needed to succeed in some manner, or at least show that they had gotten further than the previous male teams, so that the essence of female empowerment could be conveyed with this movie. Unfortunately that essence does not make the story any better, and it actually makes the story worse.Second, there is useless dialogue. When a big scary monster is breathing down your neck and everyone is sitting there still and not saying a word, why does someone need to say aloud ""don't make any movements and be quiet""...? And then the monster doesn't attack THAT person? Cmon. Smh.Third, there are ridiculously unnatural poses in this movie. When you see the flowers/plants that basically engulf the people you will always see them standing in an unnatural walking position, with all of the figures seemingly walking in different directions. This is ridiculous... if you are about to die from being engulfed by a plant, you would not start walking into the middle of nowhere and continue walking until you are engulfed..... you would sit, rest, lay down, relax, you would do SOMETHING other than walk. And all the plants look the same except different colors, yet the people who have been engulfed that are central to the plot... those people look ridiculously CGI-ed out. Budget shortfall?This, and tons of other illogical things, reduces the greatness of this movie. The CGI is PERFECT, and most likely that is the only reason people give this movie such a high rating. That, and the desire to falsely raise the rating of the movie on IMDB simply because it is all about female empowerment. But eventually the scores will even out and people will see that this movie is no Arrival. It is no Prometheus. It is a non-comical Ghostbusters remake (kinda like the last one that was just released).",Annihilation

331,wolfghostninja,Resist the cool trailer.,5,14 March 2018,"This is a unique film, I mean that in two particular senses. Firstly, the film introduces some unique and very beautiful artwork. The colours and special effects set the design language apart, especially in regards to the sci-fi genre. Secondly, the film occupies a unique position in the history of cinema, but only because of its unusual journey to the screen. Originally a studio production, it was sold to Netflix, which indicates that the studio execs had no confidence in it making money from the box office. In hindsight, their decision to cut loose is justified - but that is not to alter the fundamentally speculative nature of film production.Studio executives do not have some sage ability to produce hit after hit - that is left to the zeitgeist of the time. No one knows what make a film a hit before it is made, or even before it is granted a release to the public. So, we must seek to judge films on their own merit, on the artistic vision that cinema reveals.Alex Garland is a notable talent, with a penchant for writing intellectually driven films that still appeal to the lowest common denominator. Garland directs, the first time he has been given the opportunity to direct with a sizable budget with big stars to helm the production.There's some interesting set design, but really that's about it. The protagonist and the central characters are all women, and while there's nothing inherently wrong with that, it stimulates disbelief from the outset. Why would untrained women be given assault rifles and sent into a new phenomenon to explore it? They are not suited to the job at hand, so naturally they all die. Good sci-fi asks us to suspend disbelief - but not to the same extent as the genre of fantasy.This inability to keep the audience convinced that what they are watching is plausible or possible helps paper over plot holes. When Portman's companions betray her for not revealing the fact she was married or that her husband didn't know he was a predecessor in the ""shimmer"" or they weren't told etc, the reasoning for characters motivations becomes unclear.The movie pretends to have a philosophical basis but it is weak or poorly articulated. Halfway in there are some pretty visuals, but meagre story development. Ultimately this film is a half-baked Arrival knock-off. Its a modern day B-movie at best, and a certainty to sweep the Razzies at worst.",Annihilation
332,lord-blade,Utter nonsensical garbage.,1,11 October 2018,"Here's a group of somewhat talented actresses, being given a ridiculously bad script in a movie that makes no sense. They attempted for some sort of sci-fi, horror, drama... thing... and just ended up with a tedious mess of nonsensical scenes that barely quality as a movie.SPOILERS BELOW:
So, in most movies, you can accept a few flaws. There will usually be a bad choice or two, or maybe some good on the writers' part. But this movie was entirely made up of those.You have some mysterious zone that they send drones and animals into, and can't get any signals back. So they send teams in, which never return. While the military as a whole isn't exactly ""brilliant"" they wouldn't just keep sending groups of soldiers in on suicide missions. If one team went in and didn't come back, they MIGHT send a second, far better equipped team in... but when that team didn't return they would stop throwing people at it. The military doesn't just shove endless lines of troops into an unknown.And then when we have the main characters' team going in, to a zone that only one person came out of, that person clearly suffering from some unknown virus or radiation poisoning, you'd figure naturally the new team would be in full hazmat head to toe. But nope, they just send them with basic army cammo, because that will keep them safe.Not to mention that they would never send a team of scientists in without a heavy military escort. The scientists rate far higher than grunts that get sent in to guard them. But no, they let them wander in alone.Then you have situations like the giant croc attack. Which somehow grabs the backpack of a woman standing in front of a door, with nobody seeing it of course, and just teasingly pulls her into a half submerged house, then lets her get up before pulling her back again. A croc, especially one that size, would have had her, and thrashed her to pieces in seconds. Not to mention that after they kill the croc, they all decide to just take rickety boats across the swamp... KNOWING that there are giant crocs in the water?!Of course you also have the fact that these supposed trained scientists are going around picking up samples with their bare hands, even though everything they know to this point tells them the whole place is toxic in some fashion. We have giant fungal/mould colonies growing around, and the brilliant scientists decide that putting their faces right up to them is the best way to proceed.We get to watch a video of the previous group of soldiers cutting one of their own open to show how his organs are shifting around like a ball of snakes. And the trained medic on the team declares that it's just a trick of the light.They spend the night at an abandoned base, sleeping at the top of a tower. Which makes sense. What doesn't make any sense is having the one sentry on guard STANDING ON THE GROUND BELOW! The sentry should be somewhere with a good view and out of harm's way.The list goes on and on. There's some suspension of disbelief in movies, but there's only so much ridiculous stupidity that you can accept. There are countless cheesy made for TV movies with $500 budgets that have done a vastly better job of having an actual plot and some sense to their script. This movie is pathetic, and everyone responsible for the writing and decisions should never be allowed to work in the industry again.",Annihilation

334,pmdawn,One of the best films of 2018 & destined to be a cult classic,9,30 September 2018,"Directed by and ""based on a dream of his about the book"", Alex Garland (who made Ex Machina) brings us something so intensely beautiful, haunting and mesmerizing that it makes one question the sanity of whoever decided to not release it on theaters worldwide. (It's sad that everyone got to see the completely unnecessary PC ""Ghostbusters"" remake with an all-female cast, but this brilliant film had to be Netflix-only. Wow.)Featuring an almost entirely female cast, starring Nicole Portman as Lena, a cellular-biology professor and former soldier and an ensemble piece really, with quality acting from all fronts - including Jennifer Jason Leigh in a great role. It features an alien invasion... but it's probably not how you expect it to play out. Think ""Stalker"". Think ""The Happening"", but a marvellous work of art instead of a waste of your time.More than a few scenes here are particularly tense, bone-chilling and memorable, and the story is ambiguous enough to make you want to see it a second time right away. Every scene looks fantastical, beautiful, out of this world, and both natural and supernatural. However there are some very ugly things that happen, and there's some gruesome ""body horror"" for good measure.I can't really go into the technical details as I'm not an expert, but from the direction, to the screenplay, from the cinematography to the acting this is a perfect, completely solid science-fiction film that also serves as an allegory and metaphor for guilt, grief, disease, self-sabotage and frankly, evolution and life itself - but in the most amazing and natural way possible.The Soundtrack is also very notable and is used incredibly effectively. It's a masterpiece of sorts and compliments the movie perfectly.Science minded people will not be disappointed and neither will most cinephiles who have a preference for movies that are able to both respect and awe their audiences. This is one of those such rare movies which deserves to be seen and appreciated.",Annihilation

""Annihilation"" manages to create a threat to Earth that is both beautiful and intoxicating to watch and yet frightening as hell at the same time, and I loved every moment of it. I'm a huge ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" fan from way back, and ""Annihilation"" managed to hit the same buttons of pleasurable universe-pondering and just plain popcorn-flick big-screen movie theater entertainment joy without being a copy of ""2001."" (This is definitely a film to see on the biggest screen with the best sound system you can find, by the way). I thought the cast here was perfect, the story, tone and pacing perfect, the special effects perfect, and the sheer audacity of the ending section literally mesmerizing (I was attracted and repelled in equal amounts, and couldn't take my eyes off the screen even though at times I wanted to because it was so effectively freaking me out). Likely for sci-fi fans only, and even then it will have those fans arguing its merits--which I think makes it even better!

337,heatsink98,Logic holes sink this boat,3,28 March 2019,"The film centers on exploration into an alien expanse called the Shimmer that has taken over a national park. It's a mix of horror elements, survival, and sci-fi mired in a strange choice to tell the story as flashback from the main character. So, at the beginning of the story we know the main character survives, and now the film is supposed to get by on a why-did-this-happen question. That doesn't work well. The horror elements, however, are reasonably unsettling through the middle of the film. Things go downhill toward the end in a far too drawn out allegory of sorts that finishes up in a ridiculous way out.Logic is a major factor in pushing this film's score way down. The setting is a national park that has been walled up for three years. Nobody notices. The search party (of seemingly semi-stable personalities) decides to go the extreme long way on foot to reach their target for no reason. The Shimmer has strange effects on radios and tech, but somehow video cameras work just fine. Memories and sense of time are affected by the Shimmer, but nobody bothers to write notes or keep a journal. Little bits like this make our fearless heroes seem like airheads lost in the jungle.

So if you're wondering why you haven't heard about this , that's cause the distributors pulled it down from the theaters last week cause it wasn't doing well there. And hence it's on Netflix now. This is a movie I've been looking forward to especially since it's directed by Alex Garland , the guy who gave us ex machina. The movie stars Natalie Portman and oscaar Isaac and it's about a small biome causing changes in nature. And getting closer to what's causing it and why ?. makes this slow movie interesting. This movie had some great acting and screenplay. This movie has a couple of monsters prowling around and has very predictable jump scare moments and some scenes gave off the vibe of a b grade horror movie , they should've worked on that. Depsite being creepy , dark and weird. This movie is nothing less than ex machina and a really good mindbender right beside arrival . In the end it's Natalie Portman in an other weirdo movie right after Black swan with great writing , intense characters and taking one step closer to annihilation.",Annihilation

I loved every aspect of it and it was one of the few movies that really got to me. It was a slow and cerebral sci-fi movie with a fantastic set, amazing performances, and really cool atmosphere.So I was excited to see that Alex Garland was making his second directorial movie.Annihilation is definitely a polarizing movie to most. Like Ex Machina it is a slow, plodding movie, it's meant to be a slow burn kind of sci-fi. The team takes their time moving through the shimmer world trying to figure out what this extraterrestrial thing is. For the most part it works, but there are stretches of it that really lack intrigue.That's where this one really lacks in comparison to Ex Machina. Besides Portman's character, the rest of the team are just throwaway characters that you really just don't care about at all. Each of the three leads in Ex Machina were so well developed that you really did start to care for Eve and wanted Caleb to help her get away from her abusive creator. Though I get not ever character has to be developed as fully as a protagonist, but they need just a little bit for me to care as stuff starts happening to them in the shimmer.The ending is still something awe inspiring and left me staring at the screen in a state of wonder until the credits rolled through and then some. Very few movies make be feel that honestly Ex Machina was probably the last one.It's probably one that I need to see again without my preconceived notions of Ex Machina's greatness. It's just good to see that there are some studios willing to give people like Alex Garland a budget to make something experimental like this. They need to realized that not everyone always wants to see an Avengers type movie, that we do need to see stuff like Ex Machina, Arrival, Blade Runner and this movie too.",Annihilation
349,mharah,ANNIHILATION isn't long enugh.,5,19 March 2018,"At least half of the films I see need cutting. Most film stories can be told in two hours or less; this one can't. I haven't read the novel; I didn't know that it is the first of a trilogy. But it's not just a matter of restoring fifteen minutes of cuts. I'm guessing that the missing material isn't on the cutting room floor; I'm fairly confident that it was never filmed - or even screen-written - in the first place. The science - reference to which is fleeting - is barely exposed. And yet it is at the heart of the mystery of the film. The character development is spotty, leaving it mostly to what they say about themselves; this is almost never complete enough, always unreliable. Lena does divine their truths, or at least enough of it to get by on, but although it seems to satisfy her, it does not satisfy the film. Too many loose ends - or worse, too many surprises. Shock value may be horror film fodder, but this film aspires to greater things which it should have achieved. Too many plot lines are left hanging, and the penultimate sequence is just plain bizarre. (I can't call it disconnected because the unexplained events up to that point are not really connected, either.) No spoilers here, but just exactly where does it come from? Natalie Portman is competent but predictable (in a film that isn't, depending on your expectations). Oscar Isaac seems to have wandered in from some other film (which according to scuttlebutt at the time, he actually did.) Gina Rodriguez seemed to be warding off Jane the Virgin. She only partially succeeded; elements of her TV character kept creeping in. Jennifer Jason Leigh found her character masterfully, but then had very little opportunity to develop it. This did not make her last appearance easy or credible. In short, ANNIHILATION needed to be a limited series on Netflix, Amazon or Hulu.

And even if it's filled with some weird moments like the bear stealing voices and the humans transforming to plants ( the plants growing out from Josie was pretty uncomfortable to watch my body was shivering), it's still a fantastic movie about evolution, human nature and mental health. The Shimmer the film can have many interpretations: extraterrestrial or spiritual but the metaphor that comes over and is more accurate is Cancer which is mentioned at the beginning at college then inside the shimmer plus Ventress suffers from it, and Cass's daughter died of leukaemia. The shimmer Work almost like Cancer as it deconstructs the DNA of cells and mutates them, but rather than destroying, it evolves them causing the deletion of the old identity and the creation of a more sophisticated one, and this is the central theme of the movie in my opinion. As it interrogates the limits of this identity asking until which level of evolution do we stay ourselves? The shimmer creates chaotic life formes in constant change, the opposite of death which is an anomaly as Lena mentioned that would make the shimmer's interference on organisms ""life"". But in reality, the anomaly is our rejection to change and evolution, so the metaphor is a metaphor for human change and the ""destruction for building"" moto. Another message that touched me in this movie is: choose"" fight."" in the face of sorrow and misfortune!

She left the military, but they remained a couple. Kane went on long secret missions and Lena had an affair with her colleague. Kane found out about it, but still loved her. Lena decided to stop the affair. Away from all that, a meteor falls on a lighthouse. A weird event named ""the shimmer"" starts growing from it. Kane is sent on a secret mission to explore it. Lena for 1 year waits for him to come back.
Movie starts: *Kane* comes back home acting weirdly. After a brief conversation he starts bleeding. Lena calls an ambulance and goes inside with him. The ambulance is stopped by a back ops group. They drug her and take them both to a secret facility close to the Shimmer. 
*Kane* seems to be dying. Lena volunteers to go in the shimmer with a group of 4 other scientists to find answers to help Kane. All the scientists have something screwed with their lives, and so they are volunteering, even though they believe they might die.
The shimmer is an area that is growing that people and machines go in, but nothing goes out, except for *Kane*.
They go inside, and all of them lost their memories of the last 3 or 4 days, and as already expected, have no communication with the outside through technology. They start finding plants and animals that have mutated. The closer they get to the lighthouse, the more mutations they find. They find a video card that shows that a person on the last group that entered the shimmer suffered a mutation. They find plants that grew in the shape of people. The physicist says that the shimmer is a prism that reflects back waves, and that's why the genes of the plants have mutated to have the forms of humans (just so you know, that's not how science works in our world, but let's say that that's how it works on this parallel universe where the movie takes place). The biologist (Lena) puts some of her blood on the microscope and sees she is mutating. The psychologist feels that she is mutating as well, and she rushes forward alone with the mission, so that her mind isn't changed by the end of it. The physicist decides to become a plant and goes away and becomes a plant.
Lena is now alone (2 of the others had been killed by mutated creatures before) and goes to the lighthouse finding trees that look like fractals made of glass and human bones along the way.
In the lighthouse she finds a video camera, a hole in the wall and a hole on the floor (where the meteor came through), and the burned body of a man.
She plays the video on the video camera and sees Kane sitting in the position where the burned body would be. Kane is speaking to *Kane*, how his insides are mutating and his mind is changing, and he can't take it, so he burns himself with a phosphorus grenade.
Lena now feels horrified that the body of the burned man was his Kane all along, and that the *Kane* who met her at her house was someone else.
She hears whispers coming from the hole. It's the psychologist, she's at the center of the hole. She says the source is a living thing and is inside her. The source expands and consumes the psychologist, and transforms into a floating blob. Lena gets close to the blob, and a drop of her blood gets into it. This makes the blob copy her shape, making a *Lena*. Lena fights with *Lena*, and so *Lena* fight back. Lena sees tha *Lena* is only mirrorring her, but does not know many things. Lena takes a grenade and hands it to *Lena*, and takes the pin off and gets out of the lighthouse. *Lena* burns, and ends up touching other things and spreads the fire to all of the lighthouse. Out of the lighthouse, Lena sees many other mutations burning too.
Skip to the future. Lena is being debriefed. When the lighthouse burned, *Kane* became healthy again. Lena goes to meet *Kane*. They hug. Both of their sets of eyes change color.
End of movie. 
Discussion: What does all of this mean? 
Basically it's founded on the (erroneous) premise that life started when a meteor came from outside our world (a seed of sorts) and hit us and started spreading life and mutations. So someone asked themselves, what if another of this seeds came to earth? Since the logic is flawed, they wrapped some mysteries and drama around it to make us keep watching it beyond what we should (like they did with the series Lost).",Annihilation

361,keyope,Interesting but a bit of a let down,6,13 March 2018,"Annihilation is a film that kept me interested for most of its run time. I found the first half of the film to be a little slow. It doesn't really get going until Natalie Portman and her crew venture into the shimmer. The first half could easily have been cut down by 20 minutes, but that's a minor gripe.
Once they are in the shimmer there's lots to keep you interested, although there are some daft moments, like when the mutated alligator drags one of the women under water. Portman wades in after her and somehow fights off the giant alligator and gets her friend back without either of them getting a scratch on them.
What keeps the audience interested is the clever plot device where we're told that all the answers are held in a lighthouse in the middle of the shimmer, where everything is coming from. Unfortunately when we do eventually get to the lighthouse the ending is distinctly underwhelming. It felt like the filmmakers were trying to go for a brilliant ambiguous 2001 Kubrick style ending, or even a Close Encounters type ending, so that we'll all think they're dead clever. Other reviewers have pointed out the similarities to the film Arrival. These are valid, except for one thing. Arrival has a brilliant ending. But the ending of this film is pretty ""meh"", hence why I've given it a 6 instead of an 8.Oh, and the lighthouse? Yep, it's on the beach, right next to the sea. So why on earth did they spend a week travelling through dangerous swampland to get to it, when they could have just gone there in a boat??? Or walked along the beach / coastline?There is also a bunch of scenes showing Natalie Portman's character having an affair. There is absolutely no point to these scenes (unless I missed something?). This subplot has no relevance to anything else in the movie. It feels like the resolution of this subplot was edited out in post production.Portman holds the film together, and the other women on the mission give decent performances. Thankfully there are no Mary-Sues in this group either. Each of them has issues and flaws. But because we're shown in the first act that only Portman survives we're cheated out of caring what happens to the others. You know they're going to die so you feel nothing when it happens, which is a shame.The effects and the ideas are mostly very interesting and there is at least some originality here. It's a refreshing change from all the big superhero blockbusters and their formulaic storylines, but feels like a missed opportunity. Overall, it's entertaining and has some good scares and tense moments, but I won't watch it again.",Annihilation
362,imranahmedsg,"Fantasy, mystery with great photography and limited plot!",5,16 April 2018,"I don't normally watch fantasy movies but I took the risk with Annihilation. The story line about a government expedition with hints of biological warfare intrigued me. Initially, the movie held my interest ... or at least for the first ten minutes. Subsequently, I would tune in as and when I found the scenery worth watching or perhaps when it seemed something significant (plot wise) was about to occur. At times, the scenery in the nature park where the movie is set is astounding. The vivid green contrasted with the colorful flowers made the images amazing. However, Annihilation is not a documentary about photography it is a movie with a plot ... theoretically. The movie came across like a suspense - horror - thriller but all that adrenaline was lost when the director moved into pseudo-intellectual artsy stuff. These artsy 'what's the point' quasi-intellectual interludes become more frequent as the movie progressed. They created little interest for me. The movie tried to do much and ended up doing very little. In the end, I was left scratching my head asking myself what I missed. Maybe 'truer' and more experienced science fiction fans will appreciate the movie more than me. For the average viewer, perhaps you'll enjoy some of the computerized nature scenes.",Annihilation

Clearly this movie was inspired by Tarkovsky's masterpiece Stalker.

364,Behnam-A,Perhaps Biology explains the psychology better!,8,16 March 2018,"Annihilation is a movie that needs a little more attention if you want to enjoy it completely. I found it very symbolic which includes some inner (maybe hidden to first look) layers of psychology behind its sci-fi outer shell.Unlike many other metaphoric movies, I think using metaphors was an excellent idea to explain a complex phenomenon like psychological changes of human mind while it faces serious challenges and the overall path of humanity that is heading to final extermination. Using Biology as a tool to explain it is also a very brilliant idea. You can simply pick that up when the psychologist which is also the expedition team's leader clearly gives the hint while she is explaining the difference between suicide and self destruction and then she says perhaps you(the biologist) can explain it better.
This Movie is about people's reaction to challenges, the way they look at themselves and when they face their true nature, the way they try to pull themselves out of the big universal failures of the humanity and the effects that remains even if the power of the will is strong enough to pull them out. I will not go further through details in order to avoid spoiling the story. Go watch it for yourself and enjoy it.
 
The cinematography is very good, green views and beautiful imaginative pictures of alien form plants and environment are interesting especially considering the budget of the movie. In the matter of acting, it is simple because the characters has been written that way so maybe you won't be able to say if a person's performance is good or not. Especially for Natalie Portman, I think her talent is way beyond her character so obviously she plays it the best way and obviously it is meaningless to judge her performance based on it.Finally I can say if you are a person who is interested in complex ideas especially in subjects like psychology, I definitely recommend this movie. If you are only interested in sci-fi aspects and mysterious ideas you will also enjoy it but not as much as movies with big budgets and huge computer works.",Annihilation

368,raja-mishra7,Different and yet a little predictable.,7,20 March 2018,"Without giving any of the suspense or essences of the storyline away, I think the innovative concepts about Alien invasion which are proposed in the movie are outstanding. However, the human angle, the cover story to forward the theme, wasn't completely exploited. Somehow, narrative felt somewhat incomplete, like, the director could have spared another 30 minutes and added something more to the plot to connect all the dots!Natalie Portman was outstanding as always, the supporting characters were predictable, you will find them in all alien movies which was one of the let downs.",Annihilation
369,tlfirth,An Experiment in Science-Fiction,9,12 March 2018,"This is one mind-boggling film. Experimentative in nature and sentimental in emotion, Annihilation is not meant to be a cohesive film, moreover it is an abstract tip-toe into the art of science-fiction. As a sci-fi enthusiast, this incredibly ambitious story is more than my cup of tea. As a physicist, this challenges science by proposing a radical theory about a type of being that refracts everything (even DNA) into something else. I emphasise radical, because this is fiction after all, but with the range of imagination that we have as a species, why shouldn't we reach hypothetically for the impossible.Alex Garland has produced something rather extraordinary in this tale, based on the highly-acclaimed novel by Jeff VanderMeer. Transferring to film has provided the visual aspect that this story needed, and Garland has not held back. In short, the film is beautifully brought to life with barely a shot wasted on colour and detail. Some of the scenery is breathtaking, and the final thirty minutes are something to behold in terms of not just imagery, but sound too. It rivals both Arrival and 2001: A Space Odyssey in terms of labyrinthine storytelling - not that it's complicated, but it will challenge your mindset. There are a number of dark revelations that will stick with you for days after the film.The cast are infallible - Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tessa Thompson are all superb in their roles, helping to build the bizzarely tense plot. Oscar Isaac is a great supporting cast member, effectively playing two contrasting versions of the same person - one that's loving and playful; the other emotionless and eerie. I do hope Portman and Leigh are recognised for awards, they both channel their emotion in different ways.Ultimately though, the medal of success should go to Garland who's direction is the main event of the film. The switching between current and past events helps to show the surreality of the explorers' situations. The clash of beauty and darkness is strikingly clear, especially when it comes to the emaciated bear that stalks them. This was possibly the most tense scene of the film. In conclusion, the amalgamation of experimental storytelling, visual extravaganza, strong performances and fresh direction makes Annihilation the next best sci-fi film to see. Don't understimate it at the beginning, its final moments will give you chills.",Annihilation

373,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,"A true sci-fi masterpiece of chaos, death and self-destruction",9,24 February 2018,"Alex Garland has gone into alien territory with his loose adaptation of the novel Annihilation. With his last film Ex Machina feeling like it was grounded in our reality with how the technology was presented, here Garland transported me as an audience out of the plausible and into a chaotic hybrid of a dream and nightmare.Told through very sketchy interviews by Natalie Portman's Lena, Annihilation starts out in familiar sci-fi event territory (similar to 2016's Arrival) with the reveal of a translucent unearthly wall called the Shimmer. It continues to slowly grow like an infection consuming the land with anything or anyone that enters it never returning. Enter our core group of all-woman scientists who enter the Shimmer to get answers that past expeditions have failed at. Once inside the Shimmer, the story begins shifting more into a post-apocalyptic visual style that blends Apocalypse Now with Alien and The Thing. But by the end you will feel like you experienced a dream that will make question what you saw in the Shimmer.Annihilation itself is the true theme of the story in not just about an alien force threatening our way of life through mutation and ecological destruction. Like Ex Machina in a spiritual way, Garland is really focusing on how human beings harm themselves by their own self-destructive behaviour whether it is suicidal tendencies, paranoia, pride, addiction, guilt or lying to pretend life is just perfect. Following Lena's perspective into the Shimmer, we meet the supporting cast of characters who from the start appear to be perfectly sane people from the cold-hearted psychiatrist Ventris (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the calm and shy physicist Radek (Tessa Thompson), the tough, confident medic Thorensen (Gina Rodriguez) to the kind-hearted Shephard (Tuva Novotuny). But in reality they are broken human beings made from personal loss and their own insecurities. And these faults are displayed by their reactions to the alien threats and the psychological and biological effects the Shimmer has on them. Lena as the protagonist starts as someone you automatically sympathize with but through the course of flashbacks and events you see how her questionable choices in the past may have inflicted too much damage on others within her personal relationship. By the third act, her journey through the Shimmer becomes one less of proving how good she is as a person but more about confronting her own problematic nature.The world within the Shimmer is a place that feels haunting, alien but beautiful thanks to Garland's film crew including production designer Mark Rigby, cinematographer Rob Hardy and a creepy, alien-sounding score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salibury. The way the sunlight reflects from the Shimmer's rainbow surface and the overgrowth of colourful hybrid fungus and plant life makes the Shimmer-affected area feel like you stepped out of Kansas and entered the realm from The Wizard of Oz. And there it is filled with mutated wildlife that ranged from looking fantastical to nightmarish with their death-like appearances. Thanks to some amazing visual and practical effects, the creatures never feel like they are too exaggerated or spectacular. Yet you can't help to but to believe there is a not-of-this-world element in a fearful awe-inspiring way. In the final act, the story, much like the landscape and creatures, evolves or mutates. It becomes a surreal and cerebral visual event that left me in awe and shock with questions. After some time to think I see it perfectly reflects the question surrounding Annihilation of whether death by our own genetic and psychological devices is an end or a new start for something that can be improved.I don't personally agree with Paramount selling the international rights to Netflix, especially with the disappointing Cloverfield Paradox, but I can understand why this isn't a movie for everyone. It can be frustrating depending how you interpret the ending. The movie doesn't give you an explanation of everything as it says we don't generally always have rationale explanations for our own chaotic tendencies. For me I enjoy that kind of approach because this movie felt like true science fiction right down to its cerebral core. If you want the full out-this-world kind of experience that I got with this movie, see it in a theatre, if possible, as soon as you can before you can only watch it only in Netflix on your tv or laptop.",Annihilation
374,cjs6547,Not impressive,2,16 March 2019,"This might have worked as a romantic drama with a bit of adventuring, but the sci-fi and horror are all wrong.A team of some women volunteer to go into the shimmer, a bubble that is spreading around a lighthouse. I say ""some women"" because they have no clear objective, roles, chain of command, discipline, or in most cases, even mental strength to be there. Odd considering the shimmer is under strict military police observation, and they go so far as to hunt down a dying man in an ambulance because he emerged from the shimmer.The characters are not memorable. They have no distinct personalities, just different levels of losing their s***, ranging from fragile mind to mind-already-broken-so-not-going-to-emote. None of them are likeable or have any discernible motivation to be there. They don't talk about their research, seem fascinated in the world around them, or say anything at ALL of interest. I think they say 'I don't know' 50 times in the movie. What an inspiring bunch! One of the women comes up with a theory that doesn't make any sense, and then immediately gives up. At some point they decide they are losing their minds by literally saying they are losing their minds or 'changing' or something. They literally didn't have the direction or ability to ACT it, so they just say it.The movie is shot poorly. 90% of my screen was black during night scenes. This means they only need a fraction of the budget for nighttime monsters and action scenes. I get the feeling they're going to stop shooting night scenes at some point all together and just leave audio on a black screen.The ending looks like someone's project in a special effects class. Most of it does actually. The director was probably enamored with cell division at the time and made a movie with multiple shots of cell division scattered throughout with about 5 minutes worth of research on Google. They say this movie was dumbed down because test audiences didn't like it? What an insult to past and present audiences!",Annihilation
375,dholliday-imdb,promising idea ruined by amateur film-making,3,9 November 2019,"This film had pretty much all my pet peeves in modern movies:the need to insert pointless soap opera relationship drama. Alien and 2001 are the most celebrated sci-fi films because their characters don't have time for relationship issues, this gives the sci-fi more space to develop. Why do so many modern sci-fi films ignore this obvious message?grrrrrl power! aka shoving contemporary social agenda into your movie, regardless how unrealistic (those grrrl scientists wearing machine guns like they're nothing...hilarious).too much fake-looking overly-digital cgi: looked far too clean and cartoony.non-linear story-telling when done well can be interesting, when done poorly as here all we get are spoilers (we're told early on who dies) and bad pacing.cliches galore: the 'they look like us' trope for one.music which doesn't fit: that cheesy acoustic guitar belongs in a wistful chick flick, not a heavy sci-fi. Then again, maybe Annihilation is a wistful chick flick.single-expression acting. Natalie Portman monotone pained expression, even as she's humping someone other than her husband (yes, this is a scene...so deep, maaan!)It's not completely terrible as the core idea had potential so at least the viewer will have exposure to that, and the final moody scene with the doppelgänger, while silly, was at least interesting to watch, despite the too-loud farty brass noises meant to imitate movement (you'll know what i mean when you watch it).

It dabbles in many sub-genres of sci-fi, but does very few of them well.It really is a shame too. This one had the potential to be a true fantasy/sci-fi classic with its strong worldbuilding, fascinating visuals, and attention to style that is usually reserved for genre-titans.Instead, it becomes a slightly-above-mediocre slog with wooden characters and poor pacing.

380,n-m-bertin,Nice little Sci Fi movie,7,23 April 2018,"I was pleasantly surprised with Annihilation. It has some very good ideas, although scientifically quite impossible. It is its own little world, with great characters. It always feels tense, desperate and sad, with a touch of poetry. It is derivative, it takes from Alien, from Jurassic Park, and especially from Arrival. Portman's character is quite close from Amy Adams' character in Arrival. A lonely woman, driven by her work, looking for redemption. I didn't mind the ending, I think it added to the originality of the movie. The special effects of the doubles were not very good though, but the crystal towers and the animals were very well done. I really prefered it to Ex Machina which premise was bad : no one can believe a single scientist can create the perfect android with the perfect AI. No one has all these skills. But here there aren't really any plotholes. Like Blade Runner 2049, some stuff is open to interpretation, which is fine. The director/writer however adapted the book without knowing it was gonna be a trilogy. So he had to guess what the author had in mind, and make up the rest so he had a complete movie. That's why it doesn't feel that coherent all the time, like the intentions of the meteorite for example, or the scientific nature of the shimmer (DNA prism ?) and why I only give it a 7.",Annihilation

382,JamesMovieGuy_117,A modern sci-fi classic,10,17 March 2018,"I can tell this movie isn't going to be for everyone, but as a fan of sci-fi horror I absolutely adored this film. I would even go as far to say it's up there with some of the classics of the genre such as The Thing and Alien. As I was skimming through the IMDB reviews I saw the common complaints of it being too arty or it making no sense. For those people, this is the kind of movie where you need to open your mind. The characters are entering a world where the rules are different and anything can be possible due to cell mutations. Some even complained about the film having five female cast members in the lead roles for no reason. Now I know Hollywood is putting lots of feminism in their pictures these days. I'm one that accuses the new Star Wars movies for having a Mary Sue protagonist. However these five characters are intelligent, smart and yes they all are vulnerable to the hostile environment which makes the movie tension driven and interesting. If John Carpenter's The Thing can have an all male cast, I see no reason why not to have five females in this movie.I like how the film doesn't spoon feed the audience with answers. All the characters have gone through some turmoil whether it be their child dying of cancer or their husband being killed in action. This motivates the women to explore a world to find some greater meaning but in the end they enter a world where things make less sense, where cells randomly mutate to create sometimes beautiful but other times monstrous creations of nature. The film is also incredibly disturbing, especially a scene involving a vicious bear which has to be one of the scariest creatures I've seen in a long time. The ending also goes into surreal territory but ultimately I found it satisfying considering the context of the movie. I see this as a modern sci-fi classic that will be enjoyed by audiences in years to come. It kind of sucks audiences don't appreciate films like this anymore but I'm glad it was made because it reminds me there are still talented filmmakers willing to take risks to create something original.",Annihilation
383,imdb2-5,When the director is to full of art...,5,16 March 2018,"This is an intense gripping film on a number of levels as well as being empty. It balances questions about a relationship and the nature of people on one end and the future of human existence on the other. Unfortunately while it reveals answers to the first, non -Scifi part, the remainder is a muddy mess that is meant to show layers of depth and symbolism. And it comes off as another pretentious attempt to do just that with little explanations and questions of shock and horror that has been done before many times and in different forms.I confess that I hadn't read the book and perhaps the science is better spelled out there. But in the movie version I'm at a loss. Basic logic is completely lost. Simple questions of ""why didn't they just do this instead?"" seem to have evaded everyone in movieland. Perhaps the only question that is answered is that a sequel will be needed to explain what happened and where all of this pointlessness is really going.This is a 5 because the movie is gripping and interesting and beautiful to watch, even if a good part of it doesn't make too much sense and is pseudo-science. While others may wish to watch this one over repeatedly for deeper meanings, my thought it is to save your time. I liked the tale but was left unsatisfied at the end.",Annihilation

Despite some flaws, this is a different and very interesting film whose intrigue ""holds"" from start to finish. It is also a fantastic visual experience, the best we have seen in recent times. The rhythm of the film is perfectly suited to the development of the ""plot"" that it offers us. As for the meaning and interpretation of the film, it is clear that they will vary from person to person. Personally, I think that, despite all the apparent complexity, the interpretation of the film is very simple and the message of the film is very clear. A pessimistic message, as usual with director Alex Garland. Beautiful performances by Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh, as well as by the other three actresses, these characters whose motives are poorly developed, which is a weakness of the film. Oscar Isaac, again in a film by Alex Garland, after the excellent ""ex-machina"", is also very well.

396,kcrateau,Wanted to like it,3,12 September 2020,"I started this movie three times and never could get into it. When I finally saw it through, it turned out to be a typical nonsensical, no plot, slow moving, enigma of a movie with no real explanation and way way to many flashbacks that had nothing to do with the overall plot. I like sci fi and mystery but I say to anyone to save your money and/or two hours of your life. I should've listened to my instincts and not watched this trash.",Annihilation
397,SeriousMayhem,A pretentious movie that really isn't anything more than a second-rate sci-fi horror flick,5,16 March 2018,"The movie starts off slow and while it picks up some speed along the way, it never manages to reach a decent pace.In roughly the first half of the movie we are introduced to our main character and supporting team. With the time it took to cover all of that, you'd expect to get something more than uninteresting stereotypes and simply dull personalities without substance, but that's exactly everything we got. We're also supposed to care about the relationship of our lead character through what felt like a gazillion unnecessary flashbacks. It never worked for me and I found it distracting more than anything else.During the second half of it's runtime, the movie tries to make us wanting to know what's going to happen next, what is the cause of all of it. It manages to succeed in this reasonably well, but it mostly does so by adding more confusion and questions into the mix. This wouldn't be such a big problem, were it not for the unbelievably unsatisfying, although beautifully portrayed scene near the end. Oh, and it has a twist, which isn't really a twist, because it was so blatantly obvious already, not to mention cliché. Such a waste.Visually it looks good. It's rich in it's own way, but not as rich as the trailer may lead you to believe. There's a mad dash of LSD here and there which I personally enjoyed. The world created within the shimmer sprouts a lot of interesting and original ideas. It's too bad that almost none of them are explored beyond the point of that ""something is changing"".The small amount of horror and scary scenes are decent, but overall nothing too special and ultimately serve no true purpose. The exception is one scene, which is pretty unnerving to say the least. This scene sadly also makes it clear there's so much wasted potential in the rest of the movie.Natalie Portman delivers a very good performance. Oscar Isaac is decent and Jennifer Jason Leigh appeared to be half afsleep during most of her screentime. The rest of the cast is subpar at best, but considering what they had to work with, I can hardly fault them for that.I can usually suspend my disbelief very well when I'm entertained, but the amount of silly and illogical choices made by the characters were so plentiful I had a hard time doing so. There's one scene in particular which had me literally shaking my head.All in all, this movie was a letdown with some good parts. Some may like it, some may not. I feel it could have been so much more. 5/10",Annihilation

It's edited in the most confusing way, with information not given to the viewers logically. With writing, none of the characters are given backstories so it's impossible to relate or even care about any of them.I am left with so many questions, one of them being, why does Oscar Isaac have a southern accent in some scenes and not the others??

And what's the deal with that giant rat with no skin on it's face? And then that alien robot at the end. And how about the plants that grew in human forms? How ridiculous is that? The reason was given as the radio waves reflecting or something equally silly. We never find out what it is exactly and it self destructs for no reason.Sorry, but this was too stupid to give any higher rating than I did. It deserves a zero rating for wasting our time and lowering our IQ.I knew it was silly from the first dialog in the classroom where she states that some lone cell roamed the universe for billions of years looking for a home. Or some such nonsense. Are students really taught this in science classes today or is this Hollywood's belief system?The movie is geared for the uninformed and those who were never taught any real science.They throw out scientific terms to explain unreal phenomenon, but it's all gobble de gook.I'm sure many will love it, but to those who know real science it will look like a really bad cartoon.",Annihilation
401,con_au,Yeah! Nah...,4,16 March 2018,"I went into this wanting, trying even, super, super hard to love it. 
An all-female sci-fi movie?
Yeah!
But nah.
I loved the score. Atmospheric and clever, it makes a real contribution. The effects are alright mostly, although some of the environment looks a bit too much like an Instagram celebrity's idea of a gorgeous outdoor country-chic wedding, and the mutant creatures are definitely on the Jim Henson side of spectrum. 
Plot overall is to my liking, but it's realisation is way too nutty to make it sing. The dialogue is dire. The characterisation of some of the key characters is just weird - I'm looking at you Jennifer Jason Leigh. 
Some of the choices made by the lady posse are maddening. Actually, a lot of them are. And a film which requires such suspension of disbelief can't survive under the weight of so many clangers.
You're going to clomp into an alien wasteland with some semi-autos but nary a helmet? You're going to hop into a tinny (a little aluminium row boat) after you've just met your first gigantic gatorshark? You're going to use your NV goggles in a well-lit space but then put them down when you're trying to shoot the bearasaurus rex that just took your crew mate?
The list is literally endless. And these are just the minor details. There are gigantic ones too. Did they not do a blood test on the 'husband' once he makes it into isolation? Did they maybe think to do the same on Lena when she reappears? Has G-earth really not picked up on a several mile squared, and expanding, shimmering, alien habitat during its latest run around the planet? Any attempt at explaining why Lena's been gone 4 months but only experiences a couple of days of time loss? Any reason why the greatest army on the planet didn't try a box of matches as a possible WMD, seeing as in the end a bit of phosphorus did the trick?
I'm totally bummed out. I want to see powerful female leads carrying films in all sorts of genres but this film reduced a group of super brainy women down to their various flaws and frailties (sad mom, a cutter, cancer, a lesbian - and we know for sure she's a lesbian because she keeps wearing a singlet when everyone else is in long johns) and then had them make the sort of choices you'd expect from a group of undergraduates in a slasher film.

Alex Garland takes his fictional ""shimmer"" to a whole new level and showcases some purely science fiction ideas. He also writes intriguing character arcs that evolve around the idea of Annihilation itself. He uses some biological concepts as metaphors for the characters that truly works. The story isn't completely original, sure, but the way it is executed and the steps it takes are so breathtakingly unique and interesting.Performances: Natalie Portman shines as the Star, as she always does. Oscar Isaac showed why he's one of the most underrated actors in show biz with just a few minutes of screen time. The rest of the team was incredible; Jennifer Jason Leigh in particular left an impression. The standout of the shimmer team was Tessa Thompson, who conveys a broken, traumatized, lighthearted woman with such empathy and passion that it's hard to tear yourself away.Other thoughts: the score was subtle, yet awesome. The visual effects were frankly stunning and off the charts. The production design was breathtakingly beautiful and, at times, fittingly eerie... and the artwork displayed was intricate and magnificent.Annihilation is a fittingly unquantifiable piece of Science Fiction.

406,sjalkarjadottir,a total surprise and one of the best things i have watched .. and did not comprehend,10,6 April 2019,"Yes, this is one of those movies that seem very philosophical. Horror is just one tiny aspect of it - hardly a key feature - but as ""supporting actor"".The story is - well, maybe it is the language barrier (i watch movies in English, because they are not being translated to Icelandic most of the time) - and this story is anything but exposed.
The narrative is visual and contextual - narrated in a calm and slow pace. I greatly enjoyed it but have to admit that i only really ""got it"" when i read a synopsis afterwards.Acting is excellent, visuals are stunning and storytelling is flawless.its a 10/10 for me, because i just loved the atmosphere of the movie, its look and feel, the approach to its context and how it would not consider the audience to be idiots but make up their own minds.Now it is debatable if storytelling is good when you kind of ""have to"" read up a synopsis to understand it - but to me, it means that it is a challenge.One more suggestion .. take your time to watch it and think about it.

It kinda muddled through without explaining what or who was responsible for whatever that ""Shimmer"" thing is. They're attacked in the night by a bear type thing which is fine but why was the woman who was standing guard away from the watch tower where the other 3 girls were sleeping? She was standing in some crappy hut in the middle of the field with a light on instead of being 50 feet up a guard tower, she was completely alone and too far away to give a warning.

Basically a fable about 5 disturbed women venturing into an enchanted forest, wow.",Annihilation
410,Kolobos51,Not as smart as it wants you to think.,4,18 March 2018,"Annihilation was meant to be the big mainstream breakthrough for the filmmaking team that made Ex Machina. Instead, it pretty much tanked, with much of the discussion of the movie in the media centering around politics (why an all female cast, why change the race of the lead) and most of the fan discussion online centering on whether the movie was too smart for the mainstream. My reading is this: if you go into this thing expecting something smart, you can see that but really, this is just an incredibly self important sci-fi film that could have worked but just doesn't. Natalie Portman stars as a college professor in a deep state of grieving because her soldier husband (Oscar Isaac) is dead only for him to walk into their home like nothing happened after a year. Only now, he seems deeply shell shocked, won't discuss where he's been, and has a serious illness that gets him and her quarantined at a military base so shadowy even the viewer can't really tell what is going on in there. I know I sure couldn't. Whatever it is, Jennifer Jason Leigh is in charge and she's been closely monitoring an inexplicable phenomenon called the ""Shimmer"" emanating from meteor strike at its center. 
Portman rather easily secures herself a spot on the next expedition into the Shimmer which will be led by Jason Leigh herself. And here is the first logic bump, why keep allowing people just to wander into this thing if no one ever comes out??? Maybe attach tethers to them, try going in with vehicles, something. But whatever. The next bump comes immediately after. There is very little development on the team. VERY LITTLE. I came to identify them as sad smart one (Portman), obsessed leader (Jason Leigh), one with slight accent, timid one, and hot headed one. It's not clear why they were chosen. They certainly don't seem to be preeminent in their fields and show no special levels of skill once inside. Portman was nothing but a college professor, for goodness sake. She did have some military experience but nothing suggests her service was particularly distinguished. They get inside the Shimmer, find that their devices don't work, they lost time, and everything living, plant and animal, is being mutated. We learn this from an early encounter with a gator that has shark teeth and let me say that as pretty as the exteriors are, lush green vegetation lit by a rainbow prism created by the Shimmer, the special effects are not good. That first gator looks only slightly better than the gator from Lake Placid and that was what, 15 years ago now? Later, characters start dying or going crazy despite the fact that we know next to nothing about them. So who cares what happens to them? I spent most of this movie just plain bored. With a seemingly intentional slow pace and no characters to latch onto, there was just nothing that I really cared about happening on screen. Normally I would have clicked off, and honestly I kind of wanted to, but decided to force my way to the end on the basis of reviewers claiming it gets dramatically better as it goes on. Saying it gets better really is just saying that it starts bad and gets marginally better. I wasn't so bored later but I still can't say it was good and to be perfectly honest, there's not much to recommend here. If you want dumb creature fun, watch Deep Blue Sea. It you want heady horror, catch The Void. Hell, if you want a genre film with an all female cast, check out The Descent. Even the acting can't really save this thing because good actors are left such incredibly one note characters. This just feels like a fan fiction retread of Lovecraft's ""The Colour Out of Space"" that thinks it's ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and isn't nearly as good as either.",Annihilation

413,markj-02556,ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN,8,20 March 2018,"A biologist signs up for a dangerous mission, where the laws of nature don't apply.This film is written and directed by Alex Garland (Ex Machina). It stars Natalie Portman (Black Swan), Jennifer Jason Leigh (The Hateful Eight) and Tessa Thompson (Creed).This film is fantastically interesting, it makes me want to watch it again and again till I understand all the elements of the story, I love films like that, for example 2001: A space odyssey (1968). Portman is brilliant as always she is a biologist trying to find out what happened to her husband. Garland shows yet again that he can direct as well as write, actually in my opinion the direction overshadowed the writing, this film is gorgeous to look at. This story is very interesting, the third act especially is mind boggling. Also the special effects were on par with some Hollywood blockbusters and the score by Geoff Barrow (Ex Machina) and Ben Salisbury (Ex Machina). is sumptuous and Hypnotizing.Sadly no film is perfect, the other cast is no where near as good as Portman, especially Oscar Isaac (Ex Machina), who attempts an accent and doesn't pull it off. Finally, the actual words these characters say are quite by the numbers and aren't very interesting, there is no line in particular that stands out to me.Very interesting, If you like films don't give you all the answers and have to make you think.

I found myself longing for the days of a man in a rubber suit when the unconvincing monsters appeared - it's very distracting. Portman is good without being exceptional, Leigh puts in a strangely mannered performance and the two sidekicks are one-dimensional and predictably dispensable.

When I watch a movie, I want the ending served up to me, I do not want to be wondering what I just watched - and more importantly, why I just wasted almost 2 hours of my life on it. Leaving that aside for a moment, I'll try to make sense of it. A woman's husband disappears and then reappears, coughing up blood, he is then quarantined. He's apparently been inside a large spreading dome like structure, called 'the shimmer'. To make sense of it, she and a select band of women decide to enter this alien-like world, where they find strange, cross-species creatures, living in a surreal forest. The band are attempting to find a lighthouse, where the shimmer originated. There, it is discovered that the alien can clone and devour human form. That's about the size of it, without giving anything away. Interesting concept you might think? The concept is the only interesting about this movie. It crawls along at a snail's pace - so slow in-fact, that you drift off into lalaland! Eventually, you lose interest in this bore-fest and by the end, you no longer care what is happening.

And while I struggled to get through the old Russian epic I had no problem with this newer film.Sure, Garland (director of the film) and Vandermeer (writer of the book) do claim that Annihilation wasn't an attempt to remake Stalker or Roadside Picnic, but the similarities are hard to ignore. As is the older H.P. Lovecraft story The Color From Out Of Space (where a meteorlike object creates havoc around the impact crater, deforming and mutating both flora and fauna, as well as emitting an otherworldly color not before seen by man)..It is a fascinating subject for me to explore in these stories. Where alien entities not so much invade as just exist and we are forced to try and find out what makes the uninvited neighbours tick. Even when it may be represented by a skull-faced giant bear that uses human death screams as its hunting lure (guaranteed nightmare fuel there) or as seemingly harmless beautiful floral arrangements.Intersperse that with combinations of Cosmic Horror like in The Thing, and pure old school Cronenbergian BodyHorror the characters end up trusting noone and no thing as both minds and bodies disintegrate throughout the tale.If you didn't pick up on it yet, I friggin love this film. From the expertly handled effects and visuals to the otherworldly musical notes on the soundtrack. If I were to nitpick I kind of feel that the flash forward interview scenes that are intercut from the start was a bit unnecessary.Now, after Dredd, Ex Machina and now Annihilation I can hardly wait to see what Alex Garland decides to tackle next as he is one of the most interesting voices in Movie SciFi right at the moment.",Annihilation

That thing was terrifying. It was nothing but multiple at the same time. Some thing that made me feel uncomfortable just like Giger's Alien. (Giger/Geiger, dunno) Even more because it was kind of in the uncanny valley between human and animal. It looked dead, yet it was alive. Nightmare fuel.

430,Anttell,Out-there,6,5 September 2018,"Alex Garland's debut, Ex-Machina (2014), was an intelligent scifi-piece. The same can be said about Annihilation, though Annihilation has and will be more polarizing among wide audience - I can see many calling it pretentious, even if it possesses many familiar structural details. Earth is under an extraterrestrial threath and a group of scientists/soldiers are sent to investigate. The premise is obviously a familiar one but the film eventually turns into ponderings about life and humanity disguised as a scifi-thriller. The film somewhat reminded me of Denis Villeneuve's Arrival (2016), but Annihilation is more out there with it's intentional and theme appropriate ""weird"" atmosphere that stems from it's characters and audiovisual choices.The film has some nice artwork and all in all, for me, it was a pretty interesting viewing and it can be a retrospective grower for sure due to it's distinct atmosphere and thoughts. Still, at the moment I'm kind of on the fence whether I actually liked it or not - eccentric stuff.Rating: 6/10",Annihilation
431,cliffvose,Dismal,1,15 March 2018,If I was the writer whose book this dismal adaptation is based on I would be in litigation with the movie company. ''Nothing like the book.'' is a much bandied around epithet amongst critics but in this case it deserves it. The inherent racism and sexism embedded in this tale is truly horrifying. The main protaginist is a white professional woman who gets the best lines and the lingering soft porn gaze of the camera that is used in the unnecessary and gratutitous back story shots. If I want titilation I can access pornhub. The deep seated anxiety of contemporary culture is glaring in the imagery of a bear ripping through a chainilink fence (?) silently and then carrying off one of the lesser characters to have its way with her in the woods!?This film was obviously put together by millenials with too much spare cash for their own good. Avoid.,Annihilation
432,charleslanobucklin,Worth Watching,8,13 April 2021,"Based on the polarized reviews I decided to take a gander at Annihilation. Quite frankly I don't get the negative reviews. Beautiful visuals, good acting and a story that is quirky enough to hold my interest for the long running time. I'm giving it a solid 8 stars - the ending is a bit of a let down but still the show is worth watching.",Annihilation
433,sagniknath,Stunning and oftentimes trippy visuals with an ending that is fodder for thought provoking speculations,8,24 February 2018,"The premise of an alien/unknown environment and its effect on the explorers who try to fathom its mysteries is really nothing new in sci-fi. Not even remotely.
2001:A Space Odyssey, Event Horizon, Sphere, Interstellar are but a few of the examples off the top of my head pertaining to this sub-genre. They even did it just two years ago with Arrival. However, the beauty of this trope is that if properly utilized, it can really make for an engaging watch as we the audience , along with the onscreen explorers in a closed environment , try ourselves to make sense of the weird events and get a payoff when the final clue is revealed as to the mysterious entity's origin and purpose.Annihilation rather very successfully accomplishes in this target, namely to enthrall the viewers with the wonders and horrors of the perplexing location called Area X (very reminiscent of The Zone from Andreii Tarkovsky's S.T.A.L.K.E.R. ) and to make them care for the fate of the lead character (played effortlessly by Natalie Portman) who is resolved to find out why a part of the Earth's landscape is afflicted by such bizarre phenomena .The visuals and look of Area X is overall the film's strongest suite. Alex Garland has a penchant for showing beautiful scenery that appears too dreamlike and yet can be the setting for something sinister, as he did before in Ex Machina . I also liked how none of the characters in the expedition to Area X were overly cliched and that the dialogues felt very natural. Every character interaction and every flashback serves to strengthen the narrative and explore some of the film's more underlying themes.The ending itself is purposefully ambiguous , as it was in STALKER, but there are enough clues thrown about to let you know what exactly transpired and how the film itself maybe an allegory for an actual real life problem. It's not the end itself but rather its subsequent interpretation by the audience that is the most rewarding.Definitely a one time watch.",Annihilation

But the more you watch the more disturbing the story is, in a good way.Basically this is an alien encounter movie with scary scene here and there. The story isn't really complicated. The soundtrack is amazing, the music really enhance the alien feeling. The acting is good. Everything is okay. But still the twist in the end will make you think wth just happened after finishing this movie.",Annihilation
435,fustbariclation,The level of ignorance of the world is profound.,1,25 March 2018,"I know that one should avoid this sort of rubbish, but optimism does prevail from time to time.It's curious to see just how unformed the notions in some heads really are. We know that people spend money on expensive enemas, called 'colonic cleansing', because they have no notion at all of what goes on in their digestive system. This film makes it clear that a profound ignorance of almost everything discovered about the natural world in the past couple of centuries is far from rare.The film can't decide whether it's a guns 'n girls violence-porn film (though it tries for that), or an alien invasion, or a wow-what-clever scientists there are. It fails at all three. When it introduces one as a physicist, with the remark that she's very clever, you know that they've given up all hope of showing, not telling, and, indeed, so it proves. If the physicist, or any of them, is particularly bright, they conceal this magnificently.They go for mystery amnesia, having the group realise they've been in the place for several days, but not remembered anything - and then, next night, they sleep and wake up with no disturbance at all. The amnesia trope is not returned to, and, clearly, was only there to fill in some minutes. The actresses, writer, and director don't even know what diffraction is, so it isn't that surprising that genetics is quite beyond them. They've been told about the HOX genes, but, in having them inherited by plants, have no notion whatsoever of embryology, and thus, of its implications. They're must be of the view that we start of as homunculi. I suppose it's the Dunning-Kruger effect, really, that has writers produce something that reveals such utter ignorance, far too deep for any sort of suspension of disbelief to work.They didn't know what to do with it, but the bear was a nice prop.

Back acting, bland acting, bad writing, bad dialogue, bland dialogue and plot holes that a T-Rex could stomp through.The only thing the men know how to do in this movie is to shoot guns and be yahoos.

We have women scientists being all gung-ho, like men. Somehow, this makes it even less credible.Hey, you know what would have been good?

Actually, up until the end you still know virtually nothing about what happened. Second story also non-existent, just an excuse to show interracial sex, which seems obligatory these days in American films. Dialogs are not badly written, but mostly useless, perhaps due to the non-existent story. An abundant of unexplained things, again, up until the end. Also an abundant of illogical things, one example being: Realizing the gravity (or is it graveness?) of the situation/threat, I'm sure the US government can do more than just... that. I know communication frequency can't get through, but I'm certain you can pre-program drones to fly in and out on autopilot to get a recording of the situation.

441,kepeb,Could have been good.,3,14 June 2018,"The general feeling when thinking about Annihilation is that it was a shame, and a real missed opportunity for Sci-Fi fans.Taking cues from 2001's Evolution, an other-worldly being is spreading visibly after a meteorite hits the earth but this time it's no joke.
The alien life-form in question demonstrates a rather under-explored and contradictory 'reflective' reaction the the earths environment and inhabitants.
Some of the elements of this concept could have been engaging and would have provided a more justifiable reasons for the stunning visual effects achievable today.Unfortunately, that's not what we got. Far more time was spent exploring the feelings and emotions of the slow paced and inexplicably All-Female expedition into the alien territory. All the representation boxes were checked with gusto.
Somehow, an expanding incident of global concern under investigation by the government and military was left in the hands of a terminal gender studies professor, an Hispanic lesbian,a dutch girl with a sob story, a black geek and Mary Sue (Expert at everything).
They were non-military (Portmans's Character was Ex-military) but they were all issued weapons. They were scientists, but took zero notes, did no tests and the only time a camera appeared was when they found one...The third act was a relief, after the pointless whining and screeching ended thanks to the team being mostly killed off, from here it felt more moody and thoughtful. Somewhat in line with the recent 'Interstellar' when combined with the slow pace.You could almost be convinced by the 'art' ploy at this point, that the film was trying to convey hidden meanings and deeper more poignant points about the characters or even life, again, It's a shame. Because it didn't. Just a blatant ripoff of other well explored 'alien' tropes.I can already hear the excuses and dismissal of this criticism, Yes, if it makes you feel better, we are all racist Nazi's. However...
Poor old David Gyasi was shoehorned into the protagonists backstory as an afterthought, for no other reason than they needed some interracial action to complement the diversity quota. Twice! he had to endure Portman moodily bouncing on him via flashback accompanied with some loose reference about self destruction.It was such a shame to see a great idea and clearly a large budget go to waste on a project clearly more concerned with pushing this awful agenda than telling the story.

442,TheJohnnyPHreak,Gorgeous Sober Sci-Fi Drama,6,28 February 2019,"Alex Garland may not be a household name but film nerds know his name very well. This is the man who has created some excellent genre film in the past few years. He is the writer of such films as 28 Days Later, Dredd and Ex Machina which he also directed. When his name is attached to anything I get excited. When I heard about Annihilation, I did get excited. He was making original sci-fi with an outstanding cast. There's something about original ideas that makes me very stoked. I want more original films, especially sci-fi. It's one of my favorite genres. There are so many places to go with it. Garland is one person who I hope keeps coming up with fully developed original ideas because the film industry needs them. His latest endeavor, Annihilation is a layered movie that hits a lot of high points and a few low points.The film follows a biologist named Lena, played by Natalie Portman. She is grieving with the loss of her husband, Kane, Oscar Issac who went disappeared on a top secret military mission. When Kane shows up one day he's not the same. Lena can't get any answers from him. He has a medical emergency and on the way to the hosptial, the ambulance is stopped by vans in black. Lena wakes up in a military facility and explained that Kane was on a team that went on a mission to the odd zone and has been the only person to come back. Needing answers Lena joins the next mission into the Shimmer, an all-female team that features Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tuva Novotny, and Tessa Thompson. What they meet in the shimmer is something so expected and life-changing.This film is very much about dealing with loss and demons of all time. Each member of the mission has something they are overcoming or struggling with. Whether it be the loss of a family member, drug addiction, self-harm or guilty of past, each of our characters has something troubling them when they go into the shimmer. It makes for the film to have layers not just layers of the zone they have to go through but layers to their personalities and actions. The entire cast is very good. Portman may get the most screen time but Leigh, Rodriguez, and Thompson all shine. Garland seems to be very good at getting good performances out of his cast while telling a deeper story.This is thought-provoking sci-fi that answers some questions about what's going on in the film. But bigger questions are raised about humanity. That at times can slow the film down. Not in a negative way, but there is a lot to take in about the characters. Not just trying to figure out what the Shimmer is and how it is affecting the environment. Even though we don't spend as much time with each character as Lena, we are told through dialogue backstories and histories. There's a lot going on in this movie and I think it's a film to fully understand requires multiple viewings.Something it seems like Garland is now perfecting is visual in his film. Annihilation is beautifully shot with some vivid color schemes, excellent cinematography, and pretty wild special FX. The creatures in this film are nothing you've seen before. They very much evolve from the Shimmer and the atmosphere is at times its own character. This is a film definitely made for the big screen. No matter how large your TV screen is, I don't think it will do the film justice. For that, I give Garland all the credit because you can stop watching the film when it starts. As soon as the characters get to the Shimmer, we get to see the full extent of this sci-fi adventure mystery.I don't know what I expected the film to turn out to be. It definitely didn't see where it was going. I'm getting use to that with Garland films. Ex Machina is a film I could have predicted anything that was going to happen in that film. Annihilation is the same way. And that's a testament to the script. But there was something that just didn't hit me. I'm not sure if it was the small moments that slowed the film down. It could even be the ending that I expected some kind of big twist or a decent explanation. There was a twist but it's something that on re-watches is easily spotted. As I said earlier we are not given much explanation on the sci-fi elements in the film. The final moments of the film leave a lot to self-interpretation.Annihilation is visually stunning, thought-provoking and well acted. It just for me is missing something I can't explain. And it kind of falls apart for me in the last 10-15 minutes. I really love that Garland is going out and making original sci-fi, we as fans need more of it. I hope that he is given the chance to make more. I know this wasn't a huge hit but it seems like it's already making a cult status run. I suggest anyone who loves smart original sci-fi to check it out. At least that means that maybe the film industry will go out on a limb with original content instead of trying to make money on know IPs.",Annihilation

Written and directed by Alex GarlandThis movie was beautiful and terrifying at the same time. It comes from Alex Garland, the director of Ex Machina, another terrific mind twisting science fiction film. This movie takes you to a place that is alien in conception but exudes just a tiny bit of the familiar. It is a world that is ever changing even when you don't want it to.This movie is about a team of scientists who venture into this bubble called The Shimmer in search of its meaning. Many have entered it but none have returned with the exception of Natalie Portman's husband. He didn't come back the same though. Whatever happened inside changed who he is on a fundamental level. What they don't know is it changes everybody and everything.I won't give anymore away because finding out what it all is and what it all means. The exploration is the crux of the idea. It leads you through everything piece by piece and little by little. It latches you into this alien and nightmare world. It then proceeds to remove what comfort you might have. It evolves and devolves at the same time.This was a weird slow burn. I kinda loved it. The emotions coming from the actors has an air of detachment. They're all scientists in some fashion so they're viewing things from a distance. It is not necessarily cold. They're holding it all in. At least until their world starts to blur and decay right in front of their eyes. There is one creature that is the biggest form of nightmare fuel imaginable. It is the bear/human hybrid with a skull face and the screaming voice of it's last victim. Yeah pretty freaky.Overall this was a terrific, slow, weird and crazy nightmarish movie.

It looked visually stunning (and it was), and it seemed like it was an interesting concept...two things that usually make me like a movie. But almost from the beginning it was a disjointed mess. While the visuals were great, it seemed like there were 3 or 4 (maybe 5) different story lines going on. The filmmakers used every trick in the book to try to make the story coherent - flashbacks, compartmentalizing, but the story was just too much work to follow, with too many unanswered story line questions, like:1) How did Natalie Portman's husband (or clone of him) get out of the shimmer and back to their house? And why didn't he remember anything?2) What was the point of showing flashbacks of her having an affair with a coworker? And what became of that?3) What made Josie into a cutter? Why didn't they develop that issue a little further?4) How did Josie turn herself into a plant so quickly, and why did she even want to?Then, just when I thought I had a handle on the story and the concept, the last section...'The Lighthouse' reared it's ugly head and totally blew everything to smithereens. It left me saying ""WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT???"" I like to think I'm fairly intelligent, but I have no clue as to what the story was really about, and what happened at the end. It kind of felt like a bad acid trip.This movie could stand a major streamlining of the story and the script., and some better character development...just of the 4 women that went into the shimmer.

Parts of the forest set actually reminded me of the 1970's version of Willy Wonka's chocolate factor or a set from early Star Trek or Lost in Space. I actually found myself wanting more CGI!

458,jg_1977,Probably the best scifi-horror movie of the past 10 years,8,10 July 2018,"As it stands at the halfway point of 2018, this film is probably my 3rd favorite release so far. I liked quite a bit about this movie, I'll go through all the big items, piece by piece. First, the characters are all done wonderfully, especially given tha it has an ensemble cast. All the main actresses get a moment to shine and a deeper dimension besides their outward description, Portman and Thompson in particular turn in stellar performances. Second, it masterfully crafts tension and horror. From the very beginning we are on the edge of our seat, and the unease only builds until the last frame of the movie. Also the horror elements, are truly terrifying, with proper build up and no reliance on jump scares. Lastly, the visuals are some of the best I can think of. Every frame is gorgeous and could be a poster on your wall. My biggest issue with this movie is the ending, as I suspect is the case with most people. Throughout the movie, it's walking the line between science fiction and horror, and then the last 20 minutes turn hard into the science fiction aspect in a very unexpected way. Not to say that the ending is bad, but I felt that it was far too abstract with not enough set up for it to be earned. I suspect that writer/director Alex Garland intended to make this ending shocking and confusing, but I think he took it a touch too far, resulting in a climax that feels like it belongs in a different movie. Despite my gripe with the ending, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, so much so that I recently rewatched it. Everything about this movie is executed so well that I suspect Garland will be remembered as one of the great modern, scifi directors. My last note is just a piece of advice for those who do watch it at home. Watch it on the biggest, highest definition screen you have, with a solid sound system. A big part of this movie is built on it's visuals and sound design and you won't get the same experience if you watch it on a low def TV or laptop.",Annihilation

And that is a shame. Annihilation is a very well acted and intelligent scifi horror movie that deserved far more attention that it received.The writing in this movie for the most part is very good. Though they aren't given too much time to themselves, Lena's squad has enough depth to make them each feel they belong in the story and Lena is a fascinating character. Everything in the Shimmer, the dome of light that swallowed up a small town after an interstellar object fell on the outskirts of it, plays out naturally through her interactions with them. Everyone has a reason for the way they are, whether it be Dr Ventress listless speaking tone or Thorenson's tendency for self harm, and why they are on their path of self destruction. They are aware they are likely to die, or worse, end up like Lena's husband, Cain, but are adamant o undergo their mission, at least until they see what may become of them. There are some questionable moments of dialogue, at one point Shepard asks where Lena learned to shoot after they manage to kill a mutant alligator, which one would think they would have been aware of when they gave her an M16 when they sent her in, but they are rare and far between. Where the writing did fail completely was the framing scenes. A horror movie works by withholding information, the most important being what happened to them. This movie tells who the red shirts are immediately, telling the audience who lives and who dies. It hurts the suspense of a mutant bear attacking hem in the dark when you know who it takes. Furthermore, it serves more as exposition, taking you out of the story to tell you what you probably could have figured out if you paid an ounce of attention.The body horror is excellent, what the Shimmer does to the flora, fauna, and the squad is sometimes beautiful, more often horrifying, but always engaging. Plants that grow in the shape of humans and bears that can mimic their victims, there is so much to see that its hard to get bored, but its the changes they start feeling that steals the show. Scenes like a soldiers guts writhing in his stomach like a snake and his corpse becoming a giant fungal splatter on the wall drives home that even if they make it out, they aren't going to be the same again. The fear of becoming something other than human is ever present, especially when you see the horrors it can create.Was the movie hurt by its cast? No, an all female cast isn't the cause. It appears Paramount's lack of faith in the project doomed it.

I read the book upon which this movie is based, and I found it mind provoking and entertaining (unlike its far less interesting sequels). Although I wasn't a big fan of Alex Garland's movie Ex Machina, I was excited to see what he would do with Annihilation. Especially given that some claimed it was too ""brainy"" for a theatrical release here in Europe. Well, its not brainy. Certainly not if one compares it to the book. I was aware of Garland's choice not to re-read the book before writing the script, and I was prepared for him to exclude some of the book's strangest and unfilmable sequences from the movie. I was not prepared for him to have changed nearly everything except for some or the basic story. In fact the whitewashing debate seems redundant, since Natalie Portman's character is so far from the one in the books. Sure, it is a beautiful and poetic movie. But it is not mind provoking (/""brainy""), or especially intriguing. It is a light version of the book that fails to address some of the most fascinating things about Area X and most certainly the characters. So to conclude: The characters are without depth, the story as well. However, it is shrouded by a poetic and colorful shimmer (see what I did there?) that clearly is meant to divert attention from these flaws. 
My recommendation: If you want poetry, beauty, but also(!) interesting characters and ""brainy"", then read the book!",Annihilation
461,yoncenator,Scientists? Military? Anyone with common sense? None of these wrote this film.,3,30 May 2018,"OK Let's start with the good. The special effects in this film start out pretty good and the cg in the end is amazing.That's all the good, now the badIn what world does any military operation let you choose whether you want to continue forward or not? One that has a procedure of coming down from a perfect vantage tower with high powered machine guns and night vision goggles to investigate loud sounds from a hostile in the immediate vicinity? One that finds the ONLY video record of a previous failed mission and 1) doesn't even watch it to the end 2) discards it as 'light tricks' and of no use at all and 'they must have gone crazy'?  In what scientific community (military or not) do scientists discover their group has missing time and does absolutely nothing to try and record or mark intervals and note (write down, mark your arm ANYTHING) when time passes? How in the hell do you see a hostile mutant giant crocodile, and one of your team are taken by a giant mutant bear and you want to go into the jungle ALONE to find them? Even if she were completely crazy, how does one woman overpower three healthy good sized women that all have firearms and knives that they carry at all times?The final act is worth watching just for the cg. If the writers had only spent a few of those millions of dollars on consultants instead of day glow lichens, this would have been a more enjoyable ride, but as it stands I barely made it through there were so many WTF dialog and plot moments that I couldn't stop thinking ""MAN this is really bad film writing"" through most of it. If it was necessary to lose one character, let her own cloudy mind take her down the tower to be killed. NOT EVERYONE LOSE THEIR MINDS and act like a thirteen year old girl would in that situation. These are supposed to be seasoned military and highly educated women. I didn't buy it and it was insulting to anyone watching. How about showing some respect for scientific method and good old plain common sense. So the moral of this story is, ""If you're not sure what it is, KILL IT BEFORE IT KILLS YOU"" ?????What a horrible lesson for our already xenophobic society. Blech.",Annihilation

463,chriskylie,Ponderous sci-fi,6,14 August 2020,"Annihilation is another existential sci-fi asking big (largely unanswered) questions about humanity's destiny on this planet. Unlike Arrival and BladeRunner however Garland mixes in more typical blockbuster action and traditional thrills and jumps along the way. That said Annihilation doesn't build tension as you'd expect, despite similar set-plays to Jurassic Park, Predator etc. Whilst the premise is interesting enough, as with Ex-Machina Garland is too preoccupied with the film's ""big message"" delivering under-involving characters and a vague marginally dissatisfying pay off. I couldn't escape the feeling annihilation was too much like a longer, very well produced (and expensive) episode of Black Mirror.",Annihilation

466,Zettelhead,Big disappointment,3,14 April 2018,"First of all: This was ment to be an adaptation of a piece of literature, the frst book of Area X - the Southern Reach - Trilogy by Jeff Vandermeer. In this respect the movie completely fails. The writers of the screenplay try to interprete a highly complex story and solve the riddles of a weird surreal SF-novel which prominent quality is to stay mysterious and unsolvable.
When they got their weak explanation together they reinvented the whole thing according to their interpretation, not according to the book!
So if you expect to get something just near the visions of Jeff Vandermeer you´ll be horribly dissappointed. 
If you expect something else you´ll probably get something quite unsatisfying as well, wrapped in a real cheesy production design. At least, Natalie Portman and her male counterpart do a good job.",Annihilation
467,martinlucas-469-207968,Empty and lost,1,29 March 2018,"The vast range of responses to a film like this is fascinating. It must reflect the many different ways we all use film entertainment. For example, I love science fiction, and am always willing to suspend disbelief, but to me 'Westworld' is based on a ludicrous premise, has no real heart, and manifestly rushes round during the last couple of episodes desperately inventing unbelievable fixes and switches to the plot to get it to work.
But the imagery is wonderful, and apparently to many loyal viewers this more than makes up for it's other shortcomings ..
Similarly, 'Annihilation' looks like a significant film, talks like a significant film but in the end is nothing more than a rather tedious exercise in beautiful CGI and pseudo philosophy. But the scary stuff ( weird beasts that have skulls instead of real heads, writhing things in people's stomachs etc,) are randomly plucked from the well established horror movie playbook.
There is nothing remotely original about anything in the film. Nothing.

469,ChipperX,Into something different...,10,23 February 2018,"Annihilation (2018).Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.Alien invasion movies usually have one thing in common: The invading species wants our planet whether we're on it or not. One unique aspect of Annihilation is the fact that our protagonists are never really sure why the invaders came, after all.Lena's (Natalie Portman) husband, a military operative, has been missing for twelve months, and she is understandably distraught. She delves into her work as a university biology professor and shuts the world out. When Kane (Oscar Isaac) returns, Lena is at first relieved to be reunited with him. Unfortunately, Kane appears to suffer from PTSD: He remembers so little of events that led up to his departure and return that Lena is forced to join forces with the government to set things right.Annihilation begins by grounding us in the relationship between husband and wife, and then takes us on a frightening journey of self discovery, renewed purpose and utter madness. The film delivers sublime, alien-triggered variations of plant and animal DNA that are stunning and imaginative. What is the purpose of the alien species here? Are the aliens benign, or will their DNA ""refraction"" destroy earth's biosphere?Natalie Portman dives headfirst into the character of Lena, providing clear focus and a strong sense of purpose as the film's protagonist. The story unfolds through her experiences, and she carries the role with frightening intensity. Arguably, director Alex Garland's greatest achievement with Annihilation lies in its ambiguity: Who are we as a species, and how do we differ from other cellular beings? There are no easy answers, but the journey makes this question moot. For in making something different, the director succeeds in highlighting our cellular similarities.",Annihilation

The movie has sometimes a nostalgic 1950s look, combined with nowadays yet over the top CGI.

Portman goes in to follow her husband to find out what happened.This is an interesting premise but the film does not explain major points at all and leaves it up to the viewer to make sense of it. In addition, the director chose to constantly jump from the present, to the past and to the future of the story in such regularity that it became extremely difficult to follow.

Live organisms do not change in order, only defects are possible. Also take into account that bio stuff respect thermodynamics And move from higher energy to lower. - No something from nothing.EXPLAINATION:Only way this movie could work is if broken alien's spaceship would Crash land, braking before impact. Its nano-machines go try and fix the spaceship, but they get confused and wreak havoc by rearranging everything with everything. The system is centralized, because when alien is burnt, zone falls apart. The alien is real tho.The only part of this movie that is worth while is part when alien tries communicating. This is realistic, as intelligences differ In their nature, and it might be hard to impossible to understand another intelligent species.

487,ShanTeaTime,Hidden Depth Within A Shallow Looking Premise,7,21 October 2019,"""Annihilation"" is a science-fiction psychological horror film, following the story of a group of scientists who enter ""The Shimmer"", a mysterious quarantined zone of mutating plants and animals caused by an alien presence.Apparently this film was a financial disaster, which is a shame because it's actually really interesting and thought provoking! I haven't seen a film come along like this before and have such a strong sense of meaning. From what I picked up (and what I read up on the movie after seeing it) the movie is a huge allegory for cancerous diseases. Which is fascinating! I haven't heard of that concept before if it's what was intended.First of all we have an all lead women's cast, with Natalie Portman at the front killing her performance. I appreciate that the film is following Portman's character trying to save her husband, but isn't cliche and shows a lot of layering to that complicated relationship. We get a lot of crazy and creepy imagery, which makes you as an audience member feel on edge as soon as they enter ""the shimmer."" One scene that sticks out to me in particular is seeing the hedges in the shapes of human physical forms, it's so unsettling. The music in this film is really solid as well, I wish it would've garnered more of a following!So back to the cancer basis of the plot. We see mutated versions of animals and plants within this dome-like structure, various characters dealing with emotional grieving, our main character (whom is a cellular biologist by the way) eventually fighting a distorted version of herself with a cyanide bomb (self-destruction) and can be seen as a form of radiation treatment. It's all subtle but not too subtle to where it didn't click in my mind by the end. I probably missed quite a lot of the imagery as well!The film is intelligent, though will go over the heads of many people. It's ending was solidifying but didn't give me a sense of completion. So that bothered me a little bit, but didn't take away from the plot overall. Give the film a chance if you love sci-fi, for the pure fact that the visuals are stunning in this.

What's distracting are random ""sex"" scenes that do nothnot but ruin any pacing this movie had left.What is said and what happens is annoyingly inconsistent, infuriating even as there is an attempt to pass it as a mystery. When you accept the characters are just rambling nonsensically just to spook you, you realise there wasn't any challenge at all, either, which obliterates any tension.

Instead of physics, today's lesson is biology, so get your study materials ready.Not unlike hundreds of other films in its wake, 'Annhilation' follows the exact same formula of 1979's 'Alien' in tone, story, Giger-designed-looking structures and female heroine lead, but this is one of the better versions thanks to some excellent, atmospheric cinematography and pacing that actually respects the attention-span of the viewer (which was one of the truly subversive and brilliant things about 'Alien' that doesn't get mentioned as much, in a film that was full of genius ideas). Admittedly, the pacing probably seems good because the writing is so thin, so it's not like we have a lot of developments to cram in here.The acting is also very good but it's largely in vain, because this film never feels as tense or as frightening as it should; and even worse, the characters are paper-thin and unlikeable, and we can list them as: 'The Adulterous One' (which admittedly is interesting within the context of multiplying cells and splitting yourself between multiple people, losing yourself in the process -- the existential theme of the film), 'The Gay One' (we would have worked it out for ourselves but just in case, we get some out-of-place flirtation dialogue),'The Sheepish Self-Harming One' and 'The Dying One with Nothing to Lose' (..but does Jennifer Jason Leigh ever not look cool?).Cancer metaphors like these have been around in sci-fi literature (Ballard) and film for some time ('Akira'), but 'Annilation' still feels like a spirited attempt at trying something creative, that almost works.",Annihilation

Whoever thought of putting instrumental guitar music in the soundtrack deserves a slap. Lena's affair seemed to be stuck in there for no good reason. Her duel at the end with her ""echo"" goes on for way too long.Then there's the worst thing: the ending.

Then when I saw the movie, it wasn't even the same plot as the book.
Only 4 characters in the movie are in the book: The Biologist, her husband, the psychologist, and the Boar thingy.
The characters in the book are: The Biologist, The Psychologist, The Anthropologist, The Surveyor, a mentioned linguist who never made it across with them, the Biologist's husband and parents are mentioned throughout the book. In the movie, it is The Biologist(Lena), Her husband, the guy she's sleeping with, The Psychologist, A Morphologist, A Medic, A Physicist, the people quarantining her.
The characters in the book have no names, and this was to keep them from getting too close to each other. The characters in the movie all have names, and they say their names a lot.
In the book, they're investigating a tunnel/tower, and inside is a never-ending script of words that on closer inspections seems to be alive. The Biologist inhales a spore from inspecting the words, making her immune to The Psychologist's hypnosis. The next day the Anthropologist is dead. Biologist is sure Psychologist caused it. She and Surveyor get sent back into the Tower, then psychologist disappears. The Biologist names the creature writing the text The Crawler. There is a lighthouse, and a picture of the lighthouse keeper she sees in the Crawler. Aside from the existence of a lighthouse, none of this is in the movie. She finds her husband's journal and decides to continue searching Area X instead of returning home. (This is the end of book 1) The movie is just them examining a lighthouse. And Lena enters a hole which I'm guessing is the Tower, and meets a creature that mirrors her. Then she's back on regular Earth in quarantine.
In the book, everyone from the previous expedition came home mysteriously, and then died of cancer a few months later. In the movie, the husband is the only one to have come back, and is now dying of organ failure and in isolation.I didn't think any movie could top Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters for a worse book-to-movie adaptation.

494,treborbasset,I'm so disappointed,4,13 January 2019,"Billed as a science fiction horror film, for a lot of it Annihilation seems to be a love film with an all female cast. The book itself is about four women, so I don't know where this film went wrong. Apparently it was only based on the first book of a trilogy, and deviated quite a lot, more using the ideas to tell its own story.Annihilation is neither exciting, nor interesting, nor scary. It is simply boring and full of plot holes. I feel like it was in desperate need of a strong male lead. Or better character development. The husband sucks all the air out of every scene he's in. He looks moody and barely speaks (this is true in flashbacks as well, so nothing to do with what happened to him). It is difficult as the viewer to empathise with Lena or even comprehend her love for him. Or care about it in any way.The team of four going into the Shimmer have no chemistry whatsoever. If you compare it to a movie like Aliens or Predator... actually, it is pointless to do so. This is not an action movie, although a good action movie could be made with this premise.The story is told by jumping backwards and forwards in time, but I found myself not caring about any of it. The three women apart from Lena I couldn't really tell you anything about. Actually, there were five rather than four that entered the Shimmer, but that's how badly written and forgettable they were - I forgot one.All of the main cast are insipid and devoid of personality. There is one scene where one of them gives Lena the lowdown on what makes each of them unique. It was forgettable and pointless. The viewer finds themselves not actually caring what happens, even in the small number of tense moments where their lives are in danger. I fought the urge not to turn off halfway through, and was rewarded with an initially intriguing and beautiful finale, that is then completely wasted with an unsatisfactory ending that doesn't attempt to explain any of it.The writer and director of this film did a terrible job. I honestly don't know what he was trying to do with this film, but he didn't succeed.It is a shame for such an interesting concept to be wasted on this film. The concept behind it is extremely interesting to me. The visual effects were stunning and beautiful, at times psychedelic. This could have been an intriguing or even quite cerebral film, instead of the confusing painting by numbers love story we got, riddled with plot holes. It leaves you with more questions than answers. Deeply unfulfilling.",Annihilation
495,filmsbyq,Annihilation - a review.,6,4 April 2018,"Alex Garland's latest big-screen offering - and small screen, more on that later - is the 'cerebral' thriller Annihilation. I put cerebral in quotations as Inception this is not! Admittedly I am one of the few people who were not blown away by Garland's last outing, the enjoyable but, I felt, too ponderous, Ex Machina.
I will say that Garland definitely has a good visual style. Like Ex Machina, Annihilation looks incredible, which contributes to an initially interesting and disturbing atmosphere. That soon wears off as the story gets not so much going as plods along.
Natalie Portman is Lena, an ex-soldier turned scientist/biologist whose husband, Oscar Issac's Kane, also a military person, has gone missing presumed dead. Lena mopes around her home, sullen with grief and guilt - she had an affair with a married colleague at the college she works at, though it is not indicated whether the affair happened whilst her husband was missing or beforehand - cutting herself off from friends and acquaintances.
Kane returns but he is different and cannot explain his year-long absence. When he suddenly becomes critically ill, Lena takes him back to the military base in an effort to save him. There she meets Jennifer Jason Leigh's Dr Ventress who tells her about her Kane's return from an exploratory mission into an unexplained area they had named the Shimmer, due to its dome-like shimmering quality.
Ventress goes on to explain that several missions had yielded no results and they had lost much personnel. All the previous expeditions had been male only, so for no discernible reason I could fathom, the next suicide - sorry - expedition would be an all-female affair. Lena, military trained and a scientist to boot, decides to join the mission reasoning - poorly - that the answer to whatever is killing her husband is inside the mysterious Shimmer.
So, on a planet where a person can barely sneeze without it hitting the internet and satellites from every first world country orbit the planet, this Shimmer has been being investigated, for over a year, just by the Americans. A year in which it has expanded and they have kept feeding military bodies to it. Right. Onward.
Five intrepid ladies head into the Shimmer, besides Lena and the doctor, there is Tessa Thompson as the DNA specialising, anthropologist Josie Radek, Gina Rodriguez as the overtly gay Anya Thorensen and Tuva Novotny as Cass Sheppard. All have their scientific specialities, not that it matters much in the context of the film. \Only the good doctor knows Lena is related Kane, the only person to have returned from the Shimmer.
Once inside the Shimmer, all sense of time and orientation is lost, the women cannot remember entering the Shimmer, nor can they recall how long they have been inside.
They trek on exploring the wondrous and lush landscape. On coming upon a semi-submerged houseboat, they proceed to investigate. One them gets attacked by something in the water. Obviously. After a frantic rescue, there is a brief showdown with the unidentified river/swamp beast. Lena shows her military prowess, emptying a clip into it. Bravo.
There is quite unbelievable science, gobbledygook and hapless exposition as they speak of DNA adaption and mutations. Unfortunately, such subject matter has been executed so much better in other films and television programmes.
There is madness, mutiny, abduction and death but it is not anything you would care about as none of the characters is particularly memorable or empathetic. I would give out a complete spoiler-laden review, but it would make very little difference in the context of the film, with its somewhat ambiguous premise petering out to a most unsatisfying conclusion.None of this is the fault of the talent on show, who all try gamely with the material they are given, but with exposition kept to a bare minimum - usually a good thing - and explanations almost nonexistent, the story struggles to keep a viewer either engaged or caring.
Annihilation is almost too smart for its own good, with the questions it poses - why would you keep going in? How has no one in the world noticed there's an expanding light bubble in North America? - not the ones it perhaps hoped for. Annihilation was released in theatres in the U. S. but in Europe, due to some distribution issues, was released on Netflix. As I said earlier, the visuals in the film are stunning so it is a pity - even with the advent of supersize televisions - that it could not find even a limited theatrical release in Europe, as its visual scope at least deserves a large screen.
Annihilation is not unwatchable, but it is disappointing and somewhat pretentious with a good film buried beneath the pretensions.",Annihilation

It didn't surprise me when I learnt later that the director is also behind Ex Machina. The dialogue is both good and awful at different spots. The acting is nice.Very high-concept with a real sense of mystery, scary at times but short in action (thats absolutely great it wasn't an action thriller!). I had a fair share of plot holes and questionable decisions, but overall it is a captivating experience.

501,ashishagupta,"It was pretty but it was bad, well it was pretty bad",3,15 March 2018,"Whoever wrote the dialogues and screenplay should be annihilated. Once again, Hollywood creates a Sci-Fi movie that creates a team of all scientists, where the scientist behave like unprofessional juveniles. I just can't understand why they go down this road. Successful movies in the past have put together a team of jocks and nerds and wrote a good back story that logically places them together in that scenario. Something goes terribly wrong and then our jocks and nerds, who otherwise would never mingle, are compelled by circumstances to work together to figure out their survival plan. This diversity of character traits allows for: deep intellectual inquiry from nerds about the sci-fi part; overblown act first think never behavior from jocks about the action part; and a dysfunctional team behavior from both to fuel the horror part. The movie progressively kills off the rude jocks and the arrogant nerds until the last person standing is a woman with a good heart. This is pretty standard and straight forward to execute. The writers of this movie apparently were sick the day that taught screenplay at drama school.In movies, nobody likes to watch women get badly hurt or killed on screen and consequently an all female scientific team headed into danger zone is a tough proposition to pull off. While it has been done before, Annihilation is unable to pull it off. Had the dialogues been profound, they might have correlated with the stunning visual scenery in some parts of the movie. Unfortunately, the phenomenally lousy script was either boring or annoying. I can't recall a single quotable line from the entire movie.I wonder who the target audience for the movie is supposed to be. Those who might overlook the mind numbing stupidity of the movie are not the types who would come to watch a Sci-Fi movie of their own volition. It is the opposite of' those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind'.Given how gratuitous and cliched the horror was, with the Shimmer mutating the movie from a sci-fi into a creature feature, I half thought that Harvey Weinstein would show up in the middle of the night to attack our group of all female scientist protagonist and they would exact sweet revenge. But nope, its just a boring typical ugly-ass animal and women in bondage scene.",Annihilation
502,drhoads-93743,Atmospheric Horror,8,13 January 2019,"I gave this film an 8, but in reality I was toggling in my mind between picking either 10 or 6. I know it's weird, but I can't quite tell what to make of this film. Is it great, or it okay?The atmosphere of the film is truly creepy, like from a nightmare. The visuals and score were crazy in a great way. What I imagine a bad DMT trip would be like.I really only see two problems with this film. First, some might say it moves a little too slowly. Finally, for a film with such bizarre elements as this, I was kind of hoping for a conclusion that was a bit more symbolic and/or surprising and/or ambiguous.Many people have been talking about this film like it needs some great explanations. And unfortunately, I really don't think it does. The ending seemed pretty straightforward and there was little I was confused about. Only a few small elements needed further explanation, which I was able to quickly Google. But that was it.The buildup was so intense, and I was a tad let down by the time the climax finished.They were on the verge of making a masterpiece. But they fell short in a few areas.Overall, I definitely recommend. Just have patience with it. Watch it at night with the sound up loud in order to hear the very soft-spoken dialogue and to get the full effect of the terrifying music.",Annihilation
503,maue-19674,A Real Science Fiction Mood Piece,8,21 May 2019,"Lets face it - Annihilation is a 'love it' - or 'hate it' - kind of Film. If you are looking for spaceships, aliens, explosions etc you had better look elsewhere - this is Sci-Fi in reflective mood (or 'refracted'?). The story - loosely based on the novel - seems simple. A Biology Professor's soldier husband suddenly turns up at their house after being 'missing' for some time. He cannot remember where he's been - or much at all. He collapses and is on his way to Hospital when the ambulance - and all aboard - are taken by armed men. On awakening Lena (Natalie Portman) is told about her husband's 'mission' - into a phenomenon called 'The Shimmer' - by Psychiatrist Dr Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Despite numerous expeditions into the phenomenon, Lena's husband is the first person ever to return. However, no one is any the wiser as to what the 'Shimmer' is or does. Lena volunteers to join the next group to enter in an effort to find clues as to what it all means. The Group - all Female - is led into the 'Shimmer' by Dr Ventress and things start to get weird almost immediately.This is a real Sci-Fi 'mood piece', indeed almost Art Film. The 'Shimmer' itself is beautifully realised and the whole experience once inside has a strange- dreamlike quality. There are many themes explored within the Film - our attraction to 'self-destruction' - ALL of the characters in the film seem to be 'damaged' to one extent or another and seem only willing to head towards their own self destruction. On the other hand, the 'extra terrestrial' source of the 'Shimmer' is NOT a conventional alien entity as we have seen in countless Sci-Fi films - indeed when Lena is asked 'what it wants'? She replies that it 'may not want anything' - it simply defies our reasoning. The clues that are scattered through the narrative hint that the 'Shimmer' is a giant 'refraction' medium - and whether it is Radio waves - or even DNA - it ALL gets mixed in a huge biological blender.
Some of the images are simply breath taking and the ideas are largely left to you as the audience to decide what is actually going on. 'Annihilation' is one of those Films - a little like 'Arrival' - where you are asked to put your own interpretation on the events. I have watched the film a number of times and, for me, it remains a weirdly hypnotic experience.",Annihilation
504,russmillerwy-957-682439,weak tea in pretty colors,7,4 March 2018,"Like the team sent in to investigate the mysterious phenomenon, Annihilation lacks the boldness and resolve that could have made it more interesting. I found myself missing the competence and confidence of a Kirk-Spock-McCoy landing party. We shouldn't chalk that up to this being an all female team, either. Janeway, Princess Leia, or a dozen other more real-life female characters would have held their own, too.As many others have already said, this is beautifully and creatively filmed. The colors would make a spectacular screen saver, and make up for the slowness of pace. It reminds me of Sunshine in many ways. As in that film about heroes sent in to refuel a dying sun, the plot is overshadowed by whimpering, psychologically unstable characters who are seeking the first excuse ro fall apart, flip out, a fade away.

Everything about it just works for me: visuals, sound, story, themes, atmosphere.One of my favourite aspects is the sound. There is one song in the movie that encapsulates its themes really well, and is played several times throughout. Other than that, there is no soundtrack except at the very end during Lena's confrontation with the entity. Except, the lack of soundtrack up until this point implies to me that the unreal and unnerving tones are actually coming from the entity, and Lena is hearing what we are hearing. It just works so well to sell the otherness of the entity even more.The themes of pain and self-destruction are, while not subtly, really well incorporated into the story to the point where the literal story doesn't even really matter, and it's more about the internal journey that Lena is going through. I really like the movie's message that pain and trauma will change you irreversibly into someone new, but still you.",Annihilation

511,Uwontlikemyopinion,If Andrei Tarkovsky Could Roll Over in His Grave,5,2 April 2018,"Biologist Lena (Natalie Portman) mourns the disappearance of her husband Kane (Oscar Isaac). Suddenly, Kane reappears inside her house. Surprised, she demands answers. Confused, he rambles vague answers until blood pours into a glass of water that he's drinking. On the way to the hospital, government agents capture and detain them at a compound called the Southern Reach. At the compound, Doctor Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) explains to Lena that Kanes' organs are failing from entering the Shimmer, a mysterious zone that will engulf the United States within several months. In the hopes of healing her husband, she enters the Shimmer with four strong, intelligent women.I'd recommend this movie to people that enjoy Lynchian movies, plus elements of body horror (watch out for that bear scene). The film is ambitious, challenging, thought-provoking, and leaves the viewer to decide his or her own answers. Additionally, this movie conveys a plethora of themes ranging from duality, evolution, annihilation (duh), love (specifically interconnectedness or codependency), biology, and suspicion of our body. This film should be seen several times if anyone can muster the patience and temperament.As much as this film wants to be ""Solaris,"" ""Annihilation"" disappoints. Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac lack chemistry. Every single character appears to be on either Ambien or Xanax. And the way they speak, forget it. The story relies on flashbacks within flashbacks, a great example of bad structure. The violence, although minor, is ugly (Gina Rodriguez's character gets mauled by a bear, her teeth fly out and her larynx is exposed, a dead body decomposes against a pool wall).

This film is masterfully constructed with countless layers and payoffs that treat the audience for being engaged with the plot while leaving them fascinated to find out what it further has in store. The visuals and sound design in this film are gorgeously crafted, and utilized to their fullest extent to provide commendable sequences of audio/visual storytelling that leave you in awe and wonder..If I were to draw any sort of minor complaint from my viewing experience, it would be that besides Oscar Isaac and Natalie Portman, there is a couple acting performances that fall flat in a number of sections where line delivery and expression feels mediocre and phoned in.

It still feels like something is missing to make this big. Maybe I would have been more impressed if I had seen it on the big screen - unfortunately we were not given that choice, since a cinematic release was scrapped.

518,realmuthaf,Annihilation of common sense,5,17 March 2018,"After ""Ex Machina"" I expected more from director Alex Garland. Annihilation is pretentious, boring and ultimately style over substance.The premise itself is intriguing - there is an expanding supernatural Zone out of which nobody has returned, except for Natalie Portman's husband, who appears to have no memory of prior events. Portman herself is a university professor who presumed her husband dead.However, everything goes downhill really quick. First, literally on the 3rd minute of the movie we are shown a comet hitting a lighthouse, which immediately eliminates any mystery regarding the Zone's origins, as it's clearly extraterrestrial. Then we are led to believe that the Zone has been expanding for 3 years already. And what has the government organization overseeing it done in the meantime? Perhaps, send a large-scale military/scientific expedition with lots of gear and vehicles? Well no Sir! They have only sent a few small teams, none of which ever communicate or come back. So, by the movie's events, the current squad consists of 5 suicidal women who barely have any relevant skills for the mission. And while all are ""scientists"", the only person who tries to do some research is Portman, who at least takes biological samples along the way.And how our 5 girl-scouts act once they enter the zone is unspeakable. They go in without any protective gear(!) and only M4s for weapons(!!), with only Portman having prior shooting experience(!!!), follow no plan and just wander around wasting time(!!!!) and leave no marks to be able to find their way back, as GPS and even compasses don't work(!!!!!).Besides the sci-fi-ish premise, the movie also has some horror elements, so there are obligatory scenes of a team member being snatched from behind, and one team member losing their mind and acting hostile towards others. The latter scene looks very lame, by the way. There is some suspense in the film, but not enough of it.While Annihilation has some pretty, albeit low-budget, imagery, the story feels like its writer just came up with some creepy moments but didn't care to stitch them together in any sensible way. There isn't any sense in Thessa Thompson's turning into some sort of discount Poison Ivy and disappearing. There isn't any sense or consistency in the CG-alien's actions. Why has it ""entered"" Jennifer Jason-Leigh and obliterated her? Why hasn't it done so with Portman, and played some copycat game instead? The alien core can be burned to the ground with a single phosphorus grenade, really? Why didn't Isaac's duplicate (whose reveal was as obvious and predictable as possible) also burn down, while all the other alien constructs were destroyed?The answer to all those questions is because the writer did a sh***y job, that's why.

I am now learning that producers put this line on the cover when a movie is especially BAD. US movie makers have been going through a lot of forced changes since early 2016. A breed of reviewers calling themselves pop-critics wanted more women in movies just for sake of being a woman, not talent or skills. You know who they voted in 2016 US elections. This lack of good acting and talent cannot be more apparent from watching Natalie Portman's from very beginning of the movie. Why would anyone hire this bad actress beggars belief. Then she meets the director of the exploration team - a woman. And before the mission, she meets another 3 other female biologists (in a scene where I counted 7 women and 3 men). You cannot make this type of blatant discrimination up. Somehow you the viewer are being brainwashed to believe that these women will succeed where trained military and male scientists have failed! I now understand what was meant by ""where laws of nature don't apply anymore."" This movie is in same category as all-female Ghostbusters and latest Star Wars by JJ Abrams. It is about pushing an ideological agenda rather than a story.But let me go back to the beginning. The first few scenes of this movie is a right rip off of the great movie ""The Signal,"" a movie I thoroughly recommend you to watch to come out of the depression and coma that Annihilation will induce you into.

Like the ""Shimmer"" zone which is the main focus point of the movie, it's incredibly beautiful to look at, but there's a LOT going on just beneath the surface. I recently saw it at my local theater and I still haven't completely been able to work it out, at least not completely in my mind.It basically follows an ex-military woman turned biologist named Lena, played by Natalie Portman, who has not yet fully gotten over the apparent ""death"" of her husband Kane, who went out on a mission about a year prior to the main event of the film and never returned. However, one day, completely out of nowhere, he returns, walking right into their bedroom, with an empty cold look in his eyes that immediately alerts the viewer that something isn't quite right. Lena, understandably is very overjoyed and emotional about his return but unnerved when he can't give any sort of answer about what happened to him, where's he been, or how he came back. He then begins coughing up blood and while en route to the hospital in an ambulance it is intercepted by an envoy of military and police squadrons who take him out of the ambulance and with the paramedic and Lena viewing everything with both confusion and horror and suddenly Lena passes out, seeming to have ""caught"" whatever illness/radiation? her husband has been exposed to. She then finally learns the truth about what happened to him and that he was the only person so far who has returned from a mysterious alien zone of sorts dubbed ""The Shimmer"" by the scientists studying it since it ""landed"" on Earth near a lighthouse about three years ago. Wanting to find out more about what happened to him and what the shimmer is exactly she volunteers for the next mission into it despite knowing fully well the risks involved and that she and the four other women going in might very well not make it out. Despite the rich alien beauty and richness of the shimmer, the film, from start to finish is very dark and gloomy, with the first act slowly taking it's time to build up an uneasy atmosphere of suspense and dread. For viewers with shorter attention spans it might come off as a little too depressing or even boring, but once the team goes into the shimmer, the film finally starts to pick up pace and remains visually and emotionally satisfying all the way up too the film's climax. There is plenty of eye-candy to be had, but don't let the visuals fool you, there are still terrifying things to be experienced in the shimmer and if you let your guard down too much, you might end up regretting it when you least expect it. Not strictly a ""horror"" movie, at least in the traditional sense, as there are no jump-scares or ""ooga-booga"" moments that you might expect from the trailer, it very strongly reminded me of Lovecraftian Cosmic Horror, and the film, as well as I suppose the book it's based on (I've never read it), clearly took a lot of their inspiration from stories like ""The Colour out of Space"" with it's mysterious, surreal, alien landscape with mutated flora and fauna that are as deadly as any creature from movies like Alien or The Thing. I definitely enjoyed it, and I think viewers who are into films that aren't afraid to be intelligent, creepy, thought-provoking, and weird all at the same time, will enjoy it as well. Eight stars, minus two for some very vague, but minor and ""incomplete"" plot points which I wish would have been resolved in the movie, but never really were.",Annihilation

528,cristiandeiana,It tries to be more complicated than it actually is.,6,15 March 2018,"I suppose this might just come down to personal preference but I personally find that Annihilation tries too hard to be overly intellectual/complicated, and I find it interesting how this seems to be a trend in cinema in recent times. If you think about how sci-fi movies were made decades ago, they were usually a lot more action oriented with a plot that is fairly obvious. You also had movies like Blade Runner for example which on the one hand is fairly cheesy as you'd expect from an 80s movie, but at the same time it has a deep thought provoking plot. There are even modern examples like Inception in the same way is deep thought provoking, and can even be somewhat complicated, but what I'm trying to explain here is that these movies don't try to be overly complicated. They have a plot which is easy to grasp and understand but at the same time has depth.The problem with movies like Annihilation is that it tries to use an underlying theme with which runs throughout, you're suppose to try and be intellectual and understand these themes and supposed metaphors in order to appreciate the plot and for it to provoke further discussion. Where I find this goes wrong for Annihilation is that I don't feel like the theme is particularly interesting or thought provoking, and whereas it may have worked if used more subtly as a side theme and for the rest of the movie to have a more solid plot, Annihilation commits fully to the theme which results in a bizarre and in my opinion pretty weak ending. In short what I mean is the movie tries to be more complicated than it actually is which in turn weakens the plot.Annihilation does contain some satisfying action sequences, horror, special effects and acting, all of which bring the quality of the movie up a notch. However I'm not particularly impressed with the directing, with too many slow sequences where nothing much happens to the point where it becomes a bit tedious to watch. It works in movies like 2001:A Space Odyssey where the setting and artistry of space welcomes the slow pace, and also Blade Runner does this well with beautiful stylised shots and an amazing soundtrack. Annihilation doesn't have these same qualities and therefore the slow pace just doesn't work. I mean sure some of the CGI looked pretty nice, but that doesn't mean I wanna watch a slow pan of the scene for 10 seconds if it has nothing else going for it.In conclusion, it's safe to say Annihilation isn't going to be a cult classic. It's merely a nod to a particular theme or set of themes running throughout humanity/society. If you fancy watching a bit of horror, and some decent suspense then you may enjoy the ride at least to some extent. However I think that's about all the movie has going for it, and so with a weak plot and poor directing it overall ranks low in my book.",Annihilation

532,utku_kamil_ozen,One of Those Movies You Love and Hate at the Same Time for Different Reasons,7,1 June 2019,"This is a very interesting and bold sci-fi film that does everything right story-wise, but it has some major flaws that kept me distracted for the majority of its running time.I love the premise of the film and its take on aliens. Whenever we see aliens in movies, their behaviors and motives are almost always in line with ours or simply they are animals with some super predatory attributes. Everything they do is similar to and explicable by our own experiences and the things we are familiar with. They either come with warships to invade us, exactly like a country would do to another country, with weapons and warfare; or in the case of the latter, they hunt a small group of people until the last one, a protagonist, kills them at the end. Now I don't necessarily have a problem with those movies, as long as they are well made, but they all have a very simplistic approach to the question of an alien's behavior and motives. This film however does completely the opposite, the alien(or aliens) in Annihilation is so weird that I am only about 90% sure that it was an alien, and that is after the film literally spelled it out loud for the audience. I love an unsolved mystery in my movies and we are rarely gifted with those, because they make movies to satisfy a general audience, they are dumbed down for the lowest common denominator, so they don't hate the film because they don't ''understand'' it. I don't need to know everything at the end, I don't need to say ''Oh, so, that's how that happened!'' That's why the alien was so interesting and weird, we don't even know what it wants, it causes trouble but we are not sure if it is doing it as an attack on us or if it is even aware that it causes harm to us, all of which makes the alien much more interesting and genuienly creepy, much creepier than a mindless killing machine.However, as much as I loved the premise of the film, it has done very little with that premise. It has so much potential and could have been much better. The film seems to have suffered from low budget and it looks comically cheap sometimes. And that rainbow colors theme doesn't help. There is a weird contrast of visuals that doesn't work; when the characters are indoors and at the safety of their homes, It is dark and they act overly dramatic and there is a sense of depression, all of which are so unwarranted and it feels like a different movie, you feel like you are watching a haunted house or a possession story and it feels so unnecessary. Whereas when our characters are in the shimmer, there is a theme of rainbow colors and it doesn't fit at all. The sets looks cheap, like someone decorated the trees with plastic decorations. They clearly had a low budget and couldn't find a smart way around it. The world design is very important for me in a science fiction, but it was to the detriment of the film in this case, because it's done so poorly.Having said all of that, I still highly recommend it because of its originality and weirdness. The ending alone is worth watching. If its budget had matched the ambition of its writing, this film could have been a sci-fi classic.",Annihilation

534,wiredarp,Generic stuff you've seen done better already,4,22 March 2018,"Looking at some of these reviews, i'm struck by how many are obviously gamed. 
Such as 'A Mind-Bending Sci-Fi Masterpiece'. LOL.This is a very poor movie. Slowly paced with badly chosen flashbacks, huge plot holes, and at the end of it, absolutely nothing you haven't seen done better in other movies. Unlike some claims, its certainly not 'highly sophisticated when it comes to scientific explanations' as one shill claimed. In fact, its a mess of nothing at all. I've seen more realistic plot exposition in Godzilla movies.Acting is ok, but nothing extraordinary. The filming is its only redeeming quality, its rather nice, with lots of woodland and swampy scenes, and the alien plant landscapes are very nice (rather a bit like the War of the Worlds remake). The CGI however does have a few flat spots (the 'deer' are a particularly bad render). Its basically a monster/horror movie done by the numbers. Save your money.",Annihilation
535,leegato,I Came In Expecting the Unexpected and I Got....Sorta What I Expected?,7,23 March 2018,"I became interested in Alex Garland's work after watching Ex Machina a year or so ago. I was absolutely mesmerized by the writing and pacing, as well as the philosophical depth, of such an intense and unsettling film. When I began seeing the trailers and marketing for Annihilation, I had this feeling that this film was going to be beyond the horror sci-fi it was advertised to be. In a sense, I knew that the film was going to be as philosophically pleasing as Ex Machina, and beyond the scope of the typical horror sci-fi genre.Fast forward to me finishing Annihilation. I walked out of the theater with a mixed response. On one hand, it's a thought-provoking science fiction horror film; on the other hand, it's an incomplete story told with masterful direction. So here are my thoughts:The cinematography and design of this film are fantastic, that's without question. The film goes to great lengths to describe the world underneath the Shimmer, a world where biological rules are ignored and blur into hauntingly beautiful mutations of life. The design of the film is artwork in itself, the results of an expansive imagination that blends the genres of nature and horror. Much of the imagery in this film is beyond the likes I've ever seen in a sci-fi film. It's incredibly creative yet wholly familiar.The pacing and direction of this film as a horror film is gripping; I found myself holding my breath during several key climactic moments (that more or less involved excruciating and toe-curling gore). It's so incredible that the very design of the film and the way it's directed makes just looking at the mutated imagery of the Shimmer's effect on nature stomach-churning; Garland takes great care in establishing suspense and letting it pay off with the unimaginable.The story was unsatisfactory and riddled with plot holes. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I felt the film the was trying to portray a philosophical and abstract message with the film but failed to do so. The subplot of the film (involving Natalie Portman's character's personal life) doesn't seem to tie to the main plot and its devices, and feels incomplete. The supporting characters' backstories are explored but doesn't seem to have much relevance in terms of symbolism with the main plot. Anywhere where I can find an interpretation/abstract meaning of the film, I'll find it, especially for an Alex Garland film, but this one was tough to interpret, and thus felt incomplete for me. Too much attention was brought to the subplots and not enough was given to connecting them to the main plot.That said, the film manages to maintain interest in the story; it plays off as a mystery, slowly peeling the intricacies of its world and story layer by layer, keeping its audience invested as they try to unravel the fantastic elements of the story. I overall was happy with how intense and horrific this piece of art is, but felt the story was lacking and too ambiguous to develop any meaning from it, whether it be on a plot level or a philosophical one.",Annihilation

538,hakrames,The Best Sleeper Film of the Year,9,28 February 2018,"From writer and director Alex Garland, Annihilation is about a team of researchers who go into this unknown zone that has appeared called 'The Shimmer' to investigate what it is, why it's here, and how it's growing and changing its surroundings so rapidly. I was a fan of Garland's last film he wrote and directed, Ex Machina, for his tightly written dialogue and mesmerizing scene development with great acting and a surprising amount of action as well. His work on that film transfers over beautifully to Annihilation with a substantially bigger budget and a wider variety of acting as well. Even though this script has substantially less dialogue than his last film, each and every line is executed beautifully and the audience feels the impact of every one as well. His direction in this movie is flawless with the proper use of slow motion and the mix of special effects and practical makes it mesmerizing every second the cast is in the shimmer. Like I said the dialogue is practically flawless with it's variety of characters and unique builds in this film. The twists written come across very well and are fleshed out beautifully with its amazing cast and great direction. Rob Hardy's work on cinematography is amazing with his offsetting shots and beautifully crafted scenes. With him working on Ex Machina with Garland they have now developed a system that is just pumping out more and more beautiful movies every few years now. Acting wise everyone did a flawless job in this film. Natalie Portman I believe has never done a bad or even a decent performance, when she hits the screen she's impeccable with every role, every character, every scene, every line of dialogue that she executes in every film she's in. Jennifer Jason Leigh did an amazing job once again as Dr. Ventress in this film, I grew a very big liking for her from her performance in The Hateful Eight. Even Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson did amazing jobs for their polar-opposite characters in this film. One of the biggest parts of this film is the make p done on the cast and it's by far the best looking makeup of the year. The scars on characters and tattoos being strategically placed on the characters makes this films story just more and more impactful with every watch. The blood and gore used is beautiful combined with great prosthetics and for gore and creatures as well. Annihilation I believe will be one of the best sleeper movies of the year with it's highly original sci-fi story and great direction and acting with a flawless blend of CGI and practical effects used. My only complaint has to be a subplot that attempts to flesh out Portman's character a bit more, I felt it's not necessary and drags the runtime out a little bit too long. Minus that it's a near perfect sci-fi movie. I have to give this film a 9.25/10",Annihilation

544,NotTheOne000,Remembering what it's like to not understand,10,15 March 2018,"In Iain M Bank's novel Excession, one of the sentient super-intelligent spacecraft observes:""An Outside Context Problem was the sort of thing most civilisations encountered just once, and which they tended to encounter rather in the same way a sentence encountered a full stop.""And so when the alien asteroid / seed / spacecraft (call it what you will) lands on Earth, we encounter such a thing. Just as when the British Empire's ships landed on an isolated stone-age island, the humans of the film have no context in which to place the events unfolding, hidden, within The Shimmer. All the Earth-islanders know is that something has arrived which makes no sense, over which they have absolutely no power, and which entirely reshapes their core belief of being masters of their immediate surroundings.Only in Annihilation, the reshaping is not one of an encounter with a higher form of technology or scientific knowledge. It's a disassembling of the sense of explanation to which we have become so familiar. In an era where explanations, scientific or not, are just a screen-tap away, the ultimate shock to us is to be put into an environment where we cannot possibly find understanding - not even an invented one of Russian bot conspiracy theories. The sense of control over ideas that our technology has given us is deliberately cast to one side here.Garland has described his film as being the book remembered as a dream, and the narrative is true to that statement. Time jumps with no memories to fill in the gap. Characters simply disappear, with barely a thought given to them once they've gone. There is a sense that your body is not quite how your body should be. And understanding is impossible because real-world logic has been suspended. The casting itself is evokes the dream-like nature of the film. Existenz (Jennifer Jason Leigh), Westworld (Tessa Thomson) and Black Swan (Portman) all blur the boundaries between real and unreal.The film will divide critics and viewers. There is allegory, namely the inherent nature of self-destructiveness that is part of life, and the fact that life simply does what it does, be it human or alien. At the end of the interview between Lena (Portman) and Lomax (Wong), Lena says that the alien did not want anything and was not destroying, but simply changing things. That's also true of the greater arc of humanity. Human society, as an entity, has no sense of autonomy, and whilst it may look like we're destroying the Earth, the truth is that we're actually just changing it.However, the greatest strength of Garland's films is his willingness to confront the audience with realistic characters and avoid simple morality tales. To overcome her mirror self, Lena realises she can't defeat her reflection by brute force. Only through an act of guile can she win the day, guile which she has practiced through the deceit of her husband. It's not often we see the hero survive by exploiting character traits the contemporary audience finds unpalatable. It's a simple observation, that deceit is one of our species' most advanced evolved attributes - but it's one we do not like to admit.As for the ending? The prism of The Shimmer is the prism of human interaction. That great generator of invention, the chopping and changing, and cutting and pasting of ideas, thoughts and feelings that makes up the human experience. Lena is Lena, but something new has been added to her. Kane is alien, but some of Kane has been added to him. Both have changed, both have mutated, both have evolved.Annihilation is, in my opinion, one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies ever made. It's a literary film, and recalls the works of Kurt Vonnegut in its use of high-concept sci-fi story-telling as a framework for intimate existential human study. Whilst not as beautifully constructed as 2001: A Space Odyssey, it has a free-form and fluid feeling to it that Kubrick's controlling style prevents. The ending to Annihilation may not be as explicitly profound as 2001, but it's philosophically subtler. More art-house than smart sci-fi in its denouement, Annihilation is closer to the simultaneously enigmatic and visceral styles of Shane Carruth's Upstream Color or Jonathan Glazer's Under The Skin than the beautifully meticulous artifice of Denis Villeneuve as seen in Arrival or Blade Runner 2049. It is, therefore, far more challenging.Paramount did well to pull the film from international cinema markets. It does take a while to get going, and most viewers will lose interest before the pieces come together. It's not really an audience-friendly film, to be honest, and if you've read my review this far and enjoyed the film as much as I did, you're probably, like me, the most pretentious member of your circle of friends. Anyway, whilst I wish I'd had the chance to see it on the big screen in the UK, it would have been branded as a flop and that would have been a great tragedy. In a parallel universe where Oscars are given for artistic merit, this film would sweep the board. If it's lucky, in this one it'll get a handful of token nominations.Thank you Netflix, btw.",Annihilation
545,sukrancetik5,A reflection of the mutations of the cancer cells,7,12 March 2018,"There were interesting aspects of human existence problems. But basically the whole movie about a reflection of the mutations of the cancer cells.
It was like a documentary showing what would happen if the mutations in cancer cells was happening in the world. That was quite interesting perspective indeed. There were a lot of holes in the movie but that was not so important because in real life we don't understand a lot of things as well. Afterwards we will try to make sense about it.

546,MarkoutTV,Nope,5,4 March 2018,"Yeah this one wasn't working for me, dawg.It's been a while since I found myself at such a disconnect between the public and critical view of a movie and my own interpretation. Not since Dunkirk I think.Either way much like that one I can see why people liked this movie and I don't have any issue with the fact people do, it just didn't work for me. There's no real advantage to being the guy who doesn't like the beloved movie and I'm not really in the mood to go into laborious detail to explain why I DON'T like something, hence why most of my detailed reviews are positive as well as most of my reviews in general. I don't want to do this review at all and the least effort I put into it, the better honestly. So I'm just going to do this review in a pros/cons list format.Things I liked about the movie:The environmental effects are really nice.Oscar Isaac was good in it, because he's Oscar Isaac.For the most part, Natalie Portman was good in it.A couple of the tense scenes were indeed quite tension-filled. Two in particular.The first scene where video footage is found of Oscar Isaac's crew descending into madness, complete with a highly disturbing scene of a crew member's stomach being cut open to show that his internal organs are moving.The mutated bear attack scene in the house was freaky, tense and legitimately compelling. If every scene were like that we'd have no problem here.The premise itself, a growing orb likely to consume the world if unchecked, where inside all DNA is refracted and distorted, while not the most unique thing on the planet, is interesting and can be done well, and there were glimpses of it being done well here.The ending (although they basically gave away the surprises 5 minutes before the surprises) was well done and saved me from being truly merciless on the film.Now the bad news:The trailer was bad. It should have ended right before they ENTERED the shimmer. It would have been so much more interesting if the audience came into the movie wondering what was going to be inside. Roland Emmerich has been getting butts into the seats for his terrible films with this style of marketing for years. He can't make movies for the life of him, but he can make trailers. So as someone who saw the trailer multiple times during previews, I fully admit I was put off from the getgo. Then again although I was put off from The Post due to the trailer, I admitted it was better than the trailer made it look, although still not particularly good. But that movie ultimately was tonally different from how the trailer made it seem. With this one, save the ending and a couple details, if you saw the trailer, you saw the movie.It took a bit too long to get into the shimmer. It would have been fine if in the near hour of exposition leading up to it, the film created more interesting characters than just Isaac and Portman, but pretty much everyone else in the movie is disposable... and was disposed of.In my opinion, the acting performances from any of our female leads who's name didn't rhyme with Shmatalie Shmortman, were either unremarkable, or flat-out bad. Unfortunately, I thought Jennifer Jason Leigh, an actor who has been in other movies, and has been good in some of them, fell into the latter portion. She seemed to deliver all of her lines in a sarcastic tone, even when it seemed ill-befitting the moment or worse, unintentional.In the middle of their fight for survival, she finds a video cassette with writing to the effect of ""for those that follow"". Her response: ""Hrmph... I guess that means us."" If I'm in the crew I'm like: ""Not the time for sarcasm, jerkface."" That's what I would say. Jerkface. I'm a badass.Basically all the dialogue in the movie is spoken in whisper, even when they're not in the shimmer. I always find that really annoying in movies. Comes off as pretentious. That's probably a me-only issue but when every line of dialogue is performed in a quiet tone to make them seem meaningful, it takes the drama away from the actual dramatic moments.So much unrealistic dialogue.""In a way it's two bereavements. Losing my daughter, and losing the person I once was"". Nobody. Talks. Like. That.A disturbing video portraying a man having his stomach cut open to reveal his intestines moving around like a snake. Professional medic: ""That was a trick of the light."" There's being in denial and then there's being a moron.Ultimately unnecessary flashback scenes that basically only served as trailer footage. Think the Batman in the desert scene from Batman v. Superman. A few of them provide decent exposition, but most of them were needless.Shephard, recipient of the esteemed ""worst actress in the movie"" award and deliverer of the great ""two bereavements"" line during a scene of exposition vomit on a canoe, is attacked by a mutated bear and very clearly has a 0% chance of survival. However, Natalie Portman declares ""we have to make sure"", just so she can go out on her own and we can get a trailer shot of two white cartoon deer. And the payoff to this scene... HOLY CRAP... she's dead. Speaking of the cartoon deer...Although the environment effects are beautiful, most of the creature effects are anything but. In any scene where there is bright lighting they look cartoonish and not really there. The good bear attack scene was aided by the fact that it took place during the night time. But the stuff with the deers, or the gator attack, didn't look very good.At the beginning, Portman's character is asked what happened to the crew. She says ""I don't know"". She then proceeds to explain exactly what happened to the crew in detail throughout the events of the film.The big monster at the end of it all is a machine that creates clones of people to the tune of weird psychedelic rock music... meh. It's completely superficial of course but just for me personally it was a little bit of a letdown.The scene of Portman interacting with her clone was effective, but why did the clone wait until it had a grenade in it's hands to stop mimicking Portman's movements? Shouldn't it have ran alongside Portman at the same time, ultimately blowing both of them up? I think it would have been a far more effective ending if Portman sacrificed herself in order to kill the threat anyway, but that would have required some actual bravery on the part of the filmmaker.The big bad menace is defeated with a grenade. I wish one of these thriller movies would actually end with a clever way to defeat the monster at the end, not conventional weaponry. Same problem with War of the Worlds. A pretty decent thriller and a threatening menace, and how is it finally taken down? A bazooka. Again, a me problem only. That's why I'm not saying the movie is bad. I'm saying it didn't work for me personally.The final Oscar Isaac video makes it clear that there's a pretty decent chance that he isn't the real one. Kinda takes the piss out of the twist.Maybe it's just the New York City tap water because despite the glowing reviews, in my theater there were a couple walkouts and some chirping of ""this is stupid"" behind me. But me and this film were just never in sync. It came off as a movie desperately wanting to be more smart and meaningful than it actually was. One person clapped. I'm happy for them.",Annihilation
547,Miasmakoala,Pseudointellectual nonsense adventure movie gone beyond bad,2,6 March 2019,"The premise of the movie is that something called The Shimmer has been expanding for three, I repeat, three years in a national park. The officials have sent expeditions in with no one returning except Natalie Portman's husband Oscar Isaac who remembers nothing about it. The Shimmer is like an instagram filter that's begun to remix the DNA of literally everything that's caught in. Lead scientist covering the event explains that it's ""a religious event, an extraterrestial event, a higher dimension - we have many theories, few facts"".I thought this line 15 minutes into the movie was really nice and I had high hopes for this. I can't believe how wrong I was. The further the movie explores the concept, the less sense everything makes. The plot was beyond stupid and if there had been even one single rational person in the movie, this film simply wouldn't exist.If the Shimmer got treated like they handled an extraterrestial threat in, for example, Arrival, it'd be a completely different movie. In Annihilation they just head straight into the Shimmer with a rifle and a backpack. The Shimmer has grown for three years and when they go in there they find out that their radios don't work in there. I'd think they could've tested that during those years pretty easily but who cares about logic, it's just a stupid adventure movie, let's head towards the danger and wait for everything to work out conveniently.Acting ranged from passable to horrible, but especially the dialogue felt really forced and shallow. The only two reasons the characters had anything to say was to 1) wonder how everything is so strange and mysterious 2) to explain the messy plot to the viewer.I love Natalie Portman, Oscar Isaac, Alex Garland and science fiction so I can't understand what went this badly wrong here. It feels like several different people wanted to tell their own story and the end result is such a horrible and silly mess. I'm pretty sure that this movie is going to age like a can of butter that's left outside for the summer.",Annihilation

It gave me expectations but failed to deliver real hard.Visually it's kinda interesting but you can see it's a small production as every trick in the book is used to compensate for the cheap CGI... over saturation, weird blurs... overall very CGI looking CGI. Some things look good, the ""universe"" in itself looks good but to me, it was wayyy too far behind what our eyes are used to these days. A good way to sum up the visuals would be: Avatar fanfiction.The plot is almost original but it's nothing new and feels like déjà vu. They built the film in the ""let's interview the survivor"" way, which imo spoils a lot of itself! Really a bad decision. Plus it feels rushed and the all female cast is questionable. The argument is ""we only sent male military crews, now, we'll send a female scientist crew!""... How about... a military crew escorting scientists? Instead of giving a bunch of PhD females an assault rifle that they clearly can't use. I wanted to make a ""soundtrack"" part but I don't remember a single one so, either there's no music, either it's forgettable. I think there's no music which is fine for this kind of movie but when you have soundtracks like Bladerunner 2049, Interstellar, Dunkirk even... you can't help but think that something is missing. Anyway, in the end it feels like a small production that Natalie Portman has to carry on her shoulders for 100min.

It has a lot of pictures and camera settings. The individual scenes are told leisurely and you take time for each individual setting. It is also noticeable that the figure drawings of every actress, carries a secret that is gradually revealed. This also makes it a bit more exciting for the narrative strand. Alex Garland also understands how to set the special effects to the perfect scene. The effects are very colorful and you can also notice how he is charging the tension. The creatures are very beautiful, although you know that in the next scene you can't trust the beauty. The meaning of life is also a message from Garland. Where we come from and where we go. Unfortunately, Garland sometimes delays the story too much and then waits in vain until Garland comes to the point. Also the actresses are very well selected and you notice that each of the women have a heavy backpack to wear.

It doesn't help that the special effects are surprisingly lackluster, taking you straight back to the middle of the 2000's, with the look and movement of the first digital animal that was introduced being so mediocre that it had me and my girlfriend laughing. On a few imaginative moments the movie reminds you of what it could've been, such as when the double deer appears or when the crew encounter the mutating flowers.

I'm still not quite sure what the point of this film is because after watching, there seemed to be huge focus on the backstory of the main couple that has no payoff whatsoever and huge gaps in the explanation of what is actually happening.Annihilation is very similar to Alien: Covenant in that if this was just a safari through this make-believe world it'd be a smash hit, but unfortunately it was supposed to be a film and if falters at the first hurdle of needing a good and enticing plot. In the same way that Alien: Covenant seems to make lazy plot decisions, Annihilation cleverly avoids that mistake, by making no plot decisions whatsoever and leaves you with a very pretty but fairly dull end product.The big twist ending and the ham fisted ethical questions are laid on so thick that at points they're almost annoying, and some of the acting certainly towards the end is downright cringeworthy. Tessa Thompson's natural charisma is massively underused and her character almost has no point in being there.All of the 'discoveries' made by the team have no lead up or progression, they just happen and have no pushback from anyone else giving you the impression that even the writers themselves didn't actually understand what they were writing. Strange events just happen and then are either forgotten or flogged to death to make a very flimsy point that in the end don't matter because the final 10 minutes is so unbelievably bad that you don't care.Annihilation is like finding your favourite sweet in a Christmas selection box, and then realising it just an empty wrapper.",Annihilation

The first order of business upon navigational disorientation would be to reverse one's steps.
The women went into the Shimmer to get actionable intelligence, but when presented with it, decided to ignore it because of selective ignorance.
Seemingly, a real scientist would grab a sample of something UNUSUAL and of something common AND RETURN HOME IMMEDIATELY (if possible).
The next wave / next trip would be to gain an increased understanding and gather more intelligence.
Also, no one set up a BASE of operations for normalizing the situation.I can't help but feel the ""mutation"" aspect of the creatures/animals also aided in covering up what could be bad CGI.The movie does a poor job of getting us to care about any of the characters, so when they are in peril (or die), it's OK.
We begin to only care about figuring out the puzzle.There is an underlying sense that the situation will return to normal -- that is until the flash-forwarding starts.The viewer never really cares and never really gets closure.There are also logic difficulties.

Accent not on feminist, but on pointless, (although I know everyone who's out for revenge for thousand years male domination, will deliberately misunderstand and will vomit blood on me). I'm not against a feminist movie, I'm against a stupid movie. Why there is an all girl group against the ET, because the male soldiers failed... Would have been too hard to look for a convincing reason? Like genetics, anything along the lines of ""female is the original, male is mutation"" (which is true), so the ET (yes, I won't take seriously that alien), affects female genes differently than male ones. Or any pseudo-science blabla. No, it's because males failed. Please send after every lost battle women to succeed where men did not. How stupid is that?
Still the movie is not all bad, it starts exciting, expectations raise, but in the end it fails miserably. How dumb that ending is? I've seen this (without giving away any part of the plot) like a hundred times in my life. From Wells to Dick to the Astronaut's wife and the list goes on. It is a movie you've seen a lot, with different actors. Typical Hollywood rebranding. That is why I mean this movie is superfluous. A cash in on Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac, but above that utterly pointless.
BTW, if you have money for Natalie Portman, how come you don't have for proper CG. The FX here are from the 90s. Don't misunderstand me, I can live without CG, but here it is so bad (e.g. the rigging of the animals) that is distracts me.

All the performances play effectively in the story, without a bad one in the bunch. The special effects combined with the cinematography is outright gorgeous. The writing is very good, and excellently plays with the premise. The characters are believable, and while occasionally minimalistic, I got enough from them to care about what happened in the story. I really can't think of anything wrong with this one. From the start I was immediately interested, and my interest was sustained throughout the film. This is an extremely unique movie, not like many I've seen. If I had to compare this to any other film I've seen, the one I would point to would be Arrival, which happens to be one of my favorite movies. This is a slow-paced film at times, but I wasn't bored for a minute. By the time it was over I had to give myself some time to really think about what I had seen, and to really ingest it. Both of those points being things I also found when I saw Arrival. After I would come to one conclusion, it wouldn't be too long before I would arrive at a different one. I still can't safely say I'm certain about my conclusion, nor do I think I ever will be. This kind of storytelling can be risky, not every audience member is willing to have a movie lack explicit answers. I however happen to love when a movie demands I think, and if you also do, you might just enjoy this one.

They would have an instant bond and something to relate in each other, but the film makers decided to go a different direction and you have to respect that.

This does not destroy the movie. It makes me think of it after I watched it for longer than I did think about most I saw this year of the lord 2019 and it is December now.
Also almost all female crew - I do not mind. It was not too strongly accented as girls power but still it was a bit of a turn off. Or is it a sign of times to come with patriarchate making place for matriarchate? As said - not too much focus on this in the movie but you cannot avoid to see.
And the ending just fits into a standard hollywood nonsense, so predictable. Multiple other S-F and horror movies did that. That is just below the level I expected.
Still I gave it 6/10 even if the most important part i.e. story was this much garbled. It had a great potential to become a classic. Now it possibly becomes a base for a sequel. What a pity. If you fake things do it with pride and decency or at least with humour. There is no humour here. This is an edge case for me.
Still watched it till the end so not all bad.",Annihilation
591,aperisic,I regret watching this,4,27 January 2019,"The movie is kind of Twilight-Zonish, nobody-knows-why-anything-is-possible. Too early the movie starts being clear about its premise, something is changing our environment.Every Sci-Fi movie is reflecting our fears mixed with out expectations. This one is, well, just practicing it all. There is no real question and there is no real answer. The idea is good but it is neither introduced properly nor resolved, it is just hanging in there from start to finish.Why did I watch this movie? I do not know. The long scene where Natalie has something to fight off, is bad in every sense: meaning, execution, scenography, costumes... I had to switch from rich visuals to TV mode at one point, not being sure what I am looking at exactly, and it was not magical in any sense, it was real 3D something.The movie does not give a purpose to itself, so it remains a student experiment, an unfinished book. What is the director saying in the movie? Overall - nothing.The movie must have much firmer ground than this. The actors cannot just perish as in some sick video game. It all must have some meaning even if it is hidden.This movie is even repeating couple of times that it all has no purpose, no intention, no desire, no ulterior motive at least not the one we could understand but it keeps destroying it all, the life as we know it. Accidentally malevolent force!? Highly developed virus?I am really not sure what to make out of this movie.

592,john-connor-freedomfight,sci-fi at it worst,1,30 March 2018,"First of, I haven't watched the whole movie, I did not need to. In fact I stopped watching at 3 min and 32 seconds. Why? Because it wasn't a sci-fi but a religious thriller. Something I am not interested in at all. When that backward women started to explain her beliefs about how life came to exist in the Universe propagating archaic long disproven pseudo science as science fact, I already knew I would be bored stupid should I force myself to watch even one more minute.I mean had it be labeled a religious horror movie, it might have been great for that genre, for those who like that kind of stuff. I am not one of those. Had I know I would never have started watching it. I simply have no interest in that. Yet since I am a scientist and also love science fiction, I started to watch it until of course it became clear that the viewer is being duped about what this movie is all about.So if you are looking for a scifi movie, save your time. If you on the other hand are a religious person or into horror, read the other reviews to see if it is for you. I cannot answer that.",Annihilation

596,Mikheil-H,"Bizarre, strange but somehow works!",8,28 February 2021,"Coming back from the fantastic Ex_Machina, director Alex Garland presents another science fiction thinking piece packed with mystery and uncertainties. One thing that is certain however, is that this film will be talked about for a long time.Our guide through this world comes in the form of Natalie Portman's Lena, a former solder and biologist, who decides to venture into a mysterious location referred to as ""The Shimmer"", after her husband, Kane (Oscar Isaac) returns as the only survivor of the most recent expedition. From there we are exposed to increasingly imaginative and wonderous visuals the further into ""the shimmer"" we venture. Lena is joined by a physicist (Tessa Thompson's Josie), a psychiatrist (Jennifer Jason Leigh's Dr Ventress) and a paramedic (Gina Rodriguez's Anya) all giving strong performances and adding weight to this rich story. Although based off Jeff VanderMeer's book of the same name, Annihilation diverts from the source material providing twists and surprises for book readers as well as general audiences.Fundamentally, Annihilation is a thinking piece, meaning that it takes a more leisurely pace than other science fiction films. However, this is not a criticism, as what Alex Garland does brilliantly, as with Ex_Machina, is use this leisurely pace to intrigue us further. By that I mean, he presents us with a concept, in this case, the area called ""the shimmer"", he then spends the next 20 or so minutes letting the audience develop questions by telling us the limited information characters already know, such as, the only survivor being Lena's husband. This way, when we delve inside ""the shimmer"" we are in full anticipation of every event and development. As a result, when action does take place, it is gritty, shocking and haunting, especially one particular scene with one of the most ingenious creatures I have ever seen.Whilst I praise the story structure for being expertly laid out, that doesn't mean you will not come away with questions on what you have just seen. However, these are not traditional questions where you are wondering what a character will do next, but more what has the character done? what does that say about humanity? and what was the meaning of certain actions? Annihilation manages to give rise to all those questions whilst still telling a coherent story and being a single, complete film. Thus, despite the book's sequels, this film will not be receiving one, which in the end makes it all the more original and unique in today's movie climate.Annihilation is a must watch for fans of sci-fi or even movies in general. Minor issues involve a subplot with Natalie Portman's character which is by far the weakest aspect, as well as the very first scene, which I feel is not necessary. Other than that, Annihilation is a beautiful, haunting, original tale and is, in my opinion, one of, if not, the best film of 2018 so far. Plus, it's now on Netflix.",Annihilation

Let's talk about it.From the opening shot alone, I knew that this was not going to be a typical sci-fi film. This film has a beautiful asthetic to it while also balancing realistic portrayals of characters.In this movie, Natalie Portman and a group of scientists venture into the shimmer, a barrier that cuts off the outside world. Few people return after going into the shimmer, but when Natalie Portman's husband does, stuff goes wild and that's the only plot summary I will give you.Request: Please don't leave this movie. Several of my audience members did and I felt it so disheartening to see that.Please support Annihilation.

605,sean_pak215,"Decent, but a step back from Ex Machina",6,31 May 2021,"For all the talk about how challenging this may be for mainstream audiences and how it was almost hacked by Paramount and flushed into release sans fanfare, I actually felt like this film was written and filmed more to appeal to a mass audience than Ex Machina. The latter felt more like Garland working out his personal thematic obsessions in his unique way without consideration for traditional forms of entertainment. This film, on the other hand, tried to be more ambitiously trippy but the story asked fewer philosophical questions, and contained a more expository script. Ex Machina, by contrast, told a more enigmatic story which left thoughts and questions of more substance in my mind after the credits. Even the genre trappings here (survival horror) felt like a concession to the mainstream, whereas Ex Machina was harder to categorize. The much-discussed final 20 minutes were also a little too straightforward for me, as visually spectacular and ""trippy"" as they were. But it wasn't the profound enigma that a Kubrick or a Tarkovsky could muster, or even a Jim Jarmusch, Jonathan Glazer or Shane Carruth if we're talking contemporaries. The climax here tried too hard to be some kind of philosophically profound statement, but that's the thing: it felt forced.Complaints aside, I still thought it was one of the stronger and more ambitious mainstream Hollywood science fiction films of recent years, the key word being ""mainstream."" For that alone it deserves some appreciation. The camerawork, set design, performances, soundtrack and overall direction were of high caliber, and I was entertained the whole time. But it still just struck me as a Hollywood affair, which left me with a slight air of disappointment since Garland's previous directorial effort was much more enigmatic and underground-feeling.

607,peterfaure,How to butcher a great novel in less than two hours,5,12 March 2018,"So I will keep this review short.
The movie is overall entertaining, as long as you don't mind a slow pace and prefer suspense over mindless action. It also touches on interesting topics and creates undeniable tension. Overall, more Blade Runner than Star Wars (very different from both in terms of plot though), but I mean it as a compliment.
However, when compared to the novel it was based on (and it's worth noting that the novel was the first in a trilogy rather than the standalone story this movie appears to be), well, it's really just a colossal disappointment.
Some of the elements of the novel are present (the main characters, the shimmer, the lighthouse) but the movie completely changes all of those elements to make them fit a much shorter story that is nothing but a shadow of the novel, considered one of the best SF novels of the last few decades.
I can't go into details without spoiling both the movie and the novel, but let's just say that the movie failed to convey any of the beauty of the novel, cheapened and simplified all the characters and the plot, and really missed on some of the key elements of the novel, elements that made it unique in SF literature.
Comparing this movie to the novel, in fact, is like comparing a light bulb to the sun.

I personally, really enjoy this as an outcome for the film, as again, it's different to most other movie endings; each day we're surrounded by people wanting to know what, why, when, where, who?.. But with this, you don't really get any of that, it presents the audience with the concept that not everything needs a meaning behind it, and that this is just how things are.Watchers that don't understand the movie will likely feel as if their time's been wasted, or mildly irritated by what they've just seen; however that reaction is simply one of someone who feels as though their intelligence has been insulted by something that's just gone over their heads:)",Annihilation

Narrative goes back and forth while we follow Lena's journey to uncover the mystery of the Shimmer, a strange phenomenon that is engulfing an isolated region after her husband returns from it, barely alive. The flashbacks slowly uncover what happened and who are these characters, with excellent acting from all parts and well edited pacing that keeps the audience engaged and respects your intelligence by not explaining what doesn't need to.It's a film in the same vein of Under the Skin or The Arrival, I welcome these new trend of sci fi which is interested in both visuals and substance.

Post credit scene? No.
Not your standard sci-fi flick, Annihilation has a slow but promising start. It is full of excellent performers that give the caliber of performance you'd expect from them - Portman stands out, but the rest of the female ensemble all hold their own while facing their personal demons and also facing a weird, and a seemingly hostile alien landscape invading Earth. Rodriguez is probably the most surprising. From her hair to her attitude she's 100 miles away from Jane Villanueva, the role she's probably most well known for.Stunning visually, yet not quite on par with Avatar's Pandora, it features the same sort of colorful flora and fauna. The score is compelling and well-matched to the film. But ultimately, it loses itself in convoluted science mumbo-jumbo and truly bizarre alien stuff.There are too many plot holes throughout to make a satisfying film. If you're looking for answers, you'll be sorely disappointed in the few if any, you receive. The ""science"" is shoddy at best. Only a few brief lines of dialogue are afforded to explaining the mutations in ""the Shimmer"" and they are unsatisfying and incomplete. It doesn't come off as the sort of movie you would be able to understand if you were just a little smarter, or a bit more well-read, instead it seems as if the issues it has are largely narrative. The screenplay purposefully doesn't give enough information and rather than feeling bogged down by too much science and explanation, we were distracted by the lack of it.The film just - got too weird too fast. And there wasn't enough good in it to make up for that. We're all for strong female ensemble films. We're all for talented WOC playing scientists and doctors. We're also all for smart and well-written sci-fi. This just didn't deliver.",Annihilation

Enter Annihilation, a classic example. In fact, the acting in this film is pretty good, the story is reasonable but above all, the vision, concept and style of the film is where this pushes it well above your average sci fi horror flick.The scary/action sequences were almost certainly the points of the film that were the highlights. From that hefty croc beast to the awesome lighthouse sequences towards the end of the film. Not forgetting the scene where they're tied to chairs by Anya, before the entrance of that mutant bear; this is one of the more intense scenes you'll come across in recent film releases. My absolute favourite part is probably when Dr Ventress explodes - just spectacular; and this whole sequence was quite clearly nailed by the production team.The soundtrack was suitably dystopian, oddly beautiful and weird.On the concept - I liked how we learnt more about the shimmer as the film
went on. Teased at each significant event with something else the shimmer does - both to humans or whatever resides within it.So if you want some weird sci fi delivered in a fantastic visionary style, look no further than Annihilation.",Annihilation

This movie is predictably about an alien invasion which created a shimmer like area which is ground zero for the military and scientist if anybody goes there nobody returns you are getting the sense of other movies yes you are right but that's where the similarities end and the real danger real original concepts starts to kick in. This is a nature vs nurture story and its very allegorical in the sense we are constantly tampering with the nature that's how mutation happens and can lead to fatal disasters it's a plague that can wipe out humanity and the newer ones will take place so that the new renaissance happens that's a dark theory i am just getting from this movie maybe I will be wrong anyone can give there perceptions of this movie. The cells regenarate and can mutate to so much infinite level that we will die someday that's the human flaw that's the start of the movie. So the extraterrestrials happens to come to earth and wants to evolve into something that will be infinite just like the cells but the hybrid of humans and aliens can merge but the cells will have a flaw, talking about flaws it's a story of human tendencies everyone is flawed and that trait drives thoroughout the movie the men never returned cause they get twisted by the shimmer and why the lead returned cause she has a pateince a aim to come home but with her own nefarious tendencies the flawed behaviour and the passion for finding something leads to her victory and eventual disastrous fate at the end. Maybe it's open ending I don't know and then comes the direction this is jaw dropping stuff Alex garland just nails the cosmic horror elements he is a knack for creating disturbing reality which wil feel real for the audience and the vfx is stunning for shoestring budget it's just dues ex machina happened oh right his debut film was ex machina getting it I just gave a referencial element to my review nevertheless this is the best horror sci fy of the decade.

Touches upon sci-fi film making from another era, yet uses modern film production to realise an alternative, fantastical world.I'm not a horror fan, but happy to be unnerved in this case.The cast were great. Soundtrack was a good fusion of styles.Having seen it only once so far, I cannot say I understood all elements (especially in the final third), but as other reviews have mentioned, this film stuck with me for days after. Believe it or not, I don't feel the need to to understand all of it, because this is a story about meeting something we may have little concept in understanding fully anyway. Have a watch, I hope you enjoy it.",Annihilation

633,3Lina3,Makes little sense but beautiful in a ''cancerous'' and self-destructing way,8,1 September 2018,"What did I understand about this movie? It's a story about relationship and changing. It's psychological, personal and interpersonal.I don't want to make a lot of sense from it, I was just feeling it and ''inhailing'' the beautiful imagery. Yeah, Natalie Portman and people behind this movie are sometimes more pretentious than they're supposed to be. I didn't find that annoying though because I liked that world of psychological and physical self-destruction and depression.

634,bettetojason,Doesn't come close to living up to it's potential,4,15 December 2019,"The idea of this film seems like it's completely original... an otherworldly realm to be explored and survived on it's search for the truth behind it's existence... I'm assuming there are earlier films with similar plots (seems like there has to be), but I can't really recall any quite like this.This film had a lot going for it, the director did the understatedly clever ""Ex Machina"" prior to this, a mega-budget this time around and a pretty decent cast with the always reliable Jennifer Jason Leigh as a co-star... but the ideas failed to be as riveting as they could have been, continuity errors and really, really stupid decision making (why did they only ""blackout"" at the beginning?... would've been much better if the memory loss was reoccurring, and ""why would they post someone at guard at ground level when they could be guarding the stairwell to the ladder from above??... idiotic, and some of them are supposed to be smart)The ""action scenes"" obviously had a lot of $$ put into them, and tremendous CGI quality for the special effects... but the plot was severely lacking with the aforementioned continuity errors... it doesn't make the most out of it's opportunities... it wasn't scary at all and the ending (although again, special effects are great) was just dumb and pretentious, doesn't seem to flow well and ideas just seem trite.Too bad, it could have been great... it really goes to show that these Hollywood 'mega-productions' rarely seem to get it right.4.5/10",Annihilation
635,leonthesleepy,It melted my brain in the best way possible,10,13 March 2018,"I dont think its possible to describe the final 30 minutes of Annihilation and do it justice, which is the best compliment i can give it. As a piece of visual storytelling, Annihilation blows it out of the water. Garland's latest work pushes the boundaries of mainstream cinema by offering a film that is so unapologetic in its vision, you cant help but applaud. Not since Arrival (2016) has a film captured my attention so completely and left me so consistently in awe.I mean what else can i say without spoiling it. The performances are great. The female representation is fantastic. The visual effects and design should get nominated if not outright win. If you love sci fi, then you need to watch this immediately on the largest screen you can find. This is a wholly original piece of work, that will likely draw wildly different opinions and interpretations.",Annihilation
636,aubuchon,Basic Horror Film with Grandiose Metaphysical Window Dressing,5,24 February 2018,I love sci-fi more than any other genre but this is not it. This movie's basic structure is horror with a metaphysical flare. There is one scene where a bear attacks and removes the front part of the head of a living human being. Another scene has an actor setting himself ablaze with a phosphorus grenade. I went into this movie expecting a mind-bending and wondrous adventure but it was a grueling 2 hours of torture. Basic recipe of the movie follows horror genre to a T. Each character gets killed off one at a time. We think the culprit is dead at the end only to find out in the closing scene that it still lives instantly letting us know that a sequel is in order.The production and acting was great. The storyline is ambiguous at best but the horror aspect overshadowes everything else.,Annihilation
637,bighalsy,Snoring boring....,1,19 March 2018,"The only thing that works for this flick are the visuals which are pretty stunning. Everything else falls down like dominoes. There is no real story, per se. And what there is is poorly written. This is a riff on Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now. They were going for the long slow burn - descent into madness - but it just comes off as boring an unintelligible with plot holes big enough to drive a 747 through.The ending of the film is completely unsatisfying, like the entire rest of the film. And why they even think they needed to dabble in diversity politics is beyond me seeing as there was no point to any of it anyway.This film falls squarely into that category of film which is, 'Well, there's 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.' As a wiser man than I once said, 'Enjoying wasting time isn't time wasted.' And that is true. Except in cases like this where it isn't enjoyable and really is just wasted time.",Annihilation

We tend to see what we want to see and save our best arguments to convince ourselves.This movie's most redeeming quality was that it wasn't as big a disappointment as ""Blade Runner 2049"". This wasn't a sequel to a great movie, ""Annihilation"" was just a movie that perhaps tried to hard to be artsy. It also seemed confused about what sort of movie it wanted to be.There were holes of reality throughout. Like when the women were walking across the field to enter the shimmer, it was as if they were on a day hike, not the nations team to save the world. There was no support team, no new technology to communicate or stay alive, no instrumentation to record data, no large team tracking them or giving last minute instructions. I wouldn't even start as to why they sent these four women into the shimmer. Why would anyone sent these problem ridden individuals into such a vital mission.
I could go on and on. In case you haven't guess the artsy comments are about the last part of the film and especially the painful scene where the other being mirrors Portman's every move. When this movie ended, I thought the premise was good, but it could have been soooooo much better.",Annihilation

642,malthenielsen,The Annihilation of a meaningful story,1,19 June 2018,"This movie could have been good - but was terrible. Some mainstream movies have their characters behave like teenagers in slasher movies, regardless of them officially being scientists or master assassins or whatever. I see the reason for this; in horror movies, the characters need to interact with ""the dangerous thing"", and if the characters act efficiently and have ressources, it turns into an action movie. So characters are dumbed down, in order to make them less efficient. The price of this, is that you get nonsensical characters, like clueless scientists.So. The US army found this alien shimmer that expands in a zone, and they think it threatens the entire world. They have zero date from the zone. There's no reason to belive the expansion will continue indefinitely; it might just stop. It is cautious to assume it will keep expanding. This is not adressed at all. The scientists just go ""it expanded yesterday, so it will keep doing so forever."" Instead of using the not neglible ressources of the US Army - nuke the alien, send in entire bataillons in Apache Helicopters, or just send teams inside the bad zone for half an hour, gather data and then retreat to return the data - just go in, grab some plants and soil samples, go out.Instead they go for the worst option imaginable; send small teams deep inside for long expeditions, thereby ensuring none will survive and bring data back. So for THREE years the US army is just watching the bad thing do it's thing and do nothing. A sane person with 10 people working for him could have gotten more information, than the US army got in three years.So. The team with the heoine on it goes inside the zone. It is an all-female team, I guess because of current tropes. They are supposedely soliders, but carry no useable military gear in the large backpacks they probably just use to show ""look it is so army-like because of the large backpacks."" They have nothing with them - booby traps, mines and such - that helps them tp secure a camp in a very hostile environment. Now who'd have thought that could have been useful, everybody else that went in died, but well, that probably means all they need is tents and guns and no mines! The team makes no sense. Why not add 10 marines to take care of them? I guess marines are so expensive: The entire world is threatened, but the US army doesn't want to waste marines on this. The team furthermore seems to have no real command structure or any routines, some team members do not know the goal of the mission, some have not bothered to look at a map of the area. At one point they sleep in a gigantic complex, potentially shot full of monsters, and do not bother to do the ""secure the area""-thing soldiers love to do. Oh and it's not like it would be useful that everybody had a map, in a place where everybody else had died! Nobody could foresee you might end up alone, having no clue where you are! At the end the team leader just leaves her team, and makes nothing out of the whole ""I am supposed to order you guys to make this mission happen"", she is OK-doky that the others feel like disobeying orders. A team member is killed by a bear, no serious rescue mission is attempted, one team member afterwards wanders off alone (well why bring more people to cover you, it's better to send just one person while the others hand around and chill). They find a video with information of what is going on; they just watch it fast and then argue about what was in the video. Oh yes, it's not like it would be useful in saving your lived and such to understand the video, really, why waste 20 seconds of your life watching it a second time? Who needs information in a place where everybody dies from unknown reasons?Now let me jump to the end. The hero saves the world, yet when she gets back to base, the commanders seem angry and suspicious of her. Why are they not happy that she saved the world? Did they want to include the ""parents unfairly angry with teenager""-trope. I figure that if a soldier saves the world, this is the sort of thing that should make commanders happy, and give the soldiers medals. But in this movie, commanders get angry if you succeed. They sent her on what they thought was a suicide mission, yet appear suspicious/perplexed about the fact that her team members died? Are these commander guys like ""we send people on suicide mission, but do not understand why anybody would die on this dangerous suicide mission! Foul play!""At the end of the movie the heroine's husband is obviously an alien clone/copy of her real husband. She hides this from the commanders - because she is happy to have an alien copy of her dead husband? As a scientist, she should realize, that the alien will most likely eat her or infect her with something (that's what the aliens have been doing!), but who cares in a movie that thinks scientists = idiots. I also doubt that normal people would appreciate alien copies of their loved ones!It is interesting that older movies have handled these issies well. ""Stargate"" has a scientist/military team that acts like a scientists/military team, and not as ""team confused teenager"". ""Stolen Bodies"" has people reacting believable to alien clones of their loved ones. A plethora of movies has believable military debriefings. It's not hard to do these hings well, yet this movie failed.",Annihilation

You're focusing too much on the content and not the context. Science tries to create models of consciousness, but it's never going to work. You cannot do science without language and without concepts. It's a second order. You see the problem is you're trying to use a second order phenomenon to get at the first order. You got it backwards. The tricky thing about the implicit is that it cannot be pointed to because it holds all the pointers. Imagine if you were Mario from Super Mario. Now...can Mario use his finger to point at the pixels of the screen? No, because Mario is in a sort of dimension which is tangential to the pixels. Mario doesn't know about the pixels, he's made out of the pixels in the same way that my hand right now is inside consciousness. So my finger cannot point to consciousness because the finger itself cannot point outside it because it's made out of the pixels. No matter where Mario points, he's never going to be able to point out, because he's made of pixels. It's like your the fish, but consciousness is the water.",Annihilation

From its grand themes to its petrifying atmosphere, Annihilation is an illumination that takes its audience to parts unknown. The literal, psychological and spiritual are seamlessly woven together through elite writing, direction and editing. Like a true sci-fi, this film takes its time to carefully build its characters, environment and subtext while submerging its viewers in visuals that won't soon be forgotten. Some may question moments of overdone acting or unclear writing but, when dealing with a project this purposeful, those complaints can be excused.Annihilation truly excels because it's intention is unwavering. The slow pace, dramatic scoring and detailed effects are all geared towards the common cause of immersing its audience into an alien land, making the bizarre familiar. Not only does this create an electric experience but it also contributes to the overall message of the film. In the end, everything comes together so masterfully that Annihilation is indisputably a triumph. From elite shot selection to unforgettable sound, Annihilation is one of the better movies around this year.Writing: 9/10

We see the main characters at the end who may or may not be ""changed."" By that I mean not 100% sure if they are alien copies or original people with modified DNA. I think there are some original ideas. There isn't a purposeful attack/hostility from the ""shimmer"" until then very end. I think that's important. Maybe that is why it is hard to understand...

Hmmm, Claustrophobic like Predator (1st one), Alien (1st) where you don't know at first what is 'after you', and almost Stanley Kubrick like like 2001: Space Odyssey where you don't know where or when you are in time. Just watch it! It also will make you jump at least once or twice which is always fun. As of late we see #OscarsSoWhite or females complaining there aren't enough films with powerful females in the lead! All 5 leads in the film are female and do a fantastic job in their roles! If Hollywood wants to promote more female leads in their movies then start writing movies like Annihilation!! It took me until the next morning to finally figure out the ending which was kind of puzzling to me when it first ended. But I figured out the ending and it finally made sense. No spoilers of course by house rules! I gave this film a 10 out of 10 and I'm a male that loves sci-fi and horror movies of good quality, acting, special effects, characters and story.

651,ilozzoli,Florida Stalker,8,28 April 2019,"Lena is a biology professor, ex-soldier, and wife of Kane, a soldier, who is regularly away from home on secret missions. She cheats on him; he finds out, and volunteers for a mission that no one has ever returned from. He enters the Shimmer - a weird alien area, much like the Zone in Tarkovsky's Stalker. He returns after a year, but something is not right, so Lena also volunteers, and enters the Shimmer with a five-member all girl team.Annihilation is a mind bending experience. If you get the vibe, you will probably want to watch it one more time. But you may end up hating it, because it is not the kind of story you typically expect from a sci-fi. There is a mysterious, alien area in the movie, depicted brilliantly using great pictures and CGI, but the story is centred on a journey inside our minds (again, just in case of the Stalker). The Shimmer, as it is explained in the movie, is a bit like a tumour: it reshuffles/mixes the structure of everything - crystals, genes, and even mental processes - and so speeds up change enormously. Why would one want to enter such a dangerous zone? Because it is part of our nature, Ventress, a psychologist explains. Most people have self-destructive tendencies: if something is fine with our lives, we cannot be happy with it, we want to change it.But while we can never be fully satisfied with what we have, and regularly look for something new - a change, we are also frightened of change. Potentially, because we feel that if we change, we are no longer ourselves. As Ventress puts it at the end of the movie, ""Our bodies and our minds will be fragmented into their smallest parts until... not one part remains - annihilation"". So that would be my read on the movie: our constant thirst for, and fear of change, and the tension this constant struggle creates in our minds.In the very last scene the couple meet again. ""Are you Kane?"" she asks; ""I don't think so"" he answers. ""Are you Lena?"" is the final line in the movie. She is probably not. They have changed, and this might help them to move on. Tarkovsky's Stalker is about ultimately everything staying as it was before, why Garland's Annihilation is about ultimate change. I am not sure which vision is actually closer to reality.",Annihilation

In its visual creativity, too, this film represents extraordinary things in arresting and interesting ways. I will simply say that if you are intrigued by films which evoke a real sense of awe, wonder, fascination and dread, representing the unearthly in truly thoughtful and interesting ways, check this film out.

You don't have a lot of time before the phenomenon grows even larger - and possibly becomes uncontainable - and you still have no idea what it is. What do you do? A) Send in another team - perhaps a larger, better-trained, better equipped Spec-Ops team that is hard-wired to a team sitting on the perimeter, or, B) Send in four chunkalicious regular gals ... because ... y'know, if a team of highly trained soldiers can't do it - four Diversity Divas sure can!You can guess which one they pick in Annhiliation.First, the good: There are a few cool/creepy concepts and some nice visuals in Annihilation ... one in particular that will stick with you for a while, I bet. Cinematography, acting, sound, score, visuals, FX are all pretty good - nothing distracting, anyway. *Overall* the story is pretty engaging and kept my interest.The not so good: Once again, what was a potentially decent idea/story is completely destroyed by Leftist Propaganda mixed with a generous helping of stupid. Feminist component? Check. Homosexual component? Check. White woman cheating on her husband with a black man? Check. Forced People of Color component? Check. Incompetent/Crazy white men? Check. Then, you get to the stupid: These women are supposed to be ""combat-trained"", yet are utterly laughable with their weapons handling and tactics. Muzzle discipline is cringe-worthy. They don't work as a team and they make ridiculous tactical decisions (like one going off on her own to search for a missing team member). They didn't bother to bring flashlights or weapon lights .... but they brought a powerful microscope! They're supposed to be documenting what they find, yet nobody is taking pictures or video - or even field notes. Their night watch (LP/OP) is set up in the middle of a field, and the person manning it is sitting there with a lantern blazing away. I'll stop there - you get the idea.So, is it worth watching? I'd say ""yes"" if you don't have to pay to see it. It's an OK ""shut-your-brain-off-for-2-hours"" kind of movie (if you can ignore the SJW garbage).

This barrier appears to be expanding in size, and affecting whatever gets caught in it a number of beautiful, gruesome, and beautifully gruesome ways. Barring one exception, no one and nothing that has crossed into The Shimmer has returned to talk about it. Lena, a biologist with an inner desire for redemption based on occurrences not immediately known to the audience, joins Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and three other women of various scientific backgrounds (Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, and Tuva Novotny) in what would appear to be a suicide mission into this fantastical mass of lush landscapes and frightening creatures in hopes to collect data on what exactly is the cause of this phenomenon. Any further discussion of the plot would delve too deep into spoiler territory, and a film like this deserves to be seen with as little known about it as possible, so as not to ruin any potential surprises. This is a film that's at its most fun when you, along with the actresses onscreen, are gradually unraveling layers of mystery not only regarding The Shimmer, but their own psyche. Annihilation, loosely based on the Southern Reach trilogy by Jeff VanderMeer, is a slow, ambiguous, yet visually and thematically arresting film that easily rivals the quality of director Alex Garland's previous film, Ex Machina. Though he has seen modest success in the screenwriter's role for many years now (The Beach, 28 Days Later, Dredd), Garland's prowess has proven to translate well from paper to screen in the director's chair. Many quiet and intimate moments are had here as a number of challenging questions are posed and largely left open for interpretation. For this reason, Annihilation-- for all its strong points-- will lead to be a rather polarizing film. That's not to excuse every instance of these quieter scenes; there are time jumps in the film that largely feel unnecessary, especially ones involving a subplot between Lena and one of her coworkers.Those who see the trailer and expect an excess of gunplay and violence for the film's two hour running time may feel this movie to be lacking, but filmgoers who can appreciate a deliberate pace should welcome those quiet parts, as it is that deliberate pace that makes the inevitable moments of horror and despair all the more gripping. There is little to prepare you for just where this film is headed, and when things get horrifying, those moments stick with you. One particular sequence involving one of The Shimmer's dangerous wildlife should provide ample amounts of nightmare fuel for an unsuspecting audience. The haunting soundtrack does well to compliment the dazzling special effects at work here, the latter made possible by the same FX team behind Garland's aforementioned directorial debut, Ex Machina. Fans of more intelligent science fiction should not want to miss this film while it is still in theaters. Annihilation is a movie that deserves to be supported, not dumped out onto Netflix as soon as possible by a faithless studio. And while the slow pace may be considered too slow for some, it is a journey into the surreal that is well worth taking, and should make for quite the conversation piece long after the end credits roll.",Annihilation

There are some deeper, intertwined topics hinted at throughout the film, which may be interpreted as you will, some will see them... some will not !?
I say it's ""A Marmite Movie"" simply because the reviews seem to be at opposite ends of the ""love/hate"" rating scale.

Right at the start of the mission they go on site (dangerous poisoned zone) at foot without gaz mask. Many days of walk. Any kind of mission like this is done in 15 min with an helicopter and parachute. They go there on foot and confront all the dam dangerous things one by one (a group of scientific women backed by the army without any material to study the zone. They just have guns.....LOL).

665,mrwickedproductions,Horrifically disappointing,6,5 March 2018,"The intriguing trailer with ""The Alien"" melody sold me on watching Annihilation in theaters instead of waiting for it to appear on Netflix. The synthesized notes promised an eerie, captivating, and horrific journey into Alex Garland's adaptation of the first book of the ""Southern Reach"" trilogy. And horrific is right. Horrifically disappointing.
 
The film follows Lena (Natalie Portman) and fellow scientist/volunteers into a mysterious ""Shimmer"" that changes the land it encroaches upon. All of the previous military volunteers that have entered are never heard from again, except for Lena's husband (Oscar Issac). In order to save her husband from mysterious health problems, Lena joins a group of scientists to study the ""Shimmer"" and reach its core at the lighthouse. Interestingly enough, the group is all female, which reflects our current climate of the all female dream team (Ghostbusters, Ocean's). The film has a great cast with amazing performances, blah blah blah. Okay, now that we got that out of the way, let's get to the negatives.
 
In the ""Shimmer,"" the group makes groundbreaking discoveries, while attempting to survive. But the film digs its own grave when it comes to caring about the characters and building suspense due to its opening, which shows Lena post journey out of the ""Shimmer"" being interviewed by scientists. She mentions who dies, who goes missing, and the very fact that she's there in a lab room confirms that she survives as well. So scenes later where danger is imminent, we already have a good idea as to what will happen. Talk about fun.
 
When we compare Annihilation with Alex Garland's previous sci-fi film, Ex Machina, the flaws become obvious. Unlike Ex Machina, Annihilation is not focused. It's an adventure, drama, fantasy, horror, mystery, and thriller. There's the aches of love, the influence of psychology, the beauty of evolution, the creation of monsters, the existence of aliens, and the crisis of existence. The film spreads itself too thin, with more ambitious topics than there are baddies in Spider-Man 3. I would rather watch a story that delves into one or two of these ideas, than try to tackle many parts of a different whole.
 
Like Arrival (which is a much better alien mystery), Annihilation relies on several twists of its own. But compared to the weight that they're given, the twists don't hold enough impact or surprise. You could even say that the final twist is a failed attempt at an Inception like ending. With Inception, viewers are so engrossed with the dream world and its implications that the twist of whether Leo's character is still in a dream or not comes naturally. In Annihilation, a question is asked in the end which falls flat on itself like a teenager trying to sound deeper than s/he actually is. The question shouldn't have been asked. It easily takes away the buildup of the final scene and makes the whole ending laughable.
 
David Ellison, financier at Paramount, was concerned that the film was ""too intellectual"" and ""too complicated"" and wanted changes to be made to appeal to a broader audience (in order words, dumb it down). I couldn't disagree more, not for the same reasons as the director, but because there's nothing complicated about the film. Intellectual? Sure, it deals with science. But the actual science within the ""Shimmer"" is completely fictional and relies on the entertainment value to make any of it believable. Complicated? Now that's just an insult to moviegoers. Although don't be surprised if you run across several people who bought into the film as though-provoking. On the surface, it's shrouded with stupendous fantasy. But at its very core, like the one in the ""Shimmer,"" it is as purposeless as the alien that lives there.

668,jelstudio,I think the bad reviewers missed the painfully obvious.,9,16 December 2020,"So this movie has gotten lots of bad reviews, mostly from people who judged it as a scifi-movie but apparently missed what this movie was apparently about.This movie is about infidelity. It's that simple.You have a married couple. 2 people who love each other.That's the single cell that splits into 2 similar cells.Then an alien comes and corrupts this unity.Or perhaps a mutation makes one part of the happy couple seek something on the side.The movie doesn't say which of those 2 it is.Anyway, the alien is the lover. The foreign entity that makes the 2 cells become different.Does the lover come to destroy the happy marriage? No, but it changes it into something new.How so?Well, when the 2 parties in the happy couple discovers the infidelity and later comes to terms with it... then they are 2 changed people. 2 new people. Not the same couple as before.That is Kane and Lina.All those happy couples who do NOT survive the infidelity... are all those who become the mutated animals and plants and, well, dead things we see.The movie basically explores whether infidelity is done freely or is part of human nature itself.This movie is amazingly beautiful and deep.Anyway, that's what I saw in it and I'm not even married.Maybe I got it completely wrong... or maybe all those who gave it bad reviews got it wrong. Watch it (At least twice or a few more times, since it's not an easy film) and make up your own mind about my interpretation of it.The only reason I can't give it 10, is because I'm a romantic and hate the idea of infidelity. But it's so close to a 10, since the 2 sharing real love (Kane and Lina) did get each other in the end.Maybe going for the affair is just a human impulse people can't really avoid going for at some point in a long-standing relationship. Neither good nor evil, but simply part of human nature. Maybe that is what Ventress speaks about when she talks about self-destructive impulse.I thought the clues to this story were abundant throughout the entire movie, but maybe I saw a different copy than all of those giving bad reviews :)

Not unlike Ex-Machina, Alex Garland impressed his style into this film which I find very appealing. His movies have a certain flavour to them which seems to capture my attention in a macabre way.
He brings the best out in his actors, which is essential for weird movies. How many times have you seen a weird movie and thought, ""Ugh, the acting is terrible!"" And the entire film is a joke. Not so with this film. Natalie Portman is wonderfully serious, Jennifer Jason Leigh is creepy and distant, the rest of the characters all portrayed well by their respective actors.
The concept of the ""off-worldyness"" itself is unique so there was a large margin of error I was willing to grant, despite the plot holes.

The ""Bird Box"" effect seems to be spreading like some viral plague across the inflicted biosphere of genre filmmaking. You don't have to have a solid concept, just some gimmick and a whole bunch of moronic characters stumbling around for 100 minutes.
Such is the case with Annihilation, a film so laden with pot holes it makes the streets of uptown New Orleans seem pristine by comparison. An object plummets from space and hits a lighthouse and immediately begins mutating everything in its path as it spreads across the countryside. ""Scientists"" and ""doctors"" set up a base to study the ""Shimmer zone"" and apparently keep sending idiots into the zone and of course, they never return. Except one guy who comes back, goes to his house, talks to his wife, and then starts spitting up blood and writhing in agony. Govt. spooks swoop in and take him and his wife to the base where it is determined that he's had massive organ failure and internal bleeding and she theorizes it could be a virus or radiation. So what does his doctor wife do? She goes on a mission with a few other women into the shimmer zone. No hazmat protection, nothing. Only rifles. There they encounter weird plants and animals which are being mutated by the force within the shimmer zone and they find a memory card with video showing some eel-like creature inside of one of the previous explorer's guts, to which one of the women shouts ""It's a trick of the light! It's not real!"" And she proceeds to be a complete idiot until her thankful death midway through this fiasco.

I definitely was close to checking out around the middle point, but quickly my interest was piqued and in the blink of an eye the movie turned into a profound, 2001 meets Under The Skin meets Predator surreal science fiction near- masterpiece.The first half is so patiently mediocre that the second half almost feels like a completely different movie, making the movie a mixed bag but one that's totally worth it. Some of the performances are great, some are okay, and at least one is noticeably bad. Natalie Portman turns in a great performance (she carries the entire film) and Jennifer Jason Leigh gives a reserved and underplayed angle to a well worn out archetype. The side characters however, like Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson, are mostly annoying and sometimes border on being simply bad. Oscar Isaac is very good. Most of the technical choices are good. The cinematography isn't particularly flashy but it captures the world behind the shimmer in all of it's messed up glory (the last twenty minutes are truly a thing to behold). The music choices are also a mixed bag. Soft strum guitar comes in at random intervals and doesn't really work, but the dark, brooding thump of a certain synth track really gives you a sense of cosmic horror. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'm going to leave it at that. Go support this movie, even if it isn't perfect.

We are brought into dream-like world that does not care for the organisms that inhabit it, but just exists -- it can be considered as much of a waking daydream as a nightmare. And just like its big brother Cloud Atlas, I feel that Annihilation does not get the credit it deserves, but should be analyzed in film school as a ground-breaking instalment in its genre. The only reason I don't give it a 9 is because of the drawn out back-story between the main protagonists, which seems a little forced at times and doesn't add as much to the story (unless there's a sequel).",Annihilation

I thought about this movie for hours and after letting it digest and making sense of the deeper meanings and themes, I really came to appreciate and love this movie. (The ATZ Show has a really good explained video on Youtube that will completely change the way you look at the movie.) I watched Annihilation again today because this is one of those movies that requires a second viewing - there was so much that I missed and I can confidently say that this is is arguably my favorite movie of 2018.First of all, there's no denying that this film is simply beautiful. The way it's shot, the scenery.. fantastic. Also, this movie is extremely original, I've never seen anything like it before and I love it when a movie offers something new. A few more adjectives that come to mind to describe this movie are immersive, intense, creepy, emotional at parts, trippy at others, there's just so much to appreciate in this movie.What really elevates the movie for me however is all of the deeper meanings, themes, and symbolism that are going on beyond the surface plot. This is a movie with many layers that really makes you think, and people can interpret it in many different ways. That being said, this movie is definitely not for everyone... if i were to judge it solely by my first immediate reaction, I would rate it much lower, maybe 3.5 stars.

686,ModishMovies,Thought-Provoking and Demanding a Re-Watch,8,26 February 2018,"After Alex Garland's first film, Ex Machina showed me that true science fiction in cinema is not dead, I was looking forward to yet another sci-fi film by him. Whether you like both of his films or not, you can't say that they are worthless and poorly-crafted. Whether or not you liked this film, you should be able to appreciate this on a technical/visual level. If Ex Machina proved anything, Annihilation further reinforces the idea that cinema is true art if it makes viewers contemplate it or look for meaning in it themselves. There are enough plot summaries here, so I will not be adding to that list. Instead, I will tell you that the story is excellently-paced and moves quickly after being gripped instantly by one of the opening shots. The set-up to the film perfectly balances the mystery surrounding this bubble-like layer called ""The Shimmer"" (*cue overwhelming, disorienting synth sound*) and the confusion of what happened to lead to a specific scene. We are told just enough to not lose interest in what's happening, but not enough to be able to predict what will happen next. This allows Garland to brilliantly keep viewers on the edge of their seats during scenes that would have been too comfortable and enjoyable had the suspense and intrigue not been built up so effectively. The only flaws that I have with this film are with the characters and their development. During the first half, the characters develop at a great pace and I felt that I would truly get to know each main character emotionally and psychologically by the end of the film. However, after three important characters are given good backstories and emotional attachment is built to them, no more characters are elaborated on for the rest of the film, which caused me to not become as invested as I could have been in the rest of the characters' fates. Alex Garland is very skilled at developing the characters that he does. Part of the reason that Ex Machina worked so well was that there were so few characters, so you really got into all of their psyches and personalities by the end. Annihilation develops certain major characters flawlessly, but forgets other major characters that could have helped the story feel more emotional. The visuals in this film are absolutely incredible and stand out almost as much as the thought-provoking ending. If you weren't engaged in the story, the visuals will keep your eyes glued to the screen. The cinematography and lighting of scenes that take place in The Shimmer are well-composed and beautiful. The effects are made to look more unbelievable and crazy as opposed to Ex Machina, where the visual effects make a real person look like an unrealistic, real person. Even though February is barely over, I would strongly consider this a contender for the Best Visual Effects award at the 2019 Oscars.This film will keep me thinking about it and pondering its meaning until another film with an intellectual meaning as strong as this one replaces it, which isn't very common. Would you rather forget an enjoyable, simple movie or remember a challenging, memorable film? If you answer to the latter, this film is certainly for you. 8.5/10",Annihilation

Dir: Alex GarlandSynopsis: Basically you have a biologist (Natalie Portman) goes into a force field known as the shimmer. No one knows what it is or where it came from. A crew of scientists (all female) journey into the shimmer to see the cause and do research.Okay so this one was extreme. I'm not sure if I would consider this a perfect film (in my standards) but this is def one of the better ones I've seen so far this year. And I really really enjoyed it even though it's a bit of a slow burning flick. If I had to classify this one I would say somewhat of a cross between a horror/sci-fi and an art film. Sci-fi films like this you can't really tell from the trailer what it is based around but right from the rip you get a look at what is starting the conflict in he film. As the film progresses it uses the flashback point of interest theme, so as an example you'll get a scene where the characters will start a convo about something and the main character will have a flash back explaining the convo or subject. There are scenes and themes that are a bit disturbing so those with a weak stomach beware but then there are scenes that are elegant and beautiful. The added themes of horror and creature/monster give the thrill and suspense a nice touch. You think you know the ending until you get a quick twist in the last scene. Something to keep in mind is that it is a MIND BENDING film so even if you watch it twice you probably won't completely understand it. There are parts of the film that are essential and if you don't pay close attention or if your not a biologist you won't understand what is going on. Re watch? Definitely would. If your a fan of sci-fi or mind bending films it's really worth the watch.",Annihilation
689,cliffordo-33234,What's the Sound of One Hand Clapping,8,15 June 2018,"Visually, this movie is great. The lighthouse scene at the ending is very surrealistic. It reminded me a little of the ending in Kubrick's 2001. The science-fiction horror aspect reminded me of 'The Thing.' The bear is genuinely horrifying and creepy. It is a little more intelligent than 'The Thing' in that it isn't so obviously good guys against bad guys. But then, maybe it is a little too intelligent. It left me wondering wtf and running to find another video where somebody explains the movie to me. It think that it goes too far with being enigmatic because it loses some of its visceral impact in the process. It deals with some very interesting themes. The human instinct for self-destruction, and our sense of identity and the unity of life. I have a lot of respect for a movie production that is willing to sacrifice box office in order to be intelligent. However, a week after seeing the movie and thinking about it, I basically had to concede that it just didn't quite make sense to me, and then I have to wonder if the director just wasn't quite able to close the deal with his audience. So I can understand why many viewers probably feel frustrated and frankly offended by it. That was the way that I felt when I watched 'The Arrival.' If you have to watch a movie ten times in order to understand it, then the movie is not communicating effectively enough. It becomes like the Zen koan, 'What's the sound of one hand clapping.'

If a phenomenon like this actually occurred, it would be the focus of world attention. It would be major. It would be viewed as a possible threat to the planet, and humankind. The United States, which has sent probes to distant planets, and the rest of the world would have employed the most advanced technology on this thing. Scientists around the world would be analyzing the information. Instead, this phenomenon is not even in the news, and, aside from the US government, no none seems to know anything about it? The government has never bothered to fly a drone into the shimmer, or drop a probe? Instead, they just send these small groups of explorers into the shimmer to never return. It's ridiculous. Maybe the book would explain it more, but the book should not be a prerequisite for the film.",Annihilation

697,acandiani,tarkovsky is surely rolling in is grave,1,15 March 2018,"Based on Jeff VanderMeer's novel, Annihilation is not only way too similar to Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker but even more similar to the Strugatsky brothers original book Roadside Picnic. Shall we also say that there are many elements of Tarkovsky's Solaris (the book by Stanislaw Lem) in this movie too, same as in the novel too. For Jeff VanderMeer to deny any ""borrowed inspiration"" is sensationally ridiculous. The film is atrocious. Let's just think that the ""alien"" is annihilated with a simple bomb, I mean, no one could think of it before? We know 5 minutes into the movie how it's going to end. We have watched it all before.

1. Setup should be different, maybe one start scene in begining showing future, but then pretty forward to the end (going forward and past didnot go well with this movie.
2. I m not convinced that team goes into that area (all are biolohgy, medic, physics .. so on )

710,MacacoBanditi,Fear What's Dumped in Netflix,3,19 March 2018,"I awaited eagerly the release of this movie, as I am an avid consumer of science-fiction. I usually rate Sci-Fi flicks slightly above what they deserve, just because it is an intrinsically challenging genre and filmmakers should be commended just for trying their hand at it. In this case, however, I feel this movie was vastly overrated and my rating of 3 stars is an attempt to bring balance to the hype. I will provide some background to the story but keep my review spoiler-free. The premise of this movie is by no means original and yet remains a compelling one. Some alien force takes over an area on the Pacific Coast of the USA and transforms it into a realm of mystery that gets bigger by the hour and from which nothing ever returns, The Shimmer. The action gets going when, out of the blue, one lone trooper does eventually return from it and the people in charge decide to send one further expedition, this time composed solely of women of various professional backgrounds, mostly academic/scientific. All of them are given assault weapons, even though only one of them appears to have any military experience. None of them wear any protective gear, even though it has been determined that biological activity is strongly affected within The Shimmer. From here on the flaws in logic, even within the weird world of the movie, begin to pile up so fast that any suspension of disbelief is not possible anymore.The Professor of Biology in Johns Hopkins University states that ""different species cannot cross-breed"". Seriously? Ever heard of a mule? It's a cross-breed between a horse and a donkey, two different species. The characters actions are completely irrational, the dialogue is contrived and expository aiming at the lowest possible common denominator. We live in the year 2018, it is very unlikely that anyone watching a science-fiction movie will not have at least a vague idea of what a ""mutation"" is. The heavy-handed didactical tone of the characters becomes annoying very quickly, besides being unrealistic: people simply don't talk like that unless they are teaching a high school class. Plot, dialogue, and some of the effects are quite amateurish for such a high budget movie. Some are downright unintentionally hilarious. No matter how spectacular the vistas or the colors, we as an audience are quite desensitized to astonishing visuals at this point. Anything is possible with CGI. When the direction doesn't succeed at making you care about the characters, most of which are quite annoying and act illogically for their outstanding level of education, it is difficult to empathize with their plight and get emotionally involved in the action. The tone is never set unambiguously, what are we supposed to feel? Fear? Anxiety? Tension? Horror? Curiosity? Sadness? It tries to be a blend of all of them and ends up being none. In summary, the three stars are for the interesting premise and for the ambitious scope of the project. The seven stars that are missing from a tenner are from poor execution at all levels, including the acting, which in a few cases is as amateurish as the characters in the movie. I am worried that Netflix is taking advantage of its 'hostage' audience to force this kind of product on people. This is not high quality science fiction, it is science dumbed down to the level of illiteracy, minus any thought-sparking, tension-building, attention-grabbing plot. An unfulfilling and highly disappointing experience.",Annihilation

716,AntiJoule,An honest review,6,28 March 2018,"So I gave this movie a 6/10. It actually deserves a 7/10
I took -1 off because of metoo & its obvious SJW connotations. (I could very easily have taken -2 because of it)I do think this movie is good enough to be at the cinemas and not a direct to dvd (netflix) movie. That's for sure.
The acting is decent, the screenplay is bland, but okay.It's by no means too intelligent for the average viewer, not in the slightest. However, it might be too boring.It's on the level of ""Unthinkable"" with Samuel L. Jackson from 2010.The storyline is very bland, you don't really care about the characters or their motivations. It's very well done for a sci-fi / mystic movie though. It has decent effects & explains everything in a way that so that it doesn't need to be explained.The science of the movie is very documentary friendly, i.e it's not something you wouldnt know if you did not watch the occasional scientific documentary.
It's not even that of a *very* fast google search.What bothers me mostly with the movie is how often I kept thinking how stupid the people running the main operation was. I'm not going to write spoilers.
But, there are clear actions the CDC would of done in order to do the mission way more safe.
There are also way more the military could of done to scout.
E.G drones.I gave this a 6/10 because it was enjoyable, I like natalie portman & it has pretty colors.
Pretty much what you can expect from hollywood these days.By no means an intelligent sitting for anyone, but it might be too boring.",Annihilation

Because of the latter, I don't advise watching it.",Annihilation
718,igoratsalad,Disappointing & bland.,5,14 March 2018,"I was fearing for this movie since I've watched the trailer. I didn't think the concepts presented would be explored in an interesting enough way. But as I saw a 7.6 on this movie's IMDb page, my hopes got up again, only to be crushed by the movie itself.In Annihilation, you'll find:
Interesting concepts... but badly explored;A group of female professionals... that make a ton of bad decisions;A threat of unknown origin... unless you've watched the trailer;Trippy, artistic photography... but the movie pace is very slow at times;And several other examples of ""this is good... but then this is bad"", making this movie nothing more than a 5/10. Go watch a video of plot highlights instead, you'll get the same good bits without the bad ones.",Annihilation
719,bricemavillaz,Pretty good !,8,26 April 2020,"When I heard that this movie was deemed ""too smart for audiences"", I said to myself that oughta be good. Turns out it IS pretty good...but not that smart.
This isn't 2001 folks, and isn't mind-melting to understand, it's pretty straightforward.
This movie's more abstract and contemplative than smart. I guess this is why they thought the audience wouldn't get it.
It feels a LOT like Tarkovski's STALKER, you can't help but think the movie had a major influence on Annihilation. But apparently not. I'm suspicious. There's one shot in particular that really rings a bell (shot of an electric pole in the wilderness). Whatever, if you liked Stalker you'll clearly like this one.
The visuals are superbly done, and a weird, oniric, dreamlike feel permeates throughout the movie. The music and sound also also particularly good and perfectly match what you see on screen, and make the whole thing a trippy experience.
This movie is kindofa mood piece first and foremost, the pace is pretty slow (not lethargic-10mn-long shots-slow), but it is hard to classify : it's got horror parts, a lot of sci-fi, but the whole thing is wrapped in soft and poetic visuals. The ""zone"" (shimmer"") the film takes place in is really beautifully rendered, calm, full of vibrant colors and seldom feels threatening.
That's one of the best aspect of this movie : never is it made clear if the ""thing"" is hostile or not, or if ""it"" even knows about good or evil.
The story is solid (although the narration is not straightforward and skips in time, which contributes to the ""dream"" feeling) and so is the acting. Isaac plays it REALLY low this time and it's always great to see him on screen, I usually find nataly portman emotionless and cold but I finally enjoyed her a little more in this one. Nice seeing Jennifer Jason Leigh again (i felt really old tho!) and the three other leads are decent and convincing.
I'm not too sure about the ""team mate snaps"" subplot, they had to find a way to get rid of the characters I guess, but it still feels a little gratuitous and unnecessary. Apart from that, there's not much to complain about.
All the science seems to add up (no tech jumbo here tho, or the bare minimum to understand what's happening), and there where no improbable nonsense situations that pull you out of the film for being too unrealistic and leave you cursing at the director in your seat for thinking you're an idiot. None of that here, and that really felt good. More films like these please !
Really good movie I can't recommend enough for people who don't mind slow paced plot development, and very atmospheric, visual and ""moody"" movies.
There's not much of it but it's pretty brutal on the gore so be warned about that. And weirdly that doesn't snap you out of the cozy feeling you feel throughout the film. This film was clearly shot with a dream state in mind and not as a nightmare. That's one of its weird charms. And the whole ""dream vibe"" really serves the metaphysical and ""mystic"" aspects of the script, overall it kinda feels like a weird spiritual experience. And I have to say, that's one of the best alien being rendition I've seen on screen so far : clearly living but yet completely abstract and indescribable. That's the closest thing I imagine aliens could look like : absolutely not like us and way beyond what we can understand.
Again i get the movie's not really for everyone, but if you like subtlety, maturity, great visuals and a engaging atmosphere for a change, treat yourself with this one. Really good! Alex Garland is clearly a guy to watch out for.",Annihilation

Perhaps it is deep and I'm just too shallow to get it.I did enjoy the imagery and I think there some interesting scenes, but , man, I just don't know if that made it worth it.The thing that bothered me the most was the public's apparent lack of knowledge about the anomaly (""the shimmer""). Natalie Portman's character acted as though she knew nothing about it, which, in turn, would mean the general public didn't know anything about it.

722,JoeBagz,Interesting Concept with Poor Execution,3,2 June 2018,"No spoilers. Not very good. SCI-FI. Plot: A college biology professor signs up for a secret expedition to explore the shimmer, a slowly expanding zone from which nothing returns. The screenplay is based on a novel by Jeff VanderMeek which I did not read. While the premise sounds reasonable and some explanations of events offered by characters touring the zone are pretty interesting very little the characters attempt in the film over the 115 minutes makes any sense at all. These plot holes happen repeatedly and undermine the story. The response by government to the threat, the team they assemble, the supplies they carry or the objectives of their mission are all lame. Like watching teens in a slasher film, it get's old pretty quick. Am guessing writer/ Director Alex Garland best known for excellent work on Ex Machina kept the story a bit too close to the book this time. Decent cast too. This might have worked better in the 60's when the audience might have been less likely to question why the actions of the characters make less sense than does an alien environment we can only speculate about.",Annihilation

725,Roddingham,Missing proper antagonist,5,17 April 2020,I like Garland's work and style but honestly this movie didn't connect me in any way with the antagonist of the story (the Shimmer).

726,vatigue,Good-looking hull with superb acting but no content.,6,12 March 2018,"After seeing the Teaser Trailer for Annihilation last year I was very intrigued. I like almost everything Sci-Fi and figured it could be a more intellectual and philosophical ride than usual. So I went to buy the book-trilogy by VanderMeer and started reading to prepare for it. I don't regret that part, having never stumbled upon any of Jeff VanderMeer's work before. The books are weird, creepy and also pretty clever and special compared to other Sci-Fi I read. I felt like VanderMeer clearly outsmarts most readers.
Hearing that Alex Garland only read the first novel of the trilogy and then came up with a movie on his own had me not only sceptical but made me not rush the reading aswell. So far I'm done with book two.
Garlands Ex-Machina was great, I loved it despite some story-telling flaws. What he did with Annihilation made me angry after having read the books. I don't know if it's ignorance or arrogance but except for the very core idea of the book, he seemed to not care at all about the material.
There's an area that has a shimmer around it and manages to change physical laws and completely morphs preset dna together with other things. That's pretty much all Garland took from the book. The rest is from his own mind. No dialogue or scene have anything to do with the book from there on. The protagonists actually had to tell the audience they're getting crazy because the scenes didn't picture it well enough to see.
The acting was great, especially from Natalie Portmann and Tessa Thompson (underrated but will get there I hope. I managed to stumble upon most of her work since Veronica Mars). The setting reminded me of the videogame The Last of Us but not of the books from VanderMeer. Still beautiful though. (Heck if Garland made a movie of the game with that setting it could have been awesome).
Watching the movie as standalone without the novels it got adapted from, it still makes for a very murky experience, due to lack of backstory about the travel into Area X and the lack of motivation from the protagonists. Also, the eerie background-sounds were great. The guitar-songs in some scenes felt completely out of place for the setting.
Therefore my rating is 6, because of the cinematography and the very good acting overall.
After seeing the movie on netflix, I can see why Paramount decided to not drop it in cinemas outside the US and China. It was not worth it and I am still sour about that fact. I am not looking forward to Garlands next work like I did after Ex-Machina.
If you like Sci-Fi and haven't read VanderMeer's Southern Reach Trilogy, give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",Annihilation

729,MatnvannPlatn,Annihilation - Horror Sci-Fi on an LSD Trip,7,8 July 2018,"After her US marine husband Kane (played by Oscar Isaac, well that's at least one Oscar in the pocket) returns from a mission and doesn't appear to be the same person as before, soldier-turned-biologist Lena (Natalie Portman) wants answers. She ends up on a all-female mission into 'the Shimmer', an otherworldly, constantly growing soap bubble glow, emanating from a lighthouse, and from which none bar Lena's husband has made it back alive, albeit barely.Of course, when your best-trained soldiers don't ever return from a mutant bog, perhaps a team of scientists will fare better. Here's an M16, the best of luck to you!All of the tough girl team seem to have a backstory for wanting to go on what clearly is a suicide mission, and Lena, too, happily volunteers. A lovely coincidence she's a celebrated biologist, because there's wonderful stuff going on inside the bubble. From fairytale deer with glow-in-the-dark antlers to rampantly growing blossoms in all possible hues of the rainbow spectre. All biologists peer into microscopes at night when they can't sleep, and Lena does a remarkable discovery, just in time to witness one of the other ladies being eaten. Was it the anthropologist? There weren't any people left in the bubble to describe anyway. Well, as my mother used to say, night time's vermin's play time. It seems the writers mistook that for a challenge, and hired both the animators from The Revenant and Jurassic Park for the CGI effects. I also got the idea they had a kitchen argument whether they should go for a more intellectual or a horror-like feel, and decided on a compromise. We get gory scenes of people being ripped to bits, literally grown apart, cut open, and eaten from the inside, while the scientists engage in a lively discussion to make sense of it all. Instead of getting a feel for the thinly drawn characters, however, the result is a sense of alienation (heh, sorry). Perhaps that was intentional.Annihilation's scenes are dream-like overall, with flashy lense flares around every corner and lush, extravagant foliage eating away at the world as we know it. The rampant parasitic proliferation looks quite natural, and the mutation notion allows it to be plausible for a long time. Up to the point where, after delivering a semi-esoteric speech contemplating the meaning of life, the ever-distant Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) throws back her head, and disintegrates into a bright beam of particles emanating from her mouth. You read that right.When Lena returns after fighting a galvanised version of herself, everything has returned to normal. Or has it? I guess we can best summarise it in the same words as the most-heard answer in the film: I don't know.",Annihilation

'My not understanding the point must be me not the film; otherwise why would Nat Portman have done it?' (For money)Poor character development. Poor story line.

I have a rule of always watching a film to the end as you never know when and ending may save it. Sadly in this case, it didn't happen. As if it wasn't bad enough, there wasn't even really and ending, just one last pointless scene.Forgetting the main misgivings, even the little things were poorly done. A person dragged underwater by an alligator without a mark to show for it, tick. A person smashed in the face with a heavy automatic weapon without a mark to show for it, tick. No flashlight outside in an unknown world dark at night, tick.The movie was weird, think donnie darko weird but with nothing happening. What was this movie intending to be? A horror? No. A love story? No. A sci-fi? Maybe. I can only hope that it was made for 3D and intended for cinema only use. I can imagine if viewed in 3D some visuals would have been interesting (disclaimer, watched at home in 2D).Have you ever had a dream/nightmare where everything was jumbled up and nothing made sense, then you just wake up not knowing how it ended? That pretty much sums this up in one.I've resisted the urge to give it 1 star due to Natalie Portman delivering a good performance. Other than that, it really is a waste of life watching it. There's no spoilers in this review but in all honesty it would have been really difficult to give any, because nothing happens.

747,Rosebud815,Five bags of popcorn,10,27 February 2018,"When I heard that a sci-fi by the writer/director of Ex Machina starring Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac was coming out, I was immediately excited. Then when I saw the trailer, it was the majority of what I talked about for upcoming movies this year. When I saw Annihilation, I was hooked by its mystery. And as the fascinating events progressed I became more and more invested in the narrative, a story about how an inexplicable, supernatural event directly relates to the relationship between two people. Usually cutting back and forth from the present to the past story is completely unnecessary, but it really aids Annihilation with its introspective tone. It also lets the pace flow, which mirrors the film: a vivid recollection of a fragmented dream. Regarding the content of Annihilation, I'll start with its inciting event - ""The Shimmer"". This is an otherworldly event that goes beyond the logic of the human mind, delving far into the experience of life through a moment in time. ""It's not destroying... It's creating something new...""Annihilation is a metaphysical movie. For a lot of people, it doesn't compute to much. However, I really connect to the content, what happens to the characters, and what they learn. Change is a big part of it. The shimmer, in a very raw manner, is basically just energy bringing change. Immediately I thought of Dune during Annihilation: ""Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens... The sleeper must awaken."" And what they learn isn't anything set in stone either, which is part of what's so great about it. When Lena is asked at the end what her pure mirror God-self wanted, she admitted she didn't know. Annihilation chalks everything down to energy. The interior of the shimmer and all that takes place in it feels like the randomness and the inter-connected, yet apathetic hostility in how energy brings change into people's lives in moments in time. It taps into the unknown of what is felt in life; how it progresses, evolves and expands. While the entire lighthouse scene is so amazing, specifically the part where Jennifer Leigh's character spits out a universe in its own is my favorite. Lena stands there, watching, and then it all becomes clear for me as a viewer. In and because of the shimmer, her character is allowed to experience the natural beauty, the infinite possibilities and wild hostility of the random, ever-changing universe. This is the essence of the shimmer, and the entire film. Everything it creates, and everything it destroys.",Annihilation

And that is important for a satisfying movie, in my opinion. I'll use Arrival as an example: amazing visuals and beautiful music - it was kind of confusing as it went along, but all of it made sense in the end - my questions were answered and I was satisfied. In this movie, I couldn't even begin to tell you what happened. I feel like all of the characters in the movie do when they leave the shimmer: confused and a bit frustrated.",Annihilation

This one, while not perfect, is finally what I've been searching for. I don't want to say much about because this movie actually had me guessing until the end. The characters are simple but the more I thought about them the more I realized how they fit into the story. There was one character played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I thought was poorly acted at first but her character slowly grew on me and having seen her other work I can say all the choices made were on purpose. The beginning feels a bit weak (first 10 min) but the rest of the film is invigorating and gives you plenty to think about at the end. Not all the answers are in the movie but unlike Prometheus, this film gives you plenty to work with once the credits roll. The CGI is a bit dodgy in a few places but for a 40 million dollar budget, it's still impressive with the fantastic art style.

Looking for answers regarding the abrupt reappearance of her military husband who was supposed to have been killed in that very area, she joins a team of other women to conduct an expedition into the strange place, but things take a turn that defies understanding very quickly...Annihilation, adapting the first in a series of novels into a self-contained story, is a solid horror/sci-fi film which was unfortunately denied cinematic release outside the US. It has a cast of sympathetic characters who all get a fair amount of development and portrays a very strange world that contains equal amounts of beauty and grotesquerie. As our characters delve deeper into this alien zone, the more mundane mysteries they chase get clearer while what concerns the zone itself becomes stranger and stranger, culminating in a final fifteen or so minutes that can be described as a surreal nightmare. The film rewards attentive viewing as it contains certain small elements that foreshadow later events or clarify the currently ongoing ones.In the beginning of the film, a scientist in a hazmat suit questions Lena about something that is apparently in the Zone. The man's questions are very rational and analytical, but they all meet the same answer: ""I don't know"".

That did not happen, and the ending was anti-climactic, unoriginal, weak and trite. Matters were not helped by un-wise flashbacks (especially the non-sequitur nude scene), and mostly dull and uninspired acting. It felt like everyone was on some kind of sedative.I found the ongoing physical effects (odd growths, flowers, etc.) to be very poorly and inconsistently executed, and the story (while kudos for a mostly female group) simply uninspiring. Considering the build-up this movie got, I was hoping for a good story and something thought provoking. The light house scene was interesting, but really didn't carry the movie.I am a huge sci-fi fan, stretching back at least 60 years, so I have seen almost every kind of story, but this really felt like I vastly over-paid for admission.

Never ever trust a fine cut trailer.
It's like: ""Whoo, hooo! Check me out, I'm an epic film about sci-fi stuff!""So, ofcourse I watched it and expected an epic film time.
Kind of dissapointed, the least to say.Just for starters, the movie sets the tone quite nice.
It got that look, that tells me that I'm in for a treat. 
The music and sounds feels mysterius and dark, works well with the picture.But when the story get's going, that's when everything falls apart.
The tone, music and looks can't carry the entire movie all by it self, it needs some assistance.
But it aint getting it!Flashbacks and epic jumps in storytelling makes up for a confusing story.
Big gaping holes, unravels before my eyes. 
""Whait, what?""
There is a scene where our five female companions wake up after entering the shimmer. No one remembers anything from the last days. They can tell by their ransons that they been there for a significant time, but they don't know for sure. They got no sence of directions or when they even set up camp. 
I sit there like, ok.
And then they just drop that for the rest of the film, never talk about it again.So time works different in the shimmer... and then?
Nope, there is nothing more to it. Our female compadres walks on and remebers everything like normal and the days seems to go on without memory gaps. 
These holes in the story, I don't really enjoy them.And talking about our female gang.
Someone has to die first, like always. 
And I don't know if I wasnt paying attention, or if my memory is bad. 
But when the first lady get's grabbed by our mystery monster of the eavning, I actully had no clue to who actually got eaten. And I'm not talking about our crocodile Dundée moment, I'm talking about the bear Grylls moment. Who got eaten? They scream out a name, but I can't really remember who that name belonged to. 
There are five female characters, and they failed to make any of them important. Could be because I zooned out from time to time, just because the film got boring. Or a case of bad writing, I don't really know.
Would be nice to actually feel something for at least one of the characters.And the movie just clumpsy stumbels on, deeper into the shimmer. Some flashbacks thrown in from time to time, adding to the runtime but nothing added to the story. Ok, so she is a sad person who owes her husband something. Was it because she had an affair or because she painted the bedroom without approval from husband? They walk, they die, they cry and they look bored. At least one feeling they managed to make me feel also.
Time runs on and one of our bright minds suddenly understand everything and decides that she wants to embrace the event, turning into a flower? Three? Bush? 
Ok, whait what?So our ""hero"" is now alone. 
At this point, I actually didn't care anymore. I wanted the film to end!
Looked at the timer and... MY GOD, there is actually 35 minutes left! 
Wishing that the end credits were going to be 30 minutes. Long time ago I was this bored.To sum things up: Another review said: The film doesn't know what it wants to be. Action, sci-fi, horror or drama? What is it?
If I see past every crack in the story, every dip and turn, it's just a film without soul that don't belong anywhere.",Annihilation
758,starrychloe,Metaphor for a bad LSD trip,8,12 May 2018,"I swear this is a metaphor for a bad LSD trip, or perhaps more accurately, a bad mushroom trip. The shimmery colors, the surreal landscape, the horror images, the chaotic thinking, and most of all, the characters each observe and expect from the shimmer the energy they themselves put out. That is exactly how LSD or psychoactives work. The universe gives what you give. The 'shimmer' is a reflection of themselves. There were several characters, one expected a double cross, one wanted peace and tranquility, one was there to fight, and one expected annihilation. They all got what they were looking for. Some other characters even seemed like they WERE on LSD, or maybe PCP or bath salts! The music was an exceptionally eerie type of glitch ambient - the most alien music I've ever heard. I didn't really like the movie, but it got me thinking for the rest of the week. It's a classically grotesque movie, like Tideland.

759,alibaba3317,Masterclass,10,17 October 2019,"Having seen this mysterious 115 minute masterpiece several times I feel obliged to write about it.Alex Garland's second official directing gig after the critically acclaimed Ex Machina, comes in the form of an adapted screenplay from Jeff VanderMeer's 2014 novel.Annihilation is a captivating trip into the unknown, it's a refreshingly unique story that blends horror and science fiction into an uneasy mixture.What immediately hooked me was the oozing sense of lucid discomfort and severe danger. This is an adventurous and frightening dive into uncertain territory. Annihilation combines science fiction with horror in a masterful way. It's ominous, atmospheric and fantastically mesmerizing. It tells itself in the best way possible, as a mystery.The score and visual imagery are the two outstanding technical merits from Annihilation. Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow have created a uniquely pulsating score to support the nightmarish imagery put on screen. It goes hand in hand with the uncomfortable nature of the story and elevates the material from fantastic to absolute masterclass. They've given the movie a voice and personality. The sound department have done a fantastic job.Alex Garland along with his crew of VFX artist and designers have created unforgettable visuals. Not only have they come up with timeless creature designs, but they've brought them to life with authentic results. The practical and digital work blends effortlessly. There's some truly remarkable moments here. They've also managed to combine these terrifying monsters, unholy mutations, with beautiful and colorful artistry. It's a complete 180, there's horrific abominations of terror but there's also pretty looking plants and animals, sometimes both. This mixture makes for a dreamlike illusion.On the surface the story is this very elaborate and sometimes violent science fiction discovery, but it's more than just that. The obvious one being the cancer metaphor, which makes for a more thoughtful experience. It's vocalized several times and works as a passive explanation for The Shimmer, a nice parallel.The more interesting theme here is self destruction. It's an unusual topic for a science fiction horror movie. It's a really interesting allegory that spoke to me personally. It's told but also visualized. Why do we do harmful things to ourselves even though we know they're harmful? Will we succumb to our own temptations or will we evolve? It's something most of us can relate to.Annihilation is a must see for science fiction fans and lovers of H. P. Lovecraft's work.",Annihilation

The whole thing could have been condensed down to about 45 minutes and it would have been perfect. The acting and the music are morbidly inappropriate.
 
In between the cool CGI the film tries to explore complex ideas relating to emotions, morals, and stereotypes. It does this by employing various types of tensions:- playing with tempo, juxtaposition of acting styles and experimental camera work - but it doesn't achieve any greatness in this regard and just comes across really, really boring and at times reaches the heights of actually being infuriating.

Why not use vehicles to move around faster, or at least bicycles? A tank would have helped. There was no chemisty between the leads which becomes a big issue as one is seemingly willing to die to try to save the other. In the end, I wish I had not wasted my time.",Annihilation

It's impossible to listen to without making one wonder why she couldn't have a good cough and get rid of it.The first 56 minutes were tedious. The remainder was much more watchable, though not gripping by any means - it was tolerable enough. The suggestions of body horror were interesting, though some worked better than others.

769,gwyckoff,An interesting but ultimately unsatisfying (or maybe astoundingly satisfying) spectacle,6,16 March 2018,"""Almost makes sense"". The movie has the almost-making-sense feel of Russian sci-fi movies like 'Stalker' and 'Solaris'. If you even remotely like this movie, you will truly love the 1979 Russian sci-fi movie 'Stalker' which attempts the same things as 'Annulation', but actually succeeds. 
 
""Soggy Middle"". The first act is the best. Its intriguing and really gets you engaged with the story and the main character. The third act is mediocre (or maybe great), if somewhat ambiguous. Where this movie really drags is the second act. There are some really weird and beautiful effects; as well as many suspenseful horror-like sequences. However, this exploration of the mysterious Area X and the motivations of the characters is too slow and drawn out. I found I had way too much time to speculate about why the people in-charge of the Southern Reach were so incredibly inept at exploring this strange region. As the act was playing out, I came up with about two dozen strategies for accomplishing the same goals without sending people on a crazy suicide mission.The most interesting part was the exploration of the main character's reasons for undertaking such a risky mission. As the act progresses, we gradually learn the truth and the secrets which underlie her part of the story. All of this is given far too little attention and is not properly woven into the 'exploration' theme of the rest of the movie.""An ambiguous third act"". The conclusion of the movie is either rather mundane and unsatisfying or truly great and interesting. It all depends upon what actually happens. This is the one part of the movie I would watch again if it didn't involve sitting through the middle. I won't spoil the ending by writing any more except to suggest you watch very very closely. Does what 'appears' to happen actually happen or does its opposite?If the movie ends the way it appears at first glance, then the result is rather unsatisfying. If the opposite happened, then the ending has a whole different interpretation which completely changes who can be considered 'the winners' and 'the losers' in this exchange. Maybe a detailed dissection will reveal the answer once the movie comes out on digital. It would have been better, though, had the filmmaker made things clear on the first viewing. Ideally you want to get the central meaning on the first go and additional layers from subsequent passes.",Annihilation

Of course this is going to get brigaded.,10,5 October 2021,"BUT it was brilliant.It's the third film from Netflix I decide to watch despite the obvious brigading (Same comments with same titles but different account names? Come on), and GOD how I was glad I did.The dialogues and pacing was one of the most natural I've ever seen, and I was on the edge of my seat all the time because every minute of this film has a reason to exist. You can feel it in the air, like that guitar that comes sometimes to try forcing a borderline trivial reality into something too surreal to avert your eyes.All felt a bit like a patiently crafted online RPG game. You can sense the traps everywhere and wish the characters would progress even more slowly and prudently because after a while, you know that trap is a deadly one.There are different ways to understand what is going on, and I've seen a metaphor for cancer in one of the very insightful comments, but to my eyes, it's like a new world trying to start somewhere in the universe. It just happens to be our Earth, like it could be anywhere else. You see the phenomenon develop in the middle of a chaos where all DNA is melting together, along with consciousness, as if it was something biological too. All things melt together, and you get a tiny big bang, then the first intelligent creature. At first it mimics everything, then becomes starts to think and get its own will. At the end it seems like it/he decided that it had to mate. Which makes me wonder since when that all started to happen. Is it why an all-female crew was sent after the male ones? It is why the female hero can't stop thinking about the way they were mating while her 'husband' was very progressively changing during his mission?I'm not sure it's what that movie wanted to do, but thinking about the all other possibilities is as much fascinating.I love what this movie has done to my brain, it is so rich and so thought-provoking. I wish this had been a TV series, so that we could have followed the characters more in details.I'm glad this movie was denatured to cater to a wider public. This would have destroyed it. Its beauty.

780,MaggieQ-public,5 Females? Really? This Ruined the believability big time and marked the end.,1,25 February 2018,"First: The pros to this film, 
1. The sense of unknown 
2. The production value feels up to par
3. Natalie Portman is a good actress 
4. Tessa Thompson is gorgeous and also a good actorThe cons:
1. This film is completely unbelievable in its lack of urgency toward something that is supposedly engulfing the planet.
2. If a group of Marines or expert soldiers are constantly sent out and continuously never come back, WHY ARE WE THINKING 5 WOMEN not necessarily trained, including 2 scientists, 1 paramedic (?) can get the job done? This absolutely SANK this movie. It's impossible to overlook though I tried and tried. 
3. Some of the things these characters did were simply ridiculous. No one on the planet is that brave. One takes ""watch"" at night alone, while others sleep....really??? This isn't Platoon and the jungle vs the Viet Cong. They not too earlier had already seen a GIANT ALLIGATOR with an insane row of vicious teeth.One disappears into the forest, taken, screaming in agony, by another ferocious creature, and one later goes looking for her, again....ALONE.
 Listen, women as like men, are capable of doing heroic feats in the face of life threatening, dangerous circumstances but the government, desperate for answers and results would train and deploy teams better than this. These women are not ""badasses,"" heck, most men wouldn't do the things these characters in this movie does.
4. The LAW OF ECONOMY OF CHARACTERS. You know, watching this, that all 5 will not survive, and just like any slasher film, one by one, each one gets taken.
This ruins suspense and the overall uniqueness. 
5. Credit needs to BE GIVEN TO TARKOVSKY'S beautiful and superior ""STALKERS.""
As one poster here already has mentioned, even the water motifs in this film is borrowing from Tarkovsky's masterpiece. Which is fine, just give it credit.

781,calebcunningham41,Thought provoking,7,3 March 2018,"I'm sure after reading a couple of user reviews you'll see that there is very little mid-ground on this movie. No gray, if you will.
It seems you ether LOVE this movie or you undoubtedly HATE it. If I am being perfectly honest, I nether love nor hate this movie.
I gave Annihilation a 7 out of 10; firstly, because the visuals of this film are phenomenal! Second to none, this movie takes you to another world. A world where everything is beautiful or terrifying! 
I'd have to say Annihilation was much scarier then I thought it would be so if you're not looking for scary stay clear. 
This movie is also extremely physiological so stay clear if you don't like movies messing with your head. I personally love thought provoking movies that's why I saw this.
Natalie Portman and Oscar Issac are flawless in this film, convincing me that this is real and giving me a connection to their characters on an emotional level. However, where Portman and Issac are amazing I am truly let down by Jennifer Jason Leigh as her part seems uninteresting and useless to the plot but her acting is quiet, shy, and not convincing in any way. 7 out of 10, 2 of those lost stars belong to her and the poor script. 
The last fallen star belongs to some of the slowness of the film. There are 2 scenes that seem like they're lasting forever and nothing is happening. 
All in all, a pretty great ride with few complaints.
I would not recommend this movie to anyone who is not physiologically sound as it tries hard to play with your mind. 
Also, there is some very disturbing images that make this film have the R rating.",Annihilation

Instead it opted to go a more stimulating route and for attempting to do that I give this movie credit. 
having said that, it just failed to do so. too much time is spent on world building instead of character and for that this movie suffers because for what it was trying to do, it didn't lay the proper base. I couldn't connect with the characters. I didn't understand their drives. they were just thrown in a situation and you just see it unfold through out. the destructive notion that this movie was trying to play with didn't matter because the viewer simply couldn't care.

783,joakim-ericsson,"Intriguing, artsy, thought-provoking, visionary, and awesome",9,13 March 2018,"Was intrigued by this ever since watching the trailer. I was not dissappointed. This movie asks questions like: How do we deal with the unknown, what does it mean to be human, when do we stop to be human, what is human, what is our self? Is all change good, is all change evil? Very smart movie. If you don't like it it means: A- you don't like scifi, B- you don't like to think at all, or C- you think and over analyze too much. I like smart and thought provoking movies where you don't necessarily get every answer on a silver platter, something that requires you to think. I also don't like movies where it's evident that the makers just wanted to be artsy and weird, and had no idea of what they actually wanted to say or question. Watching this movie, I was hooked, intrigued and a bit scared all the way, it was hard to see how it would end.SPOILERS!Has elements of H.P Lovecraft's Color out of Space, The Thing, and Arrival, in a good combo. Also, visually borrows a bit from the game The Last of Us and the movie Under the Skin. Some very weird and artsy scenes that you probably won't appreciate unless you tried psychedelics. But, it is very cohesive if you give it a chance. If you like to pick things apart for a sport you'll probably find several flaws but nothing really bothered me. Also, half way through the movie I realized that ALL protagonists were females, and I hadn't even thought about it. In our days of PC, maybe the writers of Star Wars and other movies could learn from this one. Not many people have a problem with an ""all"" female cast, if the movie is good and doesn't have an overt political agenda. Just like Ex-Machina, this one was very good. 9/10, and the 9 is just because of some smaller (contrived feeling) conflicts between characters.",Annihilation

Once in the emergency car, special secret unit appears in black cars and they take the protagonist and her dying husband into a secret base no one else on the planet knows anything about.We are introduced to a group of similar ladies/scientist sipping beer and flirting at a balcony watching the deadly shimmering that appeared in the area after an asteroid hit a lighthouse. Apart from being very smart they all share same inability to smile. Since none of the guys who went into the rainbow light, accept protagonist's husband made it out- the team decides to do a lovely trip inside the alien realm on their own. They pack some old camping gear, some army guns and the journey begins.Instead of taking a chopper or boat to reach the impact location, they decide to cross an entire jungle on foot. Hey, why not. Girls just wanna have fun. They stumble upon a bunch of plastic flowers, giant alligators and a few other species that are a mutation between plants and animals. Without a coherent plan and every one of them using the jungle to deal with her own mental problems they one by one end up dead. One of them gets merged into a mutated bear, one gets killed by that bear/girl she has a crush on, one of them starts growing leaves out of her arms and walks out of the movie.Only the depressed protagonist and even more so depressed team leader that has left the team behind made it to the intact lighthouse, overgrown by more colorful plastic flowers and fungi.Compliments on those who built the lighthouse as it made it out in one piece after the asteroid impact and later a bomb that protagonist's husband used to kill himself for no clear reason. 10/10 for the durability of the camera that filmed the suicide and also stayed intact while the poor husband turned into stone and ashes in the explosion. He even managed to rewind the tape after he died, so that whoever found the tape wouldn't have to do that by themselves. Kind gesture.Oh, and then then there is a hole inside a lighthouse too and the leader of the expedition morphing into some sort of a black hole that draws blood from the main protagonist and eventually turns into a copy of the main protagonist. Another bomb like the one used by her husband to kill himself appears and this time everything explodes and mission is completed.The protagonist reunites with her husband, they are both aliens now.

Far too many films of this kind try to explain what the threat is in a way that kills the tension, but Garland gets that things are scarier when they're unknown. This makes Annihilation much more of a horror film than it advertises itself as because it bombards you with things you cannot possibly explain (all I'll say is...that bear).Visually Annihilation is also a treat, offering sights that are insanely original and creature designs that remind you of the weirdness of The Thing and Alien.Do not read up about this film before you go in.

More of the screen time was devoted to exploring the characters and the zone inside the shimmer rather than guns blazing.

The basic premise is a meteor hits a lighthouse and subsequently creates a ""shimmer"" that is growing and radically changing everything within it with as of yet no survivors or explanations. It's somewhat of an alien horror movie built around a psychological thriller.The acting was really split and I really enjoyed some of the roles and really disliked others. Natalie Portman as always does a wonderful job breaking out an emotionally charged complex character and has decent chemistry with Oscar Isaac in a slightly less than great performance as her husband and spark that starts the plot rolling.The special effects were wonderful leaving just enough to the imagination to make you wonder what's real and what isn't. I felt like the sound was overwhelmingly powerful in only a couple moments and left us in quiet reflection at many points. This was definitely intentional and a wonderful piece to the overall atmosphere of the movie.Overall, the acting of the supporting cast and the somewhat arbitrary approach to dealing with the shimmer left a little to be desired but the mystery, suspense, and final reveal were worth the wait! Good movie, just missed being great!",Annihilation
799,corozin,"Not as good as promised, or should have been. Blame Portman.",6,14 March 2018,"I have to admit the trailer had gotton me quite curious to see this one but now having seen it... well sad to say it didn't quite meet expectations. And despite it's beauty, and relatively original plot idea it's basic problem is Natalie Portman and her character.I'm sure having a girl who's been in the military for 8 years and then studied to become a PHD professor in Biology looks good on the writers desk but it's a long stretch to believe when Portman (who still looks about 25) is cast to play the role. But more to the point, Portman, endowed with her Chanel cheekbones and 8 stone frame, looks and is hopelessly out of place in the role, struggling to carry the weight of her M16 and rucksack around the jungle.Sections of genuinely interesting script and moviemaking are interrupted by inane girly shouting matches and screaming which seem only placed to satisfy studio bosses' idea of ""horror"" but the quieter, more thoughtful sections as they unravel the bio-monstrosity of the shimmer were actually really great.Similarly Jennifer Jason Leigh, a tremendous actress who usually lifts any movie, just grunts and whispers all the way through with a fairly hollow character with not much to really with or do. She's supposed to be the leader of the team, but the director sadly devotes all available screentime to the expensive Portman.On balance, not a bad film (at least no capes for a change) but an opportunity not fully grabbed. Portman needs to stick to playing pretty girls, as ex-military tough lasses just ain't her, either physically or emotionally. The film, whilst pretty, feels like a cross between the Hunger Games and Apocalypse Now, but without the drama or tension of either of those movies.

801,aadamhgafar-68237,"Annihilation - review, 4/10",4,23 March 2018,"For a story that revolves around a mysterious phenomenon dubbed 'the Shimmer' which seemingly bends the laws of physics as we understand them, I was anticipating a certain element of suspension of disbelief. What I wasn't anticipating was the obnoxious ambiguity that is so persistently present throughout the entire movie, it was infuriating that the two main thoughts that crossed my mind flitted between, 'wow, that looks nice,' and '...wait, what?' There's no concerted effort made to explicitly define anything, the movie leaves almost every aspect open to interpretation in what felt like an attempt to hide the fact that it had nothing important to say other than an it was an adaptation of an interesting idea (which is mostly conveyed through fancy SFX). The significance of the Shimmer is never delved into throughout the 120 minutes of runtime and the motivations of the characters are glossed over with little to no thought which leaves you with no shortage of unrelatable or unlikeable personalities spouting awkward dialogue to each other for no reason. It led to the formation of the expedition crew seeming rushed - a squad consisting of a loner psychologist, a grieving ex-soldier turned biology professor, a paramedic, an abrasive anthropologist and a physics graduate sets out to investigate the source of the Shimmer, an unlikely group with zero chemistry who meet the poor expectations their line-up inspires and often leave you wondering why or how they are qualified to undertake the mammoth task of investigating the most perplexing scientific incident in human history. The cast was largely hit-and-miss but Natalie Portman (who plays the protagonist, Lena), thankfully, gave a compelling performance but, unfortunately, it was the only one of the movie and can't make up for shortcomings of the rest of the movie.The film begins to pick up late in the movie as the special effects are really able to show off the mind-bending reality of the Shimmer; crystalline trees, mutated creatures and a cornucopia of vibrant plant life make for a remarkable and unique aesthetic that looks beautiful in places. It even succeeds in inserting a sense of unease in the face of the unknown which gave off a horror-movie vibe and was skilfully sold in the unnerving recreation of what looks like a 'Crocotta' (a beast from medieval folklore). However, the perverse curiosity of the wonderfully weird world of the Shimmer soon wears off as the confusing story plods along in its absurd way. The movie falls flat as the plot approaches the finale; the profound revelations that are to be expected after an hour and a half of build-up are swapped for a frustratingly opaque cop-out of a conclusion which leaves a bitter taste in your mouth as you realise that the two hours you just spent persevering in the hopes that the vague puzzle pieces the movie had been doling out would finally come together to show you something intelligent were in vain.",Annihilation
802,hondanut-73660,Mixed Reactions,8,24 November 2019,"After watching this film a couple of time now I have raised my initial rating. At first I didn't like it at all. The overall plot, effects and direction were great but it has flaws. The biggest is that the female characters appear to have been written for male actors and they simply used a female cast to play them. The characters are also stereotyped and culture-typed. Regardless of the fact the cast is female it has all the usual characters of a buddy war film. I get the idea that a woman can be or do anything a male character can but feel this movie would have been better served leaving the gender politics out. Also, the film fails to clearly answer any of the questions raised to any satisfying degree. It left me wanting to know more, much more about what happened. FYI - searching out the book series and even reading the wiki about them helped me get more out of it. And lastly, I enjoyed it. And did more the second time I watched it. So it's in my regular ""to watch"" list. My best advice is to familiarize yourself with the book plots before watching. It will definitely help.",Annihilation

Normally, films about madness and dispair take place within the real world or occupy a set which observes all of the norms of the physical world that we live in (i.e. Twelve Monkeys, Fight Club). Not this one.Annihilation turns the human condition and the rational basis for emotions, relationships, want and desire and turns all of these inside out and projects them onto a terrifying backdrop of the Shimmer, a world of manipulation, control, and ever increasing madness. If anyone thought this film was poor, I think it was because they expected a gory, thriller with little green men that obeyed the laws of physics. However, I think they were misinformed. Thils film is one to watch in one showing (with no breaks) and will leave you wondering why more films are not made like this.",Annihilation

The ending was unclear and drug trippy for the sake of being bold and unique.The only redeemable quality of this film were the visual effects and the fact that it was female centric, but that makes it pointless when they are characters that you don't care if they live or die.

812,greedydrunk,This movie is like an onion with its many layers to peel...,7,24 February 2018,"...only to find there are just more layers of onion.Annihilation is a film that presents a reality and never explains it, the onus is on you to work out what it all means. For many people this will be an enjoyable and challenging experience, and others will feel like they just sat in on a 2 hour Biology and Psychology lecture.The Movie Annihilation follows former military soldier and current scientist Lena (played by Natalie Portman), and four other throw away characters of various backgrounds. The group ventures into the shimmer to gather data and determine a way to stop it. As the movie progresses an adventure of scientific proportions develops that provide information and additional questions to both the characters and the viewers. The adventure climaxes to an ultimately satisfying scientific but not exciting ending. I left the theater satisfied but a little disappointed, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the little hints of information that kept me thinking through the movie. What I didn't enjoy was that some of the fundamentals were missing. We had supporting characters we knew so little about that when they died or moved on we didn't care. 
Mutation happening mostly in the form of adding flowers to walls and antlers and skin etc. 
Too many flashbacks (sometimes the same one as before only longer).
The movie cannot decide if it wants the atmosphere to be about wonder or tension and flip flops between the two over 2 hours. 
Too hard to believe they had been working to discover the shimmers secrets for years and had literally zero information about it, other than it was increasing in size. Really no one thought to maybe stick their arm in and take a scoop of dirt?In the end I enjoyed the film and would recommend it to someone looking for a little bit of a thinker. Was it a deep movie?

Alas, I was already laughing half way through, at the scene with bear shooting - so poorly constructed the plot was. However, the bear episode was just the first culmination of the incoherent pileup of plot stretches and pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo that badly needed a comic relief. For starters, one has to wonder why the biggest army in the world did not employ its might, or, say, just an armoured regiment, to investigate the phenomenon, but instead was sending tiny groups of volunteers for three years. Or, for example, why the gals abandoned a secure position on top of the guard tower just to be attacked. Or, one has to constantly scratch the head how come those pesky genetic mutations were able to merge different kingdoms of life and even fragments of conscience into all those new life forms. Or, on a related subject, where did the Cambridge physicist disappear to? Or, what happened to the leader of the team, really? Let's assume, it was magic. If so, why it was never acknowledged, but instead we hear laughable mumbling about HOX genes? These inconsistencies at some point become just really hard to bear. Without giving away too much of the ""plot"", or the lack of such, all ends pretty bad. Namely, after a spectacular animation sequence, which makes no sense whatsoever, all gets back to quasi normal, except there is an alien clone (or two?) in our midsts. The end. Of course, one also has to wonder, if it all was just a lie by the lead character. If so, why so elaborate? And what really, really happened with that ""little green man"" at the lighthouse...

We see a bunch of ordinarily talented actors degenerate into a performance matching those of D-list extras. I hope they did not get paid.But as Critics would remind us, the movie bombed in the box-office (11mill on opening weekend as opposed to 40mill budget) because we movie-goers are basically stupid and we don't 'get it'.

I mean, come on- all-female cast, diverse as rainbow cast- black, white, pink, maroon...a hint of same-sex or homoerotic tension, some cool inter-racial stuff..we must celebrate it even if the plot is shallower than the valley girls and the CGI that seems fakery made up by a 8th grader in mainland China.

839,Comic_Central,A Good Example of Style Over Substance?,6,23 March 2019,"Annihilation is a 2018 science-fiction film with a splash of horror thrown in. The film is based on the first book of the Southern Reach trilogy of the same name. The film is directed by Alex Garland and features Natalie Portman, Tessa Thompson and Oscar Isaac to name a few.
The plot is a very intriguing one from the get go as it is about a biologist that served in the army that decides to sign up for a secretive expedition into the strange Area X where the laws of nature that we are familiar with don't apply. All in all, I was very impressed with the story and the plot all together and it flowed relatively well. There were some pacing issues with parts of the plot that I think could have sorted out with an extra ten or fifteen minutes added.
An example of where I would have liked the scene to go on for a little longer to flesh out the characters motivations at that particular time was the infamous bear scene where the bear comes into the house where they are staying. I wish the suspense was built a little more before we seen the bear was in the house, maybe from some screams from outside or something of the sorts. The first act also could have been cleaned up with inconsistent pacing issues throughout it. Despite these issues the plot is still intriguing and well crafted.
The characters are were the movie falls of the rails. The characters weren't entirely memorable or very interesting as they were very one dimensional besides for Natalie Portman's character who they attempted to make relatable and to make us have an emotional connection with the character but I just didn't. Don't get me wrong, there was some connections you could make with the character but because of the writing of the character there wasn't much of a connection with the main character like I wanted and if the character died, I don't think that I would have felt much, maybe a bit disappointed but also would have felt cheated at such a cliché. Despite this, she was the best written character in the movie and was interesting to an extent.
The other characters were very poorly written as well, relying too heavily on exposition from the characters to explain them rather through visually showing us a lot of stuff. There was some visual storytelling to flesh out the characters but was only used after the exposition of the characters was already done. The things that they said a character was I didn't really feel they were or it was just done in a very questionable way. For example, in John Wick it is stated that, in summary, John Wick is not a character that you want to mess with (that is an understatement) and we can clearly see that in his character. But we don't get much, in this movie, to reinforce what the exposition told us, in an effective manner anyway.
When one of the characters said another of the characters was a cutter in the movie to Natalie Portman's character I was thinking, 'Really? They are going to tell us that instead of show us?'. We do see the cuts on her arm before that character dies but it didn't need that exposition or leave the exposition very vague. For example, Natalie Portman's character could have seen her wrists when her long sleeve shirt moved up a little bit. She seen that she was looking and pulls her sleeve down, giving her a look and then avoiding eye contact. She then gets up and walks off to see if another of the characters needs help. This would have been more effective character development rather than the exposition, showing us a lot about the character without telling us.
The motivations are also pretty poorly fleshed out as well. The man character (Portman) has her motivations fleshed out well but the others it is done very poorly, which instantly makes you not have an emotional investment in the characters.
At this point, you may be reading and wondering why I am not using the characters names, rather the actors name or just calling them 'a character' (or a variant of that). Well, that is because their names didn't stick with me. They said them a few times throughout the movie but they just never really stuck, because of the placement of the names (which was commonly filled with exposition, which is disappointing). The characters are all female as well, which I know a lot of people might have been mad about, but it wasn't pushing it and the characters could have been gender swapped and it wouldn't have made a difference so that critique I don't feel is valid in this case. The main character despite the poor writing was actually not a strong female character but a just a strong but flawed character, which is what many movies lack nowadays.
I would argue that the plot is story based rather than character based so this doesn't destroy the entire experience for me.
The visuals of this movie are very well done and it is a visually 'pretty' movie. This is my first movie I have seen that Alex Garland has directed and I have to say, I am a fan of his visuals. They are a stand out of the movie and the scenery is one of the most memorable things from this movie. The visuals themselves are utilized in a way that makes the worldbuilding very unique and visual (which is sad I can't say the same about all of this movie). Of course, the worldbuilding isn't just all visual and it does have some exposition to it, which was essential in creating this narrative.
The CGI is quite impressive in a lot of the cases such as the bear and the crocodile are both expertly done. However, in some cases for example the world around the characters is quite obviously green screen in some cases and the CGI structures seem a little odd and out of place, which they are supposed to be, but they could have made them blend into the environment a little better than what they were. The ending CGI with the alien was well done and I understand why the CGI was a little odd in this part, which, I would assume is to make the alien look more alien but the CGI is not out of this world. Not just the alien in that scene looks rubbery, the construct the alien forms from is very odd as well. By the looks of it, most of this movie will not age well and in about ten years' time the movie's CGI will be very inconsistent (more than what it looks like now).
The CGI of the gore is very well done and reminded me of Mortal Kombat a lot. The graphic nature and well-rendered gore make it look as if it was hyper-real Mortal Kombat. Great examples of good CGI gore and violence is when the bear bites the jaw of one of the characters and the tongue lolls around or the structure of the deceased soldiers' skeletons looks quite cool and nice (in a disturbing sort of way). The spot that stands out the most is the footage the expedition group we follow finds where the soldiers cut open a fellow soldier and his intestines are moving inside of his stomach.
The acting was also at times strange. At times it was very good and impressive such as the scenes with Oscar Isaac and Natalie Portman had very good acting. The chemistry between the two played out well on the screen and her reactions when she found her husbands recordings of when he was inside Area X were well acted. Most of the acting was very dull and not much emotion seemed charged behind the delivery of their lines, there was still emotion there just not as much as other lines and made some scenes fall flat. In other scenes the acting is incredible such as in the ending scene with the alien. Natalie Portman felt like she was happy to be doing the movie in parts and put her all in it and sometimes it felt like she just wanted to get the film done. Oscar Isaac delivered a very good performance, one that I would imagine be a stand out in his career despite his relatively small role in the film.
A lot of criticism in this film comes from the alien scene at the end which attempts to mimic her. A lot of people see this as quite confusing, which loses them, but I disagree with this a lot. This scene is one of the most powerful in the movie with it representing the character fighting against herself and her inner demons, which I thought was a relatively easy concept to grasp, but I guess not. With minimal dialogue throughout this whole scene it showed that Alex Garland is a very skilled visual story teller, so I don't know why he didn't use this skill throughout the entire film.
All in all, this film is highly entertaining and it had me gripped almost all the way through it, with only small times where I got bored (mostly in the first act). I recommend watching this film if you are a fan of sci-fi horror films but just be warned that it does favor style over substance with a good balance only in some parts throughout the film. With all things considered this film is a 6/10. Not bad but not particular great.",Annihilation
840,isaacroccoco,Engaging and interesting even with a big scientific wtf.,8,20 June 2018,"Good sci-fi. I'd also consider it sci-fi/horror where the horror element comes from the fear of the unknown which can be as powerful as any alien monster and is masterfully played. The horror seemed to come more from the results of what was happening than from aliens themselves. Intellectual curiosity kept me watching the slowly developing plot which felt necessary to the story in discovering the mechanisms of what was happening and was not boring. What I found to be face palm inducing was that the team was sent into the ""Shimmer"" (after numerous teams never came back except one man who was suffering some sort of internal trauma) without bio-hazard suits or any sort of protection from what was believed to be a growing ecological disaster of an alien nature. This would NOT happen in a scientific investigation with military oversight (as the movie ""Arrival""). But I guess with it they wouldn't be exposed which would be sort of plot wrecking. Natalie Portman was excellent and J.J. Leigh was on spot on.I'll have to read the book to figure out the difference of what happened to Lena & Kane vs Dr Ventress.",Annihilation
841,krisdimoski,"Cheap visuals, looks like a TV Movie?",2,12 March 2018,"Where do I start.. The movie is part of the new Hollywood movement where we have only females as leading characters (which is completely normal except that it feels a bit forced in this movie for me). What really annoyed me from the start of the movie is the fact that the story starts with the same old cliche that a lot of sci-fi movies follow. What i mean by this is we have couple of completely naive or should i say ignorant scientists (some of them are not even scientists but random women with a lot of issues) that go into an area which is contaminated without any gear or proper equipment. As the story develops you quickly begin to realize that they have a lot of troubled personalities (they are supposed to be handpicked scientists) which is basically part of the plot of every bad sci-fi movie.
Some of the scenes are completely ridiculous, like the moment where one of the girls gets attacked and the others including the team leader just freeze and you have only Natalie Portman trying to deal with the situation. Besides the things that i pointed out i think the story seemed unique but sadly the execution was done poorly.
The visuals in this movie seemed so cheap to me and my friends that watched the movie with me that makes me wonder if we watched the same movie with the people who praise the movie for its look. As the title of the review says this looks like a TV sci-fi movie at best!",Annihilation

What do you get if you blend 'Solaris' (1972 & 2002), 'Stalker' (1979), 'Southern Comfort' (1981), a dash of 'Tomb Raider III' video game (1998) and a hefty slug of HP Lovecraft's 'The Colour Out of Space' (1927)? Apparently, this. But rather than a mish-mash of ingredients and loose ends, this is actually very good. Alex Garland directs at a smooth, measured pace that suits the story well, it is beautifully filmed, does not demand a lot from the viewer, and is worth a good look.
There is no need to re-hash the simple plot here. There are some gruesome bits, some effective shocks, and a somewhat duff 'wave of the hand' climax, and performances are (as military teams in survival movies are prone to say) 'by the numbers'. Sciencey Stuff is kept to a minimum; a nod to Hox Genes is about all there is, and all that is needed in this context.
Please drive through if you're looking for 2 hours of heavily armed Space Marines zapping bugs, a genre-defining (or -redefining) epiphany, or have difficulty spelling your name.

To me, the writing felt like it was done by a smart Middle-Schooler: smart enough to understand some science concepts and have a few interesting ideas, but too naive in the world to create realistic or logical human behavior. There are just too many times that things occur that have no sense or logic. I'm not talking about the ""alien"" aspect, which is supposed to be somewhat mysterious and incomprehensible, but about the way that the humans in the story act or react to what's going on. The way that the government is handling the phenomenon seems strangely hands-off for what should be the most important event in the history of humanity, and the individuals involved make lots of odd decisions just to drive the story forward.On top of that, there is a framing device where a survivor is being interrogated about the events of what is shown throughout the movie, and it not only doesn't provide any additional illumination to bother with the clunkiness, it tends to deflate a lot of the tension by giving away certain plot points before you see them on screen. The ending is more just vague for the sense of being mysterious rather than making you really ask questions afterward. I suspect that if you asked the Director how the ending related to the rest of the movie, he would't be able to give more of an answer than he wanted things to be left open-ended.Finally, the characters are all fairly morose and sedated. There's a (weak) explanation in the movie for this, but the overall low energy makes you not care too much about any of the characters.",Annihilation
865,eddyhate,Why is that movie so loved?,3,15 March 2018,"I'm actually really asking myself the question I used as a title for this review.
This movie is bad, real bad. there's barely real dialogs and when they do talk it's really nothing good, the writing is weak and the text are total crap, you don't really learn what's happening and the characters in this movie all seem really pathetic and suicidal for the better part of them, acting ain't that good either. I love Oscar Isaac but in this one, any other actor could have played this role and nobody would have cared because he is only a character they used to make the story make sens and try and make us root for the main character.the rythm of the movie is slow, they take too much time with scenery and try and show off their bad special effects, seriously I think SyFy made better movies with better effects than this, yes they may have done it b accident but they still do better than this movie sometimes. the thing that really bothered me about this movie is like I said already the characters are pathetic and there is no dimension to them, they are really generic in the way they are shown, it's like they have just one emotion per actor and did not have the right to use any other expressions than totally depressed, hysteric or suicidal, why make such boring dialogs that lead nowhere and bring nothing to the story? it just doesn't make sens if you want to make people like the characters root for them to survive, because surviving is the only thing they have to do and they don't do a good job at it and that showed that the director did not have anything to make the story make sens for the viewers. What story? lost boyfriend, mysterious phenomena, something playing games with their minds, but no meaning to it, things are happening for absolutely no reasons and at the end of this long boring storyless movie, you get what nothing original, the complete movie is not original, they took so many bits of other stories that you can almost see from what movie they took those ideas, the questioning of purpose and humanity and love and people etc... so close to The Sphere I couldn't help but seeing the similarities, even the movie rythm kinda mimics The Sphere, slow pace phycological science fiction flick, at least in the Sphere you kinda get absorbed in the story and learn to like the characters, not just find them pathetic and boringly depressed.The end was so much like about a thousand other movies, where the ""alien"" takes the form of humans an than you see that they are up to no good, that made me laugh and even more dislike this ""movie"".for me a movie is not just about beautiful picture and somekind of love story, no it's more of a story told with images that make us feel and imagine and want to see more and hear more of that story, but this movie was just showing images with bad special effects and no reason why they showed so much of it, they were almost no moment in this film that needed us to see so much of crap.It's rare i write reviews but I don't agree with the high rating on this movie and believe that people who do like it, don't like movies with a real story, a reason for things to happen or even just amusing.don't watch this movie it's not worth your time.",Annihilation

Alex Garland was one of my favorite directors, and I couldn't wait to see this movie after hearing that he will be making the adaptation of the novel. And now I don't know what to believe anymore.It's basically him saying to VanderMeer ""I love your book and I'm going to make a movie based on it. But let me change this... and this... and this...

874,kristina-d-80904,"Beautiful, yet ruined",6,14 March 2018,"""Annihilation"" is the film I looked forward to after seeing the trailer. I expected a serious film with serious plot and characters, not the usual hiccups we see in films that are, by now, seen a thousand times...and by that I mean characters that are slow, slow-paced scenes for no reason, characters being careless and irresponsible, usual things happening as in gun getting stuck, or leaving weapons behind, lacking proper survival instincts, etc etc etc.
Unfortunately, this film had all of that in it and I found it painful to watch it in some moments. It should have gone a bit faster, there was no need for characters being sooooo slow, those scenes just made me go 'oh come on hurry up already!'...
Why does it take them so long to take a gun and shoot a bear? 
Why does a gun jam when they're about to shoot a giant crocodile?
Why are there repeatable scenes in the film, I have to say that I really found that 'intimate' scene out of place. I understand we had to see she cheated on her husband, but must that scene repeat twice?
Every film nowadays needs to have these sudden inappropriate scenes that make me sweat under my clothes when watching films with family. Could have packed that better...
Apart from that, the characters were beyond naive and just bad. Unprepared, making silly conclusions and acting completely out of place as if the place was absolutely safe and that it was totally all right to drag things on and wait for the night to fall!
Everyone sleeping over in the watchtower for safety...with doors open, with one person keeping guard in a miniature building below the watchtower? That scene had me so confused...why not all stay together and protect each other that way? Close the door and stay on the higher ground as a group!
Going out into the forest to look for the missing team member...on her own, going far...aware that there's a huge bear/predator that killed her? Yes these are such huge flaws and I can't believe it how such things just keep happening in every film that shows such huge potential.
""The Arrival"" also showed a ton of potential, but my my was it slow...it dragged on and on and on...""Annihilation"" had huge potential, the effects are gorgeous, the subject is interesting and something that showed a lot of promise, I loved the plot and the idea of the Shimmer, but why oh why did it have to be done in such a naive way? 
The atmosphere was sooo good, so was the soundtrack. Had the film been scrapped off of these useless moments and sped up a little so characters aren't slow as snails when having to react...I'd give it a 10/10.
Unfortunately, I am giving it a 6/10. 6 primarily because of soundtrack, effects and interesting plot. Other than that, a hugely missed opportunity.",Annihilation

This film flattened the story to a 'Predator' type jungle escapade, with a weak acting and bad special effects. It we would be left with 'Star-ship Troopers' experience without trying to ingest a complex story that the book is trying to share - I presume that with starts like Natalie Portman or Jennifer Jason Leigh - that could be an even an interesting experience.

And I don't mean it like the aliens or the DNA mutation or whatever.
I mean the decision making of those characters were NOT something normal people would do.From the start, this situation is serious. Like ""ALIEN"" SERIOUS. But the people acted like they don't give a damn. NOT ONE SANE PERSON GIVE A DAMN.So the meteor landed there, this should tip off NASA and it would be a big news, but no, no one know about it.Then there is this weird force field around the place the meteor landed
This should friggin alert EVERYONE IN THE WHOLE PLANET EARTH.ok they might just cover it us so easy as a chemical leak. BUT HEY, THE GOVERNMENT STILL KNOW THE TRUTH. But they still let it be for many years. YEARS. They sent team in, no-one came out. They sent team in again, and again, and again, AND AGAIN FOR MANY YEARS THEY CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME THING THAT ALREADY KNOW IT WOULD FAIL. Like they don't really give a damn weather mission will succeed or not. Is this not some pressing issue? where are the intelligence unit? the technology? analysis? counter measure?There is NONE. And the LUCKILY THE BIOLOGIST DID IT.
THE END.WHERE IS ALL THE LOGIC GO??Not to mention the dreadful pace of the story. The team talking in whisper, then walk, then talk, then dream, then talk in whisper. And the dialog is just depressing. Since everyone there were suicidal to begin with. Everything they do, act, talk, is all depressing. Especially the psychiatrist, she can barely talk normally, who the hell allowed her to join this mission?",Annihilation

883,alexmichalski,"Dumb, with some fun to be had.",4,21 February 2019,"Annihilation seems to have some mixed reviews, and I can understand why. I didn't particularly enjoy this film, but at the same time I can understand why some people love it.There are two scenes that I enjoyed. The scene where three of the protagonists are tied to chairs while a mutated bear hunts for them is genuinely really scary; the visual design of the bear, the fact that the characters are tied down, the way that the bear sounds like a tortured version of the previously killed woman, and the fact that it kills another character in such a brutal and quick way makes this scene terrifying.The other scene I liked was the final ""battle"", if you can call it that. Natalie Portman's character finds herself at the lighthouse, the location the group were trying to get to, on her own. There she sees some amazingly designed horrors that would be ruined if I described them here. A human-like being then forms, mimicking her, and nearly kills her. This whole scene is weird and incredible, and a wonderful ending to the film.Unfortunately, these are the only scenes I enjoyed. The rest of the film was boring and generic, and the wild contrast between these two scenes and the rest of the film is really strange, and makes it feel like two different films unnaturally spliced together.",Annihilation

888,mirrorsystemx,"I recommend it, especially for fans of the Sci-fi",10,2 January 2021,"Yes, this movie is definitely in my own 'Top 100' list. The horror, sci-fi, montages, etc. are on place. I don't remember where exactly I watched it 2 years ago, but I see the title on Netflix, so there's one place to check it out. Really good, though, tbh, it's still in a need of continuation (that I'd definitely watch if there comes such later on). I'd consider giving 9,5/10 if I could, due to some minor reasons, but nah. It deserved the high assessment from me.",Annihilation
889,tha-13,Purgatory revisited,9,13 March 2018,"Thanks to Netflix for giving the Alex Garland room for this masterfully produced sermon. The Oxford atheist turned Christian; C.S.Lewis learned from St. Augustine and him from The old book, that all is created good, but evil is a perversion or a distortion of the true image in which all is created. So evil is lack of true good as in misuse, lie, unfaithfulness - all these vices are destructive since they are lesser foods for the true food that all souls hunger for (turning into idols). This great movie is a classic pilgrimage to the lighthouse (I am the light of the world) by 5 women turned in some way by their choices or by loss into less than they where memt to be. The story in this fine biblical narrative is An Uncreation taking place, since evil is a parasite on being and hence must dissolve it self in the end into a mere shadow (like the result of a phosphorus explosive) - but ONE drop of blood (Calvary) may restore all and shame and sin will be washed away. What comes of that NEW CREATION The part takers won't even know. This is 17th century Milton's ""Paradise Lost"" and ""Paradise Regained"" in great new setting. Bless Your heart guys for making this.",Annihilation
890,joeytosi,SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THIS BRILLIANT FILM,10,20 March 2018,"If you are looking to shut your brain off and be entertained and led by the nose, skip this film. If you are looking for a cinematic experience that gives back to you in a profound way like 2001, Solaris, Stalker, The Tree of Life, The Fountain, The Thin Red Line, Under The Skin, Enemy, 8 1/2, La Dolce Vita, Blade Runner (directors cut), Dead Man, Days of Heaven, Upstream Color, Wild Strawberries, or even The Phantom Thread - you will really like this film. It's a one-of-a-kind gem that strikes at the heart of a matter that touches many people on the planet, and is honest about the effects of betrayal within a marriage.I feel that this movie will polarize many audience members because it is a film that asks you to reflect upon your identity, or at least the identities of the two main characters, Lena and Kane. The film is about trauma within interpersonal relationships, specifically sexual betrayal and everything that goes with that. The story is a giant and beautifully crafted metaphor for how relationships work, how we see ourselves when we are in one, and how the self-destructive tendencies that reside in one of the people in the relationship destroy (or annihilate) the identity of the innocent partner, who experiences the betrayal as a trauma similar to combat PTSD or cancer or addiction or the loss of a child. In a film with a lot of subtext, this is the driving theme. This experience is often overlooked by our western culture because of the stigma of shame that can accompany it. But not in this film.It makes the point that until we can be vulnerable enough to face our true selves, we won't have the power to change our self-destructive behaviors, because we won't understand ourselves enough to know why the self destructive behavior exists in the first place. It also makes the point that once a trauma has happened in the relationship, the relationship profoundly changes forever, as do the people in it. In the case of Lena and Kane, they decide to try and love each other in the aftermath of this affair, but are both forever changed by the experience. This film is layered with many amazing psychological metaphors and challenges the audience all the way through, but in an engaging way that never gets boring. It all connects and makes sense. The trick to unraveling this mystery is to see the experience of the main character as a metaphorical self journey to gain empathy for what she has put her husband through.",Annihilation

894,maxdetroit,A modern Stalker,7,15 March 2018,"Who wants to see a down to earth Sci Fi movie in a traditional sense is wrong here. This movie is a reminiscent of the movie ""Stalker"" where a group of men goes into a mysterious forbidden zone to find a room where wishes get granted.Here we have a group of women who venture into a mysterious zone, and they are looking for a lighthouse, and every one has their own individual wishes, problems and motives. But the journey here is also more a test of the mind then anything else. So in conclusion the movie deals more with psychological issues about identity, changes, and self destruction tendencies than with action scenes and survival.On the surface it may look like a traditional Sci Fi movie, but like Stalker or Odyssee 2001 it has a lot of layers that are open to the interpreation of the viewer. For Example: You could see it as a metaphor of the relationship of Lena and Kane that was tested by a an affair. And while Kane (in a psychological way) was broken and changed and turned into a differnet person after this affair, Lena stayed in her identity but had a hard fight with herself. But this is just one possible interpreation of one layer of the movie and it may be totally far-fetched. But I believe this movie wants to be open for different views and interpreations, without tellling you what is right or wrong.",Annihilation

Yes, the highly trained group of military personnel all failed inside the shimmering thus you send a group of scientists, the least capable people in there to investigate? Are you kidding me with this kind of settings? Is that the best the government could come up with?When I go watch a sci-fi I expect it to be reasonable and logical.

897,bOOnish,Clearly no Sci-Fi movie. Unclear what it is...,3,25 December 2018,"First of all I'd like to point out that this is NOT a Science Fiction movie.
For 80% of the reviews it seems to go without saying that it IS a Sci-Fi movie. Hoewever I don't see why it could be classified that way.
Of course, there seems to be something extraterrestrial. But since the movie does not explain anything and stays vague and mystical till the end, there obviously is no science in this fiction.But if it's not Sci-Fi, what is it then? Hard to tell. As I already stated, the whole movie is quite vague and mystical. There really aren't much hints (and certainly no explanation) about what is going on in the ""world"" of Annihilation. And since you don't get to know what's happening, you can't really classify the movie. Just from the things that are shown and said, I'd call it a rather bad mystery thriller. But I also see that a lot of people seem to describe it as some kind of metaphor for a psychological disorder.",Annihilation
898,plamen_xp_lv,An..other dissapointment,6,18 August 2018,"Another title I have to classify under ""Great idea/concept, terrible end product"". 
As many others have already said, this is a mess, full of pretty visuals, philosophy and psychology, yet devoid of real substance. I am not sure that even the crew, director and actors knew what they were aiming for. Is is a thriller? A horror? A drama? Sci-fi? I can only tell you what it wasn't-deep and existentialist, as they most probably wanted it to be. Too many plot holes, some phenomenal in its scope lazy writing. People already mentioned why there is almost no logic and common sense to be found in the scientific team's actions and motives, I am not gonna repeat it. Oh, the idea behind the movie was more than promising. But instead of making a decent Sci-Fi action movie with some thriller and horror elements, or to fully go for a deeper, more philosophic film, something like Arrival or Solaris, they went for a mix of all these, failing completely to present a finished and polished end product. Plus, the pace at time was unbearably slow, further killing any joy from the movie. I give it 5 stars only because of the nice visuals, the likeable (but not memorable enough) character of the biologist, and the great premise, even though I felt dissapointed at the end.",Annihilation

I won't repeat them here (no spoilers), but there is a LOT of them and they really did prevent me from engaging with the movie.At times the cinematography was very good, but the CGI was rather clunky at several points. The cast have very little to work with and their performances reflect that. There was far too much exposition, too many pointless flashbacks, very little character development and it was hard to care about any of the characters or engage with any of the situations in which they found themselves.Annihilation, for the most part, felt vacuous and pretentious. However, at times, it did look very pretty - and I'm afraid that's about the nicest thing I can say about it.Pretty poor effort - 4/10",Annihilation
902,adam-m-fontenot,"As good as concept sci-fi gets, these days",8,24 February 2018,"I've seen convincing arguments that someone like Kubrick couldn't exist in 2018. Any director with a budget large enough to truly innovate will be constrained by the studios' demand to produce something digestible for mainstream audiences. Space Odyssey and The Shining are too difficult for modern audiences. We're too impatient. We demand to understand. This makes it rather unsurprising that Paramount chickened out and sold the international rights for Annihilation to Netflix in order to recoup some of the costs, an already low-budget picture as far as major studio sci-fi flicks go. This suggested to me that Annihilation was trying to do something bold and original, and I was right. Let's get this out of the way first. If your model of good sci-fi is Blade Runner, Alien, or Space Odyssey, you're going to be disappointed by Annihilation. That's to be expected. But if you're ready to see something new and interesting that compares favorably with (say) Ex Machina, Annihilation is a godsend. There's so much it does right, in terms of pacing, characterization, and music. The stuff of good movie-making is all here. Thematically, it grasps hold of its subject (human beings delve into Nature's heart of darkness), and sees it through remarkably. Portman puts in a solid performance as a scientist with secrets, and her character's arc is equally determined by both her human nature and her surroundings. Jennifer Jason Leigh also does a wonderful job, fresh off her performance in Twin Peaks (The Return). The real fireworks of the movie happen when the human, natural, and supernatural all collide. I'll say no more about the plot, however. This is one film which one should go into cold if possible.Let me also say a little about what goes wrong. The primary problems stem from the studio-driven affordances I've been complaining about. There's much needless use of voice-over and flashback to drive the narrative, which would flow much better if it developed naturally. The need to see and understand generates a reliance on CGI in places that would be better served by practical effects (or none at all). It doesn't help that the CGI is often quite bad. The writing is a bit threadbare at times, and features a couple of unintended laugh-out-loud moments and painfully faux-scientific explanations.All that's to say that the film could be better. But there's so much bravery in the attempt that it's hard not to love. Go see Annihilation, and support some of the best high concept sci-fi to hit the big screen in a while.",Annihilation
903,dperlis,I really tried to like this,3,28 January 2019,"I wanted so badly to like this movie. I actually did enjoy it until the end. It is visually pleasing and the special effects kept me riveted. My problem with the movie came *after* it ended. Once I started thinking. Sure, there are inconsistencies, but it's just a movie. Plot holes don't bother me as long as I'm entertained. My issue was after the movie ended and I got to thinking.....it was like the whole movie unraveled. Spoilers ahead.....stop reading now if you haven't seen the movie ......It is revealed in the end that Lena is not Lena. It is an entity that stole her identity to leave the Shimmer. The whole movie is flashbacks narrated by the entity.....so....basically.....the whole movie is a lie. Everything we just watched may or may not have happened. Maybe there was a bear, maybe there wasn't. Maybe these are Lena's actual experiences in the Shimmer, or maybe this is just a story the entity made up. For all we know, Lena died second she walked into Shimmer and this entity made up the entire story. I'm not a fan of movies that basically end with ""just kidding.""",Annihilation

I know everyone has their own favourite Genre of movies, typically horror, paranormal anything related to those topics, I'm all over it!!! This time, I pretty much demanded 1 1/2 hours of my life back. It jumps all over the place. First, Natalie portman plays a biologist, who investigates everything upon going into the Shimmer. Natalie portman always plays, best of the best roles. Nothing less than a dr or a scientist for her. Granted she IS a great actress, but she should of stuck to Star wars or Marvel Cinenamatic Universe. I grew very tired the first 20 minutes, when she was having flash backs of her husband, before her husband went into THE SHIMMER. The monster or MUTATED BEAR that ate her colleague, that also used the voice of her dead colleague, was LAME. Then it goes back to her sleeping with a black guy that she had an affair with. This movie is also pretty much PC to the point, of ""I am woman, here me roar"" theme is growing old with me. All female, military, and big role playing, for dr. physiologist, etc. Hollywood needs to lay off that, and just make descent movies. So, if you're into the MUTATED theme, this movie is for you. If not, don't bother you will get bored the first 20 minutes, with repeated flash backs of Natalie portman's character having sex with her husband and affair that her character had with a black guy. It left us hanging with her asking if the clone was her husband Cane. Yes, this movie also made clones after she destroyed THE SHIMMER. I'm sure that the book was better.

I had heard all about it when it had first released on Netflix but never got around watching it until now (As of April 14 2019) and to be completely honest, I expected more than what people were telling what it was.I tried to like Annihilation but just found the film to be extremely slow, just barely keeping myself interested by the ideas and themes the film presented. That is all I can give Annihilation credit for, it's themes of cosmicism and Lovecraftian-esque storytelling. The Shimmer is also a terrifying yet beautiful location with a cool concept behind it, as well as the final scene which is very unique in this day and age with how it portrays an alien and how it deals with such a concept. Other than that, it was uninteresting and suffers from poor pacing, as well as undeveloped and uninteresting characters.4/10",Annihilation

I enjoyed everything about this movie. Including the fact that I had to watch it 3 times to really understand it. I want a movie that makes me think, or search for answers. And this definitely did that....This movie is different. Original. Complicated. Puzzling. You have to unwrap it and consider it. Thank you Mr Garland! Brilliant effort!",Annihilation
924,CharlesAncelle,Beyond a terrible adaptation,1,23 February 2018,"It seems Alex Garland self-admittedly decided to take the concept of an adaptation very loosely, apparently only reading the first book the film is based on (which is part of a trilogy) once, and allegedly, writing the screenplay from his memory, 'like a dream.'Now I don't want this review to be about how the film compares to the book, everyone hates that. It is a given that a film is going to be different from the book, it always will be and that's fine - and that was clearly the intention here. Besides, the book itself is a real challenge to adapt, and Garland probably saw it that way, hence his decision to depart from the source material as much as possible.The problem is that, unfortunately, the result is absolutely awful nonetheless.Let me try to summarize the premise without spoiling too much:
Natalie Portman joins a scientific expedition in an area that has been quarantined for the past three years, from which nobody has ever returned, with the exception of her husband, who seems to have lost all his memories of his time there.
As she begins to explore said area, she quickly discovers that the laws of physics seem to have changed there, and that the environment is hostile to human life.That is a very great premise with a ton of potential for a thrilling movie.
Somehow, it seems Alex Garland thought that he would use his fifty-five million dollar budget to make his own version of 2001, but sadly, he failed at that too.
The first half hour of the film meanders in pointless exposition scenes and excruciating attempts to make us care about any of the characters. Natalie Portman focuses all her attention on looking tough and depressed, which only succeeds at alienating us from her completely. By the time the expedition into Area X begins, we have already completely lost interest in the film. Yet it goes from bad to worse. I expected the story to at least gain some momentum once the expedition would start, but instead, Garland chose to continually slow everything down with pointless flashbacks of more of what already turned the first act into a borefest.But not only is the second act as boring as the first act, which in itself is a significant achievement, it also turns out to abandon any form of logic or character development.
Under the pretext that the members of the expedition are supposed to 'go crazy,' Alex Garland lazily makes them do whatever he wants them to in order to serve his otherwise completely bland and uninspired plot.
The characters go from place to place without any logic or reason in a very Blade Runner 2049 fashion just to fill out the space while no tension is built or additional information really given.
Characters continually spout out exposition based on rough observations they make on the spot - to a degree that is laughable by anyone who has ever opened the most basic science book in their life.The main thread is also continuously interrupted by an interrogation scene that adds absolutely nothing to the movie, except additional overexplanations of what is happening that are already pretty heavy handedly over explained by the characters going through it - I wish I could quote some of the most awful lines, however, without context, they wouldn't make any sense, but let me just state that the film contains some of the most horrible dialogue I have heard in recent years, and there has been plenty of horrible dialogue in recent years.Eventually, we reach a third act that is simply as flat as the previous two, but turns into a pseudo psychedelic 2001 inspired sequence at some point that is supposed to inspire awe and wonder in its audience, but can only generate contempt or at the very least, mockery, whether it is with the pathetic CGI that makes the movie look like an episode of Quantum Leap or Sliders, or the ridiculous concept it is trying to represent which essentially feels like a 3rd grade summary of philosophy for dummies.Fascinatingly, nothing saves this movie in any way. The already terrible cinematography is constantly worsened by awful looking CGI flares that attempt to create an eerie atmosphere and instead constantly remind the audience that, yes, there is CGI everywhere. And then, Natalie Portman really struggles to bring any life to her performance, and one can't really blame her for it either: what could she possibly do when her character is written so superficially, when there is nothing human about who she is supposed to embody? The same goes for the supporting cast, which is as robotic as Ava was in Ex-Machina. Except that, this time, it shouldn't be that way.",Annihilation
925,S-Hite-Forbranes,A Recipe for Annihilation.,2,16 April 2019,"Take four parts of Tarkovksy's Stalker, four parts of Roadside Picnic by the Strugatsky brothers, two parts of H.P. Lovecraft's The Colour from Space and mix thoroughly, add a few pinches of Tarkovsky's Solaris to spice, and garnish with a dash of the psychedelic ending of Kubrick's 2001. Serve with a generous helping of ""Hey we're all highly trained professionals, let's all panic and do really stupid things"" from Ridley Scott's Prometheus and VOILA you have a highly unoriginal cinematic feast called Annihilation, that's guaranteed to give anyone who is familiar with the individual ingredients severe indigestion.WTF? Why not just do a modern adaptation of Roadside Picnic rather than this plagiaristic ""Homage?"" I'm sure Tarkovsky purists would be mortified at the thought of Hollywood re-making Tarkovsky again (George Clooney in Solaris anyone? Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Stalker! Just yanking ya chain Tarkovsky fans, don't hate on me). There's no need to re-make Tarkovsky's Stalker as it was only very loosely based on Roadside Picnic which was a far more traditional science fiction tale than Tarkovsky's metaphysical, existential, philosophical exploration. According to Tarkovsky, the only things the film has in common with the source novella are the Stalker and the Zone (although the Stalker's wife and mutant daughter also feature in both).The dangers posed by the temporal and physical anomalies in the Zone as depicted in Roadside Picnic are perfect fare for a Hollywood Sci-Fi/Horror adaptation: The Meat Grinder, the Hell Slime, the mutated flora and the post-apocalyptic qualities of the Zone and everyday life after the ""Visitation"" (it even briefly features an appearance by the living dead, though it is not a ""Zombie"" tale by any means). With a good screenwriter and a good director this could be an intelligent, thought-provoking, existentialist sci-fi-horror. Film-makers like David Cronenberg (is he even still directing?), or David Lynch come to mind. Based on Eraserhead, David Lynch would be a perfect fit for interpreting the post-industrial wasteland feel of the novella and the Tarkovsky film adaptation.Anyway I digress, for anyone unfamiliar with the above ingredients, taking Annihilation as its own entity, it is still ultimately a very unsatisfying film. There are a few effective scares and eerie scenes with the mutations, but there are too many lapses in logic for my taste, and I just find Natalie Portman's acting bland and unconvincing. I don't think she is good enough to carry a film as the lead (I didn't mind Black Swan though I thought she was weak in the role). Also I don't think Alex Garland is that good a screenwriter, admittedly I enjoyed 28 Days Later and Dredd but I have been very underwhelmed by everything else he's done. As I understand this film is adapted from a series of novels, I assume the film-makers expected to produce sequels though it seems this was a box office bomb so that probably won't eventuate.",Annihilation

I had the same viewing experience after watching this as the 1st time.So if you're looking for a plot description you're not gonna get it from me, but I can tell you two or three things on why my view of the film hasn't change all that much.First it's a solid film but not fully commited to the ideas it's presenting. And a big letdown and what keeps me from loving it. Alex Garland of course is not stranger to sci-fi (watch the excellent Ex-Machina) has found creative ways to visualize the pages which this movie is adapted from but fails to keep a coherent structure.My conclusion is that it's a solid flick with good performances, goood ideas, here and there, not fully expanded to their potential. It's not commited to giving us either a crazy and abstarct film (2001) nor a intelligent and enviromental thriller with less confusing turns. It tries to explain some things, all within two or three lines of dialogue and puts you into visual trance and aberration only towards the finale. Meaning that it;s not all or nothing but some of this and some of that all blended together.I must say tho, the score in the final sequence is so thrilling and other wordly that almost makes my 2nd viewing worth it after all, just saying....",Annihilation

This movie is not horrible, but past the caliber of the cast, a fairly ordinary sci-fi flick. Think, invasion of the body snatchers, if it mutated with Aliens, but not really as good as either one of those. The cast did an admiral job for what they were given to do. Of the group though, I'd say the lead actor (Portman), gave the most ""going through the motions"" performance, but I was at least happy to see that they found an actor (Oscar Isaac) whose height best match that of her.

939,fraz_bd7,A Philo-Fiction than a Sci-fi,8,8 April 2018,"To me, Annihilation was more of a Philo-Fiction than a Sci-fi. I have to introduce a philosophical view to explain it. German philosopher Martin Heidegger saw all of existence, including- living beings, inanimate objects etc., as negation of 'Nothingness'. If you consider an empty glass- even if there is no water, the glass is still there. Considering pure vacuum, there is still the container. To him, Nothingness is the original state of everything. We are in that sense negation of a certain 'Nothing'. The Nothing I am talking here may or may not be something like Dark Matter or Dark Energy, but I leave the physical interpretation to you.(Spoilers)The 'Shimmers' place may have contained a different kind of 'Nothing' than that of our own. Did you notice how the light also had a strange glow? The new 'Nothing' acted like a prism made by a medium placed upon another, which refracted DNAs of different species like refracting light. Evident by the crocodile having teeth of shark, the surreal bear preserving the dying part of its victims' minds, the human shaped plants, finally the overall DNA mixture of the human characters from the time of entrance. When at the end Lena (Natalie Portman) asks if Kane was 'Kane', he replied no. I think, so wasn't Lena.There were Buddhist themes present in the film also. Like lives transforming from one form to other, shown by the uncanny event of the bear preserving dying mind as mentioned earlier. Only beings willing to embrace 'Nothing' through self-nihilation achieve Nirvana, as did the formed beings mirroring humans entering the light house. May be the final nihilation of the whole Shimmer place represented the new 'Nothing' diffusing with the original.The movie had a very unique theme, as opposed to the territorial alien invasion Sci-fis. When the investigation team asks Lena if there were any aliens left, she gave confusing answers - because there weren't any alien life forms present in the first place. The new 'Nothing', to me, remained in a diffused form with the original.",Annihilation

Our composition its due to the cosmic destiny, but, Why should we think thats the best way of developing life?.
Those and other questions are suggested during this two hours movie. 
Curiously, the cast is full of women, the only of the two gender that could giving birth, and it is produced in the lighthouse.

The acting on every character's part was great, especially the lead: Natalie Portman. As someone who is unfortunately super critical of unconvincing roles, Portman's character really stood out to me and felt real. Additionally, the amazing visuals seen before in ""Ex Machina"" definitely translate over to this work as well. The cinematography and images in ""Annihilation"" are hauntingly beautiful. I really enjoyed the way the film used aspects like genetic mutation and alteration to convey the theme of metamorphosis. The director, Alex Garland, is adept in producing suspenseful, intriguing stories, while still being able to work in powerful philosophical concepts that make audiences think.",Annihilation

The plot was all over the place and barely kept my attention. There were characters making questionable decisions, the absence of a coherent military presence, a serious lack of coherent story telling. I didn't mind the all female team that was sent in to investigate, another thing that didn't make sense was that they went in without any biohazard gear whatsoever and sent scientists in with fully automatic wespons and no training. The sex scenes that were thrown in there were for no apparent reason at all. You have to wait until the end of the movie to find out what The Shimmer was, and even then, they don't tell you exactly what it was. ""Oh, it's just some alien."" Why was it changing the environment? How did her husband's clone survive after The Shimmer was destroyed? So many unanswered questions and so little plot substance. For the life of me, I don't know how this got a theatrical release. Seriously, did the writers dream this up during an acid trip? I rented this for cheap and still feel ripped off.

Where Stalker is beautiful and mysterious, Annihilation isn't. There's guns, alien stuff, killer animals and moving organs. The beauty in Stalker, I find, is that it doesn't actually show weird stuff you would expect in the zone. It's just the characters and their mental state. Annihilation does this too, but way less deep.It also botheres me that we also see that whole affair Lena had before she entered the Shimmer. To me it just was pretty irrelevant to the plot. I also wonder why they showed Lena after she got out of the Shimmer so soon and let her spoil everything about who dies. Bit of a bummer. I just didn't like the switching from one storyline to another (I guess the storylines are kinda the same storyline, but you know...).

But it was, especially towards the end, so very weird. I wanted to understand what was going on and get all the answers, but as it just got weirder I lost some of the interest for a while, just to at the very end get some of it back again. You might say it was almost like being on a rollercoaster of weirdness, with a lot of that weirdness being of the good and beautiful kind. It's like being thrown into this mysterious and beautiful, yet dangerous and terrifying, world wanting to know and understand all about it but not really getting there. I would say that the end made up for some of that, at the same time as it blew your mind to pieces. A part of me still isn't exactly sure of what to think, but still can't help but to like it.The movie being based on a novel I looked it up, wondering if perhaps I wanted to read it, and found that it is the first novel of a trilogy.

I watched it at home (65"" plasma screen) with some pretty good equipment (DENON AVR and SSONY4K blu-ray player). The script... in the main, for me, left a lot to be desired. It seemed disjointed which contributed to a ""continuity lacking appearing"" story line. One moment something is taking place, and then before you know it, something else has occurred and you're wondering, ""how did we get here?"" Not that more back story was needed, but rather, more cohesion.

Everything just feels like it was shot in a tiny studio with green backgrounds, and adding fake plants doesn't make a jungle. The editing is incredibly ostentatious (the close-ups on the faces of the characters, in case you didn't really see what they were expressing). The acting is awful and feels exaggerated the entire time. Natalie Portman basically has the same look on her face throughout the entire thing (let it out Natalie, you'll feel better, or take a laxative). And my god is it a slow film. Even though we all know where they're going, and why, the movie spends a solid 20 minutes or so (it felt like an hour) to establish the premise.
And again, the CGI looks better in Sharknado... This film is an absolute waste of time that thinks it's a big thing. First time in my life I take/waste time to write a bad review. But people need to know this is complete crap.

989,higherborder,"Stunning, disturbing, beautiful and brutal",9,10 July 2018,"Annihilation left a deep impact on me. First of all, visually, it is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. And this is where the movie struck a chord. This beauty is combined with brutality, destruction and finally, death. One of the central themes, self-destruction was carefully explored through feelings of remorse, grief, sadness and ultimately, the fear that comes from not understanding our place in this world. This other world, or reality - The Shimmer, is tempting to the characters because it offers them a chance to discover something and maybe to give their life some meaning. Regardless of plot holes or inconsistencies, I think that the movie conveys its message very well. It explores the darkest places of our minds and it takes us on an incredible journey. Some of the scenes are a representation of true horror because they are instinctively disturbing and hard for us to process. The idea of a different world, a different life, and different evolution is a very interesting one and I think it was meant to push our boundaries when it comes to understanding life itself. The casting was also right on spot. Portman was more than able to shows us the layers of her grief, regret, and repressed anger. Jennifer Jason Leigh was excellent like she always is. Finally, Oscar Isac, even though he doesn't have a lot of screen time, manages to leave a mark with his subtle yet terrifying role.",Annihilation
990,guldo,An eerily beautiful movie,10,17 March 2018,"I see a lot of bad reviews on here, so let me add some contrast to the nay sayers' view of things. This is a really, really good one, I enjoyed it to the fullest. It's one of those flicks that moves something within me, and this is a rare thing these days. But the mystery, the beautiful horror of the scenery and happenings inside the shimmer, coupled with the perfect terror of the unexplained together with the eerie ambience, makes for a very intense experience. I can't really remember when I last felt this way about a movie. Unlike all the (apparently) Einsteins commenting here about their bruised intellects, broken logical pathways and such and yaddayaddayadda, I like to keep an open mind so for me this one's a brilliant movie.

991,mark-deckard,"A statement about chaos, order and the nature of consciousness",8,26 May 2018,"Annihilation seems to wraps very muscular set of arms around all the notions of origin of life, evolution and the meaning of existence. Its likely no coincidence Jennifer Jason Leigh played in the movie eXistence. It leaves us with a nagging question of whether or not chaos can produce order or if the only explanation for order is the existence of will. Without will and order biology is simply a very complex kind of cancer. If random mutation is truly random then there is no reason it should move slowly or quickly or that it should move at all or in any direction. Complexity and simplicity are meaningless without will ordering the systems. 
The ramifications of a will and order to life are the impetus behind drives such as loyalty and guilt and the inability to fulfill our desires with a simple replacement. Replacement is a big concept in this story. 
Trying to replace organisms and trying to replace relationships. There is hole in the lighthouse which may be a metaphor for the hole in our souls. In that hole is a malevolent yet meaningless thing that wishes to replace us. That thing must be destroyed by fire. The lighthouse is a warning for ships to watch thier course.

Nothing here to see except for some b grade visuals, fish tank corals pasted on trees, white christmas lights on trees and a bear with a racoons skull, if that is something that excites you.
Plot : I guess somebody was watching tv and stumbled on evolution and inception back to back and thought,hey why not take good points from both of those movies and screw them up completely.
Its stupid. If nothing that goes into a perimeter doesnt come back and that perimeter is eating your planet everyday for three years, if your best bet is to send some 5 random people witch cliched backstories without protective suits, atleast some secondhand gas masks into it, then your world is truly screwed.
The movie right away hints you about cloning cells and then shows you echoes the moment you enter into the shimmer. Then tries to be all cryptic and acts like the viewers are so dumb that they wont be able to figure out that the woman that came back out of the shimmer is a duplicate. like seriously ? The moment movie starts we see that there is an affair going on between that professor dude and the heroine. And the movie acts like its revealing its darkest secrets in two different scenes to reveal that they were cheating. LIKE GENIUS. i really didnt think of that.
The biologist just picks up virus samples without gloves, the people who didnt give a fck when these women wanted to enter the shimmer get all jacked up because one of them returns. And people freaking out over some lie that doesnt even mean jack to the actual mission going on just cuz the plot wants them to be.

999,iyergokul_9,Could've been much better,5,15 March 2018,"The real objective behind Annihilation remains shrouded in mystery and it can simply be misrecognized as an action packed adventure and contact with possibly an otherworldly being. However upon viewing, it is made clear that it is a character study of one's nature of self-destruction. It is evident that the movie draws inspiration from the monumental classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey, for its bold, idiosyncratic nature of storytelling and range of ambiguity from its segmental story-telling narrative. My main problems with the movie was how the main cast of the movie is assembled together. More emphasis is put on emotion and less on the scientific forefront. The characters are basically forced into a suicide mission and that is why the core narrative of the film feels forced. There is foreshadowing and ""symbolism"" that don't matter much to the context of the movie because the entire movie is seen upon from the perspective of Lena, a survivor of the expedition. In my opinion, it just makes the film unnecessarily broad and pseudo-ambiguous than it needs to be, and that can be associated with the ending. It comes to a halt where the consciousness of the mind has been jaded and where one's morality and the laws of physics itself are rendered as distorted. A cat and mouse game ensues where the initial interpretation is to perceive the blurring line between what's real and fake. Now this would've been much different if the movie took a more complete approach to the situation and not just focus one character's circumstances and the resolve to undertake the mission. Now I'm not saying all of it is bad, for the prism-like otherworldly entity that's being made contact with presents us with a fresh paradigm and it's definitely a film that is open to discussion. However my take-away from this is that the mastermind behind Ex Machina just couldn't hit the mark with this one.",Annihilation
1000,pajamawolfie,"Some good ideas here, but the execution fumbled.",6,28 February 2018,"First, I haven't read the book it was semi-based on. All I knew about the movie was from the trailer.I described the movie as ""It's like The Thing, if The Thing was sort of lame."" So these 5 women go into this slowly spreading extraterrestrial-infected area called the Shimmer, which looks like a bubble on the outside, with the faint swirling colors. Why 5 women? Someone notes that it's been almost exclusively men before, so let's try it. It's kind of a suicide mission anyway, they wanted to go, so why not? The movie didn't make a big deal out of it, and it didn't turn out to really make a difference in what happened.The interesting stuff: Lena and the psychologist have a conversation about how humans seem to self-destruct and sabotage themselves in one way or another, that it's inevitable. Lena talks about how God makes mistakes on a genetic level. Lena is a biologist who researches tumors. There are some tattoos that are really symbolic, though Lena's seems to show up halfway through the movie. (I thought it was on the paramedic at first, and that Lena assimilated her, but I was mistaken.) All these ideas end up juxtaposed with the Shimmer, where everything is in a constant state of growth and mutation. It's all around them in nature, then it infects them too. They react in different ways to this realization: one snaps, one gives up, one finds the source and assimilates into it, and Lena tries to fight it. But how can you fight it? You can't. You can only become it.There are some great scenes. The best is when a certain creature attacks them... absolutely horrifying and unforgettable. Also outstanding is when the women find a man who had something growing inside him, and it must have burst out of him because they find his skeleton stuck to a wall, his ribs and skull some 15 ft higher than his legs, all in a mass of colorful mold. They find a field with trees growing in the shape of people. Were they people at one point? We don't know, and it's fantastic.The cons: 
It takes a long time for the movie to get to the part with the Shimmer. 
I didn't feel attached to any of the characters, and they all had interesting backstories hinted at via a few lines of dialogue. 
There was one incident in Lena's past that the movie flashed back to 2 or 3 times, and it was really distracting, and unnecessary to show it more than once.
I thought the mirror person scene was too long, the SFX of it dodgy, and its ""destruction"" was ridiculous and obviously not going to work.
There was not a drop of humor in the whole movie. One of the women nervously trying to joke around would've made sense.
They could've done a little more with the ""what is an identity, what makes me *me*?"" idea.
The scene where the psychologist was in the center of the lighthouse was too short: that was really interesting and we didn't get to see much of it.
What does it mean that cells are refracted?When they first get in the Shimmer, they realized they don't remember making camp, and it was probably 4 days since they entered. I thought this was a setup for them starting over every day, not remembering anything that happened before, so they'd have to write notes to themselves, etc. but it never gets brought up again. That would've been really interesting.I felt like it was worth watching at least once, but I paid too much to see it. When my dad rents it or it comes to Netflix, I'll probably watch it again, if only for those scary scenes.In the theater, one guy next to me fell asleep, and maybe the one on the other side of me too. I wasn't sure.",Annihilation
1001,phoenix780-193-818687,A world of change - Annihilation,8,1 March 2018,"I found the ending of the movie to be rather an upbeat one.
Each of the woman scientists, Lena, Ventress, Josie, Anya, Cass, have a serious fault in their lives.
Lena a cheater, Ventresss, sick with cancer, Cass - loss of a child, but we never find out how (was it her fault?), Josie, cutting herself (to feel alive, or feel something, why?) and Anya a recovering addict. They are seriously injured either mentally, or in in Ventress and Josie's case, physically. Are they looking for an answer to the shimmer, or are they looking for an anwer to what they perceive to be their shitty, hopeless, closed off lives. Lena buries herself in her work to forget that she probably dorve her husband into a dangerous situation. They are looking for CHANGE, and that is what the shimmer is - CHANGE, for good or bad, but it definately changes people. It changes everything on earth to be bigger (the alligator), brighter (all the flowers), for better or worse.
It is also more dangerous, so with change comes danger. 
The shimmer is a metaphor for our earth changing and we as humans are changing with it, some get cancer from its toxins, some can't go on because of a loss in our lives. The shimmer is the HOPE for a change to make our lives better. 
Our human cells change and intermingle with that of the shimmer. From the opening scene the movie is all about cell division like cancer changing, doubling forever increasing and going on, isn't that what the shimmer will do if it isn't stopped. But it is stopped, or is it. Maybe the shimmer is like cancer changing and mutating into something else and is immortality in its very nature. Maybe the shimer itself adapted and changed into something else inside Lena and Kane. Don't forget Lena tested her blood and it had changed, so she was already different before she went to the lighthouse. Who was it that left the lighthuse at the end, was it Lena or her double. It doesn't really matter because the ending, when she meets her husband (who has already changed and can't drink the life blood of earth - water) they embrace, intermingling who and what they are into something new, (just like in the shimmer when you touched something it changed your structure). This is perhaps a new beginning for their life together. One where they maybe don't remember that Lena cheated and that Kane ran away. To me it was a hopeful ending, the shimmer was burned away for new things to begin, just like a forest fire spurs new growth. Maybe it isn't too late for earth and the humans on it to recover, but we must realize it soon, or the shimmer will take over.",Annihilation
1002,htr5,A great idea that could have been developed better.,5,13 March 2018,"The film has a great, unique sci-fi idea but there is a lack of clear direction for where the film wants to go. At times, it feels very serious, immersive and tense but frequent cut scenes of drama and techno music break that feeling that is created.The film begins with what would be the present time so we already know how the story will end based on the characters present and what is said throughout the early stages. This breaks away the suspense that would have been there had the story been told in the same way as Arrival (2016).The world presented is very well created and completely terrifying and awe inspiring yet this is overshadowed by the frustrating and out-of-place drama between characters. You are left constantly wondering why certain decisions were made but this is clearly done to leave unanswered questions in order to make a film.

1024,dcpulliam,Another Reason Not to Watch This Film,2,23 July 2018,"I join in those reviews critical of the film's fatal plot holes and general pretentiousness. The film's dedication to its tortured, existentialist mood leads to its most comical manifestation: the worst sex scene of all time.I've never had an extramarital affair, but I would assume at least some bit of passion would motivate my betrayal. As we watch Portman adorn Isaac's head w/ the horns of the cuckhold, she appears no more engaged than if she was listening to an econ lecture. Her also-cheatin' paramour expressed even less pleasure in the act, if possible, and bore the hallmarks of being in a ""waking"" coma or being otherwise stunned and immobile. It is so ridiculous I began to suspect the director was trolling us.
The plot is wholly derivative and worn, the visuals nice but nothing special. Ludicrous sex scene. Stock ending. fin.

When he returns home seemingly without memory and in need of hospitalisation, Lena is intercepted by a large research vessel investigating a large area known as The Shimmer. The Shimmer is a growing area of land, where some time ago, something from space (a meteor?) hit what was reported to be a lighthouse, and engulfed the whole area, and this shimmering envelope is spreading and engulfing further and further. Everyone who has so far gone into The Shimmer (military and scientists) have simply never returned or been heard of again. That is until the return of Kane. Given Lena's love for Kane and the possibility of bringing him back to health, she agrees to venture into The Shimmer and the lighthouse, along with a psychologist, an anthropologist, a paramedic and a physicist (played in order by Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tuva Novotny, Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson) to find out what this area is, how to stop it, how to keep it safe etc.This slow burn will take its time setting up characters, world, ideas and concepts, and will not hold your hand and walk you through it, however it certainly isn't, at least for me, completely abstract and ambiguous. I found it all to be reasonably accessible, although there's a hell of a lot in here to unpack in this mildly spoilery review.So one of the main concepts and ideas that takes place in The Shimmer is that all biological DNA from all known species, suddenly has the ability to splice with one another, creating hybrids of many things, which on paper and on the surface sounds cheesy and dumb. ""Let's make a movie where alligators splice with sharks, and the people have to fight them with big guns and explosions and chases!"" But within context of the film, and the way it tackles this idea, it's creepy and eerie and morally, scientifically and environmentally... questionable. One of my favourite scenes is when Tessa Thompson's character has her arms exposed for the first time, as through much of the film she has long sleeves to cover her scars. But she says to Lena ""Ventress wants to face it, you want to fight it, but I want neither."". She then turns and walks off, revealing that DNA from plant life has taken over her, and she's come to simply accept it, and it sounds silly and hokey, but in execution it was eerie and mysterious, and there was profound beauty to it. The film's title is an odd one, because hearing it, it sounds like an action extravaganza, and even hearing the plot and seeing posters it looks it too. But Jennifer Jason Leigh's character outright says in the film, and to paraphrase ""When the DNA and cells all split and merge and refract and divide, until there's simply no cells left, implosively cancelling everything out as they split and become smaller and smaller, it results in annihilation"", which is where the title comes from.Annihilation has similar elements to many other sci-fi films, all of which are very different, and which Annihilation combines into something very unique. There were moments where I was reminded of Alien, Predator, 2001, AI, Event Horizon in an almost identical scene in which the crew discovers videotapes of bizarre, aberrant and horrifying behaviour from the previous crew, as well as the conceptual horrors of exploring the unknown. There's Under the Skin in there, especially in the last 30 minutes, where it all becomes as abstract as you can get and deals with DNA splicing into clones and emulation and sacrifice. So in the end Annihilation is a difficult film to review without either giving it all away in your explanation, which I probably have, or by making something that, in its execution, is artful and thought-provoking, but by describing it can sound lowbrow and unsophisticated. It's hard simply remembering all the ideas and threads and concepts, but it's an example of when sci-fi can be out there and complex, and I couldn't recommend it enough. It's definitely a think piece, where the story and concepts kind of outweigh the performances a little, but it's a journey fully worth taking. Brilliant to look at, visually interesting and different, there's a lot you can get out of it. It was one where I immediately wanted to see it again to further take it in, which is a rarity for these sorts of heady films, but it's even one I see myself revisiting more.",Annihilation

1034,AholeAndy,"Aesthetically Impressive, Though Its Smaller Parts Faulter Under The Weight of Its Heafty Design",7,18 May 2018,"And here's another extremely hyped visual scifi in the wakes of Blade Runner 2049 and The Last Jedi. Alex Garland seems to be lord of the concepts within the realm of science fiction and Annihilation is probably his boldest one yet. 
It's hard to say much about the plot without giving too much away. Natalie Portman--a biologist and army vet--shares a quietly deteriorating marriage with Oscar Isaac--who has been away from home without contact on a mysterious special forces mission. One day he suddenly returns, but something is off about him. Events lead Portman's character, along with four other female scientists, into the place her husband had gone--a rainbow vapor aura called ""the shimmer"" that has formed around a nature preserve. The plot unfolds from their in a way that should be experienced rather than told.
What Garland does best with the film is draw its visual concepts from it's scifi concepts, though sometime he tends to really on increasingly scientific implausibility to fuel his desired visuals. From a cinematographic perspective, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Stalker, and 2001 all come to mind.
What Garland ultimately fails at here is putting interesting characters who we actually care about through his rainbow jungle hell. Little time is spent on character development and the time that is boarders on soap opera drama steeped in bad American folk music. Some of the characters are implausible--particularly Jennifer Jason Lee's--and it is never made clear why they are their and why they appear to be in charge. I would say more time needed to be spent on the backstories of the supporting characters, but if their backstories were to be as mundane as Portman's Lena backstory, it might be better as is. In fact, all the characters appear to be perpetually mundane in this film: I don't recall a single lighthearted moments throughout it's two hour plus runtime. 
Lastly, the music was really nothing to write home about and many of the songs chosen for the soundtrack are just annoying and don't fit with the rest of the film. Music is important to visual-centric films like this, and the score here never reaches the lofty dramatic heights of its visual counterpart.
Overall the film is interesting and enjoyable to look at and maybe just needed a little more character flare and a longer runtime to allow its inhabitants to breathe. Despite its stacking flaws I'd still recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys science fiction, fantasy, or masterful cinematography.",Annihilation
1035,MindPeriod,New concepts but pretty thoughtless and laidback,6,10 April 2018,"I was compelled to finish watching the film only after I was in the second half; till that point things seemed half-baked, witless, and barely interesting.When I first saw the poster, I saw Natalie Portman, with gun and a crew, against a misty forest backdrop. I immediately thought of survival, war, and Predator-esque alien encounter. Needless to add, I was sold. But, turns out, nothing much was like it. And honestly, it didn't matter.Visuals are good, and certain concepts (and scares) one-of-a-kind. My inquisitiveness throughout, much like some characters in the film, was intact, till the end. What I didn't like was that there were liberties being taken, that there were actions being rationalized-for example, Portman's character suddenly knows how to use a gun, and that too adroitly; only later we are told she had had a military background. Even tactically, things seemed a bit off: If I were to empathize and become one with the crew, I as a lay person, would have thought of doing a lot of things differently for my survival and the mission. And these people, who are scientists and with military intelligence, didn't know even the basics.Annihilation makes for an interesting watch only if you keep your thinking aside for a bit and indulge in the novelties the film has on offer.

 - Now I know that a lot of book to movie adaptations change some story lines to make it work better with the different medium, but this change felt rushed. It seems the writers completely changed the ending to the story so that the original trilogy could be contained in one film.2) They explained the shimmer.
 - While this may tie into them changing the ending, I felt like leaving some unanswered questions made the original story as entrapping as it did. By just wrapping it up and saying, ""It was aliens, you guys!"" I felt like they weren't sure how to conclude the story and instead just pulled rationalizations from a hat.My main point? The trilogy should've been saved by making it into a tv series. It would've been a better format for the story, as well as making the story lines feel more authentic.6/10 stars.

Without an understanding of the themes expressed in Jung's work (e.g. ego, conscious and unconscious mind, collective unconscious, shadow self, archetypes etc), this movie won't make much sense. It certainly makes sense if you understand the psychological framework it operates within.We follow Lena into the depths of her own mind and if you didn't 'get it' - it's because you don't get Jungian Psychology (presumably this is what the studios meant when they said the film was ''too intellectual'').",Annihilation

One of the worst parts in this movie that I will use as an example is the alligator scene. The girl gets pulled in by her backpack back into the cabin, then pulled under water inside the cabin because the cabin was half submerged in water. Then we see the main character dive in to save the other girl, and she manages to pull her out of the water and leave the cabin. Then we see in the next scene the alligator burst down the cabin wall from the inside and then swim up to the girls where they put it down by unloading imaginary bullets from the horrible CGI effect gun. So your telling me a mutant alligator is going to pull a girl back into a cabin by her backpack, then under water where she receives no other wounds and then these two small girls are going to out power an alligator that is super huge and just burst down a cabin wall?

It's not as scary as it wants it to be, which is good actually.
The ""praised beauty"" is overrated, it's a boring swamp.
But overall it just doesn't make sense.
I didn't like the all women team where everyone is for themselves.
They don't know why are they there. They pose as scientists but there is no science in the movie other than basic cell division under microscope. So why are other women there? They have weapons as if everybody can fire. That's just...
This useless feminization of main characters and annoying sex scenes with a married black man... I understand the ""Liberal Sponsors"" need to promote interracial relationships to eliminate the white race.
And then pump up women to kill them all in the battlefield one day and destroy the entire civilization.
Honestly, a stupid movie, where the bullets don't kill, where there is no discipline.

1053,aarneai,Wished for More,7,9 October 2018,"I really wanted to like this film because the concept seemed fascinating and Alex Garland's previous film was excellent. However, I was sadly quite disappointed. I just felt like every aspect was very tame and somewhat lacking.With a film like this, much more could've been done. Everything could've been dialed up to ten and the film would've only gained from that. When there are scenes that are supposed to be scary, I didn't feel scared. When I was supposed to be on edge, I felt only somewhat tense. Had these scenes truly been what they were trying to be, I feel that Annihilation would've been hands down one of the best sci-fi films of the year. I'm actually quite frustrated with that. I found Ex Machina to be very good in these aspects and I'm left wondering what happened with Garland.It's not all bad though. First of all, this film looks absolutely stunning. Once the group enters ""the Shimmer"", the world becomes interesting, beautiful, full of detail and most importantly it left you wanting for more. It was filled with curious and rather frightening creatures and gorgeous and peculiar plants.
Second of all, I have to give credit to the last third of the film. I finally felt like the film was giving me what I had wanted from it from the very beginning. The last 30 minutes were tense and scary. It felt almost like Garland had remembered how to create tension.All in all, I think that Annihilation is a decent sci-fi film. It is certainly different from what most sci-fi films nowadays tend to be. It offers a unique look at us humans and gives us one of the most intriguing fictional worlds in a long time. Sadly, it just felt quite muted. Had it been more tense and scary, I feel that this would've possibly been one the best films of the year.",Annihilation

But once you start to peal away those onion skins and get closer to the center the less everything makes sense...I'm always for some crazy science fiction movie that is honestly just out there in it's concept. So I was quickly hooked by this ""Shimmer"". I actually thought the special effects would look worse but to be honest they look quite beautiful at times. It comes of as both whimsical and creepy in it's conception. For the most part the creature designs I found to be memorable and very nice to the eye. Simple and nothing totally over the top. The bear incorporating the screams I thought was also a cool idea. Although...It's established the Shimmer is a giant prisms that refracts everything. Yet somehow I can't get over the idea that someones screams get refracted into the bear?

Though there were some flaws in it, it was a good movie. It's not what people normally expect. And It's also a bit depressing which is why I think most people didn't like this movie.By the way this movie is actually about cancer. Even though it is a SCI-FI movie and shows you about an alien invasion sort of thing, the overall movie tells you about cancer in the most unexpected way. If you really pay full attention while you are watching it, you'll understand what I meant.This movie is literally about cancer, it shows you the true meaning of cancer. True horrors of cancer. Cancer is """"a malignant growth or tumour resulting from an uncontrolled division of cells"""". That's what they show you throughout the entire movie. I had to watch this movie twice to understand this.
When it comes to movies about cancer, it's always about the life of a cancer patient, how they deal with cancer. But here it shows you what is cancer, by the definition of it. Every single scene in this movie shows you that. You really need to see this movie twice to understand what it's trying to tell you.

1082,Rusticcrayon,Dont believe the hype look at the facts in front of you,1,27 February 2018,"It is a sad state of affairs that movies like this are gaming the review system. I watched the film at the weekend, and checked the popularity rating on IMDB ;ast night and it was tanking (it had a 46% drop in popularity) and negative reviews were coming in. This echo's the half empty cinema I sat in on its opening weekend and the fact people were leaving and grumbling before the movie was even over.Progress to Monday, and the corporate machine has turned its wheels and started to spout out rave reviews of 8's to 10's, and its rating is going up again. (Clearly the paid for reviewers returning to work).All saying how wonderful this film is, how great the acting was and what a thrilling ride, or mind bending move it was - all complete tosh.Having read the book and watched the movie, I can say that the film is a complete flop. Now I was not a fan of the book, as its was slow, plodding and full of underdeveloped characters (one thing the film did copy) and pointless flashbacks, and one of the most cringe worthy nicknames I think anyone could have created (Ghostbird).That said the book had a very interesting idea, and after seeing Ex Machina and the trailers of Annihilation, I was keen to see how the story was moved to the big screen under Alex Garlands direction. Alas, the film is a mess and no matter how pretty some scenes were, they just couldn't make up for everything that was wrong with the film, which range from flat acting to the complete removal of key pieces of the book that were core to the story (No tower, no creature in the tower scribing on the walls, the hand like organisms). Instead we have some additional characters who add nothing to the film and acting in ways that are so illogical their actions are more perplexing than what they are sent to investigate, Worst of all, the film leaves little to the imagination unlike the book, which left you pondering on what was actually happening and why. But not here, We have the physicist on hand to tell us what's happening, with no scientific equipment and works it all out within a day or two (I know they were their longer, but they had no memory of the first 3 to 4 days). Which just goes to show, woman really do know it all. This film unfortunately is not clever or intelligent, if it were it wouldn't have had to spoon feed the viewer in such an obvious way. I have read some outlandish reviews on here that make some reference to this being like 2001, Arrival and Stalker. Clearly these people were not watching the same film, or had climbed so far up themselves that the themselves had found shimmer.There is a phrase my father used to say to me which is ""No matter how much you polish a turd, it will still be a turd"". and this phase was never more true than describing this film, and sadly this this movie has to rank as one of the worst movies I have seen in the last 12 months.If you haven't seen it, then don't believe the hype, there's a reason there are a lot of negative reviews!!!

The other four women who make up the mission are also good and it's great to see women portrayed in this genre without the need for men to support or rescue them. The story is quite different to other sci-fi I've seen. I loved the haunting ending and the journey to get there explores, in provocative and fascinating ways, issues of grief, identity, humanity, and what motivates us to do the things we do. It's perfectly paced with constant tension interspersed with moments of shock, gore, horror, and terror. But these moments are not your typical mainstream scare tactics.

A lot of the show just talks drably about science and what it might be etc but it just feels overly wordy.My main annoyance with this was how the female crew was portrayed. When one of them gets dragged away the women are hysterical and breathless and screeching. I felt this is such contrast to how men are shown when they go chasing monsters (eg predators) they're necer shown crying or having a discussion. It's full on fists and anger. This really turned me off as there was no reason why the scientists good not also have been bad a**There is one scene where Natalie Portman squares up to a crocodile mutant and really shoots it down.

They LITERALLY enter a tumor, like if it was the Earth herself to have grown a cancer and we see all things that happen from cancer growth, how each person face it or fights it, and how it is ultimately alien, but still a part of yourself.

Show's over, nothing left to see here.",1,25 February 2018,"It's been said that the only legitimate philosophical question is in the form of ""Why is there something instead of nothing?"" Annihilation reverses the two subjects of that question.I don't mean to dismiss anyone's experience in watching the film, but I found nothing intellectually challenging about either the story or the interpersonal exchanges among and between the characters. The scientific revelations that some of the characters offer are earth-shattering only if you aren't possessed by an imagination that allows for the existence of other forms of life. Even their hypotheses were dull. And you don't need to be a biologist to figure out what's different about what's going on within the alien forest (the writers call it ""the shimmer"") in comparison to everyday, carbon-based existence. I won't give my explanation here since it may be one of a few mundane mysteries in a disappointing script.The narrative is both uninspired and uninspiring, and the writers provide ample opportunity to stop caring about the story and the characters. Unfortunately, this spills over into the ending which steered viewers to ask ourselves a limited set of questions about what may have happened. At least those of us who were still interested enough to care. I also had the dreaded ""embarrassed-for-someone-else"" experience more than once, both for a meandering story that seems satisfied to make halfhearted attempts at being interesting and the portrayal of a land that was too often straining to be different in ways that might move viewers to be left in awe. Never happened. CGI and special effects are bland; nothing new to see here that hasn't already been portrayed (badly) in TV sci-fi series. A walk through a rain forest is more visually compelling, even if taken on National Geographic. The alien world that's presented evokes images of a darker though ultimately lackluster Walt Disney World in a sometimes cartoonish way rather than shuttling back and forth through the multiple levels of Being in Interstellar. It represents a different reality as a blunt object in a world that cries out in desperation for a finer, simpler touch. What's supposed to be frightening is too often unwittingly comical; the gravity of the mission and the vulnerability of the characters lose their narrative force as a result. (If you haven't seen it, check out The Forbidden Planet -- a film released more than sixty years ago -- for its compelling narrative and limited but, within the context of the story, realistic special effects.)Annihilation is not worth seeing, even if you have MoviePass. Not a single ""ooh"" or ""aah"" throughout though there was some intermittent and well-earned laughter along the way. I doubt that Annihilation will show up on a ""One Hundred Underrated Sci-Fi Movies from Twenty Years Ago"" list. There just isn't very much to it.",Annihilation

(In one scene I thought I was watching Ghostbusters.) It throws in some genetics jargon and wraps everything in pseudo-philosophical nonsense while adding nothing new.The story makes no sense. Perhaps the most significant event in human history and the investigation team seems to have the budget and staffing of a small university chemistry department. Over the course of several years many research teams have entered the Shimmer, never to return (mostly). Surely, by now they'd have nuked it? But no, they do exactly the same thing again with a new team.They go in with no back-up plan; in fact no plan at all. No protocols. Not even a bio-hazard suit? And apparently no paper and pencil for making notes, which would have been useful when they find themselves lost and with no memory of the previous 4 days. Really? They are supposed to be scientists.The protagonists do all the stupid things people in horror movies always do: Just been attacked by a giant mutant alligator? Sure, let's take to the water in small boats. Attacked by a giant mutant bear? Sure, wander off in the jungle alone.

The movie is great in my opinion and they pulled off a lot of things most movies can't. Being a member of the right I was thoroughly impressed with how they pulled off an all female cast leading a military expedition into the unknown. It wasn't an overt play on feminism, or any political tinge to the reasoning. Rather in desperation they were chosen to try something new, since all male expeditions failed and why not since it is the end of the world. Smooth sale vs what movies normally throw at us! Overall the story and concepts were intriguing, the movie kept me curious as to what was going on and the explanations were not shallow or unbelievable. The story had me confused as to who was the bad guy and who was the good guy. Was what was happening even really that bad? This confusion lasted all the way to the end, where I was confused to how I felt given the outcome. Was it good or bad or neutral? No simple emotion like ""yes the good guys won"" or ""yay the bad guy/monster is dead"". The monsters were horrible and intimidating, but given the premise of what they were I couldn't come to hate them. Did anyone actually die? Was the outcome the best possible one?In short if you don't like your story spoon fed to you, and you are not the type that enjoys simple character development, then this is the movie for you.

While ""homage"" is often overused as an excuse for plagiarism, in this case it truly does seem the story was more inspired by the original, rather than simply lifting elements without thought.And there are other familiar elements to be seen here and there. Everything from the ""forest of glass"" from tv's ""Threshold"", to the alzabo of Gene Wolfe's ""New Sun"" books to some things that seemed almost a multicolored callback to the Blair Witch, to part of the closing sequence which had me saying, in imitation of 2001, ""it's full of cells!"".Despite this, the movie was actually quite interesting, and held my attention, despite a deliberately slow pace (reminiscent of 70s science fiction) and some pretty shaky science. (Which fortunately came and went quickly enough not to bog things down in technobabble of dubious worth.) The acting was a bit one note, and the dialog, as with such films, tended to drift around a bit, but overall, a good effort.--- VERY small spoiler to follow --One minor quibble. Or rather two. Near the end, there is a sequence where, though it starts off impressive, degenerates into a sequence involving what appears to be a stunt man wrapped in duct tape. Now, given the high technical level seen up to this point, duct tape man is, on his own, enough of a let down, but, worse still, the soundtrack decides to accompany a moment when he slowly squats with a low, flatulent synthesizer note, eliciting not a few chuckles from the audience.But, the few missteps, and the derivative nature aside, it is not a bad film.",Annihilation

1124,bw-22361,Ambitions & Disappointments,7,15 March 2018,"Just to clarify: This movie isn't pseudo-philosophical. It has actually a deeper meaning and subtext. Still, it's not really fleshed out that well. But let's get the positive stuff out of the way: The art-design (especially for certain creatures) is great. As well as MOST of the effects. Yeah, the CGI was pretty noticable in some scenes, and the texturierung gets out of hand, on some of the environment. Still, for the most part they look really convincing. The ""score"" of the movie, and the sound design in general are handled very expertially. Towards the end, some of the sound-effects really freaked me out. In a positive way. The story, or more so the concept of the movie remains it's strongest point. It deals with theoretical depictions of life from outer space and simultaneously describes a relationship between our protagonist, Lena, and her husband. Certain plotpoints of both narratives cross over in a very clever way. And also it contains the character arc for Lena, so the story doesn't lose itself in its science ""mumbo jumbo"", like one other review here claimed. The ending of the movie was absolutely great and very ambitious. Personally, i liked it very much. So, now to the negative stuff: The story has an uneven structure. The main plotline gets constantly disrupted by flash-forwards to the aftermath-interrogation of our main protagonist. Also the whole narrative has a weak beginning. They could have started the movie, when the main characters are already in ""the shimmer"", and THEN incorporated some flashbacks. Also there are various plot holes and inconsistencies sprinkled throughout the movie. Still, i will defend that point: All characters have a reason to be in this film. Their actions and fates have a metaphorical meaning. Also this flick creates great atmosphere! Almost like a well-made horror movie, especially in the end. Kind of Ex machina. All in all, it was a interesting movie-going experience for me and i recommend Annihilation to everyone. Those high-concept Sci Fi-movies should get made more often.

It was an interesting premise with unique visuals, which was enhanced by Portman's acting.Unfortunately, the glaring plot-holes started to become more noticeable when they stepped into the shimmer. Things surrounding the military, research crews, and other science fiction take a lot of prior knowledge to set the scene appropriately. Apparently the writers didn't think much of that through and it becomes overwhelmingly salient as the film drones on. The more I continued to watch, the more I became bored with the premise. It almost came off as pseudo-intellectual. Painting a picture of profundity through continually confusing the viewer with empty plot points, but showing some shiny imagery to encapsulate them once more.The unique visuals of the film are only the thing that carries it, but there becomes a point when even that can't band-aid the outrageous holes within the story, characters, and writing style. Near the end, I was almost laughing from how brazenly silly the narrative turned out to be.As far as science-fiction goes, Annihilation has a couple of interesting developments that are best left on paper.

The story centers on a growing 3-year atmospheric anomaly on the swampy Gulf Coast that swallows up all investigators, except protagonist Lena's army husband, who mysteriously shows up at home 1 year after disappearing into the 'Shimmer', suffering from total amnesia and massive organ failure, and no explanation as to how he got home.
There is no massive NOAA / University / CDC / military presence at the Shimmer, just a strange trek by 5 very unprepared and comically ill-equipped women into the deadly unknown. A sullen, somnambulant, zombie psychiatrist (Dr Ventress) who doesn't like to talk is in charge of the most earthshattering project in human history, which is investigating this destructive, deadly atmospheric/biologic phenomenon that is apparently on the way to destroying the earth.

This is one of those films that tempts you many times to turn it off because of the silliness of the writing, but it almost redeems itself with the mind-bending confrontations at the end.Absurdity #1: This 3 year 'event' is swallowing up the Gulf Coast and small communities; it is a deadly phenomenon (people who go in never come out), and it is spreading like a cancer, threatening the earth. And what's the response? No mobilization of the world's sharpest scientists to send in probes; no discussion of dropping a 'Daisy Cutter' Mother-Of-All-Bombs on the lighthouse that is the epicenter of the anomaly; no convocation of the world's sharpest minds, who are apparently off fighting global warming. Just yet another patrol to try to reach 'the lighthouse', the center of the infection. And in the age of instant, universal world-wide communications via Facebook, Twitter, & Instagram, the public is totally unaware of the growing devastation that has been going on for 3 years.Absurdity #2: The Army Special Forces couldn't survive the 'Shimmer' (except the heroine's husband, who returns under very mysterious circumstances). The best the military could offer could not successfully penetrate the 'Shimmer' and return. So let's send in a gang of young (except for Dr. Vantress, the mute psychiatrist), wet-behind-the-ears lady scientists to tackle the beast.Absurdity #3: There is no idea whether the alien agent is biological, viral, bacterial, or otherwise; so let's equip our heroines with neat, autumn-shade coveralls with matching M-16 automatic rifles. No HAZMAT suits; no face masks; no gloves; no protection. The Lady Ghost-Busters were better prepared for their mission than this outfit.Absurdity #4: After the attack of the Giant Mutant Jurassic Alligator, which makes Nile Crocodiles look like chameleons, the brain-dead team decides to appropriate two flimsy flat-bottom boats to paddle through the Giant Mutant Jurassic Alligator-infested swamp (they had been hiking up to this point).Absurdity #5: The team finds an elevated watchtower, a sort of forest ranger station on stilts, in the middle of a large field to bunk down in for the night. The sullen-mute-zombie-somnambulant psychiatrist decides to take the first watch - not on the open porch surrounding the ranger station, the perfect place for a secure watch - but in a flimsy, open, ground-level gazebo 100 yards away from the elevated bunkhouse. But unlike anything else in the shimmer, this particular gazebo has electricity, as there are nice, bright electric lights on - the last thing you would have on if you were looking out into the darkness for approaching threats.Absurdity #6: And this one goes beyond ""Scary Movie"" stupidity. The day after 'Geomorphologist' Cassie is snatched by the Giant Mutant Jurassic Bear that makes grizzlies look like Koalas, heroine Lena decides to go off on solo patrol looking for Cassie to see if she is dead. (She is).Absurdity #7: Lena makes it to 'the Lighthouse,' and encounters the force behind the Shimmer. It clones her in a scene sequence that is among the most powerful in sci-fi / horror film history - it is just creepy-scary - and the amorphous, incomplete clone gets up-close and personal and duplicates Lena's movements to the point that Lena cannot escape it, until she magically produces a white phosphorous hand grenade, pulls the pin, and hands it to the Alien Shimmer Clone, who just stands there stupefied, looking at the grenade until it goes off. This bit of stupidity tells the viewer that the writers just got tired of the whole project and needed a way to end it, instead of coming up with an intelligent, believable, meaningful ending.There are powerful moments interspersed among the stupidities, seen in the mutated flora and fauna of the Shimmer, and the bizarre transformation of creatures and humans. The mutated twin deer were creepily beautiful, and offered a bit of foreshadowing of the alien force's MO of cloning its victims. The Giant Mutant Jurassic Bear makes a very disturbing appearance after munching on Geomorphologist Cassie, stalking 3 team survivors (who have been mysteriously tied up and gagged by Medic-gone-crazy Ana). The bear mimics the cries for help from deceased Cassie, in between growls, as it prowls between the 3 helpless survivors. It is as if the alien cloning mechanism is being put to disturbing use in this scene, very effectively.This movie can be summed up thus: moments of pure genius, overpowered by far more moments of lazy, thoughtless screenwriting. Loads of potential was thrown away through lack of disciplined writing and plotting.",Annihilation

Firstly lets say that sending an all women team with limited military back grounds in to a hostile situation, that has already taken the lives of countless soldiers prior to their insertion, is even remotely plausible. I had high hopes that perhaps the film was going to play on this all woman line up. Much like women make better pilots and astronauts because they can tolerate the G forces better than men. But no that didn't happen. It was basically all down hill from then on. The team have cameras but are never seen to use them. Although this is supposed to be a fact finding mission and the situations they encounter are more than worthy of documenting. Adding to this is the fact they have difficulty remembering whats happening. Still they don't record anything. Why in these films are the protagonists all ways attack the things they encounter? Even though their lives are not being threatened? It says a lot about humanity in that we attack anything we don't understand. The head scratching ending has the mysterious being destroyed by fire.

1139,djorleon-12525,Great world building,10,29 November 2018,"I loved Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach trilogy, it's one of those weird science fiction works that stays with you. When it was announced that it was going to be made into a movie with a stellar cast lead by Natalie Portman I just had to go see it. It didn't disappoint. The essence of the novels is here, the characters, the paranoia, the weirdness and the scientific and philosophical implications. The movie is tight and spare in its synthesis of the story, but is also entertaining, action-packed and beautiful to look at. The acting is great and the care they took in building the refracted world is outstanding. This movie strikes the perfect balance between the visuals, action and intelligence. What would a first contact with alien life be like? Would it be straight forward like in Steven Spielberg's movies or The Alien franchises? Or would it be a destructive force that won't announce itself as such, but be more insidious and attack us from the inside and from another dimension to boot? The concept is fascinating and terrifying to me. In this instance, the alien force is not necessarily attacking us humans, but trying to communicate through our very own DNA, and in trying to translate ""us"" and our world is changing and destroying everything.",Annihilation

1142,JoshuaMooreBE,Amazing Experience Held Back By Cliches,5,8 March 2018,"If there was one word I would use to describe Annihilation, it would be inconsistent. There are so many things in this film that make it stand out, and sometimes where I was amazed at what I was watching. This film seems to have this gimmick that the longer into the movie's runtime we get, the more interesting and thought-provoking stuff happens. Unfortunately, that gimmick seems to stick it's nose early into the film and incredibly harms the first act, which I'll get into during spoiler talk. The inconsistency is everywhere in this film. Sometimes, I'm completely drawn into what I am watching, and other times I am bored out of my mind and uninterested with what I'm looking at. I think the biggest issue is in the acting. These are all very talented actors, Natalie Portman and Tessa Thompson especially, but for some reason here they have absolutely no range and react to everything in the most unrealistic way possible, and a lot the dialogue in this film is just poorly written and lame. Early in the film, they get attacked by a pretty out of the ordinary creature, and they keep looking at it like I look at the container of my chocolate chip muffins in the morning, like it's something I'm used to and it's just in my way. Sure they get spooky scared when the jump scare scenes pop in, but besides those and few notable other scenes, they just have very little expression and range. And yes, the dialogue certainly didn't help, but again I'll get into spoiler talk for more details on that. Can't really get into more details about this film before the spoiler section, but I really don't want to come off like I hate this film. The 5/10 I'm giving is a very good 5. The stuff in this film that is great, is great. Everything in the last 30 minutes is certainly worth it, with very creative visuals and tense moments that will stick with you when you leave the theater.(SPOILERS) So I really wanted to go into detail about how awful the first 30 minutes as compared to the last 30 minutes. The connection between all our main characters was incredibly rushed. Natalie Portman meets them at the table, they say ""we are going in"" and she just kinda joins them. Sure we learn more about them as the adventure goes on, but we only seem to learn more about them moments before they die. It seems like the writers wanted to make really cool death scene moments, but forgot to actually add characters to them. All of these girls personalities are pretty copy and paste. Also, I really hope I wasn't rolling my eyes at how they tried to connect Natalie's character and her husband. Again, what they did with them at the end was not only unique but made you care about their connection. What didn't connect me was them tickling each other in bed and then saying something corny about the stars. I can't stand when movie writers do this because I feel like it's a lazy way to make you see a character as a good person. You can't make a character out of bootleg bible verses. Also the completely unnecessary scenes with her affair. Not only was it weird for the pacing but it added nothing to the story. Also, it just added another character that felt like a prop. Again, there were fantastic things in the film. The visuals, CGI, and practical effects were very consistent in their quality, the ending was trippy and thought-provoking in all the best ways. That screaming bear was awesome, and I can't wait to watch that scene specifically again. Most of the horror and gore is done in a way that doesn't feel cheap, and the soundtrack was phenomenal, with a theme that is in the trailer that I was really happy to see how they used it in the film. I do recommend seeing this film, but I promise there is nothing wrong with being a little late to it.",Annihilation
1143,ajwh-53593,"Strange, abstract, mesmeric",8,14 March 2018,"I've thought about this film for days after seeing it. I don't even know what specifically I've been thinking about, all I can say is it left a big impression on me. I disagree with those who say it's intellectual. I don't think it is nor was it intended to be. It's visceral, primal, just like the world inside The Shimmer.For me, films work on three hierarchical levels: at the very basic, they should be entertaining. All films should succeed here (but not all do, which is why we should rightly slam those that don't!). Then, there are films that are not only entertaining but also elicit an emotional response; they move us in some way. Finally, there are entertaining films that are moving but also have meaning; they resonate on a deeper, often metaphysical level. To my mind, Annihilation achieves all three.Forget the plot holes. They exist in every film, otherwise they wouldn't be stories. Some of my favourite films have canyon-sized plot holes and inconsistencies. If you analyse any film you'll find them, and often you don't have to look very hard, e.g. Back to the Future. Do the plot holes and gaps in logic stop BTTF from being a great film? Not to my mind, because I'm invested in the movie. Plot holes only matter to me when they draw me away from the film; if it fails to entertain me.Does the plot in Annihilation even really matter? The film is about the experience, the visuals and audio, the curiosity, the suspense. A world that could only be accessible to us in our imaginations is here brought to life on the screen. It asks a lot of questions but isn't interested in the answers. It's bold, brave, challenging. Some of it is spectacular, some of it less so. Naturally, that will split opinion, but we've become too accustomed to the ready-packaged ""Happy Meal Movies"" that the studios churn out for us. We're addicted to them like we're addicted to sugary fast food. We should welcome any film that attempts to wean us off that and broaden our palates. This is a proper cinematic film, so what a shame it is that here in the UK (and many other countries) we were denied the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen. I can only imagine how even more beguiling and entrancing the experience would've been.Turn off the lights, switch off your phones, and sit back and feed your imagination and sense of wonder.

1148,Wezqu,All bad sci-fi is not grounded to reality,4,21 April 2020,To say it bluntly this movie is no way realistic depiction of what would happen if this kind of situation happened.First major problem is that they claim it had been three years of the event starting and they still act like they don't know anything about it other than its expanding and will threathen humanity. They would have most definetly known most of the stuff revealed in the movie in the first year or even a half a year from it starting. Even if they could not use GPS or other electrical navigation in the shine they still could have easilly build a rope line that would have been used to go in and out. They also could have easilly had a test group living inside the zone to see its effects on people. Not to mention that going into enviroment that you don't know anything about is not done without real protective gear.Second major problem is that there is no explanation why they could not use any vehicles to get to their destination. The starting point was on coastline would it not make more sense to go with a boat from the sea or even helicopter would have made more sense than walking through unknown area.Third major problem is that somehow the goverment never even tried to take the thing out from range. You don't need guided missiles even if it was not really said that they would not work. Not to mention the operation somehow is not run by military personel and somehow they have been able to keep it out of public news for three years. In modern society that thing would have been known from the first few days it started to happen.It only gets four stars because it at least have artistic scenes and acting is not the worse I have seen but the logical fallacies in this just made facepalm several times while watching it.,Annihilation
1149,themoviemaniac-47685,Annihilation of Everyone's Careers,2,2 January 2019,"Why Natalie Portman got involved with this film is baffling. Maybe the idea sounded appealing: A mysterious 'Shimmer' appears at the site of a comet strike and everyone that gets sent in there fails to return except Natalie Portman's husband. He returns with a mystery illness and she, being a biologist is sent in to find out why. I won't say anymore about the story.The film is just plain boring. The film makers don't seem sure whether they wanted to make a sci-fi action film or something more artsy. Instead they tried to make a combination of both, which, just doesn't work.Normally, when films turn out bad actors claim they couldn't tell what the end product was going to look like.

1150,athagram,They missed a chance,5,23 February 2019,"I'd rather begin with a credit to the idea. The movie deals with scientific concerns, the fate of humanity, the dark universe and -more generally- the inner fear of the unknown. It begins with reference to the private life of Lena and her supposedly lovely relationship with her husband, a military officer, who soon leaves her for a mysterious mission.Then, things get complicated. After he is gone for a year and he is considered dead, he makes a strange appearance to his house as she was painting the walls. But, his behaviour is very strange; he is lost, he speaks indistinctly, he has few memories and he sheds blood from his mouth. As they go to the emergencies, special forces capture both in the highway and get them to an observation unit, just opposite of a sealed zone, the Shimmer, where ""anomalies"" happen.Trying to find some answers, Lena, an academic biologist, joins a tailor-made team of female scientists to get into that shrimp and reach the Lighthouse. Indeed, in the beginning of the film we see a comet hitting the lighthouse, but how can the team know that the epicentre of the situation is there, if no squad has returned from that ""world"" anon data transmission can happen?The female mission has a positive message for women's empowerment but beyond that it is not realistic. Five scientists with no military skills (except for Lena who as in the army), no equipment, but armoured, enter a wild forest full of natural mysteries without even a plan. They do everything wrong, like taking a small boat to sail a lake where they killed a huge mutated alligator. They spend the night in an old house but they patrol on a kiosk the most exposed place.As they walk through, losing the sense of time and orientation, we learn that Lena had an affair with a colleague, and that was the reason why her husband went on a suicide-mission to the unknown. This is an unnecessary distraction from the real plot.Last, when Lena reaches the Lighthouse she finally kills the ""alien"". Before that, she found a burnt corps with a camcorder just opposite. She plays the tape and she finds out that her husband has lost his mind because of the mutations and he unleashed a phosphorus bomb burn himself. But, he was duplicated by the alien and that was the creature that reached Lane. Now, when she killed that ""thing"", everything in the shimmer created by it turned into dust - everything but the clone of her husband. Quite weird.Conclusions: one more movie with nice atmosphere and graphics but with weak plot. Many unanswered spots (including the finale) leave a bitter taste. Definitely worth to see but It miseducating the chance to be/do a revelation for the challenged humanity has ahead.",Annihilation

That said, I found this movie an excruciating bore, with almost no reasons to watch, save for a occasionally fanciful sci-fi exploration of mutation.Annihilation checks all the idiot plot boxes. Send a team of women scientists into a realm where all others have disappeared! Hit the water after learning it's likely filled with mutated, vicious, monstrous gators! Ignore the warnings of a left behind video! Along with teams of investigators, logic flees once inside The Shimmer.Okay, so maybe the visuals are thrilling? Nope to that, too. The floral fecundity of plant life gone wild looks as if it were decorated by a Michael's employee on steroids. Plastic and fake. The Shimmer itself is so vastly underwhelming, I thought More Was To Come. But More Was Not to Come.Even the normally reliable Natalie Portman limited her acting range to a few variations of concerned, from vaguely furrowed brow to deeply furrowed brow. And oh, a gratuitous sex scene is thrown in, which always means bad writing. Stuck for narrative propulsion and intrigue? Hey, a sex scene! Yeah, that's it.I don't like to be a cranky reviewer, because I honor the effort, and I know how hard it is to make a movie. Even a bad movie!

1155,allisonjx,"No logic or common sense, but very pretty",6,19 January 2021,"Title says it all. The CGI is admittedly very pretty and I'm sure it would be quite the experience to watch this on a huge screen, but the sheer lack of logic and common sense in the characters words and actions just made me facepalm and exclaim out loud, ""What?"" too many times.First thing - Lena already knew her 'husband' didn't have any memories. Everyone on the team knew that they were missing 3-4 days worth of memories. Why the heck didn't anyone carry a journal?? Not even to write observations or jot down a few drawings?? I was flabbergasted by the lack of any record keeping.
Lena runs straight into the water where an unknown creature is keeping her fellow scientist in the water. Sure was brave of her but I'll chalk that up to her 'military training'. But the following scene gave me my first facepalm. After killing a 9~ ft long crocodile, the team decides to, you guessed it, row tiny canoes across the swamp! Brilliant idea. There could only be one crocodile, right? The tiny long fish were pretty though, so I let it go.
The next facepalm scene - after viewing footage of Kane cutting open his teammate's stomach and seeing his insides slither around like a python, the one qualified paramedic in the group loudly proclaims that what they just saw was a trick of the light and that no one should pay any attention to it. I admit I laughed out loud at this. Lena was the only one who tried to fight her on this while the others wandered off to who knows where right after watching, seemingly accepting this ridiculous theory. They discover that the python-intestine man had exploded across the wall in a coverage of beautiful mold, and I was too impressed by the design to think anymore about it.
Some more that I'm too lazy to write out full paragraphs for - Wouldn't it be better if everyone was on top of the watchtower and they kept watch from there? Being so far below didn't seem very helpful to protect or warn teammates from so far away. Why did Lena want to go alone to see if Sheppard was really dead? Where did the shy teammate's clothes go after she turned into a plant and seriously, how could Lena not have caught up to her? Shy teammate was doing a dramatic slow walk while Lena was running. Dramatic effect I guess. How the hell did the camera that had footage of Kane's last moments still have battery? Any photographer worth their salt know that camera battery runs out like sand in an hourglass. It's been a year, and there just so happens to be enough battery for Lena to watch her husband one last time? Alright. Mirroring alien was creepy, but if it was mirroring, why did it lay on top of Lena while she was trying to get out? Shouldn't it have been beside her or on the opposite wall? The mirroring was inconsistent so it was a bit confusing. It forgot to mirror while it was being blown up.All in all, very pretty, but you can leave your brain behind while you watch.",Annihilation

1161,biXen,Ultimately disappointing,7,17 March 2018,"Annihilation is written and directed by Alex Garland who made a movie I loved, Ex Machina. Ex Machina has smart visual effects and the budget doesn't get in the way of the premise. It's a perfect match. It also has a good performance by Vikander. Obviously it gave me some expectations for this movie, but I think I can give it a fair review. First let's start with the good, I think Portman is convincing, so are a few of the other actors in her crew. The story is in broad terms an expedition checking out an anamoly in a forest, it's interesting and it's rooted in science. There are some nice visuals and overall I would say the movie makes you think a bit like Ex Machina. But it's maybe more of an ""experience"" in a way it approaches thinking compared to Ex Machina. In my opinion there are nice details to look at in this movie and the standard of effects are ok, but the visuals are cheesy, and look like overdone HDR photographs or games in many parts. The details of some of the plot is pretty bad, including a former soldier thinking a guard post on the ground as a good idea when they have a tall inaccessible guard tower to sit guard in. We know it needs to be ""scary"" and you need to set up events, but that is just so bad I won't even consider it a spoiler.I think the bigger scope of the movie, with the bigger set and the bigger set of characters is it's biggest problem. It honestly feels like a B movie you'll see in the middle of the night in your countries 5th most popular TV channel for large parts of the movie. I think the smaller scope of Ex Machina maybe concealed some of the weaknesses and maybe inexperience of the director/writer. In the end I would still recommend giving it a view, but my ultimate verdict is that it's a movie that would have needed a few more rounds in writing and planning. I honestly don't think it would have ended up on Netflix for the rest of the world if it did.",Annihilation

The mysterious SHIMMER they explore, is mirrored by the director fine handling of the storyline's progress, with everchanging and shimmery scenes that avoid sharp edges.Like 2001 Space Odissey, and other think pieces, it will leave you transfixed or, if you're a Michael Bay fan, disappointed.",Annihilation

1175,strudelbob,An Appropriately Nuanced Flick,8,13 October 2020,"While this was my seventh or eighth time finishing up Annihilation, I still am able to appreciate the levels of detail and nuance present in the film, while also finding new things that I never saw before.Director Alex Garland is a tour de force when it comes to making media that feels like there's no way that it could ever happen, but there's just enough of a sprinkle of science or math in the script to make it feel quasi-possible (see Devs and Ex Machina).Throughout Annihilation though, complete with stunning imagery and eye-catching effects (at least for the $40m budget it was produced upon), there is a sense of a larger theme to be understood here, very similar to Arrival or any of author Ted Chiang's works. While I have not read the book, it's certainly at the forefront of my reading list.For nerds who don't like sci-fi, this is the movie for you. For people who love recommending others movies, I would (and have) say to recommend it to others, but snobbiness aside, this film isn't for people who watch movies for face value action/effects. While it has great examples of those (and some top-notch body horror), it will not quite resonate with people on a large scale, which is unfortunate due to the mastery of the plot and hypnotizing choreography. There are so many adaptations of great science fiction moves and novellas waiting to be made, and I am glad that this one caught my eye when it was released so that I can cross reference the film to the source material, and give the author credit where it is due (I'm also a book-better-than-the-movie Puritan).If you're looking for a movie bored on a weekend or weeknight with nothing to do, this will aptly satisfy and quench your desire to know about what could be.",Annihilation

1184,stone219,It is what it is...,8,20 March 2018,"A different look at sci-fi. A film that takes you on a journey. It isnt perfect, but I believe its a much needed different view/idea on the genre.Firstly, lets look at some of the negative reviews...especially one which goes to list some of their grievances...Firearms - training can be given in firearms. You dont have to be in the military to hold an automatic weapon (especially as that person then went on to complain they werent then supplied with sidearms.Using glives for samples - correct, aseptic techniques are key to getting 'clean' samples...however, under the circumstances, getting a sample at all would be a feat. Getting in a boat after the croc scene - it wasnt on steroids. As the film suggested, its DNA had changed/merged. The science behind it was a little vague, agreed, but still, it IS a sci-fi film.On the positive side, Deciding on going in to a cinema and watching the likes of Pacific Rim, Jurassic Park or any other sci-fi film should be viewed on its merit. It is what it is. If you want a film that makes complete sense scientifically, then probably best to not watch any sci-fi film full stop.This film has some very good acting along with an interesting cast. The soundtrack is very, very good and adds a lot of depth to the viewing.The visuals are also very very good with some very nice touches with the cinematography (looking through the glass of water and her wedding ring very clear, when she was thinking of her husband was a good example of this).Not only a sci-fi film, but also highlighted moral and personal issues very well.",Annihilation
1185,melchiorphilips,The only thing annihilated in this movie is its potential,4,12 February 2020,"My main gripe with this film is that it has great ideas and then executes them frustratingly poorly. For a movie that was obviously meant to be atmospheric and introspective (and granted, the world building is excellent) it gets no time to breathe and actually establish an atmosphere. All willing suspension of disbelief is constantly thrown out the window.The dialogue is a major stumbling block for this film; it is awkwardly fast-paced and hackneyed, and akin to what'd you'd expect from The Room (2003) and NPC dialogue in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Every character is perpetually in the uncanny valley, and seems to have zero motivation. Nobody acts like a human in this movie; soldiers run head-first into danger and scientists are completely apathetic about groundbreaking discoveries. You can't build suspense if nothing makes sense.This script and cast would've made for a great movie if it had been directed by Guillermo del Toro, and edited by someone who actually knows about pacing and colour grading. The actor's performances were only so-so, and I get the feeling that the director failed to get the best out of them. The various instances of CGI ranged anywhere from poor (opening, alligator) to great (climax). All in all, a sub-par film that I wanted to like, but has absolutely nothing going for it that makes me want to watch it again.",Annihilation

It explores many ideas about our existence, survival of the fittest, the origin of life on our planet whilst being a seriously interesting and thought provoking Sci fi movie about our existence not being so perfect and immovable.

1187,diamarkin,Everything wrong with this movie except the CGI & photography,2,3 April 2018,"On a very basic level this movie has no real story line, no continuity and no common sense. 
It's stated early on that military groups have been sent in and disappeared - so of course you send in a group of untrained females - at least a couple of whom are emotionally broken. 
They suspect the ""phenomenon"" is biological - so of course they don't take hazmat suits, or even breathing filters. 
Immediately upon entering the Shimmer they wake up in their tents which are placed unreasonably far from each other and state they have lost several days...then nothing else is said or done about that missing time.
They are not at all worried about their inability to communicate to the outside.
With no idea of the dangers they are facing, THEY SPLIT UP constantly and of course - get into trouble.
Even after they're aware of some of the potential dangers - they settle down to sleep in unfortified structures, and set no sentry watches. All of this set me up to nit pick within the first 30 mins of the film and there were a plethora of nits requiring serious picking. Banal acting, shocking plot holes, too much money spent on CGI and not enough on decent script writing.

1195,tscheltens,Not as original as it seems...,6,21 March 2018,"Annihilation, the most talked about scify of early 2018... and for good and bad reasons. This movies brings visuals and story telling in the same style as Arrival did last year, Kubrick inspired, bit of alien here, bit of 2001 there, like most scify to be honest. Nevertheless, it is interesting and original enough to be among the ones that came before. Not a masterpiece or to be classic, just solid with flaws. So lets talk about the most important aspect first; story. The story of annihilation starts with the ending, which grasps attention. Smart choice for the movie, since at times the situations in the plot seem very desperate and hopeless, which creates interest for the conclusion. 
The movie is at times very mysterious and subtle, but at others bombarding with exposition. Most plot points are explained to the audience through dialog, which feels like a lazy way of telling this somewhat (coming back to that later) interesting story.
The story itself, does not feel entirely satisfying. In some way it does, the main character finds out what she was looking for. But on the scify side of the story it feels a lot like 2001: a space odyssey. And with that I mean the unsatisfying way Kubrick wrote most of his movies (hear me out). Throwing in a lot of alien and mysterious concepts, packed in beautiful cinematography, but feeling very hollow in the conclusion. As an example, the scene in 2001 where they enter the gate or monolith (whatever you want to call it). Its a unique scene, terrifying, but goes on for so long without substance or meaning. The point is, it feels like its put in there to show some skill of the cinematographer or writer without adding to the film in anyway. A lot of scify elements of this movie feels like random bits from other scifies without adding any substance to the movie. 
This movie is not about characters but more so about flashy and freaky scify concepts. The characters feel quite flat, especially the supporting cast. The main character has some depth that is shown in the first act of the movie. We get to know some details about her, but other then that she does not change throughout the story. The supporting cast, apart from some minor traits, isn't developed at all. They have a mission of what only two of them get any motivation for (though very under developed motivation). 
The structure of the plot is quite regular, with the standard three act structure. And the usual 'sequel-hint' at the very end of the movie, although a sequel would be very unlikely.
One thing that bothered me a lot was the 'science' in this scify. As a former biology student and a human being with the capability to think, I thought there were some lazy scify elements that felt more as 'magic'. Talking about the DNA merging of species and transforming of organisms, sounds very fantasy if you ask me. It wouldn't have mattered if the movie did not try to explain the science and was leaning more on the fiction side of scify. But it did put in a lot of science, but in a lazy and almost offending way. Big con of this movie.So, coming to cinematography, where the other half of the shine can be found. Most of the scify bits of the movie look very refreshing and beautiful. The movie uses bright colors to depict alien activity and life forms, which feels very fresh. Some of the wide shots look amazing, with the contrast of bright colors of the nature/alien against darker colors anything human related.
The CGI is okay, it serves the purpose but it is very noticeable. Especially the animals made with CGI. This movie could age very well on any other part of the cinematography, except the CGI would prevent it from doing so. Natalie Portman steals the show; great acting, believeable, gripping. She carries the movie, there isn't much else going on with the acting other then what she delivers. Oscar Isaac was fine, didn't have a lot to do or to show. I thought Jennifer Jason Leigh was a total miscast, I may be baised from The Hateful Eight. Other then that, it is mainly Portman doing what she is great at, and she delivers.The music and sounddesign was fine. Nothing special really. It served the purpose, typical modern scify music really. Only at the end, in the final act, the music became a little too noticable and distracting (talking about electronic sounds).Overal, I thought the movie was fine. Not as good as the hype is trying to make it. The story bothered me at some points because of exposition bombarding and I expected a little more at the end due to all the mysteriousness during the first two acts. CGI was okay and futhermore nothing really stood out. Most of the science elements in this scify were downright lazy and dumb. It felt hollow, with a pretty and shiny outside.",Annihilation

Mentally unstable crew. Supposedly crew was screened by a lone psychologist before going on the expedition. In reality, a psychiatrist would have been a part, if not in charge, of the evaluations.No one knew what happened to the other teams who went into the void. So, Schrödinger's Cat would apply here. Based upon the information and the lack thereof, a team of trained soldiers would have been sent in with the women researchers. Why send in a civilian paramedic, when a member or members of an Air Force Pararescue team would be more logical?Except when they were actually firing the weapons, the dust covers on the rifles were closed during most of the movie. This is a problem with most movies where M-4s and M-16s are involved. If a round is jacked into the chamber then the dust cover would be open, allowing the spent shell to eject. No trained soldier would walk around in a hostile environment without having a round in the chamber.Natalie Portman does not move or react like if she was trained for combat.No biohazard gear was taken with them into the void.No body armor was taken with them into the void.After fighting with an unusually large mutated alligator, the crew decides to travel in small boats instead of going on by foot.Always touching unknown plant life with bare hands.Natalie Portman goes into the forest alone in the dark to look for a crew member that was taken by a large mutated bear.After tossing her pack on the ground, Natalie Portman goes into the light house with just the one clip in her weapon.I've written what I noticed after seeing the movie only once.

This film is by no means perfect but I quite enjoyed it. It has good acting from Portman and Leigh an intriguing concept and stunning visuals. I largely agree that the decision to send this team in as they were was unrealistic, I think some exposition would have been good to understand what had been tried so far because you do wonder why an armoured unit or missiles wouldn't have been successful and I don't believe that any country wouldn't resort to that after months of failure. This slight detachment from what I consider to be realistic is what sets this film apart from a 10/10 film like Arrival for me. Having said that, I wish people would be a bit more forgiving. Hollywood pumps out a large amount of rubbish and the fact that the film studios were too scared to release this to cinema world wide just emphasises my concern.

Based on Jeff VanderMeer's novel, Annihilation slightly resembles Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker (1979), a highly artistic masterpiece from a much braver time, when audiences were less likely to balk at ambiguity. Like Ridley Scott did in Blade Runner 2049, Garland combines unusual, imaginative visuals, ideas, and sounds with more traditional audience-aimed thrills -- but he does so far more seamlessly than Scott. The film is less focused on climactic battles, instead heading toward a far more poetic, surreal ending.
The shape of Annihilation is nothing short of brilliant, with a linear, minimalist starting point that consists of simple, straightforward images (like a lighthouse). It then opens up like a strange, exotic flower, following different offshoots to new, unexpected points in its unpredictable world. The movie is admirable for featuring five women (and no men) as the characters who embark on the journey; Portman's performance especially makes it an emotional one. But given that the movie is sometimes creepy and perhaps even unsettling, it sets itself up as being more of a cult favorite -- it's closer to 2001: A Space Odyssey than to Star Wars -- than a mainstream hit. Still, if you prefer your sci-fi deep, then you're in for a treat.",Annihilation

1219,Movieboiii,The slowest and most confusing movie that I have ever watched,2,25 February 2018,"The trailer for this movie was totally misleading. The trailer made Annihilation out to be a sci-fi action film, but in reality, it was the most boring movie that I have ever watched. For the first 3/4 of the movie, absolutely nothing happens. To make matters worse, all of the actors also talked really slow throughout the movie. So what you have is a movie where nothing exciting happens until the ending. Not only that, but the ending explained absolutely nothing. Going into the movie, I was left with a bunch of questions, and leaving the movie, I was left with even more questions. The only thing good about this movie is the CGI, other than that it's awful. Save your money and go see something else. No wonder why it got a C- Cinemascore rating.",Annihilation

And then it will put you through something else..... inside....... X-) X-) When I haven't been watching this film, I'm often thinking about it, my heart still going out to the characters with Crosby Stills & Nash in my head. I'm gonna try

It's one of the best, most thoughtful and sophisticated sci fi horror films 
I've ever seen. I would say it's set to be a cult classic, on par with Alien or The Thing.

In first place it present a mature Nataly Portman, a woman who already masters the acting art, who nails every role she takes. In the second, the plot was interesting, and it tends to catch the expectator, but it fail on it. 
The problem for me was the pace of the screenplays, too ambicious to keep it simple the storytelling, it was over ornate, rococo in every sense; an then, just when the expectator managed to survived the mottle plot, it became too cryptic, too tight, too intelectual and permantly it denies to talk with the public in their own terms.

I mean, they wanted a good story to tell but now that I want to be a scriptwriter, I feel I have to be honest and judgemental. The script was not inspiring, just boring. There was no dialogue that made me invest in the characters and the beginning act, based on Natalie Portman's character's life just bored me so I actually skipped to a scene I would be more intrested in.

I mean I 10 rated I'm the Pretty Thing That Lives in The House, but this movie isn't a slow burn .... it's like nonexistent burn. The big pay off? A cheap ending. I never buy the Natalie Portman - husband line. There is zero on screen chemistry and she looks 45 and he looks 28. Army couple? Yeah my ass- not at all plausible- not even a Coors Light can in the background. Their foreplay seemed like an 11 year old girl wrote the scene based on what she read in Teen Beat Magazine. It's hard to fathom this is the same Natalie Portman who did Black Swan- she comes across so flat and uninspired and the Team Leader was on some mood suppressants-she was just god awful. Take my advice and watch paint dry- at least their is a happy ending.",Annihilation
1231,MadNick01,This movie is incredibly fascinating an eery,9,16 February 2019,"The best way to describe this movie would be to equate it to sketchbook. From the first glance at the cover its plain and obvious but when you start flipping the pages you will find an incredible art piece.I was a little bit tense seeing an all female cast on the screen thinking the movie would either start preaching something to the viewer or bash the other gender like most people do these days, but the movie doesn't do that at all and i am very grateful for it. This movie is rather long but the way it manages it's own run time is really good. The characters are a bit predictable and obvious but i took no issue with that. I am not a big fan of Natalie Portman to be honest but she did a rather decent job playing Lena in this movie. I really love the score of this movie. I had chills running down my spine when the soundtrack was plying in combination with what i was seeing.It doesn't melt into the background like a lot of scores do but rather it is actively present in the movie and you can definitely notice it. The overall message and theme of the movie is really fascinating to me. It took the overused ""alien invasion"" plot a lot of movies use and completely flips it on its head. The movie definitely pulled the rug from under my feet with that one. I really wish there were more movies like this out there.I got to be honest here though, i had to watch this movie more than once to truly appreciate every single thing this movie throws at you. It can be overwhelming and i do recommend to watch it more than once to have it fully sink in. The movie has an ambiguous open ending that suggests that it's not really Lena but rather the alien came back from the shimmer much like her husband. I like that because the movie was showing us that clearly she has escaped safely. This is what i love the most. This movie has a lot of layers, dimensions and metaphors to it. That's why i give it an 9 out of 10",Annihilation
1232,jasonbrody-68431,"Pretty, boring.",6,5 July 2019,"The visuals in this movie are absolutely incredible. The set design is beautiful, the cinematography is well executed, and practical effects are reminiscent of a long past generation of sci-fi movies that didn't rely on CGI for everything. It's been a while since I've seen a movie and audibly said 'whoa' as I took in the scenery.Unfortunately the writing, particularly the dialogue, is pretty bad. It doesn't help that the delivery by some of the main cast is just weak at times when its supposed to be compelling.The *SCIENCE* aspect of this SCI-fi movie is, bafflingly, perhaps the worst aspect of the film. Everything going on is explained in long-cut exposition scenes, which would be the points of the movie where I would take a minute to rest my eyes. It's not particularly interesting or challenging unless you didn't do biology in high school, and I think these scenes could've been cut completely and the movie would even benefit.There are some scenes where the movie finally starts to build tension, but then something absurd will happen and any tension is instantly killed. I can't go into detail without spoiling the movie, but if you end up watching this for yourself, you'll definitely recognize the scenes I'm talking about.I didn't know that this movie was based off a book before watching it, but I did guess halfway through, since the whole time the movie came off as a bad book adaptation. I haven't read the book so I couldn't tell you how closely it follows the source material, but given that the only part about this movie I really enjoyed was the cinematography, I wouldn't be surprised if it was the source material that's holding this movie back.If you do decide to watch this movie, I recommend muting it. Your experience will be much better.",Annihilation

I am not usually into sci-fi but it appeared under the horror category on Netflix and I've always liked Natalie Portman so I figured I'd give it a go.Within the first ten minutes I suspected it might end with it all being 'just a dream' or all some grand metaphor for Portman's mental state and I'm not sure I was entirely wrong to assume that. I'm also not sure if I am just stupid and don't understand the true artistic depth of the film or if I am thinking way too deeply into it. However, I think it is one of those movies that everyone looks up an explanation for after they leave and are left to come to their own conclusions.I did like how the source of scariness came from the unknown, the beauty of nature and the mundane. I also found it interesting how classic horror tropes such as the 'final girl', 'clones' and 'found footage' are appropriated and reinvented. Similarly, the merging of genres including psych-thriller, sci-fi, fantasy, romance and drama are combined to tear the viewer between a false sense of security and an underlying sense of suspense. I think this also emphasises the importance of paradox and balance throughout the film.This is an enjoyable film with an interesting concept only let down by its ambiguousness and questionable science.",Annihilation

Where is the military? Where are the scientist? 
After years of studying this phenomenon, there should've been a whole city full of people trying to figure out what's going on, and how to deal with it if they can't. 
What do they do? They send in five women with machine guns, and a whole bunch of baggage to figure out how to deal with this phenomenon. 
 Inside, they find an alligator that is as stealthy as a ninja, bears that learn how to talk, and trees that grow into the shapes of human beings, even holding the hands of little tiny plant human beings.

I´m of course talking about Andrei Tarkovsky's stalker (1979)Alex Garland's Annihilation is modernized version of Stalker. Though It has some ideas of its own. Men are changed into women. Of course Americans need to have guns when entering unknown territory. Modernized movie needs to have horror elements and violence. There must be blood and screaming. There must sex. There must be explaining. Any how the scenery is quite same, not too exotic, not too boring. It is a landscape without humans where plants and trees grow wild.

I had no expectations and no knowledge of the movie going in. The acting is good, the story is good, the special effects are cool, it's a little creepy in places but not unnecessarily gory and there is no bad horror. My only real issue with this movie is that there is a slight sidestory that seems totally unnecessary and doesn't have anything to do with the main plot. Other than that, it's a good flick. This movie does end with questions however so don't expect everything to be there up in a neat little bow at the end. Enjoy.",Annihilation

1274,Ramirez1984,A mindbending masterpiece turning epic in the end.,9,16 March 2018,"Just... WOW. This is not only SciFi at its best with a groundbreaking concept breaking away from all predictable boring clichés we have come so used to being fed with in modern action-packed ""Sci-Fi"" cinema. No, this is Film at its absolute best. I would go as far as to say that this is a masterpiece and the up there with ""Moon"" from 2009 in its genre. Like a David Lynch, Alex Garland has a gift for the implicit. Its Annihilation's strongest suit and it works so well with the sublime soundscapes and the underlying menace and nightmarish story-arc seeping into the spectator's mind while you were busy marveling at the visuals. 
Unlike Bladerunner 2049, albeit visually also strong, being completely bereft of emotion due to its static main actor, the strong almost exclusive female cast here (Nathalie Portman!) pushes the acting to skyhigh levels. Not only Portman deserves an Oscar but also Garland for its choice of quality instead of aiming for profit and pleasing the big audience. This is a film any cinephile will toroughly enjoy from beginning to end. It starts off very strong, midway I feared for a slight moment Annihilation would spiral down into a typical boring horror SF as happens usually in this genre (Promotheus anyone?) though nothing was further from the truth, it surprises you gets all mind**** psychological on you and truly shines in its final scenes. This is an I can't stop watching it thanks to its amazing and well built-up story, the tensionarc and its stunning beauty.
And the scenes are oh so memorable... Without spoiling anything, one of the last scenes in this movie might be the creepiest yet most beautiful moment to come out of any film in a long, long time.One of the best SF films of the last 20 years!",Annihilation
1275,CardinalsBaseball,Awful and pretentious,1,26 February 2018,"Reading the positive reviews of this film has left me speechless. This is not a good movie. It's dull and pointless. I can only assume people raving about this are pretentious snots, who think it makes them look like an intellectual by praising this film. Little of the film hold up to scrutiny. Five women spend a week walking through jungles and swamp to get to a lighthouse. Why? Why didn't they drive or take a boat? I never heard a reason given for this. It's a lighthouse! It would be very accessible via road. Why are they trudging through jungles and swamps? The women have volunteered for what they believe to be a suicide mission They each have their own reasons, something to do with self-destruction or some other nonsense. But when things get hairy and someone is killed, two of them go ballistic and want to turn around and go back. They knew it was a suicide mission, why are they suddenly acting like this was unexpected? Apparently, the Shimmer mixes and changes the DNA of all organic material. Why this makes alligators and bears more hostile toward people is never explained. Little is explained about anything. In the end, the shimmer is undone with a simple grenade. Why it took three years for someone to do that in inexplicable. The climax with the alien marionette and bad '80s music is laughable. The film seemed to be saying that the shimmer, like cancer, isn't benevolent nor malevolent; it just is. It has no point or objective. Ironically, that sums up the movie as well.",Annihilation

At first, i only thought it's yet another sci-fi garbage, a vain attempt to make something as scary as ""The Thing"" and as scientific as ""Star Trek"", but no. This is not a movie, that's a picture. Say, a Hieronymus Bosch's ""patched"" work, with many unrelated pieces stitching together, begetting a specific atmosphere (no, not literally).There's no logic around Shimmer. The first absurdity si too obvious: the interrogation scene, which is interrupted by flashbacks assumes those people at ""Area X"" know something about security. But they send five people to Shimmer without biohazard suits. The expedition team is composed out of scientists, yet they care next to nothing about bringing information back, nothing about keeping out of trouble. Out of many possible decisions they almost always choose the most dangerous one. Everything is done irrationally, on a whim, with no plan.Yet it creates the atmosphere I like. If Shimmer transforms life forms, it can transform their minds, as well. I can easily accept that the moment the expedition entered the shimmered land, they stopped being scientists. Just five more organisms, so fun to play with.To me, the most frightening scene is when Josie talks about Shimmer while beginning to transform into a plant. No fear, no panic, nothing at all - she just accepts her transformation as something normal, and keeps talking. This, not the mutant bear, nor gator, nor the eerie human remains, reminding me of both ""Xtro"" and ""The Thing"" - halcyon and serene Josie-soon-to-be-a-bush was the real horror.I watched this movie several times. I like that patchwork of unrelated events. I like the atmosphere. And the soundtrack, of course.",Annihilation

The whole plot is some sort of a prequel to Tarkovsky's Stalker where every detail about the Zone is matching to the Annihilation's description of Area X.
Then there's a scene in the film with an ugly bear which was copied from the Revenant. However it's just useless and doesn't give anything to the concept.
Regardless of the ripoffness of it all, nothing brings any profoundness to it. I can't see anything deeper than the storyline itself, because there are no ideas behind it.

I have to say I'm baffled by the extremely low reviews from some people, especially those who claim they went to sleep during the movie (is it fair to give it one star if you didn't see all of it?), or those who claim they are doing it to counter the ""fake"" ten star reviews. I am giving this a ten because this movie single-handedly restored my faith in cinema as capable of giving me an ""experience"" in the theater. This is not a perfect film. That's not why I gave it a ten. I gave it a ten because of its vision and its impact. I'd say it's a cross between Alien, Arrival, Monsters, and 2001. If you don't like films that create an environment and put you in it to experience something, you probably won't like this. It's not a straight linear sci-fi film where you will have all your questions answered. Instead, it will make you think about what life and death is, about what ties us together, and it will give you a few scares along the way, and show you things you have never seen in other films. It will also convey how important the soundtrack can be in a film.It's tragic that other countries didn't get a chance to see this in the theater. For anyone watching this overseas on Netflix, I recommend you watch on the largest television you can find with the best sound system you can get, and crank it. If you have to bribe your friend with the 70"" television and Atmos sound system, do it. It's worth it to experience this film to the fullest. I wish I could see it for the first time again in the theater.If you've read the book, Garland says this was created as a sort of ""dream"" of the book, and it's only roughly based on that work. If you have read the book first, you need to reset your expectations going in.Again, this is not a ""paid"" review, it's not a ""fake"" review. I experienced what I can only describe as a near-religious experience in the theater watching this film, and a repeated view at home brought all those feelings back.

the start,as a norm,showed great promise, then we proceed with all female crew of 4 to the journey to the shimmer ;each having different goal,thus the shimmer ""responding"" differently to each of them . someone wants to face it,someone wants to fight it,someone just ""nothing"" to do with it. 
the first fail is there,the writers didn't bother to cover Tessa's ending at all,like that does not matter anymore, the shimmer comes out as ""living will"" but accord to the person's blood it took shape to;which ultimately befalls to nothing but travesty of the whole journey ;which to mind you Natalie's character dismantling the whole ""alien"" thingy. 
secondly,whats the point of the story anyway? what's this dystopic journey amount to? to find yourself,while shimmer twitching your DNA,and that putting heavy pressure on the minds ? or just regret of life,and leading yourself to something worthwhile? the abrupt ""burn the whole set up "" again does not answer it. 
and one logical fail,which i dint see anyone picking up-> if the Tower is NEAR the sea side, and the shimmer didnt bother to cover the sea area (yeah,check the ending,its true) then why the hell come any military operation was held from that side? silly.
not to mention the whole ""female crew"" journey was silly, no semblance at all, it dint answer why the forgot their memory first they entered,but still keeping the rest of the journey memory ;the tactical failure is immanence ,yet the proceeded miraculously, where ""no man"" (except the hero) even went!!

But for some strange reason I gave it another watch, and I feel compelled this time to write a quick personal opinion as the credits roll up the screen.Personally I think the title is suited to the nature of the film and it's misleading. With a title like Annihilation you'd wouldn't be wrong to think it's about aliens causing destruction and carnage.
The film just doesn't reflect those tones in the film, in contrast it's more about creation and alternations than annihilating everything.
So if you're after a Tom cruise War of the Worlds style then this won't be for you.
Visually it is great ( at times ) that's not to say it's incredible but the subtle way the film chooses to show alteration to the environment based on alien influence is well done. There were times i reminded myself that this isn't set on another plant , and set on earth.
The dialogue is so so, the pace is a little slow and conversations often feel like the script was a short story stretched out to be a feature length.
Acting was good. Ignore the comments from previous reviews about women trying to be men or it's insulting to women!
If a film is good then it's good, and this wasn't let down because of the actresses, even if this was played by a lamppost it would have been just meh! So I thought the acting was solid, some scenes were totally pointless. The lovemaking scene with a colleague literally has nothing to do with anything.Now the ending the ENDING . The first time I watched it , I flat out hated it . This time I really enjoyed it.
It keeps you engaged even if you don't really get it.One of the last questions asked towards the end of the film is "" what did they want?""

Most of the area the Shimmer's claimed is swampland and thick jungle, a verdant wonderland where time seems to flow differently and everything's shaded by the shifting, brightly-colored edges of the Shimmer itself.It's established early on that the Shimmer has existed for some time, and the government's efforts to poke at it with drones and instruments hasn't yielded results. They've also sent people, and no one has returned. With the Shimmer steadily growing larger, the authorities worry it will eventually swallow entire towns and cities if it can't be stopped.Portman and her companions each have their own personal reasons for volunteering on what looks like a suicide mission, but they're hopeful - while the teams that went in before them and vanished had been comprised of military spec ops, they're a team of scientists who hope to succeed with brains where braun failed.Sadly, Annihilation seems straight out of JJ Abrams' much-derided ""mystery box"" school of filmmaking. Whetting the audience's appetite and building tension are all worthy goals, but once the mystery is revealed, the narrative deflates. Strong performances from Portman, Gina Rodriguez, Oscar Isaac, Benedict Wong and the rest of the cast can't save Annihilation from the disappointment that sets in once that mystery box is opened.",Annihilation

But as soon as they start prepping to go in there it just gets silly and worst of all , empty. The prepping is so silly as someone said above why would the governemnt keep sending people in if no one had ever come back and there was no way to communicate with the unnaffected world, but to be honest this would be ok had the rest of the movie not been a let down. I was expecting to find mind bending ideas and characters and aspects to make me think about and get into but what I got was really should some half assed ""scientific"" explanation which was totally unnecessry and the only idea the movie had was dna refractss and things change and then that's all it was 50 times. On top of that we knew before hand the other characters would die so the movie just got rid of them in a rather uninteresting way. Everybody is going on about the bear scene which was cool at best not like scary and creepy like everybody is saying , such an interesting concept should have been worked with so much better than it was. I'm no film expert but thought the movie was reallly dull in comparison to what it could ve been so now Im going to watch stalker that people keep prasing. Tnhis being said the movie is not bad , it's actually pretty ok just i couldnt really enjoy it over my disappontment with such wasted potential.

I've rarely ever been moved by the heartbreak genre. But in its few doses in this movie, Natalie Portman's performance is still making me choke up. Her casting was absolutely necessary. Her character's military and professor history was very present and realistic in her character. Her chemistry with Oscar Isaac was flawless.Jennifer Jason Leigh was jaw dropping.

Was it a subatomic energy, a pathogen or radiating light force, you never truly find out what it is, it remains a mystery. It is a very dark and somewhat depressing story set on earth with an otherworldly environment caused by the effect of the alien presence. The movie is quite slow in places but excellent in parts especially the last 30 minutes, which were beautifully haunting and original.

I won't write about the technical side of the movie, just wanted to mention this:
Maybe it's just me, but this movie is not about alien invasion. I define it as a metaphor, where the protagonist go in a psychiatric institution (that's why only woman go in the mission), where her ""roommates"" have different reasons to be depressed about. They fight with their fear/shame/suicide thoughts, and at the end of the movie, everybody made a decision.
A creature kills a woman (she commit suicide)in a bathroom-like environment, the others try to stop her but it's too late. Her act influence others (some fear more, some starts to accept death more).

Brilliant performances and gorgeous effects coalesce a fluid, telling, terrifying conclusion. In many ways, this film is a test of heart, demanding we orient ourselves against the universe, certain to be devoured. Deliberate, economic, and visionary, the volatile alien world excites and terrifies on the surface. That's just the beginning.I went to post the picture for this review, and I realized that this movie left me so speechless that I almost forgot to mention: the characters are all women scientists. Furthermore, this film takes leave from the typical plot tropes that you would expect to emerge from its premise: people, leaders, the government are all innocent.

Namely: the Zone, the Heart of the Zone, the mutants, death as an ordinary companion, and moments of sheer beauty.
Yet this movie lacks the pessimism, the fatalism of its Slav counterparts. Ok, that's cultural, but it also fails to explore in depth the ""nakedness"" that personalities get in such extreme places. Plus, the plot has some severe wholes which do not add suspense, but perpexcity. Some weird decission making process also seems to affect everyone there. And last but not least, I felt that Netflix is trying to pull out all the stops its algorithms provide.
Overall, I think is enjoyable, but I can't help to have the feeling that this was a missed opportunity.Btw: the mutant bear was a great and original addition to the mutants catalog. I'm sure we'll see in the future more references to this idea!",Annihilation

There are definitely a few things that could have been different to make for a better film; like some military trained people to tag along with the scientists. Only 1 person has made it out alive so far and he's on a ventilator, and they didn't think to bring some people who could protect them? I also don't understand why they didn't wear hazmat suits or something. They have zero knowledge of what is inside the shimmer because everyone has died, but they go in anyway with no protection from chemical or biological agents. What kind of scientists are these?

You'll have to see for yourself.Personally, what I liked most about the film (especially the last 20-30 minutes or so) is that it's WEIRD. Like really, really weird. The film fails in not delivering its best and showing its true colors until the final minutes (the film's like two hours long) but that's also where it succeeds.That said, the film starts out pretty slow, but the nice visuals and a great musical score certainly help in keeping you hooked until the end.If you're looking for something very different, trust me - you won't be disappointed.",Annihilation
1348,msierraalt,An uncanny look at self-destruction,9,20 March 2018,"'Annihilation' is a cerebral science fiction film reminiscent of Tarkovsky's 'Stalker' and Carpenters 'The Thing' at the same time.
At first glance, it is apparent that the movie contains excellent cinematography, outstanding visual effects and great acting from Portman and the rest of the cast. The themes, however, are disputed and controversial because everyone has their own interpretation of them. For me, 'Annihilation' explores the self-destructive nature of humanity through a biological entity capable of making everything around it mutate.
The only issue I have with this film is the fact that the characters are not explored enough. This may be a result of the restrictive run-time and the tight editing, which leaves the audience with only the most memorable scenes but also diminishes the deeply uncanny adventure that this film could have been. Therefore, I think two hours were not sufficient to tell a highly experimental story like this. 'Annihilation' is the kind of film that needs a long run time, since every second adds to the tension and oddness of the place the characters are in and can reward a patient audience with a rare, enduring and almost tangible experience.",Annihilation

1351,theblurbq,Beyond The Shimmer,5,2 March 2018,"Alex Garland's adaptation of Annihilation is ambiguous at best. The film is loosely based off of Jeff VanderMeer's best selling 'Southern Reach' trilogy. The plot of the film follows the basic outline of around four experts entering the Shimmer to investigate the root cause. Natalie Portman plays the film's lead Lena, with Jennifer Jason Leigh as the psychologist, Tessa Thompson, Gina Rodriguez, and Tuva Novotny.The film is told in the perspectives of flashbacks and real time. This makes the viewer easily lose interest in the story if it it doesn't have some sort of consistent thread running through. One of the effects of being in The Shimmer is that you develop a form of dementia. After crossing over, the team awoke with no memory of what happened but deduced through food rations they had been inside for at least three days.This would have been a very interesting perspective of story telling, however the time jump between the flashbacks, Lena's interrogation, and time spent in the Shimmer is so large that you can never fully get invested. The best parts of the films were when they were inside The Shimmer.The set director created a world much like that of The Last Of Us with a seemingly constant growth of fungi. It's sort of explained that the rate of evolution moves much faster in this zone and therefore animals and plants take on an other-worldly appearance. Again, just as you are beginning to really get into these moments you are ripped out by a flash back or the interrogation.On top of this, any time you begin to get a hint of an explanation as to what is going on you are pulled to a totally different scene. It get's more frustrating as the movie goes on because things just stop making sense. This makes it sound like one of those movies that you have to be an intellectual to understand, but it just doesn't make sense. It's almost like Alex Garland took the main parts of the book he liked and then tried to put them together with not much in between.If you want to make an intriguing sci-fi movie, all the dots need to connect at the end. A lot of the scenes seemed either out of context or just very badly timed, moments that seemed shocking or intriguing were dropped or instantly switched gears. With all of this being said the movie isn't completely terrible.In fact, the five characters we follow are portrayed very well by the respective actors. Each character had a slightly obscured past, after all this 'suicide mission' is volunteer, that you wanted to know more about. Unfortunately the film didn't offer much character growth for any of them, including the lead.All things considered this probably wouldn't be your best choice for a movie date, but if you really wanna see it give it a shot. For this writer, the movie wasn't very intriguing as a whole and did many things that reminded me of other sic-fi's I would rather have watched. I understand what the director was going for but in all honesty, I don't feel it was achieved.",Annihilation

I was expecting a little more action, but it turned out the action was just really lame. Like really lame. I try not to hate on movies so much because I appreciate the work these people put into their films; however, this was just not there for me. It could be that I saw Game Night the night before and it blew me away, but I think it was just that the movie really wasn't that good. I don't like to give spoilers, but even if I did, I wouldn't know what to say because the movie was literally all over the place. From the Shimmer to flashbacks to the Lighthouse, I did not appreciate that at all. And the ending? I can't even begin to explain that ending.

Cancer is self-destructive and we learn from the film that apparently it's hard-wired in our genetic structure. We as living organisms inherit the potential for self-destruction from birth. Sort of like the concept of origin sin. Anyway, each of the main cast of characters have had some sort of tragedy or self-destructive experience happen to them. This is how they all find their way together entering the shimmer to figure out what all the fuss is about. The shimmer is a growing dome, alien-like structure that is getting increasingly bigger and ""influencing"" the genetic code of organisms caught inside. Essentially in the shimmer animals, plants, and of course humans are sharing DNA, which causes them to mutate. Yes, the concept of Annihilation takes its logical leaps and liberties, but to dwell on this is to miss the point of the film. There's many directions to how one might approach interpreting the symbolism of the shimmer. For me, it's the human tendency for self-destruction, how we (our minds) contain the potential to destroy us, sending us into a downward spiral of suffering. Whether it's from being in a state of grief after losing a loved one, becoming an addict, or suffering from crippling depression or even anxiety. We all need help and sometimes the hardest part is to ask for it. For many of us, we try to deal with it in our own, mostly self-destructive, ways and unfortunately the version of ourselves that emerges from it all is a husk of who we once were. We'll look the same on the outside, but we're ultimately lost and deteriorated on the inside.On top of containing some fantastic symbolism and meaning, this film is a visual AND auditory FEAST. The imagery is stunning and also truly horrific. And the last 15 minutes or so is some of the greatest sci-fi magic you will ever witness and listen to. The soundtrack is astonishing. It's brilliantly realized as it generates an incredible sense of dread and wonder at the same time. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.It's a fantastic film and I can't recommend it enough.",Annihilation
1365,maxgrayson,Visually stunning,8,25 March 2019,"I can understand peoples dislike for this movie to a point, but I was satisfied. The plot isn't the most riveting story ever told, but it is fairly unique with some neat sci-fi concepts that feel like they could exist in reality. Where this movie might lose points with people, I feel it more than makes up for with the absolutely stunning visual aspect. Wonderful camera shots, lighting, setups and awesome CGI make this one of the most beautifully shot movies I've seen this year. Not every movie has to be life changing or profoundly deep to be a great watch in my opinion.",Annihilation

I won´t comment specifics, no need: there are more than a thousand reviews here. I will just state that, if it wasn´t for the presence of a top-star like Natalie Portman and the dude that plays her husband who´s also been around, at least this flick could have the excuse of being a full-on B-movie, but by taking itself seriously, it is simply unexcusable garbage.",Annihilation

It has parts and I do mean small parts sprinkled throughout the movie that are interesting or could even be called intense but they only last for a minute or two and then you are back on the visual, artsy track for 20 min before it has another interesting moment. I really hated most of the film but the last 15-20 min of this sci fi is real garbage and just plain stupid. 
I also didn't like there wasn't any men in the film other than small parts to fill in the plot if there was one. Many of the issues these women had with each other I simply could not believe they would come up espacially at the time they did and it seemed like they were trying to make it a female dominated film for whatever reason.",Annihilation

I'd recommend skipping through everything except the final scene, as I honestly think the final confrontation in the lighthouse works better as a stand-alone mystery. The soundtrack is gorgeous and unsettling, the visuals are beautiful, and they combine to create a scene that just makes you shut up and watch it, stunned, which is a rare event in movies (at least for me).

1375,liquidstar-08582,Annihilation - A meta-horror about Ascension.,10,29 October 2019,"Annihilation ---> What is it about? First off; very like a short story by J.G. Ballard, The Crystal World. Go find the story. I'll wait.The Shimmer - What is it? The movie explains it as a 'refraction' process. This has great relevance for our time (genetic engineering and nanotech being introduced into nature/culture). One could say it is a 'fractal organism' - fractal DNA. There is also a reference to liquification. This is the dissolving of the Self, or the rigid ego hierarchy structure - it is constant transformation. No mortal human could withstand that process for long. We need periods of time in which to be rigid, solid. So the Shimmering is like an acid trip that never ends, mediated by physical law.In 'Annihilation' the visual data are important. It is not just special effects - information abut the reality of the 'Shimmer' is being conveyed topographically - Rene Thoms Catastrophe Theory is more relevant here than plot devices. I would also reference the information glut (or 'black hole') and the nature of the information age as expressed digitally. This may not be the first film that is actually about its true medium, digital reality; and is probably exploring that reality as a truth to materials concept as found in visual art.",Annihilation

Just because you dont fully comprehend a movie doesn't mean it's bad and pretentious guys, cmon!)However, if you enjoy a deeper metaphorical narrative regarding the nature of reality and what it means to change, biologically or otherwise, you will enjoy this movie a lot.It leaves many questions up to your interpretation which I enjoy. I've read numerous theories regarding the movie, all of which hold some validity. I think what you take away from the movie shows a glimpse into of what kind of person you are. Maybe more so than other movies.One thing I really enjoyed aesthetically in this movie was its use of ecological body horror.

1381,sporebubu,Could have been much better,6,16 September 2020,"I have to say, i had high expectations coming in, all the trailers looked great, the reviews were great and its thrown around as a great cosmic horror movie, but i could only feel more and more underwhelmed as the movie went on. The movie movie wants to tackle an interesting theme: the destruction and rebirth of oneself, which it does fairly competently, but its really handicapped by the surface plot and action.The shimmer is an ever expanding area where everyone and everything that has entered it has never been found, with the exception of one person who is dying and can't remember anything, and yet it feels like the people involved in this mission have no competence to speak of:Dr Ventress is the only person who we ever see in charge of the operation, and she goes inside the Shimmer with only 4 other people out of which only one has military training while the others have zero experience in harsh conditions, none of them have gas masks, gloves, never mind a protective suit, body armors and a helmets, why didn't they at least enter the shimmer in a vehicle? Why didn't they go by boat when the lighthouse is right next to the beach? A helicopter could have reached the lighthouse in a few hours, ( i haven't mentioned but the source of the shimmer is at a lighthouse, the groups mission is to reach it and find out what it is exactly. ), they don't even have a journal or something to make notes, this could be useful in a place where people forget the things they did.And these are questions that come up in the first 15-20 minutes of the movie, and equally as many in the rest, none of which get answered, logic wise, this movie has little.Aesthetically its a mixed bag, cinematography and scenery are really beautiful, that is definitely the highlight of this movie, but anything that moves, creatures, mutations etc. are just...very obviously CGI, and it takes you out of the movie completely.This movie is very confused in what it wants to be, through the movie i had to wonder, what am i watching?Is this trying to be cosmic horror?
Is it trying to be action scfi-fi?
Or a Tarkovsky-esque philosophical drama?Because it has elements of all of these mentioned but it never really succeeds at any of them or commits to one path, and this is perfectly illustrated by the music, one moment its dark choral music ( like the ones from 2001 a Space odyssey ), sometimes its strange synth compositions and there's a guitar song that sounds like its from the Last of Us and its so distracting and out of place you cant help but feel someone edited it in the movie when the director wasn't paying attentionOscar Isaac and Natalie Portman both have great performances, Jennifer Jason and Tuva Novotny do as much as they can with their character, but everyone else is very forgettable, but given how little development their characters got you're not sure who's at fault there.I would still advise people to go watch this movie, if only for the great visuals and the admittedly fascinating ending. Based on the mixed reviews its a love it or hate it movie, i certainly didn't love it but some might. Just don't go in with high expectations like i did.",Annihilation

I think some folks have made a deal about this film being female centric but if you have no character development or story line, what investment do you have in supporting a film of this type. Continuity has awful, the imagery was nonsensical, and plot line was just ridiculous. The biggest disappointment I had was in myself for not walking out before the end credits.

The film has such an interesting concept that has never been expored before and leaves a lot of room for interpretation and leaves you thinking for days after viewing (even though the plot is reminiscent of Stalker). The film however has a very slow pace with long periods of time in between action scenes which everyone will not enjoy, but it works perfectly for me. The visual effects are stunning and the music is bone rattling and haunting. The major gripes I have with this movie is that it spoils the ending at the begining of the movie which lessened the impact the story had on me and Natalie Portman's performance left much to be desired. This is a must watch movie for any sci fi fan, escpecially if you enjoy slow burn movies and is easily one of the best in the genre of the decade.

I love the concept of an alien 'invading' this world, but doesn't particularly want anything from us. It's so hard to imagine something that doesn't want. It's so opposite of how we are built.

The action is really well weighted.As a medical doctor, thinking a bit, I came to the conclusion that this movie is a metaphor for cancer.In my opinion, the border of the shimmer represent the outer border of a tumor. The meteor hitting earth giving rise to the shimmer could represent how ionizing radiation can hit us and give rise to cancer. A tumor is slowly growing, so is the shimmer. Inside a tumor everything is constantly changing and mutating as in the shimmer. Cells in a tumor acquires new abilities and functions in a lot of biological mechanisms to survive ""attacks"" from ex chemoagents or defense mechanisms from the host, just as in the shimmer where the different human groups entering the shimmer would represent immune system responses trying to understand and fight it. The plant-woman succombing to the shimmer right after she accepts her fate would represent how people with cancer at some point often accepts death and often soon after passes away. Finally the clone-Kane would represent metastasis, cancer cells from the tumor popping up in a completely different place/organ, and changed-Lena (w tattoo) escaping the shimmer as it is destroyed would be a metaphor for how when a cancer is eradicated there are often cancer cells left that in time can create a relapse.",Annihilation

What happened after that was gradual, but I just became quite overcome with the beauty and horror of it all. It didn't matter to me that this movie wasn't really sic-fi, or drama or horror. It was a sort of fractal (or refraction) of human experiences and somehow became something beautiful in the process. The final sequences are just breathtaking from an artistic perspective and the movie has lingered with me, perhaps because it is just so different from anything else I have ever seen.

1419,red_zebra2,Three reasons you may not like this film,9,25 March 2018,"I found this film tense, thrilling, beautiful, imaginative and intriguing. I'm bemused by the number of highly negative reviews here, but have three possible explanations. The first is that the main protagonists are all women, which seems to bother some viewers. I found this aspect a breath of fresh air, with interesting and strong female characters that develop and are revealed over the course of the film. The second that may not appeal to lovers of standard Hollywood fare is that the pace is somewhat slow and thoughtful. However, this adds a wonderful air of mystery and suspense. I'm pleased to see another reviewer below also saw a comparison with Tarkovsky's Stalker in this sense (though of course nothing can compare to his cinematography). Here, the tranquil or tense atmosphere is punctuated by some scenes of exceptional horror that really shake you. And the third is that there is no nicely packaged ""answer"". There are several possible explanations for the ""shimmer"" as we go on, but I don't think there is any clear right one. The characters actually discuss this ambiguity themselves, so I do believe it is completely intentional. Finally I would add that the music is amazing - some amazing atmospheric industrial sounding tracks by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury. One of the rare films I would watch again.",Annihilation
1420,Sultan_of_the_East,No hero saving the Human race here,10,16 March 2018,"You don't write a review based on some personal expectation like it's too slow (Tomb Raider is for you), the movie doesn't ask big questions like human existence (big question for you is why the need?), story with big holes (holes in your head maybe), and no character development (do they need to act like stupid and annoying?)The story concept is fairly original which is hard to come by in recent years. You go through the scenes and events in this movie with full of wondering of what is happening to things and lifeforms within the shimmer. No, it's not a typical alien invasion movie with the bad guys just want to kill us all, and we end with a final show down war. The score is beautiful yet eerie and goes along the scenes perfectly.The ending leaves you wanting more. Sorry, there's no hero saving the Human race here.",Annihilation

The whole plot is a mess. The movie is not mysterious it just doesn't make sense. The choices the characters make are illogical and pointless. Some themes are introduced for no reason, and have no purpose in neither development of the story nor in character evolution. The whole idea of sending a team of only woman seems very odd, it feels like some sort of feminist stand. I am not sure what the producers tried to achieve, that women can be action heros??, well they clearly can but not this time. The problem is not that weren't female Rambos but that they were't anything else either. The only thing I got out of this movie is that when places as switched forcefully any without reason ridiculous results are to be expected.",Annihilation

1423,tundakov,"Beautiful mess, full of loopholes and other inconsistencies.",8,18 March 2018,"The previous reviewer put it right. I'd add to his list the suspiciosly long-lasting camera batteries. We all know that Panasonic camcorders are the battery suckers, right? :) But those left in the Shimmer appear to be sufficiently charged after being left there for a year, even though the last one supposed to be running till the end of its SD card's free space. Unless, of course, the replicant (for the lack of better word for it) turned off the camcorder but then we have to ask ourselves why he would do so and why, if he was intelligent enough to do just that, he didn't destroy the camcorder (and the record) which had quite a damning evidence about his true identity.
Overall, it is a movie that pretends to be a hard science fiction, yet it contradicts even the basic common sense, just like Alien: the Covenant. But the latter was an expensive Hollywood movie which had terrific art direction, and this one clearly doesn't. Interestingly, Garland's previous movie was almost ideally executed in the art department. 
Part of the aforementioned problem is the CGI which is uneven in execution. It looks especially cheap in the shots which feature simulated buildings and interiors, as if it was a money-saving measure to avoid building the expensive sets (which it probably was). In a few instances it's bad to the point you have to mobilize all the suspension of disbelief in you to keep enjoying the movie. The mutant bear was a rare exception. It was probably the most intense scene in the movie and the only one which looked perfect.
The parallel narrative of the protagonist's extramarital affair felt unnecessary. It was put there for a reason, no doubt, but what it was remains a mystery to many. It didn't seem to explain anything, didn't seem to serve any good purpose, didn't seem to move the story forward. Those short flashbacks felt like they came from a b-roll or were a pick-up, and were okayed for the final cut only at the last minute for whatever reason the producers had. Also, they were cut into seemingly random places in the movie, so that the movie's already unbalanced pacing suffered even more.
Its cinematography has that distinctive ""video"" look, especially in the CGI-heavy scenes, and way too oversaturated in general by modern tastes. Maybe it's cool for a Netflix series, IDK, but not for a movie of considerable production value.
As for the ending, I didn't find anything worth explaining there. It's perfectly in line with recent fashion of making an ambiguous ending which can supposedly please both general types of movie-goers: the ""optimists"" and the ""realists"" alike. It became a trend since 2010, with phenomenal popularity of Nolan's Inception but It seems to be an overused cliche in 2018. 
So, you can think it's a happy ending, if you wish so, or you can think the Shimmer finally found the right form for the expansion into the humans' world (a heterosexual couple of appropriate mating age) and decided to make a fresh start from there, destroying the impact zone itself, as it wasn't needed anymore for its interbreeding experiments.
Overall, it was a pleasant experience and not a waste of time at all, especially for a hard sci-fi fan like myself, and left something to think about after the credits. Most importantly, I decided to read the original trilogy which, many say, is much more complex than the movie. Kudos to Alex Garland for sticking with the genre which is very hard to be successful in. Villeneuve does it much better, though.",Annihilation

Compared to the source material, it is bloody awful. Alex Garland's script takes every nuance and question posed by Jeff Vandermeer's book and replaces it with the mind numbingly blunt or a cookie cutter answer. Replacing the border, an absolute edge with a door that appears just as mysteriously as Area X (there is no meteorite in print) with ""the shimmer"". The Physicist listening to three seconds of garbled radio and declaring as fact that ""it refracts everything, even DNA"", thus solving a mystery that some of the brightest minds in the country had been working on for YEARS. At almost every turn the screenplay takes a giant crap on both the original story and the audience's intelligence. You would think that the absurdly abrupt and hackneyed ""climax"" of killing the monster with fire (an organism that according to this very movie survived atmospheric entry and impact) would be the dressing on this crap salad. But no. That was Garland's decision to remove entirely from his movie some of the central plot points of the book.

What I watched was nearly 2 hours of mind-numbing tedious garbage. Nothing is really ever explained, everyone talks very slowly (I am assuming they are trying to create suspense, but it is very unnatural) - the whole setup just seems very odd and illogical for a group of women scientists preparing to venture into someplace treacherous and unknown.I will say the special effects and CGI were very good - so it did have spectacular visuals - the only reason I am giving 3 stars. Everything else was either mediocre or awful - and too often illogical.Spoilers ahead...Some of the stupid things that happen in the movie:Despite 3 years of study - sending in teams and drones - running tests at the perimeter - no one inside of a scientific (government?) facility has any information regarding what is going on inside of this bubble-like anomaly encapsulating an area of swamp and coastline - they call it inside ""The Shimmer.""A female psychologist plays the tough bad-ass character. Not the paramedic or former soldier - no the psychologist (you would assume a psychologist might be sensitive and sweet). And for some reason this psychologist has been making the decisions regarding who enters this anomaly (a.k.a. The Shimmer). I'm not even sure she is part of the government - which I assumed was in control of the facility because they capture Lena's escaped husband in the beginning third of the movie.A male soldier's insides have been completely mutated and swirling around like a worm, but somehow he is still alive. Upon seeing this on video, a former paramedic exclaims it was a lighting trick and to not believe what they just saw (Aside: pretty much all of us in the theater burst out laughing).A former soldier is using night-vision goggles to see out into the dark - but she's standing in the middle of a booth-type structure with the lights on - which obviously would disrupt the ability to use the night-vision goggles.Cells extracted and plated from Lena's blood are rapidly dividing and mutating, but somehow she is not extremely sick and dying?The ending is so exceptionally weird that I'm not sure a written description could even come close to accurate.

I'm not usually a fan of hers but she fits well within this film.

Beats sitting At the airport.With that choice in hindsight, particularly because apparently in downtown Los Angeles a matinee costs $17.50 to see, I probably should've skipped it. I definitely won't watch it again.I can tolerate moderately sized plot holes in a film if the entertainment value is high enough. This flic doesn't quite cook the dinner in that respect. That said, the few scenes that were compelling were quite so, and came close to making a zero sum gain. The acting was excellent, which is of course hugely important, and the visuals are impeccable and riveting. That for me though just does not alone a good movie make. And certainly not for 18 damn dollars plus $16 for parking. The biggest problem with this movie is that they're trying to make a point....or are they? The science is so garbled, and the holes so gaping that one can't be sure this is symbolic or just a romp narrative.

Upon seeing a preview for Annihilation and seeing Alex Garland's name as the director, I did my best to stifle my excited curiosity. I remained as patient and self-disciplined as I could and didn't read about the plot, reviews, or release date. I did this because, based on my experience with Ex Machina, I knew going into the film as a blank slate, free of hype and preconceived notions would be the best way to experience the film (which, in my opinion is truly the best way to go into *any* movie). And I was right...I suggest anyone who has not seen the film try to do the same and just go see it.The film is modern sci-fi at its best. I would also call it a psychological thriller with some action/adventure/fantasy elements. About 2/3 of the way through seeing it for the first time, I snapped out of my dreamy, trance-like focus and realized how engaged I was, how enjoyable the experience had been so far, and how I was at a complete loss for how I might imagine the film would end. I almost want to say that the film is a slow burn, but that is really only because the end is so perfectly ridiculous and contains a completely unpredictable climax. The film is filled with different variations of tension builds and releases, but the end is truly where the film peaks; on both a visceral and cerebral level.I could go on and on about the themes and details captured within this movie, but I'll restrain myself. As I said, I believe it is best experienced free of preconception. It is all too rare that films (especially now-a-days) truly blur the line between entertainment and art, but this film totally pulls it off. It is certainly worth discussing, analyzing, and reading into the concepts it presents in such a graceful, yet powerful way (I have seen it 4 times in the past 3 days, and am now listening to the original novel on audio book!), but it is also genuinely entertaining. Experiencing the film was and continues to be an absolute joy.I am generally very cynical about most modern films, but Annihilation was satisfying in every way I could have hoped. I really don't understand the negative reviews I have read. I suppose they must have come from people who were perhaps expecting a straightforward action movie that doesn't leave room for interpretation. No, it is not an ""overly-brainy, intellectual mess that is too open-ended to grasp"" but if you are truly afraid that it might be, then you may be better off seeing Transformers 7, Fast and the Furious 12, or some other re-re-remake of some superhero movie.Go see this movie!!!",Annihilation

1457,matthijsv-esveld,An alternative to the set-up of the book.,8,14 March 2018,"So first things first, the book is one of the best books I've ever read, so it was hard to watch the trailer and read what Garland had to say without losing hope for this movie. Garland is a great film maker, but I still can't believe he's just made this adaption without even reading the second and third book. There are so many things he's changed. From the simple things like giving the characters names to the whole explanation of the Shimmer (which is called Area X in the book). 
In an interview stated he adapted the book like a dream. The Biologist (Lena) is supposed to be truly introvert. Actually, none of them should trust each other. Also she's supposed to know about Area X, know her husbands there (who's dead) and stay in Area X. 
Then, Garland cut of some of the best plot points in the book and then added some him self. For example, the tower. The women find a tunnel in the ground that contains a creature Lena calles ""the creeper,"" The creature writes living words on the walls. He added the bear and aligator, two things that bring me to my next point: crossed-breed species? I certainly cannot remember those. 
No, Annihilation was not supposed to be about exchanging DNA. Also, why are they so stupid? Ventress' idea of protecting camp was standing in the middle of a field without being able to see or warn the others. Why go on the water when you know there are aligators on steroids? Plus, she obviously wasn't a very good biologist because she didn't know a thing about containment, and her microscope was way to good for it's size. But... The ambiance Garland created was just the same as the book. Even though you know way more than you know in the book going in, it's a story that leaves you sleepless and thinking about what you've just seen/read. 
In the end of the origional story, The Biologist writes the doesn't have enough senses to know what she's experiencing. Her mind doesn't get it. That image is impossible to adapt to the big screen, so Garland did a great job by just adapting the feeling that comes with it. So in my opinion Garland created a film that makes the book better, but the book makes the film better too. They go along great if you see them as the same story in a different universe. The most important thing was to make the same ambiance the book has and he did that. If I would have written the script I just would've focussed more on the tower, less on that stupid DNA stuff and let the names out. 8/10",Annihilation

If you haven't read the books, do - they're far better than this.Apart from that, the idea that the culprit here is ""refracting"" DNA is a bit daft and, frankly, unnecessary; ""changing"" would have been enough.

This is quite an okay idea, cliche but needed to be more fleshed out I personally think.
-She just so conveniently happens to be a biologest who understands everything that happens to 
-When she gets to the army base outside the shimmer, she is confronted by only a psychologist, rather than probably what would be an array of people higher up than a psychologist who just seems to be able to do whatever.
-They just walk straight into the shimmer, with absolutely nothing protective despite every other thing that has gone in there has not come back, like not even a hazmat suit or gloves for christ sake. There's not even people around to see them off, they just walk in like ""yeah cool let's do it"" also her husband manages to escape from it and walk home, like these people are super incompetent at holding a perimeter
-The government don't seem to be controlling this MASSIVE perimeter very well, also it somehow hasn't been discovered by apparently everyone as it takes them 8 days to reach the center, so unless they walk incredibly slowly this thing is pretty massive.
-Lazy writing, tries to give the essence of mystery but just comes off as super lazy writing.
-Somehow when Sheppard gets eaten, the other 2 don't see the monster that just ate her at all, despite them being there about half a second after it occurred. This leads to 1 of the 2 who did not observe what happened to believe that the 2 that were there, were responsible. Also it looks so comical when it does get her, like we're talking sharknado level of bad.
-The idea that the shimmer takes genes off of everything and expands from that, seems pretty cool.",Annihilation
1463,emanuelbradeanu,cliche and pretentious,4,4 February 2020,"The movie started well, with a cool premise and a good lead character (it's Natalie...). The film is very atmospheric, and the story sucks you in.
Unfortunately, once the novelty wears off, you realize this is just another ""aliens come to earth"" movie. Yes it tries to be more original, yes it has some twists, but in the end, if you remove the bells and whistles, is just another aliens come to Earth. And there are dozens of movies like his - from War of the worlds and Independence day, to Close encounters to Invasion of the body snatchers.
From the more recent ones - Monsters (2010) and Arrival tucked a similar theme.So, Annihilation brings little new to the table, but that's ok, since the mystery of the shimmer still keeps you glued to the screen - that until the last 1/3 of the film, when the mystery is finally unraveled (kinda of). And then the movie falls flat (at least for me) - the climax is just...stupid. Really stupid. Yeah, there are lots of flying colors (literally) and suprarealistic images, but beyond that, just stupid.The worst part is that the movie tries to be pretentious - you know, smart and cerebral, using lots of colors and weird imagery. when in fact is not. Also, there's no character development besides the main lead, so we don't care much about them.In the end, the movies has some highs - good main lead, interesting premise, cool atmosphere. The story sucks you in. But once you get past the pretty imagery, the movie is thin, cliche, and the last part downright stupid. There are better options in the genre.",Annihilation

And decent quality helps (if it has Tara Reid in it, steer clear). I've watched a lot of sci-fi, new and old, good and bad, hi-tech and low budget. I was pretty pleased with this film in many regards. Even my fiancé really liked it, and sci-fi is not her favorite. Of course there are questions unanswered (all movies have them), but overall this hit many high notes. The score was spooky but not overpowering (think Blade Runner), the science in it was pretty well explained (remembering that alien science is different than ours), and it was graphic and gritty enough to have a visceral feel. The creatures and scenes were very well done, although I had hoped to see more of them, how they would have 'evolved'.

But the whole setup has some huge logical flaws that makes the first half or so very painful to watch.In particular, I find it very implausible how the scientists react to the shimmer. There is a strange phenomenon that is spreading over a radius of many kilometers and no person or drone ever sent in there returned. So what do you do? Do you send in another team with the mission to reach the center of the phenomenon or do you poke it with a stick first, and if that goes well you send in a dog on a long leash? Furthermore, if light can go through, why don't they just use laser to communicate with the outside? And why walking when there are streets? (There must be streets if there is a village and a former base, and I don't see why a car wouldn't work if guns and cameras work in there.) Or even better: takle a boat! If your goal is to reach a light-house, taking a boat is a much better option than walking through a swamp. It makes no sense at all. Furthermore, it is completely ridiculous that they waited for a whole year before sending the next team in! Imagine you are the commander and you sent in a team for a mission to investigate a life-threatening phenomenon that should take two weeks to complete at most. Why waiting for a hole year before sending in the next team?

I own most of the MCU films and enjoy them for what they are: noisy, colorful, character adventures consumed simply for the fun of watching. However, films like ""Arrival,"" ""Ex Machina,"" ""Annihilation,"" ""2001"" ask questions without the Hollywood Spoonfeed of late. I found the journey in ""Annihilation"" entertaining and thought provoking; not a perfect film, but worth the effort to just observe and participate with the characters. Their flaws, like mine, make us more interesting, human, and accessible. The unique special effects were blended with sets and seemed in service to the storyline, which was after all fictional. If Sci Fi fails to suspend or alter our expectations of daily logic, I will simply move on and forget it. Good stories, whether in print or film listed above, are remembered beyond methods or style of telling. I loved Portman in her pre-teen ""Leon"" role; but I enjoyed her performance here as a grown woman wondering what has happened to her life and the world around her. JJ Leigh, Isaacs and the supporting cast do service in telling their parts of the larger story. If one wants escape, Cap & MCU crew are standing by.

The creatures/animals were different than described, there was a lot more gore, there was no mention of ""a tower,"" and people did not die as written.I have to think of this movie as a separate story. It's not exactly ""Annihilation,"" but an adaption of Annihilation - which I guess is what the director was going for (after watching his explanation in interviews). I find this interesting since the director praised Vandermeer for his ""original ideas"" yet refused to bring them to life on screen without putting his spin on it first.I can't say if I necessarily liked the movie. I would have preferred to watch a film similar to the book, and this movie should have been called something else since it seems to exist on its own.I also do not understand why at the end of the movie the Biologist's ""duplicate"" was made to destroy the lighthouse and all of the alien vegetation. Does this mean there will be no second or third movie to coincide with the Southern Reach Trilogy? The only clue that there might be a continuation of the series is the revival of Kane and the image of both of them embracing while their irises shift color...signaling that they are both no longer human.What can I say?

The alien (not strong in athletic ability) is able to attach to organisms through contact, wants to learn the organism information on the earth, translates into its own (fragmentation, recoding), can cause the species of the earth to reproduce, and gene recombination, Telomerase activation, re-development. The aliens need energy. With the contact and absorption, the female squad captain is absorbed energy. The female lord and his husband are copied, but the nature is different. The female lord is replicated by the extraterrestrial organism, while the husband (Kay Well) No.The creatures inside are all mutated and contain a small part of the aliens.What came out was not Kane. It was a clone. The female owner was the noumenon. And the way of absorbing energy inside is changed, and it can absorb energy through contact. To clarify, it is not close to the lighthouse and the stronger the variation, but the longer the exposure time, the stronger the variation.To add, it is also a detailed logic problem of the film: the variation of organisms is divided according to types. Varied, differentiated, and replicated are mostly highlighted in one way, not in a hundred flowers.Aliens can burn and are organisms. No specific form, relatively low. So in essence it should be human beings that have a relatively strong ability to mutate. However, because the mutation is not clear what will happen in the future, whether the society, the environment, and the organism are disordered, it is still possible to make a sequel.For the film, philosophy and theory coexist and it is better for individuals to come.

And this movie, proves the reason why sci fi is just a lousy movie, trying so damn hard to pretend to be intellectual, or , what you can call- an opinionated piece of crap. This movie, is the complete opposite of a masterpiece. Do you know why? There is a huge irony surrounding this 2 hours long film which from the beginning till the end, they like to add in a lot of UNNECESSARILY long conversations, with almost all of them are progressed using whispering. Oh and, you can't even count how many times you have to watch those scenes where they remove their backpacks and guns from their shoulder. No joke man, they just love to do that. Oh and the conversations? Nah, it's just about their daughter and stuffs (and also conversations after they make love )and all those that i don't even remember because it's just too insignificant, -sorry I just don't wanna waste my memory space. Oh and, when you managed to watch till the end, there is an incredible surprise for you! which is another incredibly long 20 minutes of what the director thought of- ""a climax"" , that brings you into a whole new world! Yes, literally inside a damn hole and guess what they did in a mysterious hole? Yeap, they sat down, to erm ,well ,you know, talk more. Why? Oh well, you know , to make you fall asleep, and then, finally, you can spend another 5 minutes looking into a bright, golden light for like a few minutes and then you get to experience how to run away from the hole after that!!! Incredible isn't it? Oh my, its like, words can't explain how intriguing this sounds. Ridiculously amazing. Wait what? You asked is that it? Oh sorry to disappoint you, but, I guess that's it .. I think. Ohhhhh waittttt no! At the end, they wanna leave you a present!!! Yes, you guessed it, a PLOT TWIST!!!!!! Now, ready for it????? Hereeee weee goooo! The main actress, after coming out of the hole, back to the cubicle , is in fact, a mutated species now! She is now not a normal human being already! And the fact that his husband is an alien too! Sounds so cool right, omg I can't even wait to tell this story to my family and friends after I watched it. Seriously. Amazing. Oh you asking bout the middle of the story? Like what happened in the middle for like an hour long? Erm I think I just saw , grasses? And like shiny things, like flowers, and then some crocodile, ohhhhh cool thing is that the crocodile has shark teeth. Oh you ask why the shark-teeth-crocodile doesn't eat people? Because, let me tell you why, it is a backpack grabbing crocodile!! Coolies. Oh and, can't forget about the bear. It's the another important character in this movie. You know, it's really important, because other than these two monsters, there's literally nothing else. The bear, is like, erm. It can scream. Erm yes, it can literally scream using a female human voice. Erm, yeap that's it. So you may ask, how can this movie still be airing until 2hours long?! Impossible ! No, it is actually possible, because you still haven't count the enormous amount of time you waste listening to their chit chats, and watching them walking from a far far place, towards you, and that can take, erm let me count, 123456, 10 minutes. So yeah. Congrats if you can stay awake watching the whole movie. Come I clap for you. In a nutshell, please , stop making movies like these, including arrival. These two movies are just like, trying to prove that they have a deep deep meaning, making it so intellectually stimulating, to leave the viewers with whole bunch of questions (because that seems more professional), and trying so, damn, hard, to awe the viewers (they want you to scream omggggggg it gives me goosebumps and leave me thinking even after the movie!!) Yes, this movie portraits just how pathetic it is , instead of actually creating a masterpiece, I think it is, a piece of crap.",Annihilation

1514,aaron_stampler-84885,Another Classic Enters the Sci-Fi Pantheon,9,9 April 2018,"A shame that Alex Garland's 2nd feature film is released straight to Netflix in his native country, whilst enjoying theatrical releases abroad. 
This is an awesome film, that feels more audacious that it perhaps is. Whilst watching it conjures Aronofsky, Kubrick and Tarkovsky - even though it reveals too much for my tastes. 
Confidently shot, with both subtle and lavish FX and design. And a refreshingly noteworthy intimate scene that is truly progressive and representative of contemporary attitudes. 
What negative reviews seem to have missed with their umbrage at ostensibly illogical behaviours and strategies (giving a paramedic a gun, lookout post on the ground, etc) is that these characters are last resorts. The givernment have tried sending full military teams, presumably with all protective gear and differeribg strategies, but all have failed. And so this team is a half-baked last ditch attempt. The characters are all also yielding to the Shimmer, and open to the phenomenon, hence their less cautious behaviour than initial teams may have had. Plus, Portman's protagonist just saw her husbabd return in a spooky, almost ghost form, then puke up blood, then get whisked to a secret government place, then presented with a possible alien phenomenon. I think she can be forgiven for not bothering with gloves for her specimen sampling. They are all self destructing. Annihilation. These reviewers seem to be completely missing the point. 
There are some genuinely frightening and transcendental moments - today's stoners have their 2001 - and it lingers in the memory long after the credits.",Annihilation

1516,williamrushermanuel,Unique movie experience,9,11 June 2018,"OK, to address some of the comments made against this movie, comments that have good foundation for complaint. First off, yes, nobody is wearing hazmat gear. They could have made the teams investigating wear hazmat gear, but it wouldn't have changed the outcome because the disease caused by the Shimmer is transmissable by fields, no actual contact is required. The movie would then spend time explaining that hazmat suits were no help. So, we could have watched people wander about in hazmat gear, but they spared us. Next issue, typical scary movie stupidity. Yes, characters do stupid things that expose themselves to increased risk. Yes, there seems to be a lack of concern for the threat the Shimmer poses the entire biosphere, but if the government cared as much as we know they would, the movie would have had tens of thousands of people dealing with the Shimmer and the world would be in a state of apocalyptic fear, and the area where the Shimmer was located would probably be nuked and still the same thing would have resulted if the writers decided to make this an unwinnable battle.So, what is there to like among a field of characters who aren't likable? Why do characters need to be likable? How many people are likable after we know their dirty secrets? Each character has their own self destructive tendencies that exist to explain why these people are on a veritable suicide mission. Any lack of common sense can be explained by the Shimmer affecting the human brain. What this movie had was a very unique alien, and instead of the alien being a bad guy, its so far away from anthropormorphization that we don't even know if the alien has an agenda or if we could understand it if it did. It appears as if its an unhappy accident for life on Earth, like a force of nature rather than a boogeyman. I really like the bear scene where a human voice was eerily issued through the bear's throat. It was scary but also fascinating and it was unique. Sure there are other movies with animals that turned evil, but I got the feeling the bear was just behaving according to its randomly modified behaviors and the poor creature itself is destined to the same outcome as every other life form on Earth. I also liked how the protagonists weren't heroes of any sort. They had their motivations spurred on by increased risk taking due to personal problems in their lives, not because some case of super-patriotism. But that brought up the question to me, do motivations matter for those who stick their necks out to defend humanity? So, we got a sliver of the opinion that people tend to have periods of self destructive behavior that can cause harm or even death, rather than an overt case of altruism or suicide, but in the end if those people help, their personal reasons really aren't that important.The final scenes with the psychologist turning into an alien construct or being was amazing and unique. I don't know if the alien was dub stepping or that was just music, but it didn't matter to me. I found the combination of less than likable characters, yet not hate-able, along with a unique amoral force-of-nature alien and the lack of a good versus evil mentality all came together to provide me with more entertainment that I have had for a movie in a long time. I was relieved to not see a multitude of orange explosions and tough guys silohuetted walking away from or falling 300 feet off of a cliff, sly smile, landing on one knee in a tough guy hero pose within feet of a raging inferno. It was nice to see a sci-fi movie without a Stan Lee cameo.The only message the movie seem to send was that heroes may be flawed characters who have their own reasons for being heroic unlreated to altruism, and that a force of nature might end what we know as life on Earth without any intent whatsoever, that the most threatening things inimical to life might exist without moral judgment, even without what we think of as intelligence. Contrary to every super-hero movie, its not the evil people that will end life on Earth. It will be Mother Nature engaging in the cycles of destruction and creation that do us in, nothing personal. From the beginning of the movie, I could tell it was going to be a movie with an unhappy ending for humans, that life on Earth was going to be profoundly changed and there was going to be nothing we could do to prevent it. We typically see how the less intelligent humans find some clever way of saving the day in most movies, when realistically, if humankind faced the types of alien invasions faced in movies, we would be the ones going extinct because we just can't compete. It doesn't have to be an indictment, it can just...be.In some respects the movie parallels the general anxiety among those in the free world at the lurch towards fascism and the global threat of climate change, a feeling that no matter what we do, the tide of culture moves in ways that humans can't adequately predict much less control. And no matter how much we try to ascribe evil as the prime mover of this frightening lurch, its just Mother Nature evolving in ways we have little or no control over. We can fret and complain and wish it weren't so, but it is so, and maybe partly because of this movie, maybe instead of being depressed and anxious until the day civilization falls into Taliban-like corruption, extremism and oppression, we can find some beauty in the destruction and understand this is how the universe operates, without compunction or favor, good and evil are utterly irrelevant. This is a movie I watched three times nearly back to back, a very unusual situation for me as even some of my favorite movies I can only watch once. Other members of my family liked it pretty well, but not as much as I did. I find most sci-fi movies have hole filled plots and characters of horror movies always seem to do the stupidest things and suffer consequences we could all see coming a mile away. In that regard, Annihilation also shares some of those problems, but if you can get past the holes, you might enjoy the ride. I give Annihilation 9 stars because its not perfect, but it was immensely enjoyable to me. I did not inflate the value to offset the one star ratings. Its my genuine opinion and Annihilation will go down as one of my favorite sci-fi films. I am gladdened that the movie didn't have the run of the mill explosions and super hero poses and tough guy talk. The sex scenes were not frivolous nor gratuitous but they purposefully did feel awkward and unrewarding. I don't think that even if all the plot holes were filled and the characters didn't make dumb decisions, I don't think it would have changed how people feel about this movie, so don't let a few plot holes ruin this movie for you, or watch it with some trepidation and lowered expectations and you might be surprised. Its more about a feeling with this movie, a feeling that is hard to put a finger on, a feeling that for me tested my biases as a human being. I don't fault people who didn't like it, I just wasn't one of those people.",Annihilation
1517,olfrilly,"A shiny turd, is still a turd.",2,19 March 2018,"This movie is bad. I'll out right say it. It's really bad. Like I'd rather watch Attack of Clones and the Cat in the Hat bad. This movie has some stunning visuals....sometimes. The CGI is terribly inconsistent. Some of the plants and wildlife look pretty good, but the entirety of the sky and sun look bad. I know when inside the Shimmer some colors will be different but the lighting is very poor in this film.I will say this Natalie Portman's performance was great. And sadly it was the best part of the movie. Her performance is the only reason why this movie isn't a 1/10. The rest of the cast fails to do anything memorable. I don't believe it is the actors faults, they all seemed talented, I blame the lousey writing. The pacing is all over the place and it leaves you feeling not confused, but rather cheated. The violence in this movie is very over the top. I don't mind blood and guts, but it was like Doom or Duke Nukem style of violence, where it is overly ridiculous and nonsensical; it clashes heavily with the melodramatic and ""realistic"" tone of the rest of the movie. This film comes across as very arrogant and self important. As if it has some huge greater meaning. It doesn't. This movie was more mind numbing than Transformers: The last Knight, because at least I can laugh or enjoy myself while munching on some popcorn watching Transformers. This movie is really bad, skip over it. This movie is the pinnacle example of how big of a disconnect there is between critics and adept movie goers.",Annihilation
1518,lopeznathan,A decent sci-fi adventure with some notable flaws.,7,27 February 2018,"There are many reasons why I do like this film, and many reasons why I do not. Let's start first with the pros, and what I do appreciate about Garland's sophomore feature. I do appreciate it for being ambitious, and for approaching grandiose themes that are executed well for the most part. I also enjoyed how some of the SFX turned out, they worked very well in a few scenes (also very poorly, but we'll get into that eventually). I also do appreciate the film's slower pace, and how the climax was handled. It allows for the audience to ponder for a bit after the film, prompting many discussions. The score is not half-bad either, I enjoyed it for the most part.Now for the cons. First thing that comes to mind are the characters. The film boasts talented faces such as Portman, Isaac, and Thompson, but they all feel as if they are VERY underused. They just do a serviceable job for the most part, nothing outstanding or worth taking note of. Though compared to the others, Portman is the strongest. The dialogue also is written poorly. As I have said, some of the visuals played out great, and some played out pretty bad. Compare the scene with the glowing orb at the end and the alien, with both appeared excessively rendered and detailed, with the scene when Portman encounters those two mutated deer creatures. They appear cheaper looking and not rendered fully, the FX altogether are just very inconsistent. That is they key word for this whole film. It is very inconsistent in these places. The characters, and the effects.Overall I do believe this film is enjoyable. I did have fun for the most part while I was watching it. The film finds its stronger points in its musical score, themes and how they are executed, as well as the last half hour. After all of the other side characters get killed off, we are left alone with Portman as she explores the heart of the shimmer, which was the best point of the film in my opinion. I am anticipated for Garland's next debut, as he is a director who has peaked my interest both with this, and Ex Machina.",Annihilation

1524,owleyesresurrected,"Pretty in places, but rather weak",5,24 March 2018,"I really can't see that this deserves the high rating it has here and elsewhere.The story is that a meteorite or something has come down and hit a lighthouse somewhere. Then there is what they are calling the 'shimmer' surrounding it - some sort of boundary that looks like the sunlight shining on an oily film on moving water. This isn't impenetrable; people can walk in, but those who have done so have tended to not come back out. And the shimmer is moving outwards; the fear being that it is going to spread round the whole world.Lena is a biologist, played by Natalie Portman. Her husband was in one of the teams of soldiers sent in there and he is the only person to come back out, seemingly 'unofficially'. He ends up in some sort of medical facility with his organs failing. She volunteers to join the next group in. She is qualified for this because of the combination of now being a biology professor but previously having been a soldier.And right there I hit my first problem with this film. The problem being Portman looks as if she is showing the effects of a lifetime of hard dieting. She looks underweight and as if she always has been, looking particularly frail and narrow-shouldered when put into combat fatigues. I just couldn't buy her as an ex-soldier, even one who has been out of the army for a few years.Lena's fellow-members of her all-female team all turn out to have Problems. I won't list them - everyone will have seen them before in a thousand films and telly shows, especially soaps. So we know before it happens there is going to be trouble with them. And, lo and behold, Lena turns out to have some extra Problems too: with her marriage, so she's carrying a load of guilt. All of these assorted Problems are quite shallowly portrayed.The sci-fi elements of the story are sketchy and really don't make a lot of sense. They were clearly meant to be Meaningful, though, but what Meaning they were meant to be full with, I suspect the writing team (if there was one) never got round to thinking about.Some of the visual effects, though not wildly impressive, were a bit out of the usual, and colourful and striking; also, there were the makings of a good and original story there, if only someone had put in the work. So I've given it five points for those two. However, I've withheld five points for the widespread sketchiness, the hackneyed, soapy chunks of the script and the unconvincingness of the characters.

Without a doubt, Natalie Portman carries this film. Coming from Alex Garland ('Ex Machina', 2014), I knew this wasn't going to be some special effects/CGI shoot 'em up laden offering. If anything, I think it was very restrained in all of the possibilities that could have filled up more than the nearly 2 hour running time of this movie.'Annihilation' is centered around a astronomical event that sees an object that impacts the Earth and results in a inexplicable and dangerous environment named Area-X. As the story unfolds, a sparse group of main characters, that includes Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, and Tuva Novotny, is selected to follow previously failed expeditions into Area-X. Oscar Isaac stars as Portman's husband, who was part of the last previous team sent in. Early on in the story, he reappears unexpectedly and serves as motivation for Portman to consent to join this almost certainly doomed mission. While the film does focus on character development, it does manage to slip into some obvious stereotyping, but this didn't detract from the film too much.As things got rolling, I decided to intentionally not focus on things I would have deemed plot holes, choosing to let the story play out on it's own terms instead. There were so many additional areas this film could have covered or added for complexity, but as I noted, it manages to squeeze in just enough to avoid feeling bloated or indulgent.The story line jumps around a bit and initially generates confusion as to just where this story is going, but they all come together like an intricate weave as the finale is presented. At times the film seems to plod along, but the pacing is intentional and you need to stick with this to realize the benefit. I was thinking of several friends and relatives who may have a hard time not yelling out 'BORING' in a few places, but as I said early on, this isn't some flashy roller-coaster ride; it's more of a slow cerebral burn - which I could only summarize with one word - trippy!",Annihilation

PROS:Interesting concept, and has at least a good sense of mystery at the beginning. I like the general idea of a phenomenon causing rapid mutations / evolution in a contained area. Solid cast (if not entirely accurate, ahem). Although Gina Rodriguez was weirdly channeling Michelle Rodriguez for some reason. Still, it's Jane, so it's fine. There was a moment with a certain mutant bear that was genuinely creepy AF. Also, slithering intestines. CONS:The backstory of Lena (Portman) is slow and nuanced to the point of being boring. She and her husband (Isaac) don't really have strong enough chemistry in the beginning to make us care about their relationship and what happens to them -- or at least I didn't. The visual look of the ""Shimmer"" was not effectively alien to me. It just seemed like a soapy, rainbow-hued veneer, like something you would see in a music video. Portman's ragtag team were not interesting or developed (even as supporting characters), and there was very little interplay between them to provide a reason to care what happened to them. The ending, while visually interesting, was entirely unsatisfying and inexplicable. Then again, I'm not a fan of the pretentious ""so vague it's genius"" tactic that some high-minded movies aim for. But the alien mime-off was still kinda cool...",Annihilation
1545,avastrasza,Mediocre,5,19 March 2018,"Welp, here is my review, make of it what you want.First part is spoiler free!Annihilation was a movie I was looking forwards too. After seeing the trailer, I was pretty hyped. But sadly, the movie is nothing like what the trailer makes you expect. The movie is very slow paced, which does'nt have to be a bad thing of course, but it comes off as very artsy, so much it distracts. The trailer makes it appear like it's a sci-fi action/survivor horror like Aliens. It is a survivor horror, but very slow paced as mentioned before. I mention it's artsy. That's because it takes things from other movies. Stanley Kubrick mostly, I think. The out of order clips reminded me a lot of Arrival. The relaxing music against a uneasy atmosphere just made me laugh because it felt like the movie tried to hard to stand out that way. The extremely slow dialogue was annoying. And the way characters acted was laughably dumb. I don't mean the actresses themselves. Everyone does their best with the script given, but just things they do in the movie. More on that later. Visually the movie was mostly stunning. It suffers from the ""Let's shoot a lot of dark scenes."" gimmick to make it scary here and there, but a lot of it looked rather nice, although I do feel they could've gone much further with surreal sights. The ""horror"" bits were mostly creepy scenery and some gore bits. It was just to little to make it work. I will move on into spoilers after this, so if you liked the movie Arrival, if you like the older slow paced sci-fi movies with a lot of abstract tossed into it, go watch it. It's on Netflix. --- Spoilers ahead! ----I won't put a synopsis here, and mostly type about what I thought worked and what didn't. I'll talk about visual, atmosphere, characters and some other things. Quick story though:
You follow Lena who's milligary husband went in a mission 12 months earlyer but never came back. During that time she cheated on him. But feeling that her husband knows, she wont do it anymore. Then suddenly, her husband returns, gets sick and on the way to the hospital a squad of millia pick them up and puts them in a research centre. There Lena learns about the Shimmer, a wall of light that's slowly consuming the world. 3 years long the millitary sent drones, animals and people in, but nothing returned except Lena's husband. A group of 4 female scientists go in, and Lena volunteers to go in as well. They need to go to a lighthouse where the Shimmer started and find a way to stop it. During the trip the 4 scientists die, and Lena is the only survivor. VISUAL
As mentioned above, visually it was pretty nice. Even if lacking imagination. The Shimmer looked very alien and the couple of surreal things they showed was fun. In the Shimmer, dna cells have combined with other dna cells. Like the dna of a alligator combined with a shark. Or the dna of plants with that of humans. You see some strange animals (yes, some. 3. Just ... 3. And a bird, but that was normal.) Plants in the shape of humans and a human corpse on its way to become one with a building. The latter reminded me a lot of The Thing. It looked cool though. A bear who roars and screams like one of its victims was also pretty cool. But you could have done so much more with this! ATMOSPHERE
It was .. pretty lame. Even though it had nice looking visuals, the overal vibe lacked creepy alien atmosphere. The characters were underwhelmed so you are as well as a viewer. The music was good at times, but a relaxing guitar riff just took me out of it. It didn't fit at all and it felt pretenteous. It didn't grasp me. CHARACTERS
I'm sorry, but the main characters are dumb. So dumb. 5 woman go into an alien territory, only a few with combat training. They all have some sort of issues. One is sick, one lost a daughter, one was suicidal.. There is a scene at night where they have a watch tower, but the leader of the group is on the ground outside, away from the tower, in a tent with the lights on, reading. In an area with unknown dangerous, aggressive animals. They had already encountered a giant slligator with shark teeth. Oh, on that, after they find that alligator, they get on 3 small rafts and travel over water! Back to the night scene, sure. They had a fence around the area, but a big, burly bear knows how to silently cut through a fence, and when our main characters know there is something there, what do they do? Keep the small light on, use s night-visor near said light and just stand around! It was so dumb. Oh, they find a vid where some soldiers went a little nuts, cut open another soldier to show that his guts are moving like a coiling snake. It's really obviously doing do. What does one of our heroes say? ""Must be a trick if light."" *Sigh* They all die in a stupid way. One gets killed by the bear (The most interesting char in my opinion, died first.) Then one goes nuts, ties everyone up, thinks she hears the woman that died first and is attacked by the bear! The bear growled the womans voice as their cells were mixed. Then one just.. dissapears. (I think she walked off the set and went home.) One turns to light and into a .. floating something. And then there's the end. You can make a dozen theories about it. And that is fun mostly. What happened? Is she an alien? Did fire destroy the shimmer? It does'nt really gives answers. I think the movie was mediocre. The idea was good, but could have been worked out so much better. The flashbacks were dumb. It didn't add much. It should have been focussing more on the Shimmer and the weirdness inside, not the side story about the cheating. It felt more like a Star Trek episode. So yeah, that's my opinion. Can you use it? I dunno. Do you agree? Cool. Have a good one.",Annihilation
1546,probiermich,3/10 for the Visuals. Otherwise blatant political propaganda.,3,15 March 2018,"Visuals: Pretty awesome, although if I only want to see ""pretty"" stuff I would go to a museum...
Story = flat
Acting = Except N. Portman really bad! B-grade TV-show bad!
Character Development = almost non-existentAll-female, mult-icultural and multi-ethnical lead-actors = Check!
White girl + black man sex scene = Check!
Political propaganda ruining yet another great opportunity = Check!So here is the thing: 
I just had to make an account here to review this since I really liked the book and it is yet another movie that could've been great but was ruined by straight up political propaganda.
Coming from a time where I watched shows like ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" without even thinking about stuff like Black & White and gender or rubbish like that, the last few years have really been hard on me. Not because I am offended by a white girl having a black boyfriend, or an all-female lead, but because of the niveau the political messages in modern movies are brought to you.
I have nothing against complex stories with a political morale, I still am amazed of Schindler's List, The Pianist, which of course have a political message, but a well executed one. The original Alien movies are some of my favorite Sci-Fi/Horror movies ever made and had a badass female lead way before media even talked about ""gender""...Because of the constant non-sense I could not finish watching Star Wars VIII. Ghostbusters was destroyed, not because of an all-female lead, but because that was the main focus of the producers, and maybe only the third or fourth place was actual story-telling and making a good movie.
Most of the new movies Hollywood produced the last 5 to 10 years were like this: political agenda first, making a good movie second. And people really wonder why movie sales and ratings go down like never before?Anyway... I am really disappointed, that I had to write a review like this, that I now am thinking in terms of gender and race, that I now can't watch a new movie anymore just to enjoy the story.Producers, Scriptwriters, Actors: Please stop thinking people are as stupid as you obviously believe they are and try to make great movies again first and fill them with meaning and messages second. Might even go pay for cinema tickets again then.",Annihilation
1547,alexandersdragons,More than what I expected,8,27 May 2018,"Actually went into this movie not really knowing what to expect but I really liked a lot of things about it. 
First off I must talk about the visuals. I saw a bunch of people complaining that its standard CGI, well obviously it was going to be CGI but the creativity and beauty of it was beyond this world. The nature, the animals, the colors, everything was extremely beautiful and well designed, even the not so appealing parts were really well done.
I should also talk about the soundtrack. Again, in response to people saying that its a forgettable soundtrack, not all scores should just be a medley of a bunch of big name artists' songs. The music was very powerful and fit the scenes quite well, especially in the end the music was so loud and booming and perfectly captured the energy of the scene. 
Regarding the characters, i would've liked to see more regarding who they were and not just one-liner backstories. 
Also the sex scenes were a bit pointless and didn't REALLY add much to the main character, nor did they somehow affect her actions later on. 
But overall an extremely cinematic experience and guaranteed eye and ear candy.",Annihilation

I loved the book and i was hoping for a stunnig movie from the directer of the Ex-machina (one of my favoriete movie from 2014). What i get is one visual good movie but with the content of one pseudo-intellectual bullshit movie. That ending was a mess. 
For the people who didn't read the book (which was completely set aside by Alex Garland), you don't have any idea of a great movie you could have had. The character of the biologist is so great in the book, but in the movie it was a fucking cliche of a character. All the structure of the book, and the misteries of the area X are but better that in the movie. 
I know my opinion is greatly influnced by my apreciacion of the book, but, i assure you, that if most people had read the book the score of this movie was way lower.

It is flawed because it is ultimately lacks, at times, the authority, credibility and conviction that makes a movie great. It is unfortunately weak in parts (rather than tell you where, watch it and make you own judgements) and to be honest, I have a love/hate relationship with Natalie Portman. Beautiful yes but I struggle with her acting. On the flip side, the final scene in the 'shimmer' is extra-ordinary and groundbreaking.

1555,shellywight-70522,Dumbest movie I have seen in a long time,1,15 January 2019,"I have never reviewed a movie in my life, but this was so painfully boring and poorly written that I feel compelled to get involved on this one.
No need to go on about the sizeable amount of plot holes and implausibilities in this movie as many of the previous reviews have already addressed those issues.
My main problem with it is the complete and utter disappointment I felt throughout my time viewing it and especially at the end.
I watched the trailer and it looked amazing!! I am a huge movie fan of all genres but my main loves are horror and science fiction. So when I saw this, I thought it would be a perfect marriage of my 2 passions. Coupled with having Oscar Isaac...who I love...and other big names like Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh lend their talents to it, I figured you couldn't go wrong. I was COMPLETELY mistaken!!
There is so little character development in this film that I found myself not caring about a single one. Sure, they try to inject some emotion with Portman's grieving of her husband. But then render it mute with totally unnecessary flashbacks of the worst choreographed love scenes ever in a movie and a useless affair with a co-worker that is never explored or explained. It neither advances or adds a single thing to the characters or the plot. Once the action actually starts to kick in, I found myself not caring at all if anyone got picked off. I felt absolutely no tension, no fear, no emotion at all. I was just trying to wrap my head around the ""science"" and wondering why these people were making one ridiculous decision after another! Nothing of any substance was present to draw me in and make me forget about the abundance of crap in this script!
And the end is so absurd, I could not even believe I had just wasted so much time of my life that I would never get back! Not only in what was going on on the screen, but in the fact that there was still no explanation of anything and I was just left with more questions and feeling completely un-entertained.
Not the worst movie I have ever seen, but one of the most boring and definitely the most disappointing. If you are going in expecting a horror film, don't waste your time. It is NOT! If you are going in for the sci-fi, I still wouldn't, but you may find some aspects you like.",Annihilation
1556,nickkubat,The Best Film of 2018,10,31 July 2019,"As of writing this, I've seen over 50 films from 2018. While a lot of them were great, Annihilation was the best one I've seen. It was terribly overlooked and became one of my favorite films almost instantly. It was a larger budget Sci-Fi movie that had things to say, but still let the audience come to their own conclusions.Alex Garland is one of the best Sci-Fi writers of the 21st century, having written great films like 28 Days Later, Sunshine, and Never Let Me Go and his directorial debut, Ex Machina is one of the leaders in the new era of high concept Sci-Fi.I'll start with the acting. Natalie Portman has her best performance since Black Swan here, with a lot of alone time on screen. While a lot of people have a problem with Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance, I think it made sense in the context of the film. The rest of the supporting cast was great, particularly Tessa Thompson and Gina Rodriguez.The technical aspects here were amazing. The special effects, especially the scene where Oscar Issac cuts that dude open is great as well as the effect of Lena's clone. The mix of CGI and set designs were interesting and cool and the score was phenomenal, especially during the climax of the movie.Finally I have to phrase the general atmosphere and themes of the movie. A sense of dread starts almost immediately here, and really intensifies as it goes. The bear scene is deservingly being praised as one of the most stress inducing scenes in a long time but watching everything that takes place in the lighthouse is also mesmerizing. With that amazing score blaring it's impossible to turn away from the stunning sight on the screen.There are a lot of themes that are discussed in this movie, from the subjects of cancer, genetic change, starting over, paranoia, and the one I mostly take away from it, moving on from your past. Anyone who watches this film will come away with a new or different understand of what the film is trying to say.This movie isn't perfect. Others have mentioned little plot holes which can be explained as them going crazy in the shimmer and Sheppard's death is ruined since your told she is dead 5 minutes into the movie (on it's own not bad but the fact that her fate is a mystery for a small portion of the movie, there was a lot of tension taken out of it.) But it's not hard to overlook the few flaws this film has and see it as a great, original, interesting Sci-Fi movie that I think will go down as a cult classic, and is the best movie of 2018 IMO.",Annihilation

It's so rich that you will want to do some reading after you watch it in order to understand what was experienced by the characters, or how certain aspects could exist in reality. The climax, in my opinion, was one of the best. It's sooo good that it might appear odd to younger viewers, or viewers who want super hero type falling action. There's a lot of 2001 and 2010: A Space Odyssey, and John Carpenter. There's the ambiguous nature of the entire film, and most likely a bunch of stuff I haven't even considered yet...there are some cool Phillip K. Dick shows that touch upon the film's themes...The script for this is soo good...i don't believe there is one wasted word from beginning to end in this film.

Not helped by some cheesy dialogue and long drawn out scenes that don't go anywhere.The film also suffers from poor pacing and a confused tone. I like genre blending and films that take chances, but that always comes with a risk that things never quite hang together and you're ultimately left with an uneven experience.Overall, if you're into sci-fi, have a Netflix account, and an evening to spare, Annihilation is worth a stab.

1583,vickamikka,For those who are too lazy or just closed minded to actually dig deeper into the symbolism behind every scene of the movie. It is actually very intelligent.,10,5 April 2020,"A very atypical sci-fi movie that seems to be very bizarre if you don't dig deep enough. I was shocked to read so many bad reviews on this movie on IMDb with the lowest rating. It is so underrated since it has so much to say. Obviously these people are not interested to open their minds a bit wider and to at least try to discover if there is something more meaningful and intelligent behind the special effects, ""not logical actions"", and the weirdness of everything. It's a ""difficult "" sci-fi that requires some brain work which is quite rare for the genre.
The movie is visually and conceptually outstanding, even tho the concept part is way less obvious. It kind of reminds of the movie ""Mother!"" By Aronofsky in a way that so many people didn't read between the lines to understand the philosophy behind the whole plot so the movie ended up with a bad rating even tho it's literally genius in my opinion.
The key to the concept is in the name of the movie itself. Annihilation means destruction and literally every single thing happening in the shimmer is self-destructive including the members of the expedition, where you can find drug abuse, self harm, cheating on a husband and etc in their past. In other words the whole movie is a metaphor for cancer - it comes from mutation of the cells and it's self-destructive. The shimmer itself is cancer and everyone who entered the shimmer has its own ways of fighting with it like people do in real life. That's why all the members have different faiths. To start with, the main character Lena is a cancer pathology expert, the leader of the mission Dr Ventress is dying of cancer and the linguist Cass had a daughter who died of blood cancer. The meteor striking the lighthouse is an unexplainable phenomenon same as when cancer strikes a human. Cancer spreads exactly in a way like the shimmer is expanding. Every single memeber of the group relates to the shimmer just like all humans can relate to the disease. Some want to fight it like Lena, who doesn't give up and is the only one who survives at the end, some want to understand it like the doctor, some just accept it and let it go like Josie, some fear it like Anya and for some it strikes suddenly like for Cass. The fact that the monster bear could scream in a voice of its last victim is a metaphor for those who suffered so much while fighting cancer that the last thing that is left for their relatives is this painful scream for help.
When Lena gets to the lighthouse - the heart of the shimmer, we are hoping to find answers there but, unfortunately, we still don't have them. What we see is this alien figure that is also Lena at the same time. The phosphor grenade symbolizes chemotherapy. And finally, we are puzzled at the end by the question who are the survivors? Are they the original selves or are they the doubles from the shimmer? Well, actually that doesn't matter anymore since anyone who survived the horrors of cancer are not the same people as we always knew them.",Annihilation

1610,pterodactyle,Initiitaion into Shamanhood (or psychological breakthrough),10,4 April 2018,"This is the third review I write on IMDb (and I have written a lot more reviews on a Russian forum, after receiving more and more impressions. It's a result of a long mind journey through a labyrinth of impressions, endless metaphors and different meanings, all true, yet hiding the real meaning through their incompleteness. Having read almost all reviews on IMDb, I believe that I'm the only guy who understood the true substance of this film and also, why there are that many versions of meaning and such a high number of truely alienated and disgusted people. It's possible that even Garland and the film crew not understand the meaning like I have and have never intended it this way (as sometimes something, which has the deepest meaning for us and completely transforms us, was never intended this way). But for me they are possible the best shamans of the Western word (if not the whole world. At least the only ones who ""got"" to me) and the film is an embodiment of a shamanic ritual or an ultimate seance of psycholytic psychotherapy.
First I thought that the film is the best ""psychedelic film"" made (meaning, the film best depicting a psychedelic experience). Then, after reading the negative reviews and analyzing my impressions, i thought that the film was a real audio-visual psychedelic drug, not only having caused a never-ending flashback of all the strange dreams, all the stuff I ever took, all the stuff I wanted to take at least once in my life and all the stuff I was afraid of ever taking, but also having warped my logic and sense of normality all the time, like in a ""normal"" dream (without any critical thinking), turning into a lucid dream (some critical thinking, but adhering to a ""twisted"" logic), a psychedelic trip (different type of ""twisted"" logic) and dissociated state, constantly morphing in-between those states making the film appearing as one of the most logical movies ever made, because I experienced this types of logic before, while people without those experiences have thought that it's the most stupid, illogical movie ever made. So, at the same time an audio-visual ""drug"" and ""illustrated"" description of different altered states of consciousness, consciousness and psychology being the main themes of the film
Then, not yet completely satisfied with my conclusions and irritated by it, feeling that there was more to it, I watched the movie again during daytime. This time I had no flashbacks and wasn't that impressed by the visual side again, but, remembering what others made out to be logic flaws, the logic still seemed coherent by me. The day after that I felt like I have to describe my unhappy drug career to others, like sort of a warning and means to understand it better myself, at the same time.
And today I was able to piece all impressions and perceived meanings together. Or actually, they ""fell"" together by themselves.
As I already said, this film is a shamanic ritual, like the ones existing with Ayahuasca and Iboga. People, who aren't ready and fear the strange, experience fear, disgust and alienation by the perceived ""raping"" of their consciousness. People, who like strange feeling, are getting lost in the beauty of caleidoscopic visuals or full-fledged visions, music played by the shaman or, if they understand the language, interesting stories with twisted logic, which may be told ""like that"" or in song, thinking that those beatiful impressions are everything that there is to experience. Other get deep philosophic insights about the world, people in general and themselves and also get lost in-between the metaphors...
I, however, realized today that I underwent a shamanic initiation - from ""deeply hurt"" patient becoming a doctor, beginning the process of healing myself by accepting the sickness and and understanding myself and it as fully, as humanly possible. I understood my sickness intellectually long before that, but only now was able to begin to accept and heal it. I'm the ""chosen one"" to understand it all, not because I'm the smartest, most intuitively gifted or insightful person, but because I fell that low with my addiction and sickness, that I was ready and in desperate need to accept this beatiful gift.
Don't get me wrong - I don't think that I've become an ""all-powerful"" awesome shaman, being able to heal others, understanding the sense of all being, etc. No, I ""broke though"" and was put on the beginning of the journey to mental health and understanding myself, which I longed for all my life, which was the reason of my beginning of taking drugs.
10 years ago I was on a ""real"" Ayahuasca ritual in the Netherlands. I feared of taking too much, had only light ""cheap"" visuals and a feeling of enchantment, but overall I was disappointed. Soon after the ritual I got into a downward spiral of mental sickness and addiction. Now I wonder if the shaman on that ritual could, feeling that I want and need the transformation, have sent me on a long way of self-destruction and annihilation - symbolically being forcefully ""taken apart"", only to later get the parts ""washed and reassembled"" by another shaman - Garland - as the Amazonian shamans describe the initiation.
I don't expect many people to understand, what I said, and believe, that most will get the impression, I got completely crazy by taking too much drugs or taking shamanic folklore too seriously, but for me, this movie produced the most intense religious, transformational experience I ever had. Now I should me mindful not to get lost again trough the feelings of grandeur or something like that.P.S. I though a little more about it now and now think that I formulated everything too weird. I want to leave it as is, but add a more simple and precise explanation from a psychological perspective.
After watching the film, I realized that something probably most important in my life just happened and I got a very important insight about myself on an intuitive level. I already knew it, but to understand it on the intellectual level, I knew, I had to explain the film to others and, in the process, to myself. It took me a week of writing endless versions of reviews, explaining the same idea in different words and sometimes contradicting myself in seemingly minor detail, and reading almost all available reviews written by others (which, as I felt, was necessary to understand it). The more I wrote and read, the more I felt that somehow all different versions of meanings I described and all meanings described by others (that were meant without trolling) were 100% right and at the same time misleading by their incompleteness. I knew that everyone was right and there could be no wrong interpretation, but that at the same time I was probably the only one who grasped the only possible true meaning of the film. And that I never could transfer the paradoxical understanding of what I experienced in all its completeness and felt about the experiences by others, but that it could be described very easily as a metaphor or an allegory, which everyone, even a child could understand. This is what I so poorly managed today (before this P.S.) and what I have to explain in it.
Today I understand that what I experienced was a very deep mystical experience, lasting the whole week and in trying and succeeding to transform my intuitive knowledge into intellectual understanding (words), I realized that the essence of that mystical experience was contrariwise transforming my long-had intellectual knowledge of being a drug addict and a mentally ill person into deep intuitive understanding, or, simply said, accepting it. And as everyone knows, acceptance is the first step to healing. This is why I described what I had experience as a shamanic initiation - becoming your own healer through an insight. A ""sober"" psychiatrist will call it a breakthrough.
I always had problems connecting and communicating between the level of intuitive knowledge and the level of intellectual ideas. I only had either feelings or thoughts. And this may sound as a banality, but when I finally managed to build a connection between those two domains - I experienced a profound mystical transformational journey.
Before I made the connection, I thought that every little detail in the film was important and intended and that Garland and his crew are genius psychologists. Now I'm not sure it's true and think that it's not really important. I felt the need to find out Garland's e-mail address and ask him many questions, but now I don't really care about his intentions or vision. Every detail of my experience was important to me and my insights are the only possible - for me. But let me repeat - the only possible explanation for the plethora of meanings and impressions, almost never repeating, are the proof that Garland is a true shaman - it doesn't matter if he realizes it or not.",Annihilation
1611,CristianUrrutia,Mismatch of Predator and Stalker,5,23 March 2018,"A group of scientists barely doing any science, walk for days into a bio-hazardous zone without any protection gear. They look at really weird stuff and people being killed by monsters, and instead of freaking out and run away they continue with their mission without any of us knowing what their motivation is. They watch some exposition tapes and talk about the what, why and how without any excitement and finally, when the two ones left reaches their destination, one dies and becomes a flying LSD donut while the other one fights the donut-turn-copycat of herself and at the end one of them (not sure if LSD-donut-copycat or the real one) kill the other one and returns home. The twilight zone burn to ashes but apparently the LSD-donut-copycat was the one that made it back home and it's gonna mate with the other LSD-donut-copycat of her husband. Now here is the issue. If the ""husband"" made it home why couldn't the life form infect the wife and multiply? Why did she needs to go to the lighthouse to get infected? Also if the life-form wants to multiply (as all life-forms usually do) why didn't it just send everyone back and continue the expansion?

As long as the story holds together, I am generally willing to ignore detail mistakes and the occasional faux pax that others have mentioned...leaving the relative safety of a tower, a bright light that would seriously reduce the effectiveness of night-vision goggles, etc. However, the scenes inside the lighthouse culminating in the final transformation of the lead psychologist and the alien's destruction by fire left me groaning and unsatisfied. The open-mouth spewing of the alien's ""essence"" to the ceiling reminded me of the climax to ""The Fifth Element"". It all seemed abit too surreal and an excuse for the director to dazzle the audience with CGI in an attempt to convey some deep artistic message. Grand effects, the music crescendos up, the creature walks back into the cave ablaze, all is destroyed, and that's it.

The film does leave a lot unanswered, which is why I think some people disliked it.As any good thriller film should go, everything is a mystery from the beginning, this elusive plot can either make or break your love for the film, all I'll say is go with it and don't try and pick holes in everything you see. The underlying tone of the film, in my opinion, is that there are things out there beyond our comprehension and comparing them to things we know on earth is illogical. The suspense never dissipates, and you're constantly craving to find out what will happen next, all the while slightly frightened at the prospect. 
Natalie Portman plays a brilliantly conflicted biologist who's main reason for joining the mission is to understand what happened to her husband in the same mission, but what she finds is unexpected. Having to depict a range of emotions, mainly confusion and sadness in a bewildering environment shows the steps people go through, trying to rationalise that which is impossible.

1627,kareeka,Alex Garland is on drugs for sure,4,18 March 2018,"Things I didn't like in the movie:
1. It was veeery slow! The second half of the movie was the longest hour I lived, you could literally set the speed to 2x and that way it would be a better movie.
2. Lack of logic. The characters are making bad decisions, 5 women goes in a warzone without hightech military stuff, the army, or any vehicle at all; they go in without a doctor or any medical help, and so on...
3. Characters are boring. We don't know anything about any of the characters - except Natalie Portman's. We don't know why do they do what they do, and apart from one line we don't know their backstory. We can't connect with them or can't feel sorry for them when they die.
4. Nonsense ending. I literally have no idea what happened at the end, why does it happened and how. It was like the writer was on drugs and made a colorful, beautiful nonsense.
5. Details. Like, they find a dead body with the same tattoo (an 8 or an infinite) as Natalie Portman has on her arm at the end of the movie. She doesn't have it at the beginning, and we that remains as an unanswered question after the ending as well.
6. Story. Basically it is a 2 hour long movie but the story can be told in 3 sentences. There are no twists, surprises or new discoveries through the film, only more and more unanswered questions.",Annihilation

1631,thom-beckett-831-687680,A breathtaking and intelligent horror-tinged sci-fi masterpiece,10,24 March 2018,"Annihilation is the latest film from Alex Garland, the director of Ex Machina, as well as the author of The Beach and Sunshine. The plot centres around a group entering into an area that's been affected by a phenomenon known as 'The Shimmer', which appears to have come from space. The party are a group of flawed individuals, including and eventually led by Lena (Portman) whose husband, Kane (Isaac) took part in a similar mission a year earlier. The film is visually stunning, and regularly skirts the territory of seeming like a dream, or a hallucination. The Shimmer is confusing, time is altered, memories go missing. As such, it also often descends into being a bad trip, or a nightmare. Portman is excellent and the supporting cast help hold together a compelling and often disturbing film, where little is explained and the audience are allowed to decide for themselves what is going on. With this respect for the audience, this Apocalypse Now like journey into madness can be read a number of different ways. Perhaps The Shimmer bears a similarity to cancer and an abundance of life killing its host, which is mentioned at multiple points in the film? Perhaps it's an analogy for the destructive effect that human beings have on the natural world? Perhaps it's metaphor for the western opioid epidemic and how flawed people self-destruct (something that affects everyone one, as noted by Leigh's psychologist character, Dr Ventress? Perhaps it's a reference to the Buddhist notion of the interconnectedness of all things? It can be any and all of these things, such is the trust that Garland places in his audience.Overall, it's a fascinating film, often beautiful, but with brutal violence and body shock imagery. The excellent soundtrack, leads from folky acoustic guitars into dark techno as the film descends into darkness. The cast are particularly great and hold together an often confusing story with a strong emotional centre. The fact that Netflix is giving such odd films an opportunity to shine outweighs the minor annoyance that a film like this would have been great to see in the cinema. It's well worth watching such an experimental and odd piece of art.",Annihilation

The movie begins with interesting premise, and up to the end, it gradually devolves into a non-senical intellectual-wannabe-movie, for example, why are all the team members female? Not that I have a general problem with that, but from the military point of view, some heterogenuous crew with much better equipment would be needed. No hamzat suits, no second-hand weapons, ... and we are talking about (maybe) the End of the world. What is the purpose of this invasion? The serpent icon on forearms? Why the main ET is trying to dopplerbang itself? Lot of questions, but not enough answers. On the otherside, movie does give some interesting thoughts about annihalation of previous selves to evolve in something new. Also, the visuals are quite OK and lead role performed well.

1652,dahlberg31,It's not trying to be anything,8,11 October 2019,"I don't usually do movie reviews, but I watch Ralph Sepie, so I'm an expert now. I'll go for as spoil free as I can though hints might accidentally be passed thru.From the production standpoint, I think they wanted a movie half-realism, half-Avatar. It probably looked incredible in a iMax/3D theater. You don't get that full experience unless you have a proper theater set up.From the acting standpoint, everyone worked around Natalie Portman. She was the centerpiece. The actors around her have proved themselves in other projects so I think they were good. Oscar Isaac is simply one of the best talents and it's really good he was in it. If not, the movie may have suffered quite a bit. Portman did great with having to deal with both facial acting and funny body movements.I was afraid 1/3 of the way thru this may end up like Contact. It didn't. The source material was better, the pacing, Portman is better than Foster, etc...I've seen some reviewers wanted this to be Aliens or The Terminator for some reason. Have guns a blazing! That's not this film (though there is action).The best part of the film: the suspense. By leaving the audience uneasy about not knowing what's going on plays into what the director wanted. This can be construed as ""pretentious."" I try avoiding that label for the truly pretentious. I'm looking at you Requiem for a Dream. The uneasiness of the film was similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Obviously this wasn't directed by Kubrick, but definitely Kurbrick inspired.The worst part: the dialogues. Many lines didn't feel natural to what a normal person would say. Sometimes less is more. They could have learned from The Larry Sanders Show of minimalism. If dialogue can be replaced with body language, then omit the lines.The themes of the movie is why you have the love it or hate it phenomenon. I think the director wanted a 2001 feel, so the themes are murky. I don't think the film was trying to be known as the thought provoking movie of the year. But it could have done better. The first lines of the movie was explaining how abiogenesis is one of the big unknowns. If pondering abiogenesis and possibly natural selection is thought provoking, then this film might be for you. Outside of that, possibe themes of destroying things humans don't understand, the purpose of life of either fighting/fear/acceptance, and questioning what it means to be sentient are present. How much in depth is up to the viewer.In summation: Annihilation is an ambitious film. It has a star studded cast and amazing visuals. The film wasn't trying to be inventing the wheel, but it far from being a hack job. For those wanting a non military SciFi film, then give this a chance. Sometimes, a movie isn't trying to be something more than a movie.",Annihilation
1653,zgoings621,This is NOT a Sci-fi action movie!!!,8,5 August 2020,"I saw this movie in theaters when it first came out. My ex and I left the theater scratching our heads wondering what the hell we had just watched. The marketing had led me to believe I was going to see a sci-fi/fantasy action movie. It is...not that. To say the least, at the time I was miffed that I'd paid to see a confusing and convoluted film that was more of a horror movie than anything, and I LOVE horror movies. But it wasn't clicking for me yet.Yesterday I was watching videos on YouTube reviewing the best cosmic horror films and this movie kept coming up on the lists, always ranking near the top. So I rewatched it today and lo and behold, when viewing this as a cosmic horror film it is fantastic. I find Natalie Portman to be a fairly wooden actress at best, but she's not a bad actress. So her less than stellar performance is completely forgivable. If you're not into cosmic horror then you probably won't enjoy this film.

1666,dragra-245-260569,How to annihilate 2 hours of your life,1,9 April 2018,"Natalie Portman is good at delivering the troubled widow at the beginning. Much less convincing later on when the story reveals her past military career. It's impossible to imagine a person like her in the military, not even in a Sci-Fi movie! She volunteers on a suicide mission but her motives are not clear, probably she want's to know what happened to her husband? But maybe it is guilt, because she betrayed him? We don't know what drives her and this makes it difficult to connect or identify with her. Other characters are even weaker except Jennifer Jason Leigh, she is the only one who seems to know what she is doing.The story itself is weak with minimal development and engagement. Would you send a group of female students with a psychologist as a leader to investigate the supernatural/alien/all-life-on-eart-altering-phenomenon? Not that being females is the problem, after all the male missions have failed, but none of them is able to understand the weight of the task. It looks like they are going for a picnic in a exotic resort, hilarious to see the M4A1 rifle being carried like a lady bag (by the handle). Most of the movie is a walk in the artificial (studio) park with occasional quarreling and psychotic episodes between the girls. The story does not evolve but stumbles until right before the end.The final scene lacks dialogue and is just visual, this is why some viewers have seen parallels with the closing scene of Kubrick's 2001. While Kubrick's finale elevates the story (and creates an open end) this one just does nothing of that. We see some entity (or more of them) but do not know what they want. There is some trivial explanation from Lena (Portman) itself, that the entity tried to create something new. Oh really? Wow. The closing scene then shows a very predictable hint to a possible sequel. No elevation here just a cheap cliche. After seeing this I understand why some people hate & avoid Sci-Fi movies.",Annihilation

Life is a cycle. Something old needs to die in order for something new to arise. Is this ""new"" something good or bad? It does not matter as it is up to us to decide on that.The tattoo is one of a Jörmungandr or of a Ouroboros which perfectly reflects this idea. It's a circle that ends but by ending itself, it is also starting something new.There are times in which we cannot become new selves unless we kill a part of us. As seen in the movie, some of the characters are not able to do this or don't even want to as they identify themselves with their misery.

Through conversation we learn that they had already sent Military,Non-Military,Scientists.Drones etc. By land,sea and air! The Dr.(Psychologist) even questions the very nature of it. Is it spiritual,alien?
 What I personally enjoyed about this was that we're talking about an infinite universe,with us humans understanding less than .01% of it...at best! Why is it people think we're so advanced that we will never encounter something we don't understand at all? That's what makes this movie interesting! Is it here to take over? Was it sent,as a sort of ""Terra-forming"" device? Is it even a life form at all?
 A great concept,good directing,good acting,enough budget and imagination to make it look really interesting, Even a good soundtrack. If you liked ""The Arrival"" you'll likely enjoy this,If you didn't,I'd suggest looking elsewhere.",Annihilation

Yeah, the ending was WTF on the surface. If you only watch movies for face-value, then this film probably isn't for you. I found this film to be enjoyably thought-provoking and unique; I was fully entertained the entire time. The visuals and scenes were fascinating spectacles which was one of my favorite parts of the movie. I loved the way the film integrated different forms of self-destruction from cells that have coded instructions to self-destruct, to alien parasites to the Earth, to the relationships we have with one another. It tied in the theme of cancer, which was touched upon at several points within the movie such as in the class the protagonist teaches as a professor, the strange mutations that occurred inside The Shimmer within living things, one of the characters having cancer and I'm sure there's much more that I missed.There was also moments of it that make you think of change as both positive and negative occurrences; people's lives are forever changed due to monumental events in their lives, events that mark a before and after in your life and forever change you.

1690,vshishkov84,Left me with a lot to desire!,5,18 March 2018,"The film's adaptation seems quite good. However, for me it felt flat when the director overly-used lens-flare effects got in the way of the story and the bland acting game.
The story and dialogue come afront as one of the best I have recently seen in sci-fi genre, without the cliches so typical of the genre. Yet there are some gaping wholes in the story, like why would they not enter the zone in an armored vehicle, yet guns are brought without issues, nor detrimation to their state?See, to me, apart from the questionable director decisions, very uninspiring actor casts, the actual movie was grippingly good to watch! This duality in good and bad makes it a must watch for any fan of the theme portrait here.
However, this is far from a polished work for the broad audience. Featuring an all-women presence in 95% of the film's duration, emphasys on the horror theme, and graphic gore well above my personal taste (R rating seems mainly for focused gore, barely for sexual)...
With all that said, I must confess that the visuals are nothing short of breathtaking. The high dynamic range of the picture, immense work put on the set and above all - the work's art director. There were moments, I thought the visual design was better that what I have seen in the past decade of Holiwood movies of this type.Finally, I must say that I would definitely read the trilogy, unlike the film director, who refused to read the sequence of novels before completing the movie...

1693,starwarsgeek249,A Great Sci-fi Psychological Thriller,7,1 June 2018,"I see a lot of negative reviews on here... Probably because people can't see the hidden meaning behind the film... The story is about a couple girls going into an alien area. They all have personal issues and deal with ""self destruction"" we see the main character has had a husband that goes off to military missions and she has had an affair. He comes back but he's different... By the time Lena comes back from the whole expedition she is changed as well. The movie is symbolizing people dealing with the alien feelings we all face in life. That is why the whole movie seems off and why only girls into the Shimmer. They're all girls from a psych ward/rehabilitation area and each of them dies except Lena. Each of them has a reason to commit suicide and the movie symbolizes their deaths accordingly. Including the professor who has cancer... She dies after the ""alien force"" inside her consumes her. When the movie is said and done, we see Lena drink water and not almost die from it like her husband/clone husband did in the beginning of the movie. I think this was to symbolize she overcame the guilt of having an affair and her past military life. Why her husband is changed from his experiences and has PTSD... I think the part where he almost died from the water was symbolizing alcoholism or perhaps attempted suicide with drugs/poison. I also read someones review on this IMDB and made a great point that the film and Shimmer are a metaphor for cancer... Makes even more sense when looking at all the characters and their deaths. They all gave into the cancer except Lena who was ""fighting the Shimmer"" as one of the girls in the movie put it. The beginning of the film even talks about cancer which is an obvious hint. This movie is focused more on the impact of cancer in general, but shows all the elements of other reasons for suicide. In general this movie is made for those dealing with cancer/sucide/self harm/ depression/PTSD. Great movie whether looked at by a sci-fi perspective and an even greater one when seen for the psychological thriller it really is.... Although reading these reviews... Many seem to be to stupid to comprehend the film and its obvious symbolisms.",Annihilation
1694,cooltoys007,Throw all logic out the window!,2,10 March 2018,"First of all this movie was not confusing, nor was it thought provoking. I get the idea of morphology, the shimmer refracting dna and the idea of one's own self destruction to becoming something new/ different. Those ideas were cool, but that's not what I have issues with. It's hard to take this movie as a deep, intellectual movie when common sense and basic logic is all tossed aside.
Here is a list of things that I couldn't get passed in this movies:1. The team. Only one person had military training yet they were all given automatic weapons?2. The biologist doesn't wear gloves when swabbing specimens? Who cares about contamination right?3. Everyone they sent into the shimmer has died and never made it back except one guy who is dying and coughing up blood. They kept him in a quarantined area and wore hazmat suits around him, but they go into the shimmer unprotected?4.This is a military/government operation, where's the military? It would have made more sense to send a team of scientist in with a team of trained military professionals. I get the girl power in this, but you could have sent them in with an all female unit.5. You kill a giant, vicious mutated gator and decided the best mode of transportation is to get in the water on tiny row boats? People! We are talking about a gator that is on steroids and has severe roid rage! This place is a swamp!6.Their idea of standing on guard at night is to have one person on the ground 200 ft away from everyone in a small guard shack that has no walls where something can grab you from all angles while everyone else was high up in a lookout tower. There was a balcony on the tower that had one set of stairs that went up it. That is where you put your guard.7.Who the hell packed their gear? No night vision goggles? No secondary side arms? No masks in case of deadly spores? The side arms and night vision googles later in the movie were stripped from the soldiers equipment they found.Now. I am not saying do not watch this movie. You can do whatever you want. It's your choice. You might like it and not be bothered by the things I listed.What I am saying is that I cannot agree with those that are praising this as the best sci-fi movie or that it's the most intelligent one. For every intellectually stimulating subject that's touched in the movie is quickly overshadowed by some boneheaded decisions and actions.There are (in my opinion) better Sci-fi movies out there.
Arrival, Blade Runner 1 and 2, Ex Machina, Any Star Trek movie, District 9, 2001, Alien and Aliens, Predator, The Maze Runner, The Matrix, Close Encounters, The Edge of Tomorrow, Minority Report, Interstellar, Dune...You want thought provoking movies?

1701,lance-0001,Will frustrate you to no end,3,3 August 2018,"It started out fairly okay, but it's quite hard to take a film seriously that focuses so much on philosophical drivel and colourful metaphysical special effects that it loses sight of everything else. The bad acting, the lack of character and relationship development, the blatant disregard for logic or common sense all in pursuit of making something thought provoking or mind-boggling... It just comes off as a pretentious, over-ambitious, hack of what a science-fiction film should be. Some points that made me feel like I was wasting my time watching this film in no particular order:1. There's nothing intellectual about it. It is basically a self-indulgence on the part of Mr. Garland where he overextends himself in an attempt to live up to his hype, but falls painfully short. The science, apart from some self-absorbed mumbling about genes and mutations, is nonexistent.2. The feminist and progressive commentary is certainly present - and quite glaringly so (Lena getting hysterical over Kane mentioned her thinking about him while he was away??) - and that is all fine and well, but at the every least they could have sent an actual military unit along? I mean hey, it could have been an all-female unit, they could come up with a reason for why that is plausible.3. No protective clothing or gas masks! There was even some talk of radiation exposure before they went in lol! You expect me to believe that this is a legitimate military-government operation when these so-called professionals forego even the most basest of precautionary measures??4. So you have a team of scientists who happen to be women going into the Shimmer for... research? Collecting samples? Except not a single one of them seemed to be into that idea once they got in - well, apart from a couple of ""oh wow this mutated thingamajig is cool"" comments from Lena as she played around with the specimens barehanded. No notes, no recordings, zilch. They weren't even interested in watching the videos to the end, which seemed to contain some very crucial information, instead choosing to snap the recorder shut because of how gross it was. The ""it's a trick of the light!!"" exclamation by the professional medic was definitely funny though.5. Do you expect me to simply take it in stride that these organisations are wasting their time sending in people with serious emotional issues (the most important one being SELF-DESTRUCTIVE TENDENCIES) whilst expecting them to come back alive? Even the so-called badass psychologist team leader, once in the Shimmer, seemed to have her head in the clouds. Showing zero initiative, making no attempt to keep her team alive, simply walking around in a daze... Is this the literary masterpiece of a screenplay Garland said ""OMG this script is the best! I absolutely HAVE to direct this!"" to? I mean I'm not ignorant to the whole cancer, refraction, self-destruction etc. metaphors this film tries to establish, but in the end we simply get a piece of visual poetry. This is not compelling storytelling.6. Should the primary objective of the mission(?) not have been to collect information, extract a few samples, and then GTFO ASAP?? I mean, you know since NONE OF THE OTHER TEAMS MADE IT BACK? Seems to be the most logical course of action - with the highest chance of survivability - would be to NOT try to push on all the way to the lighthouse, that even after a giant mutant crocodile just attacked you! But hey that's just me.7. By the way, did they really get into boats and paddle their way through a swamp just after the mutant crocodile thing?8. Point of reference: when you're a 5-person crew, and you have an accessible watchtower with a single point of entry, you put your entire crew in that watchtower and you position a guard on the balcony, guarding that singular entrance. And if a couple of your foolish teammates decide to not take refuge on that watchtower, you do not, I repeat, YOU DO NOT all go clamouring down when one of those idiots says there's trouble.9. There were some interesting questions raised (and asked in soft, bored tones), but how much does that really mean when no real attempt was made to answer them. All we got were blank-faced replies of ""I don't know"", ""I don't think so"", and ""Maybe"". Brilliant writing.10. Speaking of the writing, the dialogues were absolutely cringey. With words like ""bereavement"" thrown around in casual conversation, and forced military jargon spoken with childlike glee (mode of transportation!).And I could go on and on, but alas there's only so much time I can afford to spend on a review for a film as narratively lacklustre as this one. The film was very pretty, I liked all the bright colours and the human gardens and that gets it a 3 from me. Once again, I get all the nice little metaphors and references hidden in plain sight, they are very clever, Garland deserves a gold star for them, but I do hope he doesn't believe he has created a cinematic marvel with this film. It is not nearly as intelligent or thought-provoking as it tries to make itself out to be.But hey the creepy zombie bear was cool.",Annihilation

Well I think you got the point; this movie won't tell you much, and that wasn't the point either!In this flick Natalie Portman takes the role of Lena, an enthusiatic biologist, heartbroken by her, presumed KIA, husband.
One day, whilst painting her bedroom - in tears, her husband returns. His condition is bad, and even worse, he remembers nothing of his past 12 months away from his wife.
This is where the story takes of. Lena has to figure out what happened to her husband, and hopefully even cure his continually deteriorating condition. She soon figures out that the source of his ailment is perhaps even beyond her capabilites, and perhaps even beyond this world...Whilst I dislike the evermore returning theme of the irrational behavior of cinematographical characters in present day films, the movie offers illustrious and vivid images, metaphors inviting thought, and an overall entertaining trip.This is not a perfect film - I know - but it is great enough to take up your time a weekend evening, either alone (with a couple of beers - in my case), or with your friends/family.Finally, watch this film with an open mind, and pay close attention. This is a film where details about the plot are presented from the beginning to the very end, and it is thus important that you don't look away even for just a couple of minutes, since this will likely make you look at the screen at the end thinking, ""what the h*ck?!"", like so many others.",Annihilation

A movie where existentialism and introspection are both prevalent and beautifully intertwined throughout the entire film. This is the kind of movie I found myself contemplating and discussing for hours after with friends and or myself. Lena and her team, all women scarred by traumas in their life embark on a search, seeking answers for something greater (the shimmer). However as they delve deeper, each character has their moments of reflective insight in which they realise they need to look inward to find answers. (Specifically when Lena enters the lighthouse , she has this beautiful scene with a mirrored version of herself, every move she makes, it makes, it begins as a struggle as when she tries to fight and run from it, it just fights back and catches her, until she becomes at peace with it, it's only then when she escapes) This is all showcased through the breathtaking cinematography and deep colour pallet that engulfs this enviornment. Let's not forget, there is a brilliant blend of classic sci-fi and a flavour of horror, the scene with that bear, that is utterly haunting on every level. The juxtaposition of breathtaking colour and art, and the dreary undertone of the unknown & the everchanging refraction of DNA really provides the viewer with a unique and breathtaking visual journey, regardless of what you make of the multi faceted story possibilities.",Annihilation

That one started with an 8+ rating and had a bunch of glowing critics' comments on the poster, so I dragged a friend to see it.Turns out A Knight's Tale was a silly dumb comedy, about in the same league as Airplane II (the sequel, not the original, which was fairly inventive and still remains very quotable). I scratched my head for a while, until learning that the studio got caught hiring a fake critic to write up a fake adulatory review. Apparently it was monkey see, monkey do with the ""top critics,"" who all sang the praises for this ""innovatively charming"" and ""brilliantly irreverent"" film. With actors like Heath Ledger and Paul Bettany, it couldn't stink too much, but it was such an intentional goofball flick, an 8+ rating just did not make sense. Over the years, the rating for AKT has steadily dropped to a more reasonable 6.9.Is Annihilation another case of rigged reviews skewing the rating process, or at least of monkey see, monkey do? More relevant is how far its IMDb rating will drop, as the unbiased honesty of real viewers increasingly outweighs the misguided early reviews of ""professional critics?""I'd say this visually stimulating but logically gapped product is comparable to an M.

1733,juliusthefirst,Typical case of: Doesn't know where it wants to go at all.,5,13 March 2018,"Like all Netflix movies, I didn't really know what to expect of this. I found Netflix productions to vary quite a lot between good and bad, I guess I started this with an expectation somewhere between ""Altered Carbon"" and ""Helix"", of which I consider the first quite good and entertaining and the second as the example for linear stereotypical horror sci-fi. (Although Helix isn't from Netflix, but it fit the example)Unfortunately, I now have to say it shares a pitiful lot with the latter. I think it started off okay, having Natalie Portman as the powerful and tragic-life protagonist doctor seemed like an idea that could work for me, and sounded like it might spark interesting dialogues and a background story of a woman that's complex, and that I'm interested in, but the movie chose to not really do either of that.
Instead it just put the stereotypical horror movie group of five in a mysterious, alien-whatever occupied strip of, what else could it have been, US soil that proved to be, what else could it have been, populated by genetically mutated animals, that of course are completely predatory, while also practically immortal and seem to lure everywhere, ripping apart the group of explorers, which of course consists of: the cold, focused psychologist leader, the irrational, choleric nurse, the shy young tech expert, the girl you don't even get to learn the stereotype of, because she died too early, and then naturally, the protagonist, the only smart one, painfully apathetic but somehow still the badass. And that's really all there is.There's still a lot of other scenes where the movie seemed to try to head towards an actually original and interesting story, but right when you thought that part has begun, it's over. Like the relationship of Lena to her husband, the genetic background of the phenomenon, the physical background of the phenomenon, the background stories of the girls, the development of the government's attempts to explore the phenomenon, etc.
All this is ditched for narrating the most basic, unoriginal, horror movie stereotype survival plot and an ending scene that probably would make a nice short film-cgi promo, but just feels really out of place in this movie and very unsatisfying.I think I understand what this movie wanted to be, a mix of creative, abstract nature documentary and sci-fi alien story, but it was good at neither, because it somehow focused most of its time on being a horror movie. A bad one.Maybe to finally summarize everything: the movie seemed like it wanted to be something and then just did everything in completely the other direction, skipping out on all important background story and logic, replacing it for bad horror scenes and scenes that are so unconnected, you can hardly tell what they're about.It's okay to watch if you want to see some pretty nature scenes and for some reason, these to be connected to horror plot, but there really are better movies for that.",Annihilation

Just because is a graphically beautiful movie, you cant ignore the dotes that make a good history viable. They have to make sense.

4: the conceptual idea behind the movie is good and interesting. (but purely executed)And that's it...The bad parts are most relate with the story itself:
 
1: The justifications for failing on getting information about the phenome that is happening2: the story of the teams that went there before 3: the way that the experiences were made before the main character is recruited...4: For a secrete mega project that can make hearth go to extinction, lets pick some ""noobs"" with 0 experience in ""secret"" missions or strange phenomes and send them to resolve the problem.5: the team composition :O6: Since we are a ""noob"" team lets go in to a f#$&%# phenome like that with 0 protections ( this one is WOW)7: The plan that they pick basically is "" we don't know nothing so let's pick this ass's and go the source""..... my god...

In my view, it's right in the middle. It's worth seeing in theatres, but just don't expect the storyline to be the primary source of enjoyment. As film fans, it goes without saying that we have to Suspend our Disbelief -- in other words, don't nitpick too much. You can always find a few inconsistencies to point out if you want to be the annoying friend, but in this case, the entire basis for the plot is illogical and frustratingly stupid.The movie starts with Ms. Portman's character being kidnapped along with her husband, after his inexplicable return home. She is able to convince the head honcho to let her in on all this classified alien craziness by simply saying ""I'm a biologist, I can help"" -- as if in 3 years of studying this thing they never thought to bring a biologist? Plus the lady running the show is a psychologist, and there does not appear to be any other decision makers (military?) anywhere. They spend three years sending in troops that don't return, and all of a sudden shift to 4 scientists with no military background? Did it occur to anyone to send troops AND scientists? My head is hurting at this point.... As the movie progresses, more questions are raised about what is going on inside the Shimmer, but 95% of them do not come remotely close to being answered. Sure, a few open-ended questions can effectively add to the mystery of a film, but in this case I just found myself continually looking around the theatre at other people, asking ""WTF is going on right now?"". For me, that lack of coherence is not a good thing. Then towards the end, everyone is dead but Portman and the psychologist. The Psych disappears inexplicably, yet Portman doesn't really seem to notice. I could call out more negatives, but there were several positives as well. The special effects were simply beautiful to see. Additionally, the design of the world inside the Shimmer was incredibly inventive. Finally, though it mostly posed questions and left them unanswered, the film did make the viewer ponder about extraterrestrial life, what it might be composed of, and what it might desire. Apparently there is a book that makes the movie seem a lot more logical, so maybe read that before seeing the movie.

Hinting was given at the beginning of the movie referring to all of man as fundamentally flawed, leading to death.A team of people decide they want to enter the ""shimmer"", the unknown. All have their own fundamental issues of destruction of their selves. Each can be seen as a flaw that leads to ultimate death. They are all self destructive, yet they don't want to die.We learn after they took the leap of faith to enter the shimmer, that all things are made new. They become a new creation. Similar to faith in Christ, where you die to your old self, and are born again as a new creation.We also learn, that all things in the shimmer are connected to the vine, yet are all still very different beings. This is like when we, as believers, are all grafted to the vine of Christ. It is not us bearing fruit, but Christ to which we are grafted. This is illustrated and pointed out very soon after they entered the shimmer. Just as everything becomes part of the same body, as Christians we also become one body (the ""alien"").Just like when we die on earth, nobody ever comes back. It is a moving on to be new creations in Heaven. Just like in the shimmer. And some, even though they get a glimpse of what heaven is, and new creation, they don't go all the way to the ""light"".There is further reference to heaven, as they get close to the ""light"" (lighthouse). The crystal all around is like the pearly white gates to Heaven. And you get to see Kane, die to his old self, and then become new again. The second Kane is a reference to Christ being the second Adam, and Lena being a second Eve. They are not the old creations that they used to be, but new Creations.There are other themes, like the significance of blood (blood of Christ) to the ""shimmer"", sanctity of marriage, our flawed selves and how to save mankind. A key line in the movie is spoken by Kane, ""God doesn't make mistakes"". This is true. Our faults are our own doing. What can save us from our own destruction? Lena answers that when asked, ""What does the alien want"". Her reply, ""nothing, it is not destroying, it is creating anew"".

There are so many great films that could have been even better if they'd taken a few minutes to address issues that will drive some viewers crazy. For example:The expedition is entering an area where no one has returned completely unharmed. They should have gone in to the shimmer with sporty hazmat suits with thin cables attached so they could be extracted or find their way out if need be. The director may have felt that hazmat suits would interfere with the character's interactions etc, but when they wake up in the tents not understanding what has happened, they could be out of their suits with no sign of the cables attached at that point and carry on.It would have been easy for the biologist to put on gloves when gathering specimens.1 minute of dialogue where they argue about taking little boats on croc infested waters (like ""there's no other way to get there) and nervous glances while in the boat.There is no reason the one pulling guard duty wasn't in the lockout tower with the others. If the base needed a lookout tower, they could have made it inaccessible to justify them being on ground level when the bear attacks.Those were the most glaring issues I had, everything else could have been forgiven.

I think Lena was still the original Lena, only she was profoundly changed and still had the glimmer effect in her DNA. At least it was realistic that they were being kept in quarantine. If the ones in hazmat suits tested their blood, organs, etc they would probably find evidence of the alien in their systems and not let them out into the general public.I was confused as to why the Lena clone decided to burn everything...was it because that's what Lena 1 wanted, and they were essentially the same?Anyway, with all the crap out there, those giving this 1 or 2 stars are being pretty harsh considering the scope and beauty of this film.

1755,zraudys,Frustratingly Disappointing,5,26 February 2018,"Annihilation (2018), directed by Alex Garland, (now famous for his 2014 directorial debut Ex Machina, arguably one of the best sci-fi films of the decade), is a visually enthralling work of science fiction that ultimately, (and I should add, disappointingly), falls a bit flat. To summarize the plot briefly, the film is about a biologist, Lena, played by Natalie Portman, who, with a team of four other women, (Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tessa Thompson, Gina Rodriguez, and Tuva Novotny), explore a mysterious phenomena referred to as ""The Shimmer"", after many previous missions resulted in the disappearance of multiple military crews.
 The film itself relies on the concept of exploration. From the literal exploration of ""The Shimmer"" to the philosophical exploration of ideas surrounding humanity and evil, Garland is taking the audience on a journey of discovery that doesn't necessarily end when the credits roll. In film, this type of ambiguity and openness can be a great thing, but only if it feels earned. And this is where many of the problems in Annihilation lie. (From here on out, spoilers and specific plot points will be discussed.)
 For starters, the film is structured by showing Lena's exploration of ""The Shimmer"" intercut with her character being interrogated about her mission when it is immediately revealed that she was the only one on the expedition who managed to make it out. These scenes of interrogation, at least in my opinion, take a lot away from the effectiveness of the film. In what was a very unique and mysterious journey within ""The Shimmer"", much of that intrigue was taken away by Lena explaining what was going on. If removed from the film, and we are left with just the mission, (along with some very brief flashbacks), the overall message and point of the film would still be conveyed, and more importantly, it would be conveyed with more subtlety, (save for Jennifer Jason Leigh's character shouting the title of the film in the climax).
 Along with this, another thing that was dragging down the film, at times, was its writing. To put it bluntly, expositional dialogue was not a strength. All too often, characters would outright explain not only who they were, but exactly what was wrong with them in order to show the audience why they would agree to go on what could essentially be seen as a suicide mission. These moments felt very clunky, out of place, and unnecessary; almost spoon-feeding information to the audience in an effort to make us care more. You don't need to explain why a certain character always wears long sleeves. That can be expressed entirely visually. Don't just tell us that a character has cancer, show us. This whole tell-don't show, (or even tell-but-also-explicitly-show), aspect of the film, once again, took away from the subtlety of the story.
 But why is this subtlety so important? The film, itself, attempts to be abstract at times, leaving the audience to interpret visuals, (such as the splitting of cells, or what happens to Jennifer Jason Leigh's character underneath the lighthouse), in order to shape your own meaning of the film. This is not a new thing in science fiction, just look at 2001: A Space Odyssey's final sequence. Speaking of 2001, the climax of Annihilation is oddly reminiscent of the Stanley Kubrick classic. However, instead of leaving the audience wondering what exactly just happened, it's more or less explained immediately afterward in Lena's interrogation. This makes the overall message of the film feel less effective, and, in some ways, feels insulting to the audience, assuming they would never be able to reach that conclusion on their own.
 The film isn't entirely bad, however, as there are still positives to take away from Annihilation. For one, Portman's performance was fantastic and easily the best part of the film. At every point in the film she's able to convey so many complex emotions just through her facial expressions, and all praise she has received for her work in this film, I believe, is well deserved. Another thing that was great was the atmosphere and tone of the film, which was very consistent and constantly engaging, (and a lot of that praise should be directed to the film's director of photography, Rob Hardy.) But after this, a lot of the great things in the film are brought down by some caveats. For example, the visuals were great and visually exciting, except for when they weren't. The transformation of Jennifer Jason Leigh in the climax: beautiful, but the look of the rainbow-alien-shapeshifter: rather ugly. The look of the flowers and ecosystem within ""The Shimmer"": stunning, but the constant not-quite-lense-flares covering assaulting the screen when the characters explored the shimmer: not so much. Also, the score was quite good... except for when it wasn't. The strange, sort of warped sound of the piece ""The Alien"" that plays during the climax is chilling and a perfect fit for the film, but as a whole, the score felt very inconsistent and occasionally out of place, like the guitar music that is used when Lena is searching for the body of a missing team member.
 Ultimately, this adequately summarizes my feelings towards Annihilation: it's a great film, except for when it's not. And, unfortunately, the film has far more 'not great' moments and issues than its genuine flashes of brilliance, and this leads to the film being, frustratingly, just okay, falling short of its massive potential.

And with a title like ""Annihilation"" you think saying it in the script would be stale, but that's exactly the team that Annihilation clearly had, they pulled off everything.This was an experience like no other.

I want to think people who consider it thought-provoking are impressionable teenagers. Characters... making the most annoying, two-dimensional, unlikeable set of characters won't make your movie look intellectual or compelling, quite the opposite. Plot holes have been thoroughly described already. This is one of those movies where you end up accepting the fact that whatever happens, happens ""because director"". At least Michael Bay is honest and doesn't try to cram some shallow intellectual mumbo jumbo into his movies to make himself look smarter than he is. This movie was a waste of time. It's not appealing as an action-adventure movie, it's not appealing as an scifi essay on anything. 
Positive reviews of the movie seem to set the 7/10 or 10/10 first and then trying to make up excuses for it, not arguments.

There were a few holes in the plot/characters which you do kind of look at and think ""Why would that happen, why would they do that?"" but not enough to ruin the film overall. Also, without causing too much offence, asking why ""the biggest military force in the world didn't sort it out"" is such a stupid comment which shouldn't be associated with a film like this.Overall, yes the film has holes, but; the beautiful scenery, superb acting and mysterious storyline makes this one of the better sci-fi films of recent times.

I have seen several theories on what this movie is about but I think most missed it. It is a solid Scifi movie in its own regard but past this point I will write what I believe this movie is truly about. Of course spoilers will ensue so beware. Within the movie, there is a pointed speech about self-destruction. This is what the movie is about simply. Why would a husband volunteer for a suicide mission? Why would a desparate window follow the husband into the abyss? Why would someone with cancer take the mission? So they identified all the people as self-destructive to be clear. Aside from that, the focal point of the anomoly is at a lighthouse. What does a lighthouse do? It is designed to warn people to stay away from danger. The characters in the story continually walk toward the lighthouse which itself is self-destruction. In addition, when the main charater walks up to the lighthouse there are bone carefully arranged in a pseudo-pirate warning as if to say ""Abandon all hope ye who enter here.""One of the last scenes is also supportive of this narrative as Natalie Portman realizes she is fighting herself within the alien double. She realizes her own self-destruction, and has to find a way to break the cycle.",Annihilation

1802,marikoralph,A visually stunning modern sci-fi,8,11 July 2020,"Annihilation is based on the first book of the trilogy by Jeff VanderMeer. I watched the film prior to reading the trilogy and realized that the film is quite different than the book. Either way, the film does do a great job showing the world being overtaken by an unknown presence they call the Shimmer. From what I understand, the unknown presence is something that was able to interstellar travel and are far more advanced than we can comprehend. Dealing with a presence that advanced, it poses many questions, such as, can we even understand what it is or what it wants? Do they see us as intelligent beings or something as insignificant as a bug? It's a story of exploring this presence. If you do find yourself feeling lost while watching this due to so many unanswered questions, I highly recommend reading the books. It is the first installment of the trilogy so it seems logical that Annihilation wouldn't have all of the answers for you right off the bat.",Annihilation

Why were there helicopters just pointlessly hovering over the base as the Girl Guides went to save the world?Why were they drinking beer, 400m from the end of the world? Why were there 20 people is Hazmats silently watching Natalie get questioned? Why was a Government organisation leaving one person to decide the fate of cities, without committees or discussions and allowing unstable individuals into the Shimmer?

1837,isaiahterry-12874,A Small Aside,9,18 January 2019,"I personally liked this movie, and although I generally don't take the time to review movies there were a couple things that I wanted to clear up after reading some of the other reviews. The first thing is that while the movie does depart from the book a bit it does keep some things the same. One of those things happened to be that everyone on the team was going crazy slowly. While I felt like it was pretty clear in the movie this may have been a bit harder to see if you hadn't read the book. The reason why I say this is because some of the so called ""stupid"" decisions made in the movie can easily be explained by the fact that they are not in their right state of mind. Another thing I wanted to clear up is that the psychologist was most certainly drugging and/or hypnotizing the other women. While it isn't made overly clear there are enough pointers to this such as the fact they don't remember walking over the border and how they have a clear ability to get sedatives. This isn't explicitly stated in the movie however it is in the book and I think there are enough pointers towards the movie being the same. This is also why the psychologist is the leader of the group. A third thing I wanted to point out was that advanced technology did not work in ""The Shimmer"". Furthermore the military has sent multiple groups into ""The Shimmer"" with varying size, skills, ect all to no avail. At this point they are grasping for anything to work which is why the group may seem a bit peculiar. This is all exposition in the book that was not explained in the movie, however I don't fault the movie for not saying these things as oftentimes sci-fi movies can get bogged down in the nitty gritty details. Finally I just want to say that all of these critisisms are so nitpicky, the movie is wonderfully shot with a great cast and a weird a** ending that I honestly enjoyed better than the book (I know gasp!). Overall I would definitely recommend one to watch this movie as I genuinely enjoyed it a lot, and I think many people would as well.",Annihilation

1842,jenniferfparrish,Forget Your Expectations,8,29 April 2018,"First of all, I must say this movie is... odd. I read the reviews prior to watching and was more than a little disheartened by the ""I was expecting A bit this movie is totally not A so I'm totally going to bash it because it wasn't what I was expecting"" reviews. I get it. Sci-Fi. We all see trailers and think we know what to expect. I'm guilty too. But I don't bash a movie when it delivers the unexpected! So this movie... hmmm... where to begin. There are plot holes. Definitely. Several that I scrunched my eyebrows at and wondered how a production team let that pass, BUT none so huge that they kept me from enjoying the movie or following what was happening. There are mistakes and plot holes in every movie, there just happen to be noticeable ones in this movie. Graphics and special effects are pretty amazing. The world that is created inside the phenomenon known as ""the shimmer"" is superb. All of the strange mutations reminded me of several books I've read revolving around post nuclear war conditions on Earth... maybe a little toward The 100 when they are introducing the new Earth in season 1. Regardless, very pretty and very interesting visuals. The science. This is tough for me. I have a degree in Biology and am finishing a Masters in Physics, soooooo this is different for me than the average person. The concept of the mutations and why they are happening is... interesting... and impossible (as Portman actually states in the movie). BUT I have to remind myself that this is meant to be triggered by an alien entity. That means that what humans believe to be the limits of possibility are obsolete when you introduce alien intelligence that might conceivably not even be carbon based! So while I don't see the science as ""sound"", I am intrigued by the entertainment of the what if factor. In reality, the effects the scientists see are more aligned with genetic engineering than natural mutation sequencing... but I digress. The acting was better than average with several really great moments throughout. Portman is definitely the standout actress here and delivers a character you would expect from an actress of her caliber. The supporting cast did a wonderful job. Everyone delivered their characters, though I will say that the script itself limited the character development. You do not really have personal attachment to anyone but Portman's Lena. So I wasn't heartbroken by the eventual demise of certain characters. Had there been opportunities for me to invest emotionally in them, I think their fates would be more profound and elevate the experience further. All in all, the movie is entertaining, it makes you think about a possibility that could be out there for all we know, and the ending makes me wonder what is next. Those 3 things are, to me, what a movie should do. There are shortcomings in this movie (hence I didn't give it a 10). There are shortcomings and errors in pretty much every movie ever made. However, I do not agree with the naysayers that this movie is inherently bad or destined for the $1 bin at every retailer. I just believe that you shouldn't go in with an expectation of where you think the plot is going... because I can almost guarantee that it is not headed down the path you believe it to be. The trailers do not accurately set this movie up! So discard your preconceptions and pop some popcorn. Settle in for a good little movie that will make you go ""Huh?! What if...""Enjoy...",Annihilation

These were the questions deserved the answer but what happenes in the light house? You see an alien just wants to mirror everything? That's why the whole shimmer has such mixed DNA genes? I think there was no point in the answer. The path that movie was leading to and the ending are ridiculously irrelevant.

1847,michaelgourlay,Serious waste of my time,1,4 June 2020,"Sorry but I can't say anything good about this Beyond the mild interest of (painfully waiting) to find out what will happen when they enter the shimmer (pretty pants name too if you ask me). Then they do enter (By the way, take it nobody tried walking in and then walking straight back out again - you seem to be able to see them on the other side once they have walked through - despite the rather unexplained time distortion - good old refraction again I assume! ) and it's all downhill from there.Decided to expand on my review after reading some of the other reviews. I'm dictating this so apologies for any typos or misplaced capitals. I don't really want to take any more time correcting a critique of this poor film (in my view). I do feel I need to express my opinion on this however which probably sums up how much I resent spending time watching it.Maybe one day I will find that I am missing an artistic viewpoint of some kind. However, for the time being I just don't understand how anybody can find this film enjoyable in the watching. I would also add that those who feel the need to abuse other film genres To elevate this particular film in their reviews presumably have an axe to grind And I'm not sure why that is relevant in the review of any given film - removes some credibility if you ask me. Surely it's A significant generalisation /narrow minded to write off an entire genre of films anyway?Plot: even those Who seem to have enjoyed this film appear to concede that the plot makes little to no sense at all (to me it makes zero sense). Its generally chockablock full of holes/nonsensical. A prism that refracts everything in it including DNA??? This makes absolutely no sense to me at all. If there is any scientific basis behind this presumably there are only very few people With the scientific knowledge who are actually going to be able to make any sense of it. If there isn't, it seems like a fairly meaningless/Unconnectable concept.Mood/atmosphere: I can't think of any word to sum this up better than ""miserable"". Depressing might be another adjective I would apply however. Without substance. Contrary to normal human reactions there seems to be no sense of anticipation or wonder about this phenomenon From those involved. They all seem to defer to being miserable instead.i.e. It seemed considerably lacking in the range of human emotions. Trying to recall if there was even one joke? Even in most war films where everybody is dying there is some humour. We are humans. Basically a group of rather depressed people wander into a shiny bubble where everything in it is mutating at a cellular level e.g. people becoming plants and animals. That description however probably makes it sound a lot better than it actually is. It's slow and dreary with the music to match. While as usual I forced my self to pay attention through most of the film at times I was multitasking using the Internet and sending a message to my brother about better quality television. I didn't seem to miss anything however as a result. I had to force myself to get to the end of the film ( I thought about turning it off) and was hoping that there might be a big reveal of something mildly interesting/logical. There wasn't. I saw the word visceral to describe this in some of the reviews. This bamboozles me somewhat. I had no natural reaction to this other than boredom. I didn't find it suspenseful, scary or compelling. I would suggest to people if they're looking for that type of reaction within themselves, relative to this film, you would be better just listening to some pink floyd with some disco lights Or a lava lamp. I also saw some comments about graphics. I think there are obviously some talented drawers associated with the film. I'd perhaps prefer 'flower people' a lot of the time! However I didn't find the CGI that different or particularly special.It's great if some people enjoy the film. However, despite having a rather wide ranging taste in films, I'd sum this up as - woeful",Annihilation

The few action scenes are reasonable but it's all visual shock and there's no concept of an underlying menace - if the film was thought-provoking it'd be forgivable, but the premise is slightly childish and far-fetched - most people could probably come up with a better one over a few drinks - and the final 'battle' is decided more by luck than skill.

1852,nicholasoconnor,People have seriously missed the point.,9,5 October 2018,"I have read a ton of reviews after watching this movie, and the conclusion I've come to, is people just don't get the point the movie is making.**SPOILERS**The movie isn't just about an alien life form that has come along to 'destroy' us, it's about something more. It's about our understanding of existence and life and how our understandings are still limited by our own knowledge of the physical universe.My field is sociology, and as a sociologist, my main mantra is that 'everything we know may not be true.' This is what this film highlights. Our understanding of the physical universe is limited by our own understanding of the basic laws of life and existence. Lena goes into 'The Shimmer' as a biologist that has a firm belief in what she believes are the cellular laws of biology and the universe. Everything she encounters in The Shimmer completely contradicts that. Little things such as the tattoo on her arm which is from one of the other members of their squad, show that she is not just 'herself' anymore, but rather, a compiled version of those she shared time with in The Shimmer. This is where the refracted DNA explanation comes into play from Josie, that states that 'it's refracting everything, even us.' Basically, Josie says that everything within this field is becoming a part of everything else. The bear contains Shepard in her last moments, the deer have flowers on their head, and so on and so-forth. This is why Kane is not Kane at the end, but still in essence is. The deeper question this movie asks is: 'Is our understanding of the universe 'the understanding' or just 'a understanding.' It challenges you to to challenge your own beliefs of science and understanding and instead conceive of a possible reality in the future where none of the basic laws of science, biology, physics, hold true. There are some holes, but they are not major enough to affect the film in any great way. As for the ending, Lena is Lena but she's not. Does that make her any more or less than she was? She is now the sum of others that she experienced her time with, so isn't this the same as what we do internally? Absorb things from other people and have that influence our lives to make different decisions. For me that was the point of showing the affair and how it lead to him going, which lead to her going, which lead to her lying and so on and so-forth.This is my understanding of the movie, but as the film demonstrates, it may not be 'the understanding', as that is completely open to interpretation.I think that's a great thing",Annihilation

1868,belengo,Annihilation of your time,5,13 March 2018,"I watched this movie due to a friend recommendation and she praised it for its original concept. Although the storyline of the alien was quite unusual for what we are accustom to, there were too many badly executed practical issues that didn't let me enjoy it. For once, the constant shifts in time were, in my opinion, more annoying than useful both for the story and to increase my interest in the movie. In the same way, the flashbacks of the affair could have easily been reduced to a conversation instead of the unnecessary amount of scenes about it. Other problems I found were even more basic than just the presentation of the plot itself. There didn't seem to be much control over the missions or the strategy they were using. If they had been sending small missions for over three years without a positive result, wouldn't it be logical to change the approach? Also, isn't it convenient that their mission is the one to succeed when the rest have failed doing exactly the same? Could it be because the protagonist was there? Even more confusing was that a group of scientist didn't think to use gloves when they knew there was a great chance that something in the environment could kill them. If it was me I would've been more careful, just saying. Also, there is the fact that they didn't have enough food or supplies for the time they stayed there, as it was suggested in her interrogation. It can be an innovative movie, but basic biology still stands; people need to eat to stay alive and specially if they are constantly moving. To conclude, I would say the movie presents a peculiar idea that is interestingly presented but that has some flaws that should have been looked at more carefully. I thoroughly enjoyed the many questions that the movie introduces about the nature of the alien and the human nature itself. However, I think the practical issues mentioned earlier avoided the viewers from enjoying these. On the bright side, it is a great movie to criticize.",Annihilation

1877,ubikcorp,Dazzling sci-fi puzzle with no easy answers,10,23 February 2018,"Annihilation is based on a novel of the same name by Jeff Vandermeer, a writer specialized in a literary sub-genre known as ""weird fiction"". This book is the first from a 
trilogy; however, director-screenwriter Alex Garland (""Ex Machina"") wrote this adaptation before the next two books were even published. 
It follows the story of a Lena, a biologist with military background, whose life has been shattered by the disappearance of her soldier husband who had gone on a secret 
mission into an ecological disaster area presumably harboring an alien presence. Lena will be recruited as part of a scientific expedition into the unknown that will try 
to find some answers. As someone who have read the books, I appreciate the way the director has made this story his own, taking enough from the book to make the story 
recognizable, but at the same time making his own interpretations and connections, expanding on its themes and characters. There is much wonder, weirdness and visual poetry 
to be found in the beautiful and exceptionally well crafted film, and to my surprise there is also plenty body horror and sudden outbursts of gnaly monster action.
The movie weaves different timelines in a very seamless way, with a combination of economy and elegance that is both eloquent and easy to follow; this makes it possible to introduce 
different layers of meaning within the narrative (psychological, scientific, philosophical), and to tackle big themes without becoming pretentious or obtuse. The film contains 
memorable dialogue not included in the original novel and the characters are much more fleshed out (the conversation between the biologist and the psychologist about the 
nature of self destruction is a highlight, and a pivotal moment).
This is a project where you can clearly appreciate the simbiotic relationship between two highly imaginative thinkers (perhaps the best collaboration since Kubrick and Arthur
C. Clarke in ""2001: An Space Odyssey""). ""Annihilation"" represents the type of reflexive science fiction that ponders about our place in the cosmos, our intrinsic mutability,
and the horrors this conjures; it amounts to a surreal, sciency phantasmagoria about desintegrating identity, deeply rooted in cosmic horror. And I have no words to describe that climax apart from saying it left me in complete awe. This is 
for sure a new sci-fi classic that consolidates Garland as one of the major sci-fi visionaries of our time.",Annihilation

1879,leejameswalton,First movie I walked out of in 15 years - twisted movie making,1,25 February 2018,"I am truly mystified by the positive reviews for this film. I love sci-fi and like dark, cerebral movies so I thought I would like this film especially when I saw the great reviews. This movie is not dark - it is in a league below dark. Adjectives like grungy, slimy, dank, grimy & twisted in the worst way come to mind. It is fundamentally depressing right from the start. 
None of the characters are likeable or believable under those circumstances except for Natalie Portmans character but let's face it she is one of the most dreary A list actresses there is. The way the anomaly is dealt with both from the outside and the inside by the characters is insultingly unrealistic. I like films which try to be clever - I even liked the movie The Arrival quite a bit however this is just pretentious mental masturbation. If you can't think of a good new novel idea for a movie then don't try and pass a brain fart like this movie off as such please. The bad signs were all there right from the start but I kept waiting hoping things would pick up but the movie stayed consistently drab and uninspired. To make things worse even some of the action/battle sequences were ruined by just making them unnecessarily gory and disgusting - it was if the director was doing everything and everything to he could to slime you. The movie was like this guy's last movie Ex Machina but even more pointless and depressing. The movie reminded me very much of the Darren Aronofsky films I've been unfortunate enough to watch such as the Fountain, the Wrestler (before I switched that off too) and Noah (didn;t make it past the 15 minute mark). His movie style similarly just have this deeply disturbing, nauseating and depressing feel to them. I guess if you liked Ex Machina, and you're a Darren Aronofsky fan you'll like this movie. If not and I even save one such person from watching this film I'll feel I've done a moral service! I guess I'm an empathic person and the vibe of this movie is very distasteful - I can only guess the people who like this movie just are not perceiving the sick energy that permeates this film.

1880,wyrd-64442,A pretty self-centered affair...,5,25 February 2018,"I am rarely writing movie reviews, but feel compelled to do so here without offering major spoilers. I had high expectations, having heard of the movie and having watched a trailer or two in the past. Without getting into plot details, I will mention this: ""Annihilation"" reminds me of a number of ""strangeness-descends-upon-a-locale"" flicks, such as ""Signs"" (2002), ""The Mist"" (2007) and, more recently, ""Arrival"" (2016), but unlike those movies, it veers into the inexplicable, bizarre, and self-centered in a manner that defeats, in my opinion, both the aesthetic pleasure from watching the visuals, and seeking any deeper questions/answers the events might call upon.The main problem, I think, is that the slow, almost lethargic, pacing of the movie suggests that a feverish climax may be suddenly coming, but when the latter finally arrives, it leaves the viewer literally nowhere - the main characters have no nagging questions left, there is no plot twist, and, at best, the movie seems to suggest that one needs to accept/adapt to fate no matter how odd, bizarre, or alienating. For those of us who watched ""Arrival"" and enjoyed the movie - be warned that, in contrast, in ""Annihilation"" there is no hard science, no clever games with concepts related to the time-space continuum, no large existential questions. While it is probably unfair to compare the two movies, the first 20-30 minutes of ""Annihilation"" are VERY close to the premise of ""Arrival"" and beg the comparison. From then on, however, each film takes a different route. ""Annihilation"" opts for the increasingly more erratic, bizarre, and grotesque, but has no answers as to why or how the events we see on screen come to relate to the fate of the main characters. If I write more, I will probably reveal unintentionally plot elements. I will mention only that for the most part, the acting is good, but characterization, as a whole, is not that good - we don't get to empathize much with any of the characters. The visuals are pretty, but not unique or exceptional in any way.",Annihilation
1881,oneilla-13417,Why did I bother ..... Zzzzzzzz,3,26 February 2018,"Clearly a lot of marketing has been spent on fake reviews as this film in my opinion doesn't deserve the ratings it has been getting. I went to see this on the opening weekend Atlanta and the screening was less that 10% full (It was actually 8% as I asked the concierge as I left) I had read the book before and found it to be utterly dull and ultimately felt like I was wading through treacle to reach the end, only to find the end really was worth it. But that said the book had a fairly good idea at the center even if the story didn't delivery on the idea very well.So when I had seen a film adaptation was coming out, I thought there is no way a director is going to just turn the book into a film, as the film would bomb on the big screen if it were a straight adaptation.While the film isn't a straight adaptation of the book, and does deviate from the original story, it seems the director somehow managed to lift the dull lifeless aspects of the book and bring that to the screen interspersed with a couple of shock moments to wake the film goer up, if they haven't left already. The director has clearly chosen to put there own interpretation of the source material which is a positive thing, so why the hell they chose to make the film as lifeless and dull as the book is beyond me, and like the book, the film, fails to build on the characters and as a result I had no interest in what happened to them. In fact I was only into the film about 15 mins when I had started to realize this film was looking like a lemon and by the time I was halfway through I was clock watching to see how long was left.If you read the book and enjoyed it, you may be put off by how different the characters are, or by how the settings and story have changed to be adapted to the big screen. But ii you enjoyed wading through treacle and 1 dimensional characters of the book then you will probably love it. If you didn't like the book, then you might just come out of this asking why did I waste 2 hrs on thatNet result, like the book - great concept at the center of the story that fails to deliver on its core concept.",Annihilation

Having a conflict with the ""bottom line"" experts of this industry and avoiding a homogenized, ""hollowood"" film is even more of a reason to see it!!!!!! The acting is stunning and fulfills the intensity of the story. The cinematic hues ( besides the CGI) are so cohesive, distinct, and unique.They become immersive additional characters.

+ Visually stimulating, dare I say gorgeous. A satisfying experience to see what before I could only read about.
+ Essence of the trilogy's plot and main sci-fi ideas are represented 
+ Erie/creepy feeling was also recreated on the big screen
+ Casting was decent
+ 18A gore and violence...Negatives:
Too many cuts and alterations to the plot/story, leading to other problems... Poor character development, especially outside the protagonistDialog is too direct and doesn't match the mystery of the storyPacing issues, considering the early reveals of where the plot was goingMissed opportunities to add to the story with dialog/narrationSummary: As a standalone movie, it breaks some of the mold to a traditional Hollywood flick. It's weird, creepy, unexplained, unique.. the same words I'd use for the books. Visually stunning and story captivating, I recommend it.If you REALLY liked it, I strongly encourage you to read the books, even just the first one.

The second half of Annihilation sadly fell completely apart. There were too many distracting plot holes, too much grazing over important details, and way too much pretentiousness.

The screenplay took some liberties to create more visual tension and excitement without losing the fundamental question of ""what does it mean to be human"" and ""what is the meaning of life""? I think this belongs up there with other ""big question"" movies such as Blade Runner. The pacing reminded me of ""Arrival""--thoughtful nuance and backstory interspersed with action and unveiling. I disagree with other critics that the characters were wooden and needed more development. They are developed just enough for us to care for them and to show their humanity and their imperfection--but their complicated back-stories don't bog down the fantastic discovery in the movie.

1890,mganea-29629,A brilliant work closely related to 'Ex Machina' and 'Sunshine',9,7 March 2018,"This is a remarkable film with hypnotic power and philosophical depth.
It seems to me that its core is the symbolism of the lighthouse.
The initial scene with the meteor striking the lighthouse is Garland's way of saying that our collective unconscious needs to assimilate something alien which causes disorientation and anxiety. I believe that is simply the scientific knowledge that we have about our biology and the unsettling transformative prospects it opens.
'Ex Machina' seems another meditation on the dislocation caused by knowledge, only the unsettling prospect there is the creation of artificial mentality.
The striking similarity between the narrative of 'Sunshine' (which Garland wrote) and that of 'Annihilation' should also be pointed out. A failed expedition with one lone survivor (Pinbacker in 'Sunshine', Kane in 'Annihilation') is followed by a second one, which uncovers video messages left behind. Both stories involve self-immolation (the crew of Icarus I, Kane) and the dissolution of a central character by a primordial force (Capa by fire, Ventress by a formless life entity).

 The entire journey those girls made is ultimately pointless. They learn nothing about the shimmer, the mutations survive even though the shimmer is ""gone"" and we as the viewers are left to guess the director's intentions when he doesnt even know them himself. Its disguised as a mind breaker when all it does is create more questions about the intentions of the aliens that sent it (even if they sent themselves there) the government's amateur approach to learning about it and how disappointing it is to witness their efforts lead them to nowhere. 
 In fact, the one thing that deserves praise is the good portrayal of the horrible struggle they endure. Also, those effects seem like from an early 2000 film, simple and dont blend in. Even a typical horror film would make me go out of the cinema more satisfied and horror is my least favorite genre. Because horror films dont try to do more than they can.

Instead it sucked viewers in with pretty visuals right until the end. The the final sequence the lead simply hands over a phosphorous grenade to her alien double and escapes.....Was it really that simple? I thought your double was shadowing your every move, then why did it let you just place a grenade in it's hand before you bolt for the door. It just felt unbelievable and cheap, but not unusual given the lack of plot right up until that point.Like plenty of other comments on IMDB, I'm astounded as to how so many reviewers have labelled it a masterpiece or an 'intellectual sci-fi'.

1910,ArleneAdvocat,A different perspective ...,8,16 March 2018,"OK, here it is...a different way of looking at Annihilation. 
This was not a film about aliens at all. The whole story was about Lena not being able to come to terms with her husband's death. This was her unconscious dragging her down into her center to heal herself, I think this is what Carl Jung meant by the phrase ""individuation"". So, as one viewer commented there are a lot of holes in the plot. For example, how would Kane's overseers have known so quickly about his rush to the hospital? It doesn't matter, this is her story and she must get there herself. When her damaged husband appears to her he can give her no answers. And not much is explained when she gets to the facility. The next clue is the team, all women. They represent aspects of Lena herself. They are all armed because Lena is ex-military, they are all scientists because so is Lena. They are all parts of her. Remember the talk in the boat. All the women are damaged goods. They represent the parts of Lena that are holding her back from recovering from the shock of Kane's death. The woman who ties them to the chairs is the part that wants to keep the status quo, she even accuses Lena of orchestrating their deaths (yes!) but Lena stays true to her purpose and continues on, finally alone. When she leaves her heavy pack on the beach and continues to her center (beautifully expressed by the lighthouse) that is another symbol of leaving her ""baggage"" behind. When she sees the video of her husbands death this is the moment she heals herself. She then goes deeper into herself, the hole leads into a place that even looks like the skeletal insides of a person, and the light of purification begins. Coming up out of the depths she can finally ""face herself"" and then the fire is the last purification. Her final words show that she is healed: ""You are not Kane...""

1911,georgechivusb,What a missed opportunity,3,16 March 2018,"So this is my first review, although I'm visiting IMDb since 2004. How good a movie is made depends if I fast forward it not. This movie was on fast forward starting from the 10 minute marker.
What bothers me the most is the childish approach towards science in this movie. I mean do they really have to send a team all the way in? Research is done gradually. You send a team 50 meters in, collect the data and come back. The next team goes then 100 meters and so on. Why would you send a team for miles in what seems to be dangerous alien territory? Secondly, how can they all sleep at once in the first part of the movie? Are they under some form of anesthetic? I guess the author meant it as a study of hypothetical human behavior, but if has nothing to do with such things. I would've liked a Martian approach from this movie, but I guess the director wanted for the viewer to make scenarios in his own mind instead of being satisfied that a complex problem was solved.
The pace also lags. The transitions from the Shimmer to flashes in the main character's memory are too often and break the flow of the movie.
The CGI is top notch, just like in Ex-Machina, but the story lags behind big time. I'm left with the same feeling I had after seeing Life, the 2017 movie: disappointed.",Annihilation

But this theme transcends this to a whole new level. In stead of doing he #standard story about an individuals point of view this was about ever story ever told and how different people take their view of it. It changes you and even if u fight it off it you will never be the same. It has so many elements to it which would be an entire essay to write but if u watch the movie with that perspective it very much changes all the elements and answers so many many parts of the movie that otherwise seem somewhat meaningless.

1914,wape-23473,dig a bit deep into this movie,9,18 March 2018,"I didn't read the book, but Let us dig deep into movie and bring some interpretations to the squad members:All 5 female squad members want to end their life problems in the Shimmer.The psychologist has cancer, she treats death indifferently but she can't eliminate fear of death. Alien entity decomposes her into something like flying particles or a pure energy form.The physicist has a self-injury and suicidal tendency, she does not want to be turned into a mutated creature or killed by one when she is alive, so chooses death with dignity is her best choice. 
 
The paramedic(an addict may live in torture of mania) and anthropologist(who lost her daughter, doesn't feel like living anymore ) can't bear their fears or sorrows. Both of them are finished by a mutated bear(that bear first kills the anthropologist and absorbs her near-death memory full of horrible pains and desperate fears, which makes the bear more terrifying, it echoes ""help me"", traps and kills the paramedic later. )The biologist suffers from a moral dilemma. She has an affair because of marriage problem. She might still love(or feel guilty on cheating) her husband. She decides to enter the Shimmer to get back their marriage. At last part of film, she fights with her duplication/alien entity which is a manifestation of her living will and saves herself.If people can't control their dark side well, it will devour them, make them self-destruct and hurt other people. Human can't get rid of dark side, they have to learn how to live with it and maintain balance. Killing by a mutated monster is a metaphor for killing by own dark sides in some ways.Biologist's husband knows his partner's infidelity. His pain of losing her prompts him to join in previous suicide mission. He reaches the lighthouse, alien entity gives him a copy of himself. He tells his duplication to go back home, and kills himself to end his pain. Ironically, he finds a solution that he can love the biologist without pain.Now bring an interpretation to alien entity in this movie: Alien entity appears as a small multi-dimensional alien space, the front part is a shining hole. Alien entity is not causing annihilating, it's purpose is beyond understanding.Alien entity is a mirror of creatures living in the Shimmer. What it reflects is the meaning of everything behind their existence by a unique way, which is to understand the intention or purpose of these creatures including human through condensing very-long-time evolving process into an instant completion one.How can it do this? From plot in movie, alien entity has a power beyond time, space and our knowledge of physical rules. Due to this incredible power, assume that it ""knows"" the truth, ""knows"" everything happened, happening and will happen in future. So alien entity shows fate of creatures as easy as showing a reflection of an object in an ordinary mirror. It's resonance or response is equivalent to the actual fate of creatures it mirrors.Ex., alligator may want another row of powerful teeth. Flowering tree may want a human shape. Stone may want to evolve into a silicon-based life... all these stuff in the Shimmer are reflections of that mirror. Alien entity reacts to every squad member in different ways in terms of:
1) intentions, faults that have already hardcoded in their genes.
2) their choices from their mind states and behaviors.In sum alien entity not only provides representation of new life forms, but manifestation of inner desires of creatures by understanding intentions. inclinations buried in genes and by their choices. The only survivor- biologist who shows her will to life in front of mirror gets back.Further, It's also reasonable to assume that alien entity is a super computer comes from a super civilization that can immediately decompose, duplicate, blend and create creatures and nonliving objects on different planets in different universe. We just don't have any clues if an entity/civilization is beyond our power of understanding. It's impossible to seek a nice logic in a sci-fi movie. it is wise that the writer or director leave this to audiences.If we dig deeper into a sci-fiction film, it inevitably leads to paradoxes or philosophical debate, such as metaphysics or agnosticism. A consistent system can't tackle completeness within itself. So It is wise to stop here.",Annihilation

A future that can be foreseen is a safe one. One we can be at ease with. One that allows us to make plans and have projects.That is why we call it ""malignant"" because cancer cells do not play along with our game rules.
Our predictable future was nothing more than a mere illusion...The core-message of this film is the fact that it ethically and morally questions whether something is merely evil simply because it does not go according to our wishes?It certainly feels like that to the frustrated victim who's life projects are thwarted.
But that is a very subjective judgement of those who are or will be annihilated.In the greater scheme of things there is no objective parameter that can lead us to the conclusion that one way of cell evolution and growth is ""better"" than another...
It is merely a different way of doing things... Annihilating some and recreating others, always using the same base material, but in different ways. Taking and giving....This is why the movie gives viewers a ""tip"" by pointing out that aging is caused by a ""fault"" in our genes.
The above said is clarified in the discussion between Lina and Kane.
She states God made a mistake, erroring in gene evolution and thus causing us to grow old and die. Kane states God does not make mistakes....
She has a judgement purely based on her values.The movie's point of view is that genes are genes... No better or worse than others, an sich.
We disappear, but instead there are beautiful white dears running in the forest with flowers on their antlers.
""It's not destroying, it's making something new"" -Movie Quote from Lina's scriptTherefore, to me, this is not a horror movie or a sci fi flick but a philosophical movie. It questions our homocentric valuesystem, using our human race and our desires as standards of judgement.Buddhism already pointed out that this is not only an incorrect but also a frustrating and senseless thing to do, because we have no control.
And finding out game play rules that we like and of which we think they should be obeyed does not change a thing about the fact that we do not have control.So this is a movie that in essence questions our value systems, our homocentrism and our pathetic desire to regulate everything.I think that maybe having gone to the experience of enormous loss and having to learn to cope and to let go, made this theme somehow more comprehensible for me.
And in that state of mind I found that this was very beautifully depicted. Not an easy thing to do.I believe that the reason most people don't ""get it"" is due to the fact that we need the illusion of control, the lie of predictability to survive...
If we are not convinced to reach our pension, why buy a house, take a mortgage, have kids, and go to work every day to pay for all this?
We do this because we think only others die (young).
Yet every day there is someone who arranges his hair, paints her nails, puts on perfume, dresses up nicely, steps in a car to go to work, and dies within the next 45 min. for whatever reason imaginable... car crash, brain haemorrhage, 9/11.....People do not want to be confronted with that. It destroys there illusion of a safe, righteous and predictable world. That is why victims are often avoided. And probably why this movie is not appreciated.It apparently takes a nearly dead person to understand.But believe me the world as you know it will cease to exist!
Because of the simple reason that you will die, and thus will no longer be in it.
And this is inevitable.In other words: ""If you want to make God laugh tell him your plans!""

1930,sandralitver,Streaming and DVDs Was Annihilation too brainy for the box office?,2,21 March 2018,"No, No it was not. And here is the reason why. It was boring. Not in the sense of boring movie you let run as background noise but at best one you show off at a ""Bring your favorite bad movie-Night"". You'd expect from a ""intellectual"" Movie they'd work the same way. But watching Natalie Portman using a portable Microscope in the middle of the night without an external light source was the beautiful cherry on top of a pile of illogical events and ripped off visuals. It seemed like they used the left over Probs from various movies like Prometheus and asked Rockstar to use the Undead Bear from the Red Dead Redemption DLC Undead Nightmare.
On top of that a completely unnecessary sex scene where we learn that Lena cheated on her husband, what seems to be reason enough to go on a suicide mission.
Not a single time in this Movie did we learn why Lena wouldn't use gloves to collect samples, why the group wouldn't wear masks to avoid contamination, why they aren't accompanied by the army while it seems to be a military operation. Watching the female cast stumble around in the woods with useless and superficial forced conversations and one or another gore element to wake up the audience has nothing to do with intellectual movie making. Visually worth 2 stars. No more or less. It takes more then a 10 page script ripped off from a good Book to make a ""Brainy"" movie. 
Therefore the plot of the script seemed recycled from Arrival apparently they worked in the same building.",Annihilation

1932,shanieglean,An excellent representation of the human condition and evolution!,8,23 March 2018,"This is the first review I've ever put on here because I felt compelled to give it the credit it deserves in spite of the masses of criticism (sometimes valid) it has received. The central theme of the film is humanity's propensity for self-destruction at a molecular level, as exemplified by Lena's pillow talk with Kane and Ventress' dialogue with Lena at the base. As someone who studies philosophy and psychology I have a slight bias towards films or shows like True Detective and Westworld that delve into profound philosophical concepts. After reading Thomas Ligotti's 'Conspiracy Against the Human Race' (Amazing book) the idea of self-destruction was something that resonated with me particularly. A utopian world could not exist with humanity because we are pre-programmed to be dissatisfied, even if our life is perfect. Why is this? Evolution.
The reason why humanity continues to make progress is in part, thanks to these biologically driven self-destructive tendencies. This effort to always want something more or different is one of the reasons we are not still living in caves; however, in many ways this also a curse. The average humans life now is likely the best its ever been compared years past but, many people, including myself, are still discontent and in our current form, that is the way it will always be. The movie presented us with only one way to escape the shimmer alive and that is to destroy yourself. Not so much in the suicidal sense but, destroying yourself in favour of becoming something new. An idea almost akin to that of transcendence in Buddhism, destroying your subjective illusion of the self to achieve a higher reality.
Another thing I love about this movie is the alien. It exploits this grey area between good and evil which, is often a very much neglected space. One could say it almost serves as a metaphor for evolution, in that, it is a force that is not intentionally malevolent nor is it intentionally beautiful, it just IS. This representative of the fact that good and evil are not two cosmic forces of the universe, they are human concepts devised from consciousness.
From a storytelling perspective there are several flaws. On numerous occasions we are provided with scenes that serve no purpose to the overall plot. For instance there are a couple flashback scenes that seem a little irrelevant and there is a part dedicated to finding a missing comrade that was really unimportant in the grand scheme of things. One could also critique a lack of exposition, although it is advantageous in the case of the alien. However, in terms of who they are working for it is never really clarified, though I am led to believe this is left similarly ambiguous in the books on which the movie was loosely based.
In short, if you have any knowledge in the realms of biology, psychology or philosophy then you will probably understand and enjoy this film a bit more than those who do not. It is a slow burner that is not for everyone, it is imperfect from a storytelling perspective but, what I love about Alex Garland is he really puts the SCIENCE in SCIENCE-FICTION. The scientific verisimilitude of his movies are why his pictures will likely never be huge commercial successes because it will alienate a majority of moviegoers who are not necessarily attuned to the dilemmas involving artificial intelligence or the nuances of the human condition. On the other hand, for those moviegoers that enjoy films that pose a question as opposed to an answer, films that are not a social commentary but rather an exploration of human nature and films that are not black and white, (Obviously not in a literal sense) then this is a film for you. Cannot wait for Garland's next project and I hope he gets the funding he deserves.",Annihilation

1935,johnnyskourtis,"Great concept, poor execution",6,24 March 2018,"I have to admit that the trailer really piqued my interest for this movie, especially after seeing all these scifi-ish scenes combined with some partially terrifying and strange shots. I won't lie, I extremely enjoyed most of this movie, however there were too many plot holes, and after a certain point I even stopped caring. So, we've got the beginning of this movie, where the protagonist reunites with her mysteriously disappeared husband, but a few moments later his situation is critical, and while being transported to the local hospital, they're surrounded by a tactical unit who extracts them both and moves 'em to a secure location. It was going smoothly but from this point onwards, logic jumped out of the window:-The protagonist is being ""greeted"" by a depressed psychologist, who -even though she technically stated that our dear protagonist knows too much to be let free by refusing to comply to her request to talk to a laywer- she proceeds to give a full briefing about the so called ""Area X"" and technically offer her a job.-So far, we've got a medium sized research facility with scientists in hazmat suits and random volunteers who monitor this site, where's the military? Seems like there were some extended budget cuts for the army, assuming this anomalous event must have been the biggest humanity threat they've ever encountered but they're treating it like a rat pandemic.-Plan is simple: No plan, we just need to get to the lighthouse. As mentioned earlier, they've been sending teams of military personnel in the zone for the past 3 years and the only person who returned is spitting blood and having a massive internal bleeding. Sounds cool, let's gather a team of 4 female researchers (and a paramedic), give them some M4's and send 'em in! That's what happened. Who cares about additional protection, masks, helmets, night vision googles since you know.. it's a damn tropical rainforest in there. I actually wondered if this was a Hunger Games sequel, sending 'em there to kill each other with minimal equipment and having to survive on their own.-At some point, a member of the group is being grabbed by a mutated crocodile, and rest of the team literally stands and watches them. Guess what's their next move, use tiny boats to cross the river, hey, there really mustn't be any similar creatures lurking in the waters of this god damn swamp.Worthy of mention is when they firstly entered, and they stated how communications weren't working. Oh, oh! You've been sending people in there for a while but you just noticed it. Also, by their reaction when they firstly encountered the mutated plants, I've concluded that all the other missions in ""Area X"" had the sole purpose of getting to the lighthouse by any means necessary, and that nobody conducted a reconnaissance in the primary part without immersing further in.Finally, there were a few minor details that also got my attention like, if this place was so classified and well protected, how did the sergeant manage to get out and breach the ""24/7 surveillanced"" perimeter? Plus, when the researchers watched the video of the army dudes cutting off a part of the mutating mans body, the reaction of the paramedic felt pretty unreasonable and weird, judging from her damn profession.I still really enjoyed it and loved the atmosphere , sort of reminded me of Stalker. I'd say Concept gets a 8/10 while Execution is like a 4/10.",Annihilation

1940,asadim-28294,Confused by the ratings too? Join the Annihilation club,1,27 March 2018,"As part of a secret military operation a group of strong-willed female scientists decide to investigate an area of extra-terrestrial cancer formed at a lighthouse that has taken the lives of their male counterparts. The team may appear directionless and lost the whole time, as one would expect when there is no plan, but one thing that is firmly established in this movie is the efficiency of these women in communicating, and also thinking. A typical conversation consists of no more than 6 words, and any decision is made with the least amount of thinking almost entirely leading to something horrific.The lead character Lena as portrayed by Natalie Portman is a clueless woman with commitment issues who decides to go into the cancer, aka The Shimmer to understand what's inside of it; much like how geologists examine erupting volcanos by going inside of them! The flashbacks throughout the movie tell of a loving wife who is also sleeping with another man. Kane the husband as acted by Oscar Isaac is one of the men who's been inside of The Shimmer, and has come out with the grand achievement of contracting a lethal disease. At least that's what Lena believes. Following an awkward reunion and the gut wrenching discovery of her husband's disease Lena gathers motivation to go up to Kane's boss lady and talk her into sending her into the cancer area. Dr. Ventress, the boss lady who is played by Jennifer Jason Leigh mumbles a few sentences and ultimately agrees.The team that is put together consists of five women. You are made to believe each person is expert in something, however this proves to be irrelevant since nothing they do cannot be done by a group of high-school teenagers. Further to that, as with any secret military operation involving deadly threats their journey is assisted by prehistoric camping equipment such as tents, a compass, a flashlight, a small spoon for collecting blood samples, no gloves and no protective suits. You probably wouldn't see this coming but pretty much everyone dies by the end of the movie.THE SHIMMER (mystery sci-fi music playing)The ominous journey starts off with a few uninspiring discoveries and builds up to the first serious face-off with danger. When a mutated alligator wreaks havoc on their camp culminating in a very rare happy ending the team's next logical step is to get on tiny boats and head right into the swamps, aka gator habitat. Somehow this trek doesn't turn sour only to set the stage up for the next threat, a bear attack that results in a death. The now team of four not even phased by the tragedy ventures right into the jungle, aka bear habitat, just to ensure their teammate had been indeed killed. You hope for the situation to get better, partly because of the high ratings, but we are only at the tip of the iceberg because virtually every challenge in this movie is met with the most insane proposal.Half-way in you suddenly realize that that one character who is present in every movie who doubts everyone and turns against the team only to be killed is absent here. Just as you begin to appreciate this refreshing departure from cliches, on the suspicion of being lied to Thorensen the medic girl viciously knocks her surviving mates out and ties them to chairs, right in the middle of the night, in the most terrifying building where even predators would say their prayers before entering. Right when this lunatic is about to cut open the guts of her teammates, surprise surprise, the killer bear shows up and for target practice obliterates the medic. The beast then walks back to the main lobby where the three remaining ladies are still tied up and gently strolls in front of them as if about to give a speech on the effects of consumerism on global warming. Unfortunately right before making its second kill the wild instructor gets shot at by a bad student and dies.Having been rid of the foul mouthed drama queen the team is finally presented with the much needed peace to work together, make smarter choices, and move forward hopefully without sacrificing any more lives. Of course nothing happens correctly in this movie and for absolutely no reason the physicist character Radek just starts wandering into the jungle, and Lena despite running like a coyote cannot catch up to the turtle-speed Radek who by the way was 3 steps away from her before taking off!! How this scene made it past editing is beyond me.You might ask, gee isn't there a leader in charge of this broken team? Well, as a display of strong leadership Dr. Ventress has abandoned her team and is nowhere to be found.The movie reaches its climax when Lena enters the infested lighthouse and discovers a tape from her husband who demonstrates the mysterious powers of, of all things a phosphorous grenade against the corporeal forms inside The Shimmer. Confident that she's learned all there is to the ET Disney Land Lena goes for one last leap, into a hole in the wall leading to a bizarre underground hideout. There she meets Dr. Ventress who is in the middle of some ritual and about to be transformed into the alien that everyone has been waiting to meet. Our newly born human-like creature mirrors Lena's movements like a doppelgänger. When she moves it moves, and when she fights it fights, but when a phosphorous grenade with its pin pulled is placed in its hand the alien suddenly inherits Lena's appearance. What?! At this moment Lena makes a run toward the door, but the alien just stands there with the grenade in its hand waiting to be eviscerated! Just like a guy who's been raving about his stamina for 2 hours only to finish in under 5 minutes because he doesn't know how to do it right, the movie builds up to this climactic point and presents us with the ultimate superpower and then conveniently pretends it didn't happen. In absence of a convincing explanation one can only conclude that the alien must have forgotten about its mirroring duties due to a sudden submission to Alzheimer's disease!This movie is supposed to be an ode to self-destruction, but everything it does is flat-out laughable. Honestly just the computer-generated mutations alone would make you rightfully wonder about the very positive reviews that the movie has been receiving. I mean in a day and age when top dollar gets you mesmerizing animations the sight of two deers having the physics of gummy bears who hop around in the most unrealistic form warrants a minimum 3 point deduction! Yet as of today the movie has a Metascore of 79%. My guess is, of the $40M total budget $10M was paid to the actors, about $6 to the SFX team, and the remaining $30M was spent on buying reviews.",Annihilation

1947,daniellecruzer,Mind-altering!,10,4 April 2018,"Annihilation (2018) is a very intense, off the wall sci-fi movie that is filled with death, love, stunning visuals, and a bit of horror. The best part about Annihilation is that there is an all-female lead cast which is really significant and sends a statement considering the circumstances in Hollywood pertaining to gender. Not only are they bad ass women but they are also smart women who are each a different type of scientist, and that isn't something we see too often in these types of movies or in movies at all. I give Annihilation 10 out of 10 stars for keeping me entertained throughout the entirety of it and for making me want to read the novel that it is based off of. Usually I read the book and then watch the movie but that wasn't the case for Annihilation. If the movie is this good then the book has the be mind-blowing. 
 I really enjoyed the way Director Alex Garland set up the story, he cuts between past and present scenes throughout the movie. He gives us the background of Lena, the main character of the movie, and the life she is living as a biologist professor at Johns Hopkins. She hasn't seen or heard from her husband in a year. He shows up and it's as if his memory has been completely wiped away. His health starts to deteriorate quickly and the government takes Kane and Lena to Area X and she learns of ""the shimmer"" This is where the movie starts to get mind-altering, almost hallucinatory. 
 The shimmer is a place that defies the laws of nature, is drenched in colors and is visually striking. Garland makes the shimmer seem like a place of fantasy and a place that you would want to spend time in until something very dark emerges. That dark is the unknown and a place that is changing at a fast rate. There are flowers that are all the same species but very different looking. The animals that were once normal are evolving into monsters that have never been seen. In the very first scary scene there is an alligator that looks like an alligator but isn't quite like the alligators we are used to seeing. Not only is everything around them changing but they are changing as well. The group of women have to deal with this prism that refracts everything, with their own minds and if they can trust each other or not which is pretty great to watch because I think most people would feel the same way. 
I believe a soundtrack can make or break a movie and Annihilation's soundtrack definitely made the movie. The darkest parts are accompanied by equally dark music. Not only are we seeing some pretty horrific scenes we are hearing music that helps those goosebumps run from head to toe. Music that makes you feel as if you are actually there experiencing every bit of the shimmer. The music was never over used but used at just the right times, filled with intensity and made you feel disoriented. The swimming pool scene is by far one of the creepiest and the music really contributes to that creepiness, like nails on a chalkboard. In this scene we see the body of a man, who was part of a previous group that entered the shimmer, stuck up on the wall of the deep end of a swimming pool. The music we hear in this scene is not really music at all but more like an alarm that gets louder and louder as we see this body that has mutated in to something very out of this world.
There's nothing worse than watching a movie with terrible acting, especially when you pay to see it in a theater. The acting in Annihilation is good and Natalie Portman does an excellent job in my opinion. I have seen a few movies she has done in the past where I thought she didn't do too well (Where the Heart Is) but she blew me away in Annihilation, she makes you feel like you aren't watching a movie. One scene that I think she did incredibly well in is the scene when she gets to the lighthouse and the humanoid emerges from the hole in the wall. She is watching this humanoid mimic her but it's a CGI character. She moves beautifully and makes it seem like the humanoid isn't CGI at all but rather a real person.
Gareth Edwards Monsters (2010) has a similar plot to Annihilation's but one is far better than the other. The quality of Annihilation out weights Monsters by far. I'm sure budget has something to do with this but I was quite bored while watching Monsters, and I was on the edge of my seat, beginning to end while watching Annihilation. Garland gives us just the right amount of background on the main characters and Edwards' entire movie is focused entirely on the background. If I am going to watch a sci-fi movie about aliens I want to see more of the aliens. There's nothing wrong with a little romance in a sci-fi movie but that's all I saw in Monsters.
Garland is giving us more questions than answers in Annihilation and I like movies like this because they keep us talking after the movie has ended. I watched this movie with my significant other and we left the theater with a bizarre feeling that's almost impossible to put into words, like a disconnect between mind and body and not unlike the otherworldly sensation of tripping on mushrooms. We talked about the movie for the entirety of our thirty-minute drive home and I think that says a lot about how well this movie is made. If you are in to sci-fi movies that are filled with great acting, great music, great visuals, and a great story then you will most likely enjoy Annihilation.",Annihilation

I was not sure if I wanted to continue watching; logically after mutated flowers, mutated animals would naturally follow mutated humans and I am not interested in watching horror movies. The suspicion was confirmed by a rather gruesome pool scene and the movie on the camera. Fortunately it never descents into full-blown horror movie and it remains stylish.The scenes are beautiful yet bizarre. It reminds more of big budget music video by Tool with a dash of Evolution and Doom 3. It would not surprise me if Garland is a fan of the band.

1967,padme-63866,Thought Provoking and Beautiful,8,25 April 2018,"Days after watching this film it still sticks with me. It is a film that will keep you thinking even several days after watching it. Annihilation has successfully created a new environment and has put you into this world. If you are not one who likes to think during the movie this it not for you, this film will leave you questioning everything. This is also a film that will leave you with more questions than answers.Annihilation is about a biologist, Lena, whose husband has mysteriously return from a military mission, but soon falls ill. Lena then finds out his team was deployed in the Shimmer, an alien barrier that has genetically mutated all organisms that are inside or enter. She then joins the next all female team in which they discover many disturbing facts along the journey that makes them have bad judgments throughout their mission.What I love about this Sci-Fi film is that it tackles heavier subjects, such as depression, loss, and betrayal, unlike most science based films. Even better it connects the science of the film to these subjects. Throughout the film they talk about how genes code for destruction and that is what happens to us we destroy ourselves. Another thing this film does amazing is the display. Everything from the visuals, audio, and suspense will take you into this world. The best way to describe it is dream-like. The ending scenes will leave you stun, because of the soundtrack that makes you feel insane for a moment to the visuals that whirl around the screen.How can I forget Natalie Portman's performance. Her face tells everything in this movie. Her facial expressions are a major part of her performance and she nailed everyone. She did really well in this and can't wait to see more!

And after reading their comments, I found out that, yes, there are a lot that you would say were illogical. However, when I was watching, I didn't pay attention to those because I already had an overall sense of what it would be about and they are not really the focus of the film. It's not a film focusing on the plot, nor story nor an adventure, but ideas. So even though there were things that don't make sense, they didn't bother me at all.Some said it ""pretend to be deep"" or something like that. I don't think so.

The only thoughts provoked to me personally from this particular movie is ""I am bored"". This was in no way thought provoking or mysterious but instead a regular Jason Voorhees, where each cast member is methodically killed off in almost completely irrelevant scenes. In fact nothing in this whole movie was completely unexpected, which is a real shame. Unrealistc representations of pseudo soldiers, an insignificant handful of undertrained medical ""experts"" (That don't relay understanding of the simplist biologies) are sent direcly into first line contact with an unknown entitiy. Where is the rest of the world? Where are the tens of thousands of soldiers that would have had the whole thing cordened, even if the damn shimmer was the size of the country?

1988,redmarshall-68320,Just Because it Has Trippy Effects Doesn't Mean It's Like 2001,3,24 August 2018,"I love smart, cerebral science fiction, and that is what I expected this movie to be, based on what I'd heard about it. That's not what this is. If I'd gone in expecting a dumb monster movie with cool effects, I might have enjoyed it a lot more. I saw it with my dad, who complained (frequently) that it's practically an uncredited remake of Stalker (1979), a Russian movie which does the same tricks but better. I haven't seen Stalker yet, so I won't get into that.The plot and character motivations lack focus, much like the narrative time-line. The repetitive flashbacks are unnecessary at best and annoying at worst. I thought it might become totally chronologically unhinged, like in Enter the Void or Slaughterhouse 5, but the parts which take place in the Shimmer (the alien monster world) remain chronological, and stay focused enough to make the flash-forwards and flash-backs feel like a distraction. Everything to do with the characters doesn't work or is underdeveloped, and at least once it's openly misogynistic - two of the girls are supposed to have military training, but they never act like they're in enemy territory, or any kind of danger at all. They don't set up a watch or perimeter until they see the men's notes on how they did it, like as if female soldiers wouldn't have been trained on surviving in life-or-death situations. It establishes that the main character, played by Natalie Portman, is a doctor, whose husband is the only person to escape the Shimmer. He sustains massive organ failure and shock in doing so, and even after she says out loud that her husband's illness could be caused by radiation or a virus, they never wear any protective gear, or discuss why they aren't. This is also after scenes where people wear HAZMAT suits to interact with her husband, but she doesn't, and after we see scenes where people wear HAZMAT suits to interact with her, in the flash-forwards after she escapes. It would make sense if they were purposefully trying to infect her and her team, which I suspected when Jennifer Jason Leigh's character said she had a secret mission she wasn't sharing (like in Alien), but at the ending of the movie she reveals that wasn't what was going on at all.I thought they might be pregnant with monsters after the four day blackout, like in Village of the Damned, because of a scene where they discuss being an all female team, but of course, that didn't happen. The fact that they're all women bears no significance to the story, and, frankly, neither does them being scientists. The few scientific observations they make could have been made by a high school freshman who paid attention in their biology lessons. It isn't hard to talk to scientists and doctors about science fiction to find out what their observations might be, but the writer, Alex Garland, obviously couldn't be assed. She doesn't even take her blood and look at it with her microscope until long after they had a four day blackout, after she gets mysterious bruises, which she would know were serious symptoms as a medical doctor, and after they knew everyone who went before them got killed, except for one guy, who was in critical condition. Now, these things could have largely been explained by establishing that the Shimmer was making them feel like they were high or tripping (like, apparently, in Stalker), but they never discuss feeling funny, or otherwise act strange in ways that would make that clear. It would, again, be easy to write a scene that shows they're all tripping too hard to think clearly, and would have made the movie more fun. It's mentioned in the ""debriefing"" flash-forwards that Portman stayed for months longer than she had rations for, and it could have further explained the weird behavior if they'd run out of rations and eaten plants or animals within the Shimmer. It would would have worked as a reference to both fairy tales and psychedelic drugs, but the subject was dropped right after it was mentioned, like nearly every opportunity for interesting writing.It's hard to stress enough the ways in which the writing doesn't make realistic sense in any of the ways it's expected to. There's a scene where Jennifer Jason Leigh's character is supposed to be keeping watch for monsters, and she not only has a bright lamp spotlighting her, but also is reading by it, and not watching at all. She does this when her character is supposed to be ex-military. You're not even supposed to light three cigarettes to a match in enemy territory, let alone have a lamp on you. When they do get attacked by a monster, because she wasn't watching, they, again, never talk about it or discuss it at all. There are lots of dialogue scenes in this movie, too many, in fact, but never the right ones. There's thirty minutes of exposition at the beginning of the movie before it even gets to monsterland, and Garland still couldn't find a way to write personality or clear motivations into his characters.He pulls his punches repeatedly with the horror movie elements, as well. When in the Shimmer, they find a video of Portman's husband (Oscar Isaac) cutting open the guts of one of his team members to reveal snakey, monster-guts. The paramedic character is inexplicably grossed out by the gore, which is amazing - like, honest to God, had Garland ever met a paramedic? But I digress - they then find the guy's body all blown up into fungus on a wall in a super-creepy way. I fully expected him to have characters go all Tetsuo the Iron Man after that, but, you know, with lichen or whatever. What he did instead was show a couple of the girls with weird bruises, twice. I think once a special effect changed someone's finger print, but it was so subtle I couldn't see it on my TV, and I have a big TV. After Tetsuo, The Thing, Alien, Akira - and, hell, The Andromeda Strain, there's just no excuse for getting military and medical stuff wrong in science fiction, and no excuse for chickening out on body and medical horror.The acting is a real problem, too, and certainly doesn't help the piss-poor character development. Almost all the lead actors are people I like in other movies, particularly Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac, but everyone's lines are delivered in this weird mumbling monotone, which is just bad directing - shocking, of course, since the same guy wrote and directed it. I could hardly understand a thing the characters said, and when I turned the volume up the sound effects were deafening. This movie also features the least sexy sex scene in any movie I have ever seen, and it involves Natalie Portman. Seriously, HOW DO YOU MESS THAT UP?Alex Garner, the writer/director, also doesn't seem to understand he's supposed to be entertaining the audience - there is hardly a single joke in the entire movie, except for the lesbian girl hitting on Natalie Portman. Of course, he doesn't follow through on that character being an aggressively flirtatious lesbian at all, so I forgot about it pretty much immediately, which is impressive, because I love lesbians - like I said before, none of the character stuff works at all. The main character has zero personality outside of missing her man when he's gone. She's a doctor, but that never plays in any of her behavior. In a flashback scene she tells her husband she has a life, and doesn't just pine after him while he's away, but all we ever see her do is pine after him and refuse to socialize. It's ridiculous.I liked the deer, though.",Annihilation

1994,cmacdonald-86907,It all makes sense -- They were on drugs!,4,9 July 2018,"First of all, let me say that the film was dazzling from a visual perspective -- at least in the second half, which played out like some bizarre music video. The CGI seemed pretty high quality and everything was over-saturated and shot through with rainbow colors in a way that I found pleasing. That's about all I can say in favor of the film, so let's get into the negative side.
Annihilation is one of those films where the completely illogical, incompetent behavior of the characters is the only thing that propels the plot. I won't go into detail when it comes to all the logical inconsistencies because plenty of others have already, but suffice it to say that this is one where you'll be yelling at the screen in frustration.
If anyone reading is familiar with psychedelic drugs I think you'll agree that this whole mess of a film starts to make a lot of sense when viewed as a trip gone wrong. The characters start out sane enough, as does the world around them, but they soon become disoriented and confused. The distortions in the world around them are very similar to the visual side of an acid trip as well, starting with saturated colors and rainbow shimmers and leading up to the disturbing sight of the skin on their hands rippling and moving in front of their eyes -- something that anyone who's been to a Grateful Dead concert has probably experienced at some point. The film culminates in what could be seen as an episode of ego-death, with the characters who survive to the peak of the trip losing all sense of their own identity and dealing with it in separate ways: one character feels an exalted sense of oneness, another freaks out because he says he can't handle it, and another has an intense out-of-body experience.
Do I actually think that the whole movie was some kind of allegory for the psychedelic experience? Not really, I think it was just a poorly executed sci-fi film with decent visual effects. I know mental degradation was part of the plot, but it was never explained in any satisfactory way. I thought the whole thing was much more enjoyable viewed as a truly epic ""bad trip,"" adding a much-needed change of tone and making the manic bumbling of the characters a lot more tolerable. Try looking at it that way if you like, it might save you two hours of frustration.",Annihilation
1995,ht101,Alex Garland as writer/director failed miserably,1,20 July 2018,"This film is supposed to be a ""biology thriller"" but the plot and the way the director Alex Garland handles the ""thriller"" part is pathetic. Splice (2009) was another ""biology thriller"" that comes to mind written and directed by Vincenzo Natali. Although that film got only a 5.8/10 imdb rating, in my view the way the director handled its plot was amazingly masterful. The point I'm trying to make here is this: It doesn't really matter if a plot is highly improbable, inconsistent, or downright scientifically unsound, as long as it can keep you at the edge of your seat. After all this is just science fiction and entertainment, not a biology dissertation. It all boils down to what the director can actually do. In my opinion Alex Garland can't do much.",Annihilation

1998,Stright2thePoint,Don't believe anyone who gave this a higher review,4,13 August 2018,"The first 35 minutes is genius, it kept me very intrigued. Midway through it lost steam. By the final 40 minutes it went straight to the dogs. If you are in desperate need of a Sci-fi flick then maybe you can tolerate it.For some reason my biggest question and concern would be how did this seemingly random team of 5 women just mosey on into the anomaly aka The Shimmer? ... I mean the main protagonist wasn't currently enlisted in the military and just seemed to join the group. The whole time I was thinking if something like this actually happened the government would be all over it. Certain protocol and training would be required to go on such a mission. They literally just walked up to the force field wall thing aka ""The Shimmer"" with no radio contact or anything and just went on in.",Annihilation
1999,vistascan-48249,Unsettling questions in a sci-fi package,8,13 August 2018,"To put it simply, Annihilation is a sci-fi film with an all female cast. Natalie Portman is in the lead as the grieving wife of an army man who vanished a year ago after going on a mission. Herself, a former soldier, she is now a professor of biology at Johns Hopkins. The weirdness begins when her husband shows up at her house with no memory of how he got there, only to inexplicably fall sick. As events unfold, we are told that there is a mysterious area in a certain part of the world called ""The Shimmer"", which is growing, but anyone sent in to collect information about it never returns. The movie is about the harrowing journey to uncover the mystery of this area as five women, including Lena, head into it. This is a sci-fi movie, and saying more would give away the plot too much.The rest of the cast is made up of Natalie Portman (Lena) ,Jennifer Jason Leigh (Dr. Ventress), Gina Rodriguez (Anya), and Tuva Novotny (Sheppard), all of whom play characters with specialized backgrounds that make them suitable for being involved in this mission, and all of them have their personal reasons to venture into this dangerous area. Portman does a brilliant job in portraying Lena's grief and regrets, and the way she carries on with a steely determination despite it all, hiding her constant vulnerability under a stoic mask.Jennifer Jason Leigh portrays Dr. Ventress with a coldness that evident from the first time she walks into the frame. That coldness and cynical determination is maintained throughout the movie. Dr. Ventress is a character who clearly doesn't have much to care for, and yet her mission is important enough to consume all other priorities. The rest of the cast feels a bit unexplored in a sense. It feels like we should have gotten to know the remaining three members of the team in a much better way that we do, but perhaps this would have been impossible without stretching out the film to unrealistic lengths. We do get hints about all the characters from which we can extrapolate, but that is something left to the viewers. The two men, Oscar Issac (Kane), and David Gyasi (Daniel) are ancillary characters. While they do play their roles effectively, it is a refreshing change to see the female characters be in the forefront in a movie that's not about shoes or weddings. The movie has been called an allegory for depression, grief, loss, and regret. It is indeed, that, but it also feels like a journey into nature, realizing that nature can be in equal parts, both peaceful and terrifying; both beautiful and grotesque. Much like the life of Lena, where she is haunted by the things she had that she lost, and the things she may yet lose, unless she risks everything to preserve them. Throughout the film, this unavoidable fact of her life keeps chasing her just as surely as the threats inside this zone. The film also plays with questions of change and identity, subtly shaking our confidence in the familiar concepts such as our knowledge of ourselves, our knowledge of our motivations and our desires and our ideals, and in the end, the concreteness of our reality.Just as a disclaimers, I should say there are parts in the movie that are beautiful, and parts that are deeply disturbing. This is not a movie children can enjoy. The ending of the film, like many sci-fi films is open to interpretation. It certainly seems like this is by design, as the whole movie is about questions. Questions about paths not taken, things left unsaid, decisions made only to be regretted, identity and constancy, and so on. Annihilation is a moving film wrapped in a beautiful sci-fi package.",Annihilation

2006,elephantsareorange,Captivating,9,8 December 2019,"This is not hyperbole, it may be one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I am a Cinematic arts student at Central Michigan university, and this film displays everything we're taught to look for.The sound effects are enthralling and the music is excellent as well.
The plot is one that's easy to understand (especially for the Si-Fi genre), but the story is told in such a way that makes you unable to look away.
The characterization was done with great detail, although I would have liked more from Dr. Ventress, and the acting was perfectly executed.
The visual effects are probably the crowning achievement of this film. They must be seen to be appreciated.
The directing and editing was done so well that the movie was able to make time jumps without losing the viewer in slightest.
The themes and symbols (duplication, reflection, growth, destruction, mutation) that were present in the film never overshadowed the story, but only added to the drama and suspense of the experience.
The dialogue was mostly believable, except at times during the character breakdowns. But the messages the characters sent were genuine and believable in such a way that one could insert themselves into the story.TLDR: Incredibly suspenseful. Terrifying, but not enough to make me want to look away. Almost perfectly complete film.",Annihilation
2007,wanjikubmonica,Impact made!,10,16 December 2018,"Incredibly thrilling movie. Beautifully done filmmaking that naturally brings out the horror in the story. True sci-fi; basically mind bending and imaginative as a sci-fi film should be. Great characters that just suck you into this visceral world they are in and make you realize how complex human psyche behaves basically when it comes to self preservation. You understand that primal wants, that are so incredibly driving for a human being, are not the extent of consciousness because annihilation makes you ponder at great extent about the underlying subject.",Annihilation

2017,pierre-55105,About cultural marxism and todays relativity,10,2 January 2019,"True, when I was watching this it was just another horror sci-fi movie to me with cool effects. However, it stuck with me for quite some time and now almost a year later I realize what it was all about.Today it seems like so many people are looking at the world with their subjective eyes without any regard to the objective. I mean, people are saying that gender is fluid.. it's whatever. The art of our modern day looks like someone just took a dump on a lawn. It makes me think of the triptych painting ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" by Bosch, painted around 1500. It shows humanity's three stages of birth, bloom and decay. In the decay parts looks just like this movie in a way where humans have morphed into whatever..I'll end this review with a quote (this is the internet after all):

2018,flux-05953,Loved it,10,6 January 2019,"Woo. What a film. I knew nothing, not even its genre. Just that it had a high rotten tomatoes score. It started slow. I became impatient at parts. I considered skipping some parts. What is this about. The moment I became hooked? When her husband turns up dazed and confused. He starts convulsing blood. Is this a zombie film? No. We are shown ""The Shimmering"". What on earth is this? Delight.
The film takes off. I still reserve doubts about what they can show will shock. But it grows. It stands out in its originality but still has moments that remind of other films. One involving a monster that doesn't eat you if you don't move. Jurassic Park?
More than this is the film revolves around the idea we are all created with biological need to ""self-destruct"" in one way or another. This idea plays out when an alien crash lands in a lighthouse and does things differently. It is not a being in the sense of you or me but like a new compiler. Refactoring nature's code.
Perhaps this could have been better explored than through Lena's (Natalie Portman) affair. It brings affairs as a self-destructive thing coded into us. So in a way the film is more human/relatable than this cool alien thing that crashed landed into a lighthouse and makes everything trippy. Which is the part I loved.",Annihilation

2023,esaliya,A waste of time,1,11 March 2019,"OK, the movie starts good giving us some mystery to think about. Then that's it, beyond that is just a fruitless effort to keep viewers excited.Things I really don't understand.1. If no one came from the shimmer, why the heck didn't you try to put your foot back the moment you put it in just to check if that works?2. If radio signals are jammed, did you try any old style methods like shooting an arrow with a message tied to it? It sure seems physical things can cross the shimmer boundary?3. What's the role of the team lead Dr Ventress. She seems like a psycho from the beginning and, sure enough, her role ends like that too.4. In a world where everyone uses sanitizers daily, the expert team is not afraid to touch the dead, the fungi, the water. Wow, they must have some super powers, I guess.The list goes on an on.

It truly rose the rating I initially was planning to give.About the logic , personally I enjoy a movie with sound logic , I may close my eyes on a few ones,as they may be small.But this movie is just full of plot and logic holes.If you are a person that enjoys movie plots to details and is just a mediocre Sci-Fi film fan , I do not recommend to see this movie ,as it may be a waste of time.Now if you are a fan of visuals and Sci-fi well then you are in for a treat.

2026,stephenroughley-28818,Misunderstood. Beautiful. Intimate.,10,19 January 2019,"This film has created an awful lot of confusion here. There is no arguing that the film is a masterpiece. I think where the confusion lies is in the nature of the film. It is not strictly a sci-fi despite having been sold as such. The film uses sci-fi and horror to tell an intimate, human story of change and growth through allegory. If you do not like films that explore metaphysics or philosophical questions through allegory (the fountain, black swan, 2001) then you may very well dislike or misinterpret this film. The people here identifying 'logical' holes in the film have completely missed what the film is doing. Any focus on realism here is moot. The practicalities are irrelevant. This is a classical use of tropes to test and examine motivations along the lines of Samuel Beckett etc. This is not classical sci-fi and if you are not prepared to let go of your relationship with typical films and probe the human questions being presented then you'll at the very least miss the intention of the film. Even if you don't want to examine the film's message, just let go of your preconceptions and rules and enjoy what is a beautiful film.",Annihilation

At first I thought, great another great movie with a horrible alien ending. However that could not be further from the truth. In the days since watching I have found it to be so multilayered that there is so much you can miss. In the end I came to realize this. People go into the Shimmer broken some part of them lost. However the minute you enter you become part of something larger. Kane returns to Lena a new person than he was he left her broken aND unsure and returns a clean slate. After Lena enters and come back out, she is the same ready for something new. The past is gone. As it turns out the Shimmer refract DNA. What does that mean? It's a different veiw, we see the same thing but in a different place of a different way. It's only when Lena leaves the Shimmer that Kane heals because the Shimmer made them the same and without eachoker they could not go on. The fight at the end is a metaphor for what Lena was going through. Literally fighting with herself over what she had done and only once she stopped fighting and accepted what she had done was she able to escape but never the same.",Annihilation
