0,TheLittleSongbird,Both romantic and glamorous,9,22 February 2011,"I love Ghost. It is a film that manages to be both romantic and glamorous, sometimes even at the same time. And it also manages to mix the sentimental and the supernatural wonderfully. The production values are great, the special effects are a treat and the costumes, lighting, sets and cinematography are top drawer.The soundtrack also fits accordingly. Unchained Melody is a touching song and used to great effect here. The script is of good quality, and the story has a great premise with a poignant love-beyond-the-grave theme and a ending that proves that pure schmaltz actually does work. Jerry Zucker's direction is very good.I love the performances too. Patrick Swayze gives one of his best performances as the murdered banker who tries to warn his girlfriend that she is in danger. Demi Moore isn't as good, in fact she is just okay to start with but gets better through the course of the movie. It is Whoopi Goldberg who steals the show in a performance that is outstanding, her presence doesn't jar at all and livens up what could have been a maudlin atmosphere.All in all, a great film with a great premise and worth seeing for Swayze and Goldberg. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Ghost
1,bkoganbing,"""Godspeed Your Love To Me""",8,8 December 2009,"If nothing else the popularity of the film Ghost guaranteed a revival of that great love song Unchained Melody. It's always a pleasure when good music is heard on the airways and we have Ghost to thank for this little treasure making a comeback.Ghost also provided Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore with a couple of career roles as a typical yuppie couple settling in Tribeca when tragedy strikes one of them. But as it turns out, that's only the beginning of the story.If you were to describe Ghost I guess the best way you could describe it would be a drama/fantasy with some humorous moments, mostly as a result of the casting of Whoopi Goldberg as a fake psychic. But she comes into the story in the middle of the film. Patrick and Demi, those brat pack alumni are now eager young urban professionals, Demi makes and sells her own pottery and Patrick works in a bank, in the high end area of one, he's not just a teller. When we meet them they are starting to fix up their Tribeca loft with one of Swayze's co-workers, Tony Goldwyn.But one fateful night after seeing a performance of MacBeth, Swayze is killed as a result of a street mugging. But was it just that, a simple robbery? Not by a longshot and Swayze who was killed before his time is angry enough to stay on Earth and find out what really happened.Of course he needs an ally and that's where Whoopi comes in. Turns out that there might be a little truth in her advertising as a spiritualist and consultant to the dead. Good enough for Whoopi to win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, the other Oscar Ghost won was for original screenplay.But you won't forget Patrick and Demi as a pair of literal starcrossed lovers. You also know that the universal fates will reunite them because people who care for each other as much as they did aren't destined to stay apart.I do so love Unchained Melody. Introduced originally by blues singer Al Hibbler in the Fifties it got a revival a decade later by the Righteous Brothers. Tony Bennett also recorded a fine version and after his death a previously unreleased version of it was put out by Bing Crosby's estate. It's a perfect song for the theme for Swayze and Moore.One of the best love stories of the last decade of the last century, despite the tragedy that takes place, Ghost is one feel good motion picture.",Ghost
2,Leofwine_draca,It somehow works despite the schmaltz,8,21 July 2016,"Jerry Zucker, who previously had directed such comedies as AIRPLANE! and TOP SECRET, turned to drama for the first time in this gentle romance which has much going for it. Although it has literally tons of sentimentality and schmaltzy love scenes, these are all handled rather effectively by the director; even though Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore aren't the world's greatest actors they handle their roles efficiently.This reviewer may even have shed a tear or two during the endless heartbreaking moments. However, leaving the mush aside for a moment, the special effects in this film are the main reason for watching, done by none other than Industrial Light & Magic, who would later go on to helm big budget modern hits like TERMINATOR 2.The scenes of Swayze, in ghost form, walking through doors and people are done very effectively, as are the scenes of heaven which are predominant in the final scenes. However the best special effects are the shadows, creatures which come from the darkness to drag those who have committed vile sins in life down to hell. These creatures make really scary noises and are quite unnerving, especially if you're watching at night all alone.With lots of action sequences (the one where Swayze chases his murderer through a building and then the street, using his newly found powers to strike him repeatedly, being the standout) and another excellent scene involving a subway ghost, who is initially frightening but turns out to be okay after all, GHOST is a pleasing combination of romance, comedy, thriller, fantasy and mystery for the hanky brigade. Deservedly winning a number of Oscars (for the special effects), GHOST is a surprising delight, a mainstream film which isn't so bad after all.",Ghost
3,SnoopyStyle,Movie classic,8,2 October 2013,"Sam (Patrick Swayze) and Molly (Demi Moore) are a happy loving couple. Molly wants to get marry, but Sam just can't seem to say I love you. All he could come up with is Ditto. One night he gets shot in a mugging. He's trapped as a ghost when he refused to go into the light. The mugger breaks into their apartment, and Molly's life is again in danger. Tony Goldwyn plays their friend and Sam's co-worker. Whoopi Goldberg plays a medium that Sam tries to communicate with.This movie has elements of romance and thriller. It doesn't get more romantic than the pot making sequence. It's almost too iconic in movie history for its own good. Sam's murder provides the mystery thriller. And Whoopi injects a little bit of controlled humor. The movie is now a classic.",Ghost
4,Hitchcoc,Worth Watching Just to Watch Whoopie!,8,23 June 2014,"With an opportunity to see the Broadway production of the musical, I thought it would be good to revisit the original with my family. I saw this in a movie theater on its first run and came away with some mixed feelings. I guess if you accept the premise that one can be caught in a kind of purgatory, stuck between heaven and hell, then you can also accept that there are demons that come up from hell and pull the bad guys down. I thought that a less clichéd view of the spiritual cosmos and not a hackneyed Dante-esque one would have been more effective, but then I have no belief in fire pits and angels playing harps. The story itself is quite fun with Patrick Swayze killed so that his trusted colleague can embezzle money, using accounts Swayze has access to. Swayze lives with Demi Moore (who is a knockout) and they have had trouble committing. Once dead, he is able to move about and observe all that is happening. He also becomes part of a fraternity of dead people stuck in the same place (apparently, they haven't settled their scores). As he watches he realizes that his lover is in danger from his murderer and his ""friend."" Swayze engages a medium, played by Whoopie Goldberg in an Academy Award performance, to try to connect with Demi. She can hear him, but can't see him. It takes time for him to break down the barriers of distrust and apprehension (what would we do?). He learns from one of the other dead guys how to make things move through mental effort, and he uses this to his advantage. Of course, one has to mention the famous scene with the sculpting of the gigantic phallic symbol while the Righteous Brothers sing ""Unchained Melody."" The other memorable scene is the one where Whoopie is in the bank and Swayze is telling her what to say as she withdraws four million dollars from an account. It's certainly worth a look if you've not seen it.",Ghost
5,mark.waltz,So much power in the truest emotion of eternal love.,9,27 March 2014,"You have to be pretty darn cynical to dislike this spiritual romantic drama that shows you don't have to expose breasts or buttocks to have a box-office winner that today remains a modern classic. It is a story of good vs. evil, a story of redemption and a story of what can bring about the damnation of the soul. The story focuses on two attractive young adults (Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore), so obviously in love, that even sudden tragedy can't end. Moore, at her softest and loveliest, is an aspiring sculptor, and Swayze is her Wall Street broker fiancée. Their closest friend (Tony Goldwyn) is supposedly their biggest supporter, but the fates prove otherwise. When Swayze is shot and killed in a botched robbery, he is immediately separated from the physical but remains on earth as part of a mission to protect Moore from on-going evils. Swayze locates a fake spiritualist (Whoopie Goldberg) whom he quickly realizes can hear everything he says and haunts her until she promises to help him warn the woman he loves.""You in danger, girl"", the Oscar Winning Goldberg tells her, and the skeptical Moore must fight reality and her need for communication from Swayze in order to go on with her life. The truth comes out quickly for the eternally awake Swayze who learns quickly the facts about being a ghost, first from a kindly old man whose spirit roams a hospital, and then from the angry ghost who fell off a train. The trains here are as much a character as Swayze, Moore and Goldberg are, tooting their horns as if a warning of evil premonitions. The J train/Myrtle Avenue stop is the location for where Swayze locates both his killer and Goldberg, and you can see him at various other New York City stops, learning the powers of being among the walking dead and jumping from moving train to moving train in order to locate the seemingly sinister ghost who initially screamed at him to ""Get off my train!"".Then, there's Tony Goldwyn, playing one of the great villains of movie history, showing that a lifetime of loyalty only can go so far in surviving the Wall Street game. Rick Aviles is his sinister partner in crime, a character so vile that you can't wait for him to get his come- uppance. That comes so suddenly and horrifically that the sensitive spiritual best be warned. It opens a lot of room for talk about what is beyond our control outside of the world we see around us and what makes for righteous and what makes for ruthlessness and selfishly motivated ambition. Aviles was a versatile actor who could play more than just a New York street thug, showing great sensitivity as a homeless man who shows kindness to Danny Glover and Matt Dillon in the underrated ""The Saint of Fort Washington"". As for Goldberg, she brings both a sense of her brilliant comic timing and subtle poignancy to the role of Ota Mae Brown, fake spiritualist who shows that underneath the facade of a life-long con-woman is a true beautiful human being. To watch her go from phony to fantastic is the stuff that retribution is made out of. Veteran character actor Phil Leeds is memorable as the first ghost Swayze encounters, while Vincent Schiavelli proves to be downright touching as the subway ghost, first frightening, then sadly vulnerable, an extraordinary cameo you won't forget.Swayze shows that a Wall Street broker doesn't have to be a ruthless cheat or a non-feeling corporate S.O.B., yet he isn't perfect either, as evidenced in the somewhat sick scene with Goldwyn on the elevator where they play a prank on the stone- faced passengers that is delicious payback for those of us who have dealt with corporate coldness and the evils of office politics. Moore is a total winner here, absolutely gorgeous, and the epitome of what a true lady is. Her sadness over loosing the love of her life never makes you feel sorry for her, but you empathize with her. Jerry Zucker, the man behind ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"" movies, proves to be a brilliant dramatic storyteller, even if he comically spoofed the famous ""Unchained Melody"" sequence in the first ""Naked Gun"". This is a story that everybody can find relatable, especially if you've gone through a tragic, sudden loss and need to find comfort in something more earthly than what any earthly being can tell you. The simple message is that grieving never completely goes away, but it gets better whenever the griever is ready for it to get better, in their own way and time.",Ghost
6,kosmasp,"Things to do in movies, when you're dead",8,9 August 2020,"Yes I used a title of a different movie (different genre even) as a summary line here. While I like that movie, I'm not even sure if it is that well known to be understood. But that is besides the point - thinking too much in general would be besides the point. Yes this is heavily flawed if you think about it (with the usual cliches and tropes, how can ghosts ""walk"" and more cliches like that) - so just don't. Either don't watch the movie if you think it's too cliche, too romantic (which it sort of is) or don't overthink it! Just enjoy the ride.Having said that, Patrick Swayze has to be so patient - of course his character is not able to accept ""reality"", but he as an actor not being actually able to interact with others for most of the movie ... tough, very tough. But also Kudos to Whoopi who made the movie what it is with her humor and what she brought to the character. Overall a very straightforward story, I'd argue no surprises (even if there are ""twists""), but more than decently told.",Ghost
7,gavin6942,You Know You Can't Give Up The Ghost,8,1 January 2006,"Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is gunned down by a Puerto Rican hit-man after stumbling upon a co-worker illegally funneling four million dollars into a fake account. His ghost then tries to avenge the murder and protect his girlfriend Molly, a young Demi Moore who looks like a 12-year old boy. Hilarity ensues when he recruits the worst actress ever, Whoopi Goldberg, to act as a medium between ghost and human world.One evening in January 2006, I had nothing better to do than watch ""Ghost"" on the ABC Family network with my sister. And I freely admit it sucked me in. This was my first time seeing the film since being considerably younger, though I recalled most of the plot. I re-watched the film yet again in October 2007 and August 2010.The real fun of the film begins when Swayze learns to touch the human world thanks to Vincent Schiavelli (a character actor who coincidentally died a week before my January 2006 viewing). Not unlike ""Ghost Dad"", the challenge is to make things happen in the world of the living while you remain dead. And unlike ""Beetlejuice"", you cannot come back by having someone say your name three times.The special effects in this film I always thought were pretty good by 1990 standards. The walking through walls looks fine, and the ""hell spirits"" (for lack of a better term) really scared me when I was younger (and even now are somewhat creepy). Sure, the microscope vision when he walks through doors and such is cheesy and was completely unnecessary, but it answers a question some viewers may have had about what ghosts see.I've heard physics people complain that Sam can go through walls and doors and other objects, yet is able to stand on the floor just fine, or even go up stairs. That is a really valid point... but let's just admit it: the plot would be less interesting if they had to deal with such limitations, or brought Sam back as a mere spirit with no shape.Quicker than you can say ""turn me on, dead man"" this film will work its way into your heart with a simple, romantic (yet somewhat action-packed) plot and classic song (""Unchained Melody""). You've probably already seen this movie a dozen times, but if not (if you're like my sister) you should see it soon.",Ghost
8,lee_eisenberg,An unchained melody of a film.,10,13 October 2005,"After so many movies have made ghosts look evil, it probably was about time for a good ghost. In ""Ghost"", Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is murdered, only to discover that he is now a ghost - and hubby Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) can't see or hear him. Feeling bummed, he comes across medium Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), who can hear him. Through these connections, Sam is able to protect Molly after he realizes that her life is in danger.""Ghost"" is the sort of movie that one would expect to be little more than a sappy mess. But they did a good job with it. Whoopi Goldberg seems to be having an especially good time with her role, for which she won a well deserved Oscar. And that pottery scene? Not only does it make one truly appreciate the existence of ""Unchained Melody"", but ""Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear"" spoofed it.One more thing. I saw ""Ghost"" right after I had just seen ""The Sixth Sense"". There are some interesting similarities between the two. The obvious one is that they're both about ghosts (maybe also that one stars Demi Moore and the other stars Bruce Willis). But dig this: one was released at the beginning of the '90s, the other at the end of the '90s, and they were both the second highest-grossing movies of their years. Oh well. Maybe I'm the only person who picked up on that. The point is, this is truly a classic.",Ghost
9,jboothmillard,Ghost,9,14 November 2006,"This film, with E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, gets me every time I watch the ending, I cannot help but cry, and it's always enjoyable, directed by Jerry Zucker (Airplane!, Ruthless People, Rat Race). Basically banker Sam Wheat (Golden Globe nominated Patrick Swayze) and potter Molly Jensen (Golden Globe nominated Demi Moore) are a couple truly in love, renovating a new apartment with Sam's friend Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn), their most passionate scene is them doing pottery together, while listening to the song ""Unchained Melody"" by The Righteous Brothers (number 19 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments). Sam discovers high balances in obscure bank accounts, Sam tells Carl he'll investigate, but that night, while walking home, Sam and Molly are mugged by a street thug, he pulls a gun and in the struggle shoots, out of his body Sam is shocked to discover his own dead body, he has become a ghost. Sam stays by Molly, trying to get to grips with his condition, he cannot be heard, seen or felt, he is later shocked when the thug that killed him walks into the house, looking for something, but Molly returns and Sam scares the cat to attack the thug, he flees his mission. Sam follows him through Brooklyn and discovers his name is Willie Lopez (Rick Aviles), he tells someone on the phone he will go back for what he was looking for later. Walking the streets Sam stumbles into a spiritual reading parlor, there he witnesses con artist Oda Mae Brown (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Whoopi Goldberg) posing as a medium, but as he mocks her he realises she has an actual gift when she can hear him, he convinces her of the danger that Molly is on and to warn her. Sam convinces Oda Mae to meet Molly in person, she is skeptical, only until she relays things only Sam would know, but hearing all the danger scares Oda Mae away, so Molly goes to the police, only for them to pull Oda Mae's record, convincing Molly she is a con artist and demands her to stay away from her. Molly tells Carl this information, he goes to visit Willie at the given address, but Sam following is surprised that they are working together, Sam was murdered to obtain his book of passwords to access the bank accounts and launder money. Sam getting angered by Carl trying to get close to Molly unintentionally knocks over a picture frame, he remembers encountering a poltergeist on the subway (Tomorrow Never Dies' Vincent Schiavelli) that can move things, Sam convinces him to teach him how to do the same, after learning these abilities he returns to Oda Mae and convinces her to help him withdraw the money in the fake name Carl had set up. Oda Mae does so, taking away $4 million, she endorses the money to charity to avoid being caught, Carl tries desperately to find the money, while Sam deliberately scares him, Carl goes to Molly, where she lest slip that she saw Oda Mae at the bank, and he pieces together what has happened. Willie returns looking to catch and kill Oda Mae, Sam prevents him by terrorising him and sends him into oncoming traffic, Willie is killed and like Same did earlier sees himself dead, and his ghost is grabbed by creatures in the shadows that drag him away screaming (presumably to hell). Sam returns to Molly's apartment with Oda Mae, she is finally convinced of Sam's ghost when he levitates a coin, and Oda Mae allows him to possess her body to feel Molly and share a slow dance. Carl interrupts, so Molly and Oda Mae flee onto the fire escape, in the loft under construction he catches Oda Mae, but Molly saves her, before being grabbed and threatened by Carl with a gun, Sam disarms him and chases him to the window, trying to throw a hook at Sam he shatters the glass, and Carl is impaled by the falling glass, he becomes a ghost, and like Willie is dragged away screaming by the dark creatures. Sam speaks to the women, Molly can hear him now, a heavenly light shines in the room and illuminates Sam, the two women see him, they realise it is time for him to go (presumably to heaven), Sam and Molly share a farewell kiss, he thanks Oda Mae for everything, and he finally tells Molly he has always loved her, to which she replies his own word he repeated to her many times, ""Ditto"", Sam then walks away into the light and disappears (this ending is number 5 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers). Also starring Armelia McQueen as Oda Mae's Sister, Gail Boggs as Oda Mae's Sister and Phil Leeds as Emergency Room Ghost. Swayze gives a surprisingly good performance as the title character, Moore is fantastic being innocent and emotional, Goldwyn is good as the snivelling villain, and Goldberg almost steals the show with her deserved Oscar winning turn as the psychic, with many comic moments. It is a film that delivers well- timed laughs and a witty script, and the supernatural element works well, with terrific special effects, it is dramatic, but most of its a sentimental but highly affectionate love story, a must see romantic drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Music for Maurice Jarre and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Make Up Artist, Best Original Screenplay and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 19 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, ""Unchained Melody"" was number 27 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, and it was number 76 on The Ultimate Film. Very, very good!",Ghost
10,ccthemovieman-1,"Language Spoils Touching, Entertaining Story",5,30 September 2006,"If it weren't for my pet peeve of using the Lord's name in vain, I would rate this film with high marks because it's very entertaining. It also has the winning combination of drama, suspense, romance and comedy all rolled into one. But 20 blasphemes in a PG-13 comedy?? That's ridiculous. Demi Moore looked as good as I've ever seen her and it was nice to see her play a nice character. Patrick Swayze and Whoopi Goldberg also entertain.This one had a real tear-jerking ending that was memorable. Without the ""language,"" this would be a very good movie.",Ghost
11,Tweekums,A super supernatural romance,8,22 September 2008,"I hadn't seen this film for many years but having watched it again I'm glad that I did as it was as entertaining as it was when I first saw it.The film opens with Sam and Molly moving into their new apartment, every thing seems to be going right for them; they are in love, he is a successful banker and they have a lovely home. Things go wrong in the worst way possible when he is killed by a mugger as they return from an evening at the theatre. From the title of the film you probably guessed that this isn't the end of him. As a ghost he follows Molly home and soon learns that his mugging wasn't as random as it first appeared when the mugger breaks in to his home and starts looking for something. Unfortunately for him, with the exception of being able to scare the cat, he can't interact with the world of the living, luckily however when he follows the mugger he encounters a medium who can hear what he says. She is rather alarmed at this as up until now she believed herself to be a fraud. He persuades her to contact Molly to warn her about the mugger's plans to return but not surprisingly Molly isn't impressed with her story.With Sam dead his best friend Carl starts seeing more and more of Molly, first to comfort her then later he tries to seduce her. Sam understandably loses his temper and in doing so knocks over a photograph, an ability he didn't know he had. Earlier on his travels he had met another ghost who could move objects so seeks him out to learn how to do it himself. I won't spoil the ending by saying exactly what happens but we do learn why he was killed and that not everybody is quite what they appear to be.This film seems to fit in several categories, it is a love story, a comedy, a thriller and obviously a ghost story, it combines these elements well. The effects are pretty good given the film's age, especially the shadows that come to life to drag the bad guys off when they die, these were genuinely creepy. The acting was good, there was a chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore... especially during the now famous pottery scene and Whoopi Goldberg was good as the medium although she walked a fine line between funny and embarrassing.",Ghost

Director Jerry Zucker proves that there is more to him than just quick-fire puns and silly sight gags with Ghost, a perfectly crafted romantic comedy thriller that pulls at the heart strings, tickles the ribs and sets the pulse racing.Much of the film's success is down to Zucker's skilful blending of the genres, but kudos must go to writer Bruce Joel Rubin for his flawless script and, of course, to Zucker's excellent cast: Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore, who provide the romance as loved up yuppies Sam and Molly; Tony Goldwyn as their treacherous friend Carl, whose criminal activities result in Sam's murder; and Whoopi Goldberg as spiritual advisor Oda Mae Brown, who gets all the laughs as she helps Sam's ghost to keep Molly safe from harm. There are also great turns from the supporting players, most notably Rick Aviles as Carl's loathsome hired hand Willie Lopez, and Vincent Schiavelli as the subway spook who teaches Sam how to channel his anger to move objects.Chock full of great moments, including the iconic pottery wheel scene accompanied by The Righteous Brothers' Unchained Melody on the soundtrack, this film has tremendous repeat value and is fully deserving of classic status.

Whoopi Goldberg won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar as a not-so-fake medium who becomes Patrick Swayze's conduit to reaching lady-love Demi Moore. Whoopi is, indeed, a treasure, though Swayze is just serviceable here and Moore has to contend with a non-believing character who takes too long to come around. It might be easy for some to write this fantasy-love story off as a bloated, faded hit with a heart of F/X, but there's surprising grace and finesse in Jerry Zucker's direction. Bruce Joel Rubin also won an Oscar for his original screenplay, which has some nice twists and turns. In these hands, ""Ghost"" is nearly an unqualified success, neatly avoiding treacle and sap simply by combining a sly sense of humor with its romantic spirit--underscored by Maurice Jarre's music and the oldie ""Unchained Melody"" by The Righteous Brothers.",Ghost

16,Coventry,"In between the fantasy and romance, there's a grim horror film hidden...",9,21 February 2021,"""Ghost"" isn't the usual type of movie for me to review, since it's a mainstream classic, and primarily a romantic drama. Yours truly almost exclusively reviews horror, thriller and cult movies; - the more obscure, bloody and shocking, the better! And yet, ever since I saw this film for the first time - I was barely 10 or 11 years old - the one thing that intrigued me the most was how dark, unsettling and violent several crucial parts were! The thin line between fantasy and horror shouldn't come too much as a surprise, since writer Bruce Joel Ruben (who righteously won an Oscar for this great film) previously wrote a couple of solid genre movies already, like ""Brainstorm"", ""Deadly Friend"" and ""Jacob's Ladder"".The story, the performances, the soundtrack and the beauty of ""Ghost"" have been applauded more than enough already, so please allow me to only focus on the dazzling horror highlights for a change. Three notable aspects in this department are: #1 - the pure hatred and violence in Sam Wheat's eyes when he pushes around his foes and basically hunts them into death. #2 - the nifty detail that the spirits of ""bad people"" are taken away by grim and pitch-black shadows when they die. #3 - the great (late) Vincent Schiavelli, as the nameless subway ghost, depicts one of the most petrifying and enigmatic supportive characters of 90s cinema. His naturally menacing looks and charisma, his rage, his unrevealed background story... The subway ghost should have received his very own (horror) film.",Ghost
17,michaelRokeefe,What we do for love.,7,8 May 2002,"Wonderful. Very exceptional romance flick with a flare of comedy. A man (Patrick Swayze)is accidentally shot and killed during a mugging. His spirit does not go to the 'here after', but remains on earth in the form of a ghost to protect his girlfriend(Demi Moore). The eye contact  between these two speak the language of love. The atmosphere is enhanced with bits and pieces of the song ""Unchained Melody"". And when it comes time and you first hear the sounds of the Righteous Brothers singing one of their trademark hits...there is not a dry eye in the house. To this day, every time I here this beautiful classic I think of GHOST and the power of love.
I am not a fan of Whoopi Goldberg, but have to say she was great as the spiritualist Oda Mae Brown. Also in the cast are Tony Goldwyn and Susan Breslau. Highly recommended as a first date movie. Bring plenty of hankies. Be prepared to fall back in love with love.",Ghost

It was written by Bruce Joel Rubin and directed by Jerry Zucker.The plot involves an interesting hybrid of popular film genres as it showcases the talents of its entire cast. While out on the town one evening, New York couple Sam and Molly are confronted by a mugger. After submitting to his demands, Sam is murdered anyway. He then finds himself a disembodied spirit, invisible to the living world, wandering without hope until he finds a spiteful spirit aboard the subway who gives him some helpful pointers on how to co-exist. Soon Sam comes back into contact with those he knew in life, and he begins to learn piece-by- piece of his close friend and co-worker Carl's embezzling plot which caused his death; the apparent mugging was, in fact, a premeditated murder. In the meantime, Carl has designs on Molly, and Sam is determined to extract revenge. He contacts a psychic, and together, the two set out to serve justice and stop the maniacal Carl from getting to Molly.This is a timeless romantic film that also relies on the supernatural aside from its many genres to entertain that viewers particularly the lovers and hopeless romantics.It maybe corny and superficial but nevertheless,it contains some nice ideas and nice whole moments at a time, succeeds in evoking the mysteries that the the screenplay deals with.The cast succeeds quite nicely in unifying the movie's multiple personalities especially the leads - Swayze,Moore and Goldberg - that generates a lot of interest from beginning to end.But despite of its somewhat predictable and formulaic plot,the movie succeeds due to the sincerity rarely evoked by the movie and the way it manages to please the viewer.",Ghost
19,studioAT,A bit of everything,4,9 January 2012,Maybe Ghost's enduring appeal is down to the fact that there are elements in it for everyone. There is enough romance in it for women and just about enough humour and storyline for the guys to enjoy as well. On some levels this film also works well as a murder mystery as well.It looks a little dated in places and I have no doubt that in a few years time some bright spark producer will try to do a remake of it.The leads are all good in their roles and the film is enjoyable enough if you look past a few of the plot holes.I think this film will continue to make people laugh and cry for many years to come and the newly opened musical will only help this.,Ghost

21,hitchcockthelegend,Now do you believe in ghosts?,8,22 April 2009,"Sam Wheat is killed during a botched mugging but his spirit is stuck in spirit world limbo. Watching over his left behind lover, Molly, it becomes clear that there is far more to his killing than it at first seemed. Enlisting the help of kooky psychic Oda Mae Brown, Sam must protect the now in danger Molly whilst simultaneously getting to the bottom of his murder.Ghost is a multi genre offering, not just purely a romantic weepy that its detractors would have you believe. Romance, fantasy, mystery, thriller, comedy and no little bit of spooky shenanigans all fuse together to form Jerry Zucker's monster box office smash of 1990. Made for $22 million, it has gone on to make a staggering $517 million worldwide, proof positive that the public by and large will buy into a simple story as long as it's put together well with the afore mentioned elements. The central theme of true love reaching from beyond the grave to prove itself eternal is something that most folk find endearing in a non sickly kind of way, with it naturally helped by having a cast list firing on all cylinders.Tho Jerry Zucker's (Airplane/Top Secret) direction is uneven, it's to be expected when this is after all his first solo feature, he is however well served by his stars. Patrick Swayze wasn't wanted for the part of Sam Wheat, but he fought tooth and nail for the project and nailed the role with gusto and emotionally driven force. Demi Moore as Molly was never lovelier, trimmed short hair to reveal a gorgeous young face, her feeding off of Swayze's energy provides the film with its credible impetus. Whoopi Goldberg as Oda Mae turns in an Oscar winning performance, wonderfully funny, yet also at times sympathetic without over stretching the essence of the piece, while Tony Goldwyn and Vincent Schiavelli also provide two memorable (for the right reasons) performances. The effects work of course looks amazing for its time, none more so when the dark side of death is fully realised via shadows in the films most creepy moments, whilst the editing (Walter Murch) and screenplay (Oscar winning by Bruce Rubin) is from the top draw.So yes it's safe to say that me, a butch middle aged bloke, is personally a fan of Ghost, there's a little bit of corn in there, especially in one particular dance sequence, but mainly the film is a pure delight. Helped by Maurice Jarre's hauntingly sweet score and boosted by the use of the magnificent Unchained Melody by The Righteous Brothers, Ghost is a film to revel in if you are prepared to let it get deep inside of you. 8/10",Ghost

He's an investment counselor and his digs are something to kill for. However, that's not the reason he's murdered by thugs in an alley. Seems he's been on to a laundering scheme by some black market investors and it's a contract killing.Well, you can't keep a good man down and soon Swayze is interacting, at first in minor ways, with the living but is frustrated enough in trying to reach his wife so that he contacts WHOOPI GOLDBERG, a fake medium who has no idea that she is indeed able to hear words from Swayze until he starts prompting her and giving her information about him that only he and his wife know in order to convince Moore to pay attention to him. As one of the bad men involved in the investment scheme, TOM GOLDWYN gives a funny, terrific performance in a key supporting role. Much of the humor comes from his work and, of course, Whoopi, who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her insolent supporting role, as well as a Golden Globe.Whatever, it all works even though it seems highly preposterous when you stop to think about it. But the lines are so clever, the interaction between ghosts and real people so inventive, and the climax so satisfying that you can't help admiring how the screenwriters were able to take a very difficult subject and turn it into one of the smartest comedy/drama achievements of the year.Summing up: Highly recommended for some good chills and lots of laughs.",Ghost

Coming in, I knew nothing about it but the famous clay-forming scene... I didn't know I was in for such a strong experience. This film had me from the first few moments of it. I never lost interest. The plot is so interesting and intriguing, you can't help but watch, often at the very edge of your seat. I will say that I found one twist somewhat predictable, but maybe I've just seen too many later movies before watching this. There is a lot of suspense in this film. When I found that it was directed by a Zucker(yup... Airplane and so forth), I was somewhat doubtful as to any other quality in the film than the humor of it... if you're reading this and you're thinking the same, trust me; he pulls it off. Excellently. There are few, if any, flaws in directing. The writing is solid. At times, there seemed to be a little too much humor and some scenes were maybe a tad long, but apart from that, there was not really anything with this film that was flawed. The score is great. The pacing is incredibly good. The acting is really good all-round. Goldberg provides a lot of comic relief, without being obnoxious. Moore and Swayze have magnificent chemistry, you truly believe them as a couple. The special effects are grand, yet they don't take over the movie. This is driven by the emotions, by how the plot affects these characters. I was completely into this movie all the way. The humor is very good and surprisingly tasteful for the theme. Much of it is derived from the situation of Swayze's character and his interaction with environment and other characters. All in all, just a very impressive film. I recommend this to any fan of drama, romance, comedy, thriller or fantasy, as well as anyone interested in seeing a non-parody Zucker film and fans of the actors. 7/10",Ghost
26,neil-476,"Original, and hugely entertaining",8,7 November 2013,"Sam and Molly are young, in love, and covered in clay, so Molly is understandably miffed when Sam is killed.

Until, at least, he discovers that he can enter the body of Oda Mae, a fake psychic (at least she thought she was fake), through whom he can try to put things right.Ghost is essentially a suspense thriller with strong supernatural and romance elements, and a dash of humour. It is unusual in that all the disparate elements work, and the whole thing holds together.

27,evanston_dad,We Liked This?,5,17 October 2008,"This huge hit that came out of nowhere in 1990 looks pretty silly in retrospect.Because ""Dirty Dancing"" was such a big hit, people made the mistake of thinking that Patrick Swayze could actually act and began casting him in roles that required it. His eager attempts at emoting coupled with his ridiculous coif haircut are good for a chuckle or two. Speaking of haircuts, who thought it was a good idea to make Demi Moore look like a little boy? The love scene between Swayze and Moore is both embarrassing and icky, embarrassing because they rub clay all over each other and icky because Moore looks like Pinocchio.The only person who salvages the movie is Whoopi Goldberg, playing a fake medium who ends up being a real medium after all. Goldberg's crowd-pleasing performance won her an Oscar, and if anything about the film deserved an Oscar, God knows it was her.And I never want to hear ""Unchained Melody"" again....Grade: C",Ghost
28,AlsExGal,"Made as a summer blockbuster, it brings up interesting philosophical points",9,14 August 2016,"I have to admit that Demi Moore as artist Molly and Patrick Swayze as Sam, an investment banker, had great chemistry. This was extremely popular when it came out in 1990, even winning an academy award for Whoopi Goldberg, whose career had been on a downturn up to that point.Sam and Molly have a great life in New York City. She is an up and coming artist, he is doing well at his investment banking job. They turn part of a run down building into a yuppie paradise loft apartment. But Sam has a problem expressing his love verbally. And then Sam and Molly are mugged by a common street criminal one night while walking home. Sam is shot and killed while defending Molly, and suddenly finds himself outside of his own body. Nobody can hear him. Nobody can see him. But he can converse with other ""ghosts"" that he finds. He hangs out in his old apartment to be near Molly, and then something happens that makes him think his murder was not a coincidence. The guy who killed him lets himself into his apartment with a key and begins looking for something in particular. He is obviously not there to steal the television. And from there the murder mystery begins.I still salute this movie for one inventive turn - the most unlikely protagonist ally in film history - Whoopi Goldberg as a fake psychic who turns out to be the only person who can hear Sam. She is rude, crude, at times greedy, somewhat racist and very mouthy and with a rap sheet a mile long for bunco artistry. But she does end up helping Sam, although he spends all night at her bedside singing ""I'm Henry VIII I am"" to get her to cooperate. However, you will like her, in part because she is so real and believable.The philosophical questions I mentioned? I guess the biggest question raised is who is a ""good"" person worthy of heaven and who is a ""bad"" person worthy of hell? Are there mitigating circumstances? The film has both of Sam's murderers going to hell. Were they BOTH that bad? One of the killers seemed like he might have been a good person until greed tempted him to the point that he got in over his head for some quick money. He was like Fred C. Dobbs in ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" without the gold mine and the endless Mexican desert. And what about Sam? He kills two people , at first attacking them to defend others - and it has got to be scary being chased and beat up by something you can't see - but he seems to have fun scaring them to the point of frenzy. I mean, what did he think was going to happen in each case? Yet he seems surprised when they end up dead at his hands in what could be considered self defense taken to the point of revenge. Yet he goes to heaven. Maybe the scale of eternal reward doesn't weigh acts performed after death? Ponderous.This one might seem cheesy at points, especially the pottery making/lovemaking scene, but I think it still holds up over time. I'd recommend it.",Ghost

However, when Sam is murdered, instigated by friend and corrupt business partner Carl Bruner over a shady business deal, he is left to roam the earth as a powerless spirit. When he learns of Carl's betrayal, Sam must seek the help of psychic Oda Mae Brown to set things right and protect Molly from Carl and his cat loving henchman, Willie Lopez.....It's true, the more times you watch this film, the more schmaltzy it becomes, but there is something really raw and powerful in what is otherwise a poor mans Truly Madly Deeply, with added murder.The narrative and story are simple, Sam must find a way to protect his soul mate, so he seeks help from the weird looking like on the subway, and Whooping Goldberg, easily the best thing about the film.But what makes the film rise above its smoochy, saccharine origins is the fact that it can be really dark and visceral at times, which makes it the fondly remembered movie it is. One minute you are laughing at Goldbergs fake seances and truly wonderful chemistry with Swayze, the next you are in the middle of a very unsettling dream sequence/vision Sam has when he is shot.So even though the film does lay on the romance thickly, and there are some genuinely funny scenes involving Goldberg, it's the visceral, unsettling moments that stick with you. You'll always remember Willie and Carl being taken away, rather then the guy on the operating table, because it grabs you, and the scene itself feels cold and murky, just like where they are heading.So all in all, it's romantic Swayze turned up to ten, but just as the film gets that little to tender, that little too schmaltzy, the makers give you a jolt that snaps you out of it.Which saves it, more than you'd know.And Sam would never say that.",Ghost
30,Aaron1375,One of those romance movies that can appeal to both sexes.,7,8 August 2010,"At its core this movie is in fact a chick flick, kind of in the same way the film ""Titanic"" is a chick flick. Basically, it is a film more geared to the fairer sex, but there is enough plot points and laughs and in the case of ""Titanic"" enough of a disaster to keep a guy's interest. You would think the ""Twilight"" series could do a better job at holding a guys interest, but for whatever reasons they apparently are completely hated by males, me included...sorry. This one though had an interesting enough plot after we see Swayze and Demi making pottery, as Swayze gets killed and leaves behind the love of his life. However, he sticks around as a ghost (hence the title) to try and keep his love out of harms way and to solve his own murder. Kind of hard to do when no one can see or hear you, that is until he meets a woman who claims to be able to speak to the dead. Well she is actually a fake, that is until Swayze shows up and her powers come to life. The film has some really good elements to it, a nice scene by Vincent Schiavelli in the subway. There is a nice dose of humor too mainly consisting of the scenes between Whoopie and Swayze. The film is not without its faults though as when you think about it the part where Swayze takes control of Whoopie's body is a tad creepy when you think about what is actually going on. This would be by far though Swayze's biggest movie and I think Demi's as well. Made of a very modest 22 million and grossing over 200 is quite impressive especially when you consider this movie did not exactly fly out of the gate opening only with a modest for the day 12 million. At its core a romantic movie geared to females, but with enough stuff added to keep all entertained.",Ghost

34,JamesHitchcock,God Speed Your Love,6,23 November 2006,"""Ghost"" is a film that breaks the normal rules. It is a film about the supernatural that is not a horror film. It is a comedy which takes as its theme violent death, but which is optimistic in tone rather than black or cynical. It is a romantic comedy in which the leading man dies during the first half-hour. And it is a film that breaks the rules and yet remains within the commercial Hollywood mainstream rather than branching out into art-house experimentalism.When Sam Wheat, a New York banker, is murdered in the course of what appears to be a robbery, his spirit remains on earth in the form of a ghost. The ghostly Sam quickly realises that his death was no random mugging gone wrong and that he was murdered because he had stumbled onto the fact that his bank was being used by criminals to launder money. Sam also realises that his girlfriend Molly is also in danger from the criminals who killed him, and tries to warn her.The film takes a fairly traditional view of the afterlife. (Much more traditional than, say, ""Beetlejuice"", another film from around the same period). On death, the souls of the good are rewarded with heavenly bliss, while the souls of the wicked are dragged down to hell by demons. A few souls, however, those who have unfinished business in this life, remain on earth as ghosts. They can see the living, but cannot normally be seen by them or communicate with them. Sam cannot therefore appear directly to Molly or speak to her, and in desperation he tries to make contact with Oda Mae Brown, a medium. Oda Mae, in fact, is a charlatan who makes her living by deceiving her clients into believing that she has psychic powers, but for some reason she is able to hear Sam (although not to see him). She is persuaded to help Sam warn Molly of the danger she is in, and also to help him frustrate the schemes of Carl, his corrupt former colleague who is responsible for both the money-laundering scam and Sam's murder.The film contains a mixture of comedy and sentimentality. The comedy mostly comes in the scenes involving Oda Mae, well played by Whoopi Goldberg as that stock comic figure, the rogue with a (well-hidden) heart of gold who can (very reluctantly) be persuaded to do the decent thing. Goldberg has appeared in some very weak comedies, such as ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" and ""A Knight in Camelot"", but ""Ghost"" is one of her more successful roles. There are some very amusing scenes, such as the one where Oda Mae, using fake ID, manages to withdraw the $4,000,000 which the criminals have deposited in a false bank account and is then cajoled by Sam into giving the whole amount to a charity run by nuns rather than keeping it for herself.The sentimentality comes in the scenes between Sam and Molly, both before his murder and at the end when she realises that his love for her has survived his death. The film's most famous scene- indeed, one of the most iconic scenes in modern cinema- is the one where Sam embraces Molly while she is making a pot (she is a potter by profession), to the strains of ""Unchained Melody"", and they end up making love. I will never think of pottery in the same way again. Or ""Unchained Melody"", come to that, although the words of that song do seem very appropriate to the film's theme of longing for an absent loved one.I must admit that I had difficulty envisaging Patrick Swayze as one of the yuppie classes, but that is probably because I always think of him in terms of his working-class-hero character from ""Dirty Dancing"". Demi Moore, however, made a delightful heroine, showing just why she was regarded as one of the hottest young actresses of the late eighties and early nineties. No actress since Audrey Hepburn had worn that short, boyish haircut with such style and elegance. The film as a whole can sometimes seem corny, but overall it is a watchable mixture of comedy and tenderness. 6/10",Ghost

36,blanbrn,Your spirit will believe! One of the best of the 90's.,7,11 December 2006,"When seeing ""Ghost"" 16 years ago with friends, and family I knew that this film would go down as a classic and it did it's one of the 90's best films. The movie in my opinion is so successful because of the many themes it's associated with it's not only a love story, but also this film has plenty of comedic moments while at the same time the main characters face a web of betrayal. The plot is well written with many turns as Patrick Swayze gives a strong performance as a New York City banker, who is gunned down and killed right in front of his sweetheart(Demi Moore)and all of this is over a dirty investment scandal. ""Ghost"" then gets very interesting when the Swayze character finds out that the after life does indeed occur! He can see people, but they can't see him! Never fear the only hope is to team with a psychic(Whoopi Goldberg who rightfully wins an Academy-Award for best supporting actress) to uncover the truth behind his murder and to rescue his love(Demi Moore). Overall this movie is a great romance that touches your heart, and makes you appreciate your loved ones especially after their gone. The laughs are also good with Whoopi and it's nice to see the now late Vincent Schiavelli have a small part as a subway ghost, who helps Patrick believe in his supernatural powers. Overall again one of the best movies of the 90's that taught us love, hope, and made us a believer that our past loved ones could be ghost. Also this picture helped make Demi Moore a superstar in the 90's, as she would earn 12 to 15 million a picture during this decade.",Ghost
37,MovieAddict2016,One of my favorite films -- still moving and touching...,10,29 January 2004,"It's hard for me to truly understand why a film such as ""Ghost"" appeals to my inner moviegoer so very much. Here's a film so full of clichés and tired ideas that somehow--miraculously--manage to stay fresh, presenting us with a great love story amidst an intriguing backdrop of murder and revenge. The only problem with the movie is Demi Moore's haircut, but that's an entirely different matter.The story is classic: Sam (Patrick Swayze) is a successful accountant earning the big bucks in the big city. He's got it all: A great job, a great apartment, a great girlfriend to share it with, and an overall great life. Curled up in bed with his girl, Molly (Demi Moore), he watches a news program stating that an airplane crashed and everyone aboard the aircraft died. ""Just imagine,"" he says. ""In an instant--just like that. Bam."" He is, of course, referring to the instantaneity of death.The irony in the situation is that we all know the same thing is about to happen to him, and indeed it does, when Sam is shot dead in front of Molly by a mysterious stranger who runs off into the night. Sam dies immediately, and it takes us a few moments to realize this--since we continue to see him run after the killer. It's then that it dawns on us: it's his ghost.Unable to make contact with the living, Sam follows Molly for weeks preceding his death. (This is where that ""SNL"" skit came in--""Oh, Molly, don't do that, it's disgusting! There's a tissue right across the room!"" I've got a bit more info on that later on.) However, Sam soon realizes that his old friend and fellow accountant (Tony Goldwyn) had hired a man to shoot Sam because he had seen evidence of money laundering in one of the accounts.Now, in order to warn Molly of possible danger, Sam enlists the help of a psychic hoax (Whoopi Goldberg) to pay a visit to Molly and tell her the truth about everything. ""Go away!"" she yells as Sam taunts her with obnoxious songs until she agrees to tag along and go visit his old girlfriend.It's useless to delve any deeper into the plot, since it's all pretty predictable. But in all honesty, it's a fun ride getting to the end. This is a film that uses a tried-and-true formula of good vs. evil to achieve its goals. It's as old as the days and as true as nothing. I'm reminded of that speech about principals by Donald Kaufman in ""Adaptation"": ""This works, and it has through all recorded time."" No doubt he had ""Ghost"" in mind when he said that. (I'm just joking.)I do like the way ""Ghost"" uses its ideas of a ghost coming back to haunt his killer in a way different than most films, though. This ghost's intentions aren't to scare away people in a haunted mansion, but rather to reach out and touch the woman he once loved, and then--finally--to keep her from harm by seeking revenge on the baddies who plotted against him.I like the way one of the villains gets trapped in a bathroom and glances at a steamy window. The word, ""Boo"" suddenly appears as if someone was writing it, and with a scream the criminal flees the room and runs out into the street outside.If this were a horror film, the window gag might creep us out a bit and give us a chill or two. But ""Ghost"" uses the old ghost clichés--haunting people, making writing appear on windows, etc.--and makes us re-think them. Maybe that bartender from ""The Shining"" wasn't just a creepy old ghost. Maybe he was just having a bit of fun with Jack.Or...maybe not.That's where the film succeeds, I think: in its ideas, even if they have been done before. I also enjoyed Patrick Swayze's performance. Swayze is often ridiculed as an actor, and this caused him to sink back into the depths of unemployment for a number of years--now appearing in co-star roles and low-budget films--but I think he's a good actor with a likable on-screen personality. And he doesn't take himself too seriously, which is always a good thing. (Anybody see that Hans and Franz skit on ""Saturday Night Live"" about ten years ago? Utterly hilarious. How about the ""Ghost"" parody?)Okay, so Whoopi Goldberg didn't deserve the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Everyone knows it was just because the Academy was in a certain mood that year, where it felt that it had to give its appreciation to the black community of filmmakers, but it's a done deal and the movie is still a good love story, regardless of whether or not one of its actresses didn't deserve an award for her work. (On a sidenote, Goldberg's performance is quite fun--still, no worthy Oscar material, I soundly agree.)I must confess with a bit of shame that it is one of my all-time favorite guilty pleasures--the type of movie that puts me in a good mood every time I watch it, and a movie with an ending that makes my throat choke every time I see it. The ending really is perfect, and if the movie had resorted to a silly ""I came back from the dead!"" bit, my high opinion of the film would surely be somewhat less enthusastic than what it is today.You can't always say that many movies are really beautiful love stories, but here's one.",Ghost

On their way back to their apartment after a night at the theater, they encounter a thief and, during the botched robbery, Sam is murdered. While Molly is left grieving for Sam's death, their undying love keeps Sam's spirit on earth and he is determined to get to the bottom of his murder, which he finds out was no accident. With the help of psychic Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), Sam must warn Molly of the impending danger.This is one of those movies I would watch over and over again and it is still fresh every time I watch it. It's full of suspense from start to finish as Sam tries desperately to communicate with Molly from the dead, and as he tries to prevent the bad guys from harming her. Sam and Molly's love for each other give this film a dose of romance and features one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history: their love scene while the Righteous Brothers' ""Unchained Melody"" is played in the background. Oda Mae Brown delivered this movie's much-needed comic relief, giving us a dose of her acid wit humor. And, add in the drama of Sam's mission, this is a multi-genre film that will endear an audience for years to come.Swayze, Moore and Goldberg all did a great job in their performances, with an exciting story and plot by writer Bruce Joel Rubin and solid direction by Jerry Zucker. There is never a dull moment in this film; it's just fast-paced fun that will keep you entertained.Grade A",Ghost
39,thesar-2,The Ghost Whisperer,9,28 April 2013,"Admittedly, I had a grudge against this movie. But, not until the following year (1991) when the Oscar Nominations were read. This got nominated for Best Picture and not Pretty Woman? And not just that, very few eyes were on, what I considered (and still do) a masterpiece, Pretty Woman and more on Ghost? It would be years until I saw this again.I was sorry when I finally revisited this in the mid-1990s because, I had to concur: this was a well made film. Great in a lot of areas, even. And I've loved it since.Not so much a spoiler, thanks to the name of the movie, but Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze, RIP, in yet another masterful performance) dies fairly quickly into the movie and becomesthe title character. He's not transported either up high or down below and must learn the ways of the ghost. Mercifully, with the help of (the fantastic character, and Oscar winning Whoopi Goldberg as) con-artist (?) Oda Mae Brown, Sam can both reconnect with his widowed lover and catch the bad person who put him in this purgatory.The movie does work in mysterious ways. It's highly hilarious and touching. It's suspenseful and deep. It contains a triple pleasure: a great soundtrack, score and cinematography. And with it's ""on the surface"" clichéd characters, the actors bring much more to the table. Even though everyone, including the ""Subway Ghost,"" acted their best and made their roles their own, Academy Award winning Whoopi Goldberg shined the brightest in here, despite her blatant racism. I still laughed and loved her throughout her (sadly) short time on screen. I have always been a Whoopi fan, but here, I believe she brought her best out.This very positive review comes from someone who doesn't even like ghost stories. This one felt many more times different than the others I've seen and I will watch this many more times than the typical modern day and boringly predictable paranormal films.Side Note: While I did not downgrade the movie because of the following: I have to say, this movie made me thoroughly dislike Tony Goldwyn. Granted, he played his slimy role as he was told or felt his character needed to be seen. But, he's literally like a magnet to my magnet when I see him on screen. He's the one thing I cannot look at when watching this movie and I haven't liked him since. Just a personal preference.",Ghost
40,Lejink,In this our afterlife,7,29 November 2015,"So it was a cold and wet Sunday afternoon, prematurely dark outside. My wife and I had just got in from walking our dog just before the rain really started and there was no question we weren't venturing out again. I asked her what film she thinks we should watch and she says ""a nice one"". I flick through various selections and she stops me at ""Ghost"". She saw it years ago in original release but I've never seen it, so ""Ghost"" it was.Turned out to be a good choice. I've always been a sucker for fantasy movies dealing with visitations from the afterlife and whatnot, going back to ""Topper"", ""The Bishop's Wife"" and of course the daddy of them all ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and ""Ghost"" unquestionably taps into all of that, with good ghosts hanging around their loved ones until they find release through redemption, ascending to the light while bad ghosts don't get to stay long, getting immediately dragged down to the nether regions by irresistible black forces. This latter turns out to be very convenient for Patrick Swayze's nice-guy Sam Wheat character when two of his enemies later die on him in hot pursuit.Sam doesn't get to last too long in his physical form, being slain in front of his loving girlfriend, Demi Moore's Molly by what seems to be a random mugger. When Moore is later consoled by Sam's best friend and banking work-colleague Carl, the bigger picture quickly became clearer, leading to a reasonably exciting if slightly over-the-top conclusion as Sam races to save Molly from joining him in the hereafter as the bad guys come after her.Of course, to communicate with Molly, Sam has to find a suitable conduit so enter Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae fake medium character and an entertaining sub-plot caper where she and Sam conspire to thwart Carl's embezzlement plans in person at the bank as well as the inevitable scenes where Goldberg first becomes aware of his at first unwelcome presence and later when she's trying to convince Moore of Sam's ""existence"".Sure there are slushy bits too, like the oft-parodied (and very suggestive!) pottery scene to the backdrop of The Righteous Brothers' ""Unchained Melody"", making the film a woman's favourite ever since, but that may be as much to do with big old handsome Patrick as anything else. Undoubtedly though he and Moore are two of the beautiful people, living the life in downtown New York, but they combine well and have you rooting for them all the way through. Goldberg gets to do her goofy, sometimes histrionic comedy thing but she's kept just about in check by the direction. The special effects, for the time, are fine, particularly all the out-of-body stuff.Such was the success of the movie on original release that ""Unchained Melody"" was re- released as a single in the UK due to the popularity of this film and raced to number 1 in the charts (which it never did on original issue) but I can see why. It's a warming, life- affirming entertaining movie and good clean family entertainment, an old-fashioned Hoolywood movie in the best tradition - and what's wrong with that, as someone once said?",Ghost
41,ElMaruecan82,A Matter of Love and Death ...,8,13 January 2013,"No matter how prepared we get for corniness, we rapidly find ourselves absorbed by the romance between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze and much more by the depiction of death strangely plausible and, no pun intended, quite haunting.Indeed, the main premise of ""Ghost"", which won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, is to feature death from the dead's perspective. Not a revolutionary plot device but the only one that occupies the whole story with the ghost trying to reach the living. Why wouldn't Sam try to talk to his parents, his friends, why would Molly, all of sudden, become the center of his afterlife? The script tactfully escapes from this criticism when it's clearly established that Sam's death is not accidental, and the cause of his murder incidentally puts Molly in a dangerous situation. I also want to answer one criticism expressed by Roger Ebert, why would a ghost still care about Earthly matters, why wouldn't follow the white light and go have a chat with either ""Elvis of Aristotles""? I think that the most important feeling channeled by Swayze's performance is disbelief. He can't get the idea of not belonging to this world anymore, and this is why I felt that the portrayal of death, as a separation between the soul and the body, and the atrocious witnessing of one's death, was 'plausible', I could imagine myself dying this way. It's even ironic how Sam goes through the stages of grief for his own death, from denial to resignation. And it's extraordinary how Swayze perfectly captures the desperateness of a man who had so much to do, so many dreams and projects and finally saw his life abruptly cut. His penetrating expressions are astonishingly convincing, whether it's for sadness, empathy, compassion, his eyes are more eloquent than any of his lines. And his performance is crucial since he's portraying an isolated character. As soon as he becomes a ghost, he only interacts with a few other ghosts, even Whoopi Goldberg who plays the medium Oda Mae, can only hear him. Swayze's believability relies on his ability to touch the viewers instead of the characters, definitely the most defining performance of an actor who sadly left us too soon.And Sam's exhaustive journey, starts with his necessity to deal with his new condition, in order to stop the scheme that lead to his death. And the learning part renovates all the good old archetypes of the ghost crossing doors and touching objects. Ghosts can feel sensations and only touch or move things if they're able to think themselves as ghosts, it's an exciting part of the film to see a man learning his powers to be able to use them as weapons. In conclusion, Sam stays because he can't believe he dies and he tries to reach Molly because she's in danger. We're far from the whole 'unfinished job' and 'transcending love' clichés, the film delivers something original out of familiar material. The film also innovates with the scary portrayal of the bad guys' deaths. The atrocious sight of moaning evil shadows converging to take someone away justifies the belief in a sort of immanent justice, and the exhilarating idea that we all die twice, the good people going to heaven, and the others in some place, we don't want to know. The villains' demises is very unsettling, it can even traumatize some sensitive minds, and you see in Swayze's eyes that he feels sorry for them, for even death don't make people even. But ""Ghost""'s thrilling metaphysical value also originates the magnificent ending which is probably the closest depiction to heaven ever gracing the screen.And there's another cliché that the film tactfully reinvents, the 'Old Magic Negro', and it succeeds for two reasons. First, Oda Mae is a crook, she's not a real medium, which is funny and she discovers that she really has the power, which is even funnier. Secondly, it's Whoopi Goldberg and it's one of her greatest roles, earning her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and beyond the comic relief aspect, this is exactly what a supporting performance is supposed to be: secondary, yet so scene-stealing that we can't imagine the film without it. Goldberg provides all the laughs, capable of the most acid irony with Swayze, and being comprehensive and diplomatic, in her streetwise way, with Molly. This is a credit to Jerry Zucker, who didn't forget his comedic roots and made a few hilarious moments of the film. My only regret and this time, I share Ebert's view, I wish he had the guts to portray the second kissing scene with Whoopi Goldberg. No matter how weird it would have looked, it would have touched a very sensitive nerve and be even sadder because we would still get the idea that the sweet and tender Molly can't see Sam since he entered Oda Mae's body and it would have made the final scene even more rewarding. And I can't go on without mentioning the sweet and sensitive performance of Demi Moore as the fragile Molly, unbelievably cute with that short haircut, that became one of the film's trademarks along with Swayze's red shirt and Oda Mae's exaggerated dress. Even though Jerry Zucker, the co-director of so many spoof classics, can seem as unlikely choice to direct a drama like ""Ghost"" but with all the material he had, the script, the casting, the visual effects, a magnificent score from Maurice Jarre, all he had to do is to assemble all these elements of greatness in a straight-forward way, without overdoing anything. And the film had the cinematic quality of successful movies; this capability to be memorable in a genuine and creative way, the unavoidable iconic pottery scene with ""Unchained Melody"" probably earned the film its ticket for immortality.Not to mention the powerful ending, which, after the death of Patrick Swayze, had the bittersweet feeling of a sad premonition.",Ghost
42,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Invisible man.,7,18 February 2020,"'Ghost (1990)' is much more than its reputation would have you believe. That is to say, it's not just 'that movie where Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore get stuck into some clay'. It's a mystery-thriller with romantic aspects, much more concerned with its spooky situation than it is with its 'ooey gooey' stuff. Of course, the romance is still integral to the plot. It's also integral to your investment, as it ensures that you care about the central characters and the tragic events that they become involved with. It's interesting to see a ghost movie entirely from the perspective of the ghost. There's a unique sense of longing and frustration that comes with such an existential premise. It makes for some satisfying moments later on, once Swayze's leading man has learnt how to communicate with the land of the living. It also allows for some inventively delivered narrative twists. The special effects are still pretty great, especially when it comes to the 'going through things' stuff. Of course, its seams are starting to show but it's all still convincing enough to work. As are the performances, which are sometimes a little broad but are typically incredibly emotionally charged. The highlight for me is Tony Goldwyn, whose increasingly desperate decline is actually agitating to watch. All in all, the picture is surprisingly enjoyable. It has its problems, of course. Primarily, these occur whenever the comedy becomes too over-the-top for the established tone. The typically saccharine affair does sometimes teeter into straight-up sappiness, too. Despite this, the experience just works. It's emotional, exciting and unique. It's undeniably effective and downright entertaining, to boot. To be honest, it's really, really good. 7/10.",Ghost
43,bowmanblue,You will believe (that it's a timeless classic),10,28 April 2020,"I first watched 'Ghost' back when it was released in 1990. I was a typical teen in those days, only really interested in films involving Austrian musclemen beating villains to a pulp. Yet there was something about a supernatural, romantic comedy that just shouldn't have appealed to me - but it did. And I'm as pleased to say that 'Ghost' is still as perfect today as it ever was.I'm pretty sure most people know the plot by now, but, on the off-chance you've never seen it (or figured out the basic premise via the title!), it involves one of the central characters dying before their time and therefore carrying on existing in spectral form in order to take care of business before they can cross over to the other side.The main stars all perform some iconic roles here - don't think that it's just Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore all the way (who are both brilliant), but - as the Oscars showed - it's Whoopie Goldberg who steals every scene she's in as the larger-than-life psychic/con-woman who finds she has a sudden knack at speaking to those on 'the other side.'Don't go thinking that this is just a 'rom-com.' Yes, the 'love aspect' is an integral part of the story, but it has an appeal that's far broader than your average Jennifer Anniston flick. Hopefully, anyone of any age and gender should appreciate this. It even gets a little creepy towards the end with two instances that have brought a shiver down my spine every time I watch it.I can't really stress just how perfect 'Ghost' is. There's so little to say that's negative about it (unless you count my Mum's comment about how Demi Moore just spends the whole movie crying!). Perhaps there are some 'green screen' effects that are more noticeable today than when they were first released, but that's about the only vaguely-negative thing I can think of saying. You really should have watched 'Ghost' at least once in your life. It really is a timeless tale that hasn't aged a bit in its thirty year lifespan. Should I say it will probably live forever?",Ghost
44,g-bodyl,Very Touching and Romantic!,9,12 March 2015,"Ghost is one of the best romance stories ever made and it is not hard to see why this film became an instant classic. I liked the spin to the eons-old romance tale by introducing the afterlife aspect. This film works very well as a romance story as well as a mystery thriller and it has one of the most happy-sad endings I have ever seen in a Hollywood film. The film also work its magic through the use of music thanks to Maurice Jarre's wonderful score and the use of the Righteous Brothers. Jerry Zucker's film is about a couple named Sam and Molly who are happily in love. During a botched mugging, Sam is shot to death. Sam comes back as a ghost and he realizes that he was murdered and that Molly is in danger. With the help of a reluctant psychic, Sam must communicate with his wife if he wants to protect her. Each actor added some dimension to their roles. Firstly, the chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore is very believable and realistic. They both do a great job in their roles. I was particularly fond of Swayze and his attempts to communicate with the real world. Whoopi Goldberg does a wonderful job as the psychic not wanting to do with the events. Tony Goldwyn made a good villain, even if he was a little bit of a scaredy-cat. Overall, Ghost is a 90's classic and I really hope this film won't be a victim of the remakes craze that has been infesting upon Hollywood these days. The film is a mixture of mystery and romance and it delivers a touching story without being overly saccharine. I find this film the second most touching romance of the 90's after Titanic. This film is certainly has its share of unchained melodies. My Grade: A",Ghost

49,ironhorse_iv,This is one ghost story worth listening to. It's really good. I really do love it! Ditto.,7,8 January 2020,"One of the directors of 1980 parody comedy 'Airplane' making a gut wrenchingly emotional romantic murder drama? Surely, you can't be serious. Yes, I am and don't call me Shirley. This film was nearly a masterpiece in the way it was shot. The way the camera foreshadowing the villain's turn from the reflection of the mirror of angel statue being lifted in to the antagonist being greedy about the apartment was magnificent. The spooky dark opening with the dust of the apartment looking like spirits was haunting and the horrific, guttural cries they make created by slowing down recordings of babies crying are chilling. Even the appearance of glowing light being shine down on the titular character whenever he's about to leave was powerful even if some of the special effects are dated. To give you an idea of how good the movie directed by Jerry Zucker really was. Some movie theaters actually gave out free tissue packets to attendees during its original run because how much of an emotional tear jerking watch, the film can bring. Trust me even I was crying after witnessing this film. However the story written by Bruce Joel Rubin of a murdered man's ghost, Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) staying behind to warn his girlfriend Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) of impending danger, with the help of a reluctant psychic Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) did have some flaws. Mostly in the way the filmmakers introduce some of the spirit's powers such as possessions and moving items. First off, I felt like the film could had introduce the Subway Ghost played well by Vincent Schiavelli a little bit better. It was a bit weird for the ghost to interference with Sam when he is following Willie Lopez (Rick Aviles) but the titular character was still able to keep track of his killer even afterward being toss off the train. Honestly that scene should had been cut as it was bit jarring. The movie could had introduce that individual a lot later in the film. For example after Sam finds out that his best friend Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn)'s true motives. He could go back to the train heading back to Molly from 321 Prospect Place feeling depressed; only to find out that he is in the presence of another ghost. It's here where they should had a fight; only for Wheat not to give up and somewhat challenge him to teach him that ability. Yes it would be more of a Deus ex machina too convenient event than it originally was, but it would also made that moment a lot more emotional and powerful. Since the movie didn't do that; it always bug me why Sam didn't go back to the train station after witnessing it the first time. Why does it take him a whole bunch of filler scenes later to figure that out when knocking off a picture? Honestly a lot of what Sam does seem pretty idiotic. As fun as it is to watch Sam torment the villain with his ghost powers, writing out his name on the computer was not the brightest decision nor was going into the body of Oda Mae when the antagonists are heading their way. That along is really dumb. It's not like he didn't know that it can drain his powers. He witness another ghost do that earlier in the film. Talking about that scene; why was the point of the ghost doing that in the first place? It's not like he couldn't see his wife's hair. It's very visional. Don't get why he was surprised by it. Anyways those whole possession scenes felt forced nor does it make sense in the story as Sam never told anybody about Mae's powers. Plus it's kinda rapey as the ghost did that without her permission or her consent. It kinda disgusting and not that funny. Despite that, Goldberg did made me laugh at certain parts of the film. She was wonderful for the most part. Glad that Swayze convinced her to do this role to the point that he was willing to drop out if she didn't. She ended up winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress that year. As for Swayze, I do think that he did a good job as the titular character even if Sam is little bland and dumbfounded. His reaction to betrayal and feeling sorry for others felt real. Along with that the pottery scene involving him is very steamy and sensual. It's the film most remembered and most parodied moment. Pretty impressive for a scene that contain no nudity other than Swayze being shirtless. While the song that went along with the scene, 'Unchained Melody' by the Righteous Brothers originally was about a prisoner hoping his girl will wait for him felt unrelated in a surface level to the scene as Sam has yet became a ghost with chained limitations. It still work so well with the movie that it was put back into the billboard charts after 30 years from its first debut. It's very romantic. Even composer Maurice Jarrie orchestral version of the song was emotional to listen to. The scene where Sam says farewell to Molly was heartbreaking. Demi Moore really did act. The way that she can cry on cue and seem flabbergasted really made this moment seem special even if her character was somewhat underdeveloped for most of the film. That scene along became more heartbreaking since Patrick Swayze's passing in 2009. It's somewhat hard to watch now. Regardless in 2010 a foreign remake was made in Japan & a musical production of Ghost hit Broadway in 2012. Still overall: No reboot can beat this movie with its great use of horror, comedy and romantic tone. It's one worth possessing.",Ghost

The title may deceive, make us think that is another horror film about hauntings. Well ... it's about ghosts but does not scare anyone. The script is based on the sudden death of Sam and in his attempts to contact his wife, now widow, and warn her about a deadly danger lurking around her. Simple but effective, the script works well, plays with a universal belief, shared by millions of people, places deep questions and earned for its author, Bruce Joel Rubin, an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.The main roles are played by Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore, two experienced actors who don't have disappointed the public, providing us with very good performances. They have created a good visual chemistry, which helps to enhance the romantic mood of the film. Compelling is the performance of Whoopi Goldberg, one of the most striking of her career.

54,leplatypus,How to send this movie to heaven ? (dvd),7,28 August 2011,"This movie looks like the thoughts I had the day we buried my grandmother one year ago. I nearly shouted to her with my heart and soul but nothing happens in front of me. If she was there, how can explain we can't communicate. The best conclusion I had was that as she can't move things, she was really in an other plane, explaining we can't speak to each other.Thus it was great that a movie tries to answer the same existential question and meeting the same paradox: how does Sam the ghost can pass thought everything but can sit on a real chair: well, it's about experience and mind. Beyond this, the movie offers really great scenes about being a ghost and it's strange nobody does it like this since Shakespeare. It's more about sharing your lover sorrow, being her shadow than doing poltergeist.Another good thing is that it's not only paranormal and romance, it's also a thriller and a comedy. Swayze (who sadly turns into a real one now) and Demi was really a fine couple but this movie hasn't changed my opinion about Goldberg: she was irritating me before and she is after.Another weak point is the dark spirits: if they are here to punish bad people, they are rather good spirits. But talking about the devil would be a new discussion in another movie. So i conclude for those who like the ""Unchained Melody"", urging them to listen to U2's cover because it's simply surreal!",Ghost
55,BaronBl00d,I Liked It!,7,12 July 2016,"I waited a LONG time to finally see this. I was expecting a schmaltzy love story - and got it BUT got a good deal more too. Just about everyone knows the story of Sam and Molly. I also knew I would have to sit through the pottery scene - fortunately it was early on. I also knew Whoopi Goldberg was in it and won her Oscar. Let's start with her. She deserved it. She was very funny, energetic, and breathed comedic life into some pretty pedestrian material at times. She is gorgeous too! The film is definitely a love story, a story of love conquering all, and love transcending death. It is also a story of redemption, good and evil, a murder mystery of sorts, and a comedy of situation at times as well. Add in some not-so-great special effects and we get spirits being asked to rise. Dark spirits whisking people to Hell. A variety of ghosts who seem content to sit around and be funny. At the core of the film, however; is a triangle of acting chemistry. No doubt at all that Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore have it. Their love looks real. Whoopi and Demi have some chemistry as well, but I think the chemistry between Whoopi and Patrick is what really carries the film. They have great timing together. They are funny together. The best parts of the film for me are the scenes where they are together. Swayze has this innocent naivete about him that really is convincing. The writing is wonderful and the direction crisp. The final scene is a tear-jerker that even I could not fail to succumb to in the end. I recommend Ghost heartily.",Ghost

The main problem with this movie is that it's highly overrated and it has every possible clichè from Hollywood. First; it's lead characters are Hollywood superstars with a bad reputation although they deliver a great performance. Then, the movie had a HUGE promotional campaign. Everybody knew about ""Ghost"" when it came out and to these days, it's one of the most spoofed and parodied movies ever made (the sex scene is always spoofed!).Anyways, ""Ghost"" is a really well done movie. It has romance, suspense, comedy drama, and even little horror elements such as minimal gore. The acting is really good. Whoopi Goldberg steals the show mixing drama and comedy. The woman is amazing. Demi Moore is extremely cute and delivers a tender, sexy performance. Patrick S. also impressed me with his solid dramatic and comical performance. The direction is also top class, and the score is perfect! There you go. This is a kitschy movie but surely entertaining and tender.I recommend it for people who like supernatural love stories. This is by far the best of it's kind. One of the best romantic movies from the past 25 years.",Ghost

In ""Ghost"", it can be both. A yuppie in New York named Sam Wheat(Patrick Swayze) lives with his sweetheart Molly(Demi Moore) with his life in full motion. Then one night, everything changes. His life is ended with a bullet, and he's wandering the streets of New York confused and scared out of his wits. He does get help with a psychic (Whoopi Goldberg) who happened to be a know con-artist. With her help they make an effort to save Molly from certain doom. Not only Sam's killer is the culprit, but someone from his job is also guilty to his murder: Carl Bruner(Tony Goldwyn), Sam's own friend! How could it be? Somehow, he was the bigger thief than Oda Mae Brown. This movie is strong, uplifting and supportive in every way.

62,generationofswine,An Honest Review,8,3 February 2020,"Tony Goldwyn should have been a more popular actor. He was actually pretty exceptional in almost everything he has done but never actually made it to superstar status.Instead he kind of lingered in supporting actor limbo through the 90s and then kind of disappeared.It's a shame.And he's not the only unsung hero in Ghost, Vincent Schiavelli is in it too.It has a great cast that brings their all to the film.The script isn't that imaginative, you've seen a few movies like this before, but that never really matters when it's done well.",Ghost
63,dee.reid,"""Ghost"" - Do you believe?",8,10 July 2005,"The best thing that can be said about ""Ghost"" is that it's starkly earnest in the portrayal of two people whose love for one another is boundless, not even by death. So when Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) coos to her yuppie boyfriend Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) that she loves him, to which he dimly replies ""Ditto,"" it's genuine romance - it's the real McCoy.""Ghost"" was the romantic hit of 1990 and was directed amiably by Jerry Zucker (of ""Airplane!"" infamy) and written by Bruce Joel Rubin, who also scripted ""Jacob's Ladder"" that same year, which was another film that questioned the paranormal activity that is life after death. ""Ghost"" contains many of the comedic elements on display in Zucker's earlier ""Airplane!"" hit but remains pretty loyal to the seriousness of its subject matter.Sam has led a pretty charmed life: he has a beautiful girlfriend, a trustworthy friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn), a well-paying job as a Wall Street banker, and a brand-spanking new apartment with the woman he loves. But Sam's charmed life comes to an abrupt end one night when he's gunned down during an attempted robbery by Willie Lopez (Rick Aviles) - ""he's Puerto Rican.""But the movie's not over, as Sam is left to roam the streets of New York City alone and without any way to communicate with the living. He can't be seen or heard by living people, so he spends his days walking the streets and watching carefully over the grieving Molly as she attempts to piece together her life without him. Between doing this and that, Sam eventually learns the identity of his assailant and where he lives but cannot do anything about it.But when all hope seems lost, Sam wanders into a shop run by a storefront psychic named Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), who likes to swindle grieving people out of their money by convincing them that she can talk with the dead. It's from their dynamic interactions that much of the film's comedic elements are derived.Oda Mae is shocked when she finds that she really can hear Sam (but can't see him) and he uses her as a medium so that he can communicate with Molly and inform her that she's in danger. (He's able to convince Oda Mae to help him by singing ""Henry the Eight I Am."") Sam, with Oda Mae's help, gradually learns that his death was no random street mugging, and that he was murdered: Willie had been instructed by a mysterious third party to kill Sam and then retrieve his wallet, as he was on the verge of uncovering a money laundering scheme involving drug dealers.""Ghost"" does boast one of the most compelling and moving love stories ever told. The story is effective and is certainly a revealing and engaging look at the afterlife. The acting is powerful and profound, as each of the performers fill out their roles with perfect glee and believable emotions. The special effects are dated, but are also quite effective as well in showing us the processes in the afterlife, as it turns out that spirits can interact with the living and doesn't even attempt to spare us the darker sides of death.Since Sam lacks a physical human body, he cannot move objects. But with the help of the tragic ghost (Vincent Schiavelli) that haunts the New York subway, Sam is able to physically interact with the living. He learns that by controlling one's emotions and then letting them erupt like a reactor, he can physically move an animate or inanimate object.Do you believe in ghosts? I believe in karma, and I do believe in life after death. These are all elements in the story that are fleshed out well in Rubin's imaginative script, brought to life by the actors and the guidance of Zucker's direction. I do believe that the ladies might need tissues to wipe away the tears too, as the film's ending would prove.""Ghost,"" I believe, is one of the best love stories I've ever seen. It's funny, it's heartwarming, and it's all done in a believable fashion. Love is grand, and it's forever; ""Ghost"" will make you believe.8/10",Ghost

You would think a dead man could afford to be fatalistic about such things, but Swayze wants revenge, and after a slow start (to both the film and his vendetta) he gets it, with reluctant help from a bogus medium (Whoopi Goldberg) able to hear his disembodied voice. The clever (and often eerie) effects help salvage the story from some predictable clichés and tired comic relief, and by the time Swayze joins that big Industrial Light and Magic show in the sky the film has carved itself a sizable chunk of territory once claimed exclusively by Steven Spielberg, who no doubt is kicking himself for making the similar but saccharine 'Always' instead.

65,estebangonzalez10,One of the hits of 1990,6,8 July 2015,"""It's amazing, Molly. The love inside, you take it with you.""Only one film beat Jerry Zucker's Ghost at the U.S. Box Office in 1990 and that was Home Alone, but Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore's romantic fantasy managed to take everyone by surprise as it topped other films like Pretty Woman, Dances With Wolves, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Total Recall, Goodfellas, and even the sequels for Die Hard, The Godfather, Robocop, and Back to the Future. What is surprising is that this ghost tale still remains such a beloved classic to this date, thanks in most part to the amazing chemistry between Swayze and Moore and to the fantastic soundtrack performed by The Righteous Brothers. I don't know however, if this film would've worked without Whoopi Goldberg's hilarious supporting performance (which won her her only Oscar) considering the story doesn't really pick off until she enters the picture. Of course that overly emotional touching scene at the end is what everyone probably remembers (and the reason why this film won an Oscar for Original Screenplay), but I don't think it has aged too well. The film is entertaining, although it is cheesy at times and the visual effects don't live up to today's standards. What surprised me the most when I saw this is how well it balances those melodramatic moments with the comedy, because I always believed this film was a romantic tale from beginning to end, but it really is more of an action comedy with several twists along the way (albeit predictable ones). There is no doubt that the universal premise of wanting to believe that our loved ones are still with us when they pass away to protect and guard us is what really sold this film and Ghost easily manages to tell that story with two likable actors sharing a strong chemistry together.The film opens by introducing us to a lovely couple, Sam (Patrick Swayze) and Molly (Demi Moore), who've just bought a property and are ready to make their dreams a reality. Carl (Tony Goldwyn) is Sam's good friend and work partner at the bank who is always there supporting him and Molly. However, their dreams are shattered when Sam is murdered after a thug tries to steal his wallet one night. Sam's spirit remains on Earth and he discovers that this wasn't simply a robbery and that Molly's life is also in danger. He must warn her before it's too late, but no one seems to see or hear him. That is until Sam meets a psychic named Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) who will try to convince Molly that she can speak to her dead lover's spirit before it is too late.Up to this point Jerry Zucker was known mainly for co-directing satires like the classic Airplane!, Top Secret!, and Ruthless People. Prior to his solo directorial feature debut in Ghost, he had helped write the screenplay for Naked Gun as well, so he was mainly known for his work in satires. Many probably believed this ghost story was just another satire and so the romantic story took everyone by surprise. I'm sure Bruce Willis was regretting not having accepted to co-star along with his wife at the time, and that may be the reason why he accepted to star in The Sixth Sense years later. It's a different film but it does seem to borrow certain ghostly elements from this romantic tale. I did find it kind of ironic that in the 90's you had these actors standing next to each other being forced to act as if they couldn't see one another, while now you actually have actors forced to talk to characters who aren't there but thanks to the magic of movies and CGI are easily placed later.estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Ghost

To me, Carl (Tony Goldwyn) was a very creepy guy. Also, Willie (Rick Aviles) was just as scary as he was. I was amazed at the way Sam could step through anything in his ghostly state.

68,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Charming and touching,7,12 May 2016,"Ahh, Ghost. What an authentic romance classic, a film that puts a big old grin on your face whether you want it to or not, a sloppy, smile that's just wide enough to catch the tears that fall as a result of the sadness which accompanies the sweet, two essential ingredients in any love story that hopes to affect us in either direction. Balance is key, and Ghost employs both the giddy, heart-skipping joy of romance and the looming possibility of threat and tragedy in equal measures, never getting too dark or to soppy, at least for me. Demi has never been more adorable, in one of her career highlights. Her and Patrick 'Roadhouse' Swayze play star-crossed young lovers, in the beginning stages of building their lives together, a time that should be unconditionally happy for both, and is, until one fateful event rips them apart and plunges the narrative into effect. They encounter a thief in an alley one night, and Swayze is killed. Only, his spirit remains behind, for more reasons than he at first realizes. He keeps a protective, loving eye on Moore, and is driven to the notion that his death was no accident, his lingering presence meant for the purpose of both truth, love and retribution. He is aided and assisted by a sassy psychic (Whoopi Goldberg) who acts as his conduit between both realms. There's supernatural intrigue and conspiracy afoot, but as exciting as that stuff is, it's the love story between Patrick and Demi that has kept generations rooted to the story. A romance film is nothing without two leads who share both chemistry and a great script, which this one supplies generously. They are a show stopping pair in their scenes together, and if their predicament doesn't draw forth both smiles and cries from you as a viewer, well, you're wading through the wrong genre, my friend. The two of them make this one an honest to goodness winner with their performances, supported by narrative elements that only raise the stakes of their relationship. A film which will never not be a classic, and everyone should have in their collection. Ditto.",Ghost
69,davispittman,A sweet touching love story,8,26 April 2017,"This movie was a pretty big deal back in 1990 when it was released. It's the story of Patrick Swayze, a man who was killed, trying to contact his girlfriend Demi Moore who is in danger. He contacts with Moore through Whoopi Goldberg, who is a supernatural medium. I love to the actors in this movie and I thought every one of them really nailed their performance. Whoopi Goldberg won her academy award for her supporting performance in this movie, she's funny and delightful as the medium who really isn't aware of her abilities until Patrick Swayze comes into her life. And let me just say that I absolutely adored Demi Moore's performance here, she is one of the best on cue criers I've seen in movies, when she cries in that touching scene where she finally gets to come into contact with her dead boyfriend, it's just the most romantic thing ever and it's her acting that makes it work so well. The actors have great chemistry with one another, Swayze and Goldberg work well on screen and are funny and Demi and Patrick have incredible romantic connection. The visual effects are stunning, especially for back in 1990, that's one of the things this film was praised for back then. All in all, it's not like amazing or breathtaking, but it's an entertaining sweet supernatural love story with great performances. 8/10.",Ghost

71,drystyx,a lot of great scenes sign of a great movie,10,13 May 2007,"This may not be a classic, but it comes close. It has one big attribute of most great movies, a lot of great scenes. The story is about Sam, who has a great life, and this movie is the opposite of CLICK. Unlike that stupid movie, this guy doesn't want to fast forward his life with a beautiful loving wife and great career. But it is taken away from him when he is killed. He becomes a ghost. And that might be one of only two flaws in the story. Why he can project his needs when billions of other dead souls can't. But a great movie like this endears us to the characters and plot enough so that this is a very trivial flaw. He finds he can communicate with a fake spiritualist (Whoopi, in a role few could do as well), which is the second flaw, since we have a feeling we've seen this character in this instance all too often. Hoever, again, if the movie is good enough we can overlook this. Without making spoilers, I can only add that the movie satisfies the viewer. There is romance, humor, logic, adventure, suspense, and great scenes. Among the great scenes that make the movie (I'll only mention some) are the scene where Sam follows his friend to the killer's apartment (actually just about every scene with his friend is classic), the scene where Whoopi goes to the bank, the scene where she leaves the bank, the scene where Sam is a ghost in the office with his friend, the scene where the friend hits on Sam's woman, the first scene with the little dark men, the second scene with the little dark men...I could go on and on. What is lost in all of this is one of the greatest emotional bits of capturing character ever, when Sam realizes what is going to happen to an evil man when the little dark men appear the second time, and he expresses true sorrow and compassion for a man who stole so much from him. This is one of the most poignant and heroic scenes ever in any movie I would find it very hard to believe anyone could not enjoy this movie. Truly a winner. Know what? This is a classic.",Ghost

Once in awhile people are cast in a movie who are so right for their roles you just can't picture anyone else who could play them. This is such a case, partcularly with Swayze who was wonderful and Demi Moore, despite having gone onto more of the ""tough girl"" kind of roles shines here-and I'm not even a major fan of hers. Moore is best when playing a more soft kind of role and here she is about as good as it gets. Ghost is definetly on its way to being a classic-or maybe it already is.

The supernatural element of his character makes for an interesting and sometimes humorous film. His interactions with Whoopi Goldberg, the only person who can see him, are magical and hilarious. One might say he shares the most chemistry with her throughout the film. Throughout the film viewers are treated to an interesting conspiracy, the supernatural and good performances. Ghost also includes the immortal Unchained melody song in what is now a memorable film scene where Demi and Patrick bond in the pottery scene. It is a simple and well told story that does not seek to over complicate Swayze's supernatural presence and viewers can go along with his journey because his story is far from over.

78,eric262003,A Film That Goes Beyond Excellent,10,16 August 2015,"Even though the film world has made this 1990 movie ""Ghost"" as being insignificant, inferior to other movies that came out in this time period. But to me Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae Brown could easily pass off as one of the most near-perfect, intriguing, mesmerizing characters to ever be featured on celluloid. Her character has truly exceeded any character that Charles Dickens or William Shakespeare ever created. Goldberg literally sold her character and when she graced the screen with her performance, people were just dying to see her such a dynamic performance and who could blame them.With the 1980's coming to a close, we has the honours to reflect what a decade it has been in the era of film-making. Some of the great creative minds emerged from this occasion. It was a time when thinking and direction was compatible. There was very few lazy remakes or CGI green screen dependency. It was originality and creativity all the way. There was no competition to see how much money you make in one day. Artists like Robert Greenwald was creating artful flicks like ""Xanadu"" and Ridley Scott was making original modern-day fairy tales like ""Legend"", no one expected that the 1990's would come along with a plethora of bummer films. It was like the creativity was lost. The colourful and the spontaneous dynamics were badly watered down with blandness and half-baked films that were only out there. The only film of the 1990's that had the charm that was lost in the 1980's was the 1996 movie ""Evita"". While the 1990's crept up with its grunge, baggy clothes and other societal lowering, the time to have something to embrace on was eagerly anticipating. So while cinema was going on the decline, 1990 did provide a gem that will eternally be etched in the hearts of many because everyone had already figured out this film was going to be special because they were getting tired of the grating films that were hitting the box office this film was selling faster than hotcakes. This was clearly Jerry Zucker's best directed film (no matter what, he never exceeded his expectations). It has everything to offer, great acting, brilliant script, a few chuckles, a few cries, but the score was excellent. I mean I love the oldies and one of the most beautiful ballads is ""Unchained Melody"" by The Righteous Brothers. If that song won't have you slow-dancing with a partner. I don't know what will? Even the special effects though low-key deserve mentioning.Even though ""Ghost"" is worthy of all its accolades it may surprise you that with the powerful big budget films that were coming out in 1990 like ""Mermaids"", ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Goodfellas"" and the grandest of them all ""Dances with Wolves"", ""Ghost"" was the biggest budgeted film that year, but was still the underdog in the Academy Awards category. What made this film stand out the most was the performance of Whoopi Goldberg as Oda Mae Brown. She sold her character above everyone else, even the late Patrick Swayze (his baby will always be ""Dirty Dancing""), and Demi Moore who's career stalled after the Brat Pack. It was her flair, her charisma that carries the beat of this movie. She truly stands out like no other performer. She truly is a diamond in the rough. Granted Miss Goldberg did win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar that year for her performance as Oda Mae Brown. And the critics around chewed on that notion including me. But their rhetoric is vague and at times not fully justified. But I must go deeper and to assume that Oda Mae Brown was around before we ever knew Whoopi Goldberg in fact Oda and Whoopi are two completely different people. What I'm trying to say is that I'm not a big fan of Whoopi Goldberg (not that I loathe her either) and that this movie and ""The Colour Purple"" were the two movies that made Whoopi a household name. I would love to see her make a sequel or even a remake to ""Ghost"". I mean her humanitarian efforts are phenomenal, but her acting is greatly missed. And the long awaited return of Oda Mae Brown gracing the screen is something I would pay to see.",Ghost

Basically, it's a very moralistic story about an unfinished life cut short and revenge following death, at the hands of the ghost that was murdered. Somewhat inconsistent, especially when he meets up with the ""subway ghost"" who is a truly disturbing character. Whoopie Goldberg runs away with an ""Oscar winning"" performance as the reluctant medium. She injects much humor into an otherwise humorousness movie which is quite terrifying at times and quite graphic as well. The ""pottery wheel"" love scene is famous but also infamous as producer Jerry Zucker mocks it in one of his own ""Naked Gun"" movies. Great and bad CGI abound, as ILM gets the Heavenly scenes right but bungles the ""Devilish takedown"" of the two villains: the white-collar embezzler and the drugged-up, stupid murderer. The ""soul-sucking"" evil spirits just don't seem convincing enough. Today, a movie about computers, stolen identity, and off-shore bank accounts is old hat, but it was fresh in 1990.

It's perhaps the most inconsistent film I've ever seen. Some parts brilliant, some parts ludicrous. Poor execution or poor idea? I can't tell. According to Bruce Joel Robin, back in 1990, he was told Ghost was the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood. It was even awarded the Oscar. It doesn't receive that much acclaim nowadays, Pulp Fiction must've blown it out of the water and Hollywood begged for forgiveness from Casablanca. It now stands quite oddly, part dated (though I can forgive misguided special effects) and part beyond its time. It's like Michael Jackson's Thriller. A deliberately mixed bag with something for everyone. In Ghost, every character is perceived in tone and style through a different genre. There's romance, comedy, crime thriller, murder mystery and even a touch of horror. Unfortunately, this makes it wildly erratic. In fact, while its first few punchy moments showed promise, it's first half hour is an utter lame bore. There's a few setups that are intelligent in hindsight, but Patrick Swayze's poor acting betrays the material. Unconvincing isn't even the word. He's absolutely laughable, his reactions to things are pure parody. Its iconic moments feel ridiculous in context. The film doesn't start to get bearable until Whoopi Goldberg's appearance. She's surprisingly delightful, I always kinda doubted whether she deserves her acclaim, but she certainly does. Her addition gives the film an incredibly fascinating and entertaining dynamic. Makes it a much richer and immersive film. She always earned belly laughs with every joke. And the twists and turns keep coming at a Shakespearean rate with the amount of betrayal. Despite Swayze's acting, the emotion of the film works and its metaphysical ideas of life after death are easy to connect to and it ends wonderfully life-affirming.However, while its admirably ambitious to try and display different characters through different genres and weave between them, it does mean we get immersed in one side of the story story and have that dissatisfying feeling of being disconnected from others in the film. Then leave that character we were immersed in and that's dissatisfying. I'm not sure why it doesn't work emotionally as it's a pretty great idea from Rubin and Zucker. I can't help but wonder what this story would be like as a play. There were many times when I really wanted to break away from the camera's limited perspective and look at a different character. The stage would allow that freedom and it would be a richer experience. Though they'd have to figure out how to do the passing-through-objects convincingly. I know there's a musical but it's sentimental enough already. Regardless, this film was a huge success. Maybe we can call Ghost the most commercial script ever written instead.7/10",Ghost

84,MartianOctocretr5,"Dramatically powerful, but marred by excessive comic relief",7,16 October 2009,"The film blends some divergent genre styles, and mostly succeeds. Where the film goes wrong is in too much ambition to be all things to all people, and in so doing, diminishes its own viability. The entire Oda Mae charlatan/psychic side line is distracting; Whoopi Goldberg plays her comic relief part way over the top, and draws far too much attention to herself. Somebody must have thought ""Believers in the paranormal will like this, but let's pander to the skeptics by letting them laugh at it, and then they'll like it too."" However, the self-jabbing sequence is executed awkwardly. This leaves the film with a confused identity, lost somewhere in a void between 6th Sense and Ghostbusters.Patrick Swayze plays his part well, except in scenes with Whoopi, where he gets oddly comedic. This makes her the focus, even though the tragic circumstances of his murder parting him forever from his love should be the cornerstone of the story. Demi Moore's acting is better than it usually is, but what's up with that hair of hers? She looks like she's going trick-or-treating as Ringo Starr. Most of the remaining cast are pretty decent, except for the dead souls that haunt Whoopi. They were just annoying.The plot develops well, and the memorably haunting ""Unchained Melody"" theme was the perfect choice. The eerie black shadow creatures, with their shrill howling and blindly malevolent behavior, were suitably demonic in their design. The murder mystery and suspenseful danger to an innocent person is skillfully done.Oda Mae should have been left on the cutting room floor. Otherwise, this film succeeds pretty well in its unusual genre-mixing approach.",Ghost

The soul of ""Ghost"" is sweet natured; it offers a little something for everybody provided they are content to let the odd corny moment and occasional spot of sappiness slide.All of the cast do well (even Swayze, despite it reportedly being offered to every possible leading man in Hollywood before him) and the concept is a true crowd-pleaser because it contains elements that will appeal to a variety of different types. Sensitive folk will connect with the pure love story, thriller fans will enjoy the details of the plot, and fantasy buffs will appreciate the effects and the exploration of the afterlife. It's a blend of different styles that works well throughout, and is undoubtedly one of the key reasons why the film became such a big hit.Stealing the show is supporting actress Whoopi Goldberg. At times it feels like the part of her character was expanded upon when the creative team saw for themselves what she was going to be able to do with it. I don't know whether or not that's true, but it's such a memorable performance that every now and again it even eclipses the main romance.If you're searching for a piece of popular entertainment that's manipulative in a good way, then ""Ghost"" is a one-stop shop catering to all your needs.",Ghost

I have already reviewed Dirty Dancing before. So now I am going to review Ghost, which to me, was his best film. I know a lot of people prefer Donnie Darko, but I actually enjoyed this film more. This film is more interesting, and more romantic than Dirty dancing. Though, I think that was a great film as it was, Ghost is even better.The 2 time Oscar winner is about a guy(Patrick Swayze)who is in love with his girlfriend(Demi Moore), but has a hard time saying it. One night when he is walking home with her he is murdered in the alley. He has the choice to walk into the light and refuses. So he is a ghost living on earth and is looking to find out who murdered him or who was behind his murder. He also realizes that his girlfriend is in trouble too, so he tries to save her.Ghost is a hell of a film. I loved it and there are many good performances. Including Whoopi Goldberg, who actually won the Oscar for this film. I would never want a friend like Sam's(Patrick Swayzes).

88,classicalsteve,Possibly the Best Supernatural Love Story Ever Filmed,8,5 May 2013,"What makes this film work is as much about the premise as it is about the acting and the music. The leads, Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg turn what could have been a B-grade forgotten film into a very touching experience. ""Ghost"" is one of a few handful of films which is actually a hybrid of other genres, in this case the love story and the supernatural ghost story, successfully combined. Few hybrid-genre films have been as successful while most fall flat probably because of the difficulty of one genre overshadowing the other. One successful example which comes to mind is the original Ghost Busters, which combined comedy a la Saturday Night Live and supernatural horror.Patrick Swayze, in possibly his best performance, plays Sam Wheat, a bank executive who has as his lover Molly Jensen, a kind and completely loyal woman who creates pottery. One of the most famous scenes prior to Wheat leaving the world of the living is when they both forge pottery together. Unbeknownst to either of them, some bank executives at Wheat's firm are embezzling funds, which they hide into an account held by a fictitious person. Wheat finds out about the discrepancies but becomes the target of a hit, successfully carried out, which kills Sam Wheat the living person and turns him into a ghost. Before leaving for the afterlife, Wheat decides to investigate further into the circumstances which killed him, and solicits the help of a crack-pot con artist-turned psychic, Oda Mae Brown, in an academy-award winning performance by Whoopi Goldberg. A strange threesome develops the Ghost, Brown and Jensen to investigate the scandalous behavior of Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn), former colleague and supposed-friend to the late Sam Wheat. In one of the most moving of scenes, the Ghost of Sam Wheat lets his presence known to the lover he left in the world of the living, Molly, played with absolute believability by Demi Moore in possibly her best performance. Demi Moore's emotions and tears are what make this film work. When she realizes the ghost of Sam is in her presence, we as the audience are taken by her emotions. We suspend our disbelief and are captured by Moore's performance. She believes she has been touched by the ghost which makes us believe that we are also in the midst of a supernatural presence. Strangely, I have seen few scenes in films as moving as this one. Only certain scenes from Casablanca rival it.Now certainly, I wouldn't rank this as one of the greatest films ever made, but it is a surprisingly strong offering, and one of the most moving supernatural stories I have ever seen. Horror movies are not typically designed to elicit tears in the audience, but this one does. The three leads are perfectly cast and make us care about the experience. One of the reasons I think Ghost succeeds is that it hits on the true emotions we feel in regards to the loss of a loved one. While ghost stories are usually designed to invoke feelings of dread and fear, we sometimes forget that the emotions are about love and loss in the real world when someone close to us ""passes on"". ""Ghost"" reminds us that we often want to hear from loved ones who are no longer a part of the world of the living.",Ghost
89,gftbiloxi,Corporate Movie-Making At Its Most Predictable,3,16 May 2005,"GHOST hearkens back to films of the 1940s and 1950s which mixed screwball comedy, romance, and suspense with a ghost story. And GHOST reads exactly like a cross between TOPPER RETURNS and A GUY NAMED JOE: Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is murdered--but his spirit remains earthbound, seeking to uncover his own killer and re-establish contact with his beloved and grieving Molly (Demi Moore.) Eventually Sam manages to establish contact with a fraudulent medium named Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg)--and in exchange for helping her out in the spiritualist business he convinces her to act as his agent on the earthly plane.All of this sounds fine in theory, but GHOST plays like something created by corporate marketing men, and instead of a fantasy confection the film serves up something more akin to a three month old poundcake awash in slobbering sentimentality. The cast makes absolutely no attempt to create characters--but given the zero-quality script level you can hardly blame them; the story itself is extremely predictable, and if you don't know who killed Sam halfway through the film you need to run out for quick brain-scan; and everything from cinematography to editing to design is just as ho-hum as it can be.The only reason to watch this film is for Whoopi Goldberg, who is absolutely hilarious as Oda Mae Brown--but frankly even Goldberg's comic turn can't make this turkey fly, and if you want to see her at her comic best I'd recommend you catch some of her stand-up work. My recommendation? Hunt down a copy of TOPPER RETURNS and A GUY NAMED JOE and watch the originals instead.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Ghost

93,bellino-angelo2014,Truly a classic from the 1990s that stands the test of time,8,29 December 2020,"I have seen this movie for the first time at 14 and I liked it very much then. Now, 7 years later, I catched this movie on TV one evening during last summer and I still liked it like the very first time. And it truly deserves its cult status. Now I can go to the review.Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is a bank clerk working in New York City that begins to share a loft with his girlfriend Molly Jensen (Demi Moore). After one evening at the theater Sam and Molly are harassed by a mugger who stabs Wheat on the chest and he suddenly returns on Earth in the form of a ghost. Now as a ghost he has a mission: to take care of his girlfriend and find out who killed him. He suddenly meets a sensitive named Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) that is the only one who can talk to him and reluctantly accepts to help him. Sam soon discovers the truth: his best friend and business partner Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn) made secret deals with Willy Lopez (the mugger) and secretly ordered him to kill Sam for stealing the notebook with all the passwords of the bank accounts. So now it's up to Sam and Oda Mae to stop Carl and Willy and save Molly. I won't spoil the rest since many reviewed this movie already.So, why this movie holds up well? Most obviously the acting: it's great by everyone. Patrick Swayze is very credible as the lead and you will always root for him. Demi Moore gives a very heartfelt performance and it's probably one of her best, Tony Goldwyn is very good as the villain who of course ends the way he deserves and Whoopi Goldberg shines as the sensitive. She is probably my favourite character in the movie, and mostly because her lines were at times hysterical. And this movie gives also a nice message: don't kill people for money or fame, because it will end very badly for you if you do it.However, a true classic from the 1990s that even if you watch it after some years like I did, you will still like it, like the very first time.

(It's highly emotional in places. One of the best and most quoted scenes is the scene where Demi's character is creating and molding a clay pot.)

Director Jerry Zucker, Writer Bruce Joel Rubin Before Titanic (1997) Ghost, released in 1990, was the most beloved romantic movie of the 90's. It is still considered a romantic classic and has all the makings of a terrific movie sans the romance itself. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore sizzle as the married couple Sam and Molly. Sam is killed after a botched mugging. His rival Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn) is bent on stealing money from his bank account and stealing his wife. Whoopie Goldberg plays Oda Mae Brown, a fraudulent psychic who claims to talk to the dead. When Sam dies, he becomes a ghost to extract justice. Sam is able to communicate with Oda Mae. Whoopie is actually at her best in this film. I do know she had already made several funny movies in the 80's but this one is quite delightful. Of course, Sister Act made her famous too but as Oda Mae she's a real riot! Later on, Molly learns of his being a ghost. In its day, Ghost was a combination of thriller, paranormal surrealism and romance, an odd mix. The theme song ""Unchained Melody"" by the Righteous Brothers sold like crazy in record stores and was always on the radio. There is much to appreciate about this film. The cinematography is quite beautiful. It is both dark and light, tragic and triumphant. Yes, Molly has lost her husband but not his love. As a ghost, their relationship has never been stronger. The scene in which Sam (as a ghost) is caressing and kissing Molly as she works on the potter-wheel is still incredibly erotic and romantic! How can one not find that romantic ? Ultimately, evil is defeated and good triumphs. The ending is satisfying in every way. In fact, that ending is one of the many I have loved in movies. Also, this is one of the films that at the time were just meant to be watched with no real need to overanalyze it and to just enjoy it. The early to mid 90's was the time of VHS and this was one of the hottest videos in stores at the time.

101,caa821,Not better the second time around,4,5 November 2006,"There are some films you enjoy seeing a second time - or even more. This flick is not one of them for me. I remember reading a reviewer's comment about Patrick Swayze (I believe Leonard Maltin, either regarding this movie or ""Dirty Dancing"") describing Swayze's acting range ""from A to B.""That, plus the fact that upon seeing this movie again, after a long passage of time, I realized how summarily unappealing the characters and performances were in this picture. You can't have a more fictional premise than the lead character and others walking around while dead - but, nevertheless, there should have been some evidence of just what the hell Swayze did in his supposed high-finance job. Tony Goldwyn seemed to know more than Swayze, but his efforts seemed solely centered on money laundering, the crux of the story.Whoopi Goldberg provided nothing funny, or even the least bit believable - especially in the scene where her bizarre character bumbled her way through drawing a bank check for multi-millions, from the manager, with less effort detailed than you'd have cashing a small check in your home bank, where you know everyone and appear twice a week.Despite the steamy scene with both leads drenching themselves with the soft, wet clay which Demi Moore was sculpting, there was zero chemistry between the two lovebirds. And the enjoyment of this scene was simply demonstrating two very attractive persons in a rather unusual, spontaneous romantic interlude. Beyond that, even this scene lacked any ""chemistry,"" or even a trace of emotion on Swayze's part. The nature of this story is worth perhaps a 7* rating for viewing it the first time - but 4* is generous for a subsequent one.",Ghost

The persistence continued as she started to name members of my family and my parent's home address. Who is this person? I never felt so vulnerable. I guess that's how celebrities feel when fans approach them. The woman in question was dead on correct in her claims but I still was dumbfounded, puzzled to her connection with me. The movie ""Ghost"" deals with the afterlife, murder and a touching love story of a different kind. Banker Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) stumbles upon a bank account with a huge sum attached.

That evening Sam and his artistic live in girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore) are walking a deserted downtown street after seeing an off-Broadway play.

Meanwhile the metamorphosis of afterlife take place as a stream of light appears before newly deceased Sam. Sam ignores heavens call and remains along side Molly. Dead and frustrated Sam sees that his love Molly is now in danger as our murderer, Willie Lopez (Rick Aviles) comes back to Molly's loft the next day. With the help of Molly's cat our murderer Willie flees. Sam follows our scoundrel back to his Brooklyn flat. Sam stumbles upon a fortune teller business featuring two sisters and their clairvoyant Oda Mae Brown (Whoppie Goldberg). During one of Ms. Brown's sessions Sam interrupts a disingenuous seance as he gives his take on her fraudulent ways. Oda yells , ""Who said that?"" Oda apparently can hear every word Sam says even though she can't see him. Sam spends the rest of the time coaxing Oda to be a go between so he can warn Molly of the impending danger of the murderous Willie Lopez. The early stages of the film focus on the frustration of Sam not being able to move objects and speak to people. Oda as the interpreter give some comic relief during the entire film.

Some notable performances by renown character actor with distinguished features Vincent Schiavelli a agitated ghost constantly kicking Sam off his subway train. Great special effects showing the anomaly of the after life as Sam gets a lesson from our disgruntled Vincent. Nice twisting plot which takes you to a peaceful ending.

105,DavidSim240183,A slightly insubstantial but entertaining ghost story,8,2 April 2007,"Ghost was the No 1 box office smash hit of 1990. It made household names of rising stars Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore and netted an Oscar for the always excellent Whoopi Goldberg. Its easy to see where its appeal lies. A heart wrenching love story. A compelling murder plot. Moments of real comedy. And fantastic special effects. All the components needed to turn Ghost into a crowd pleaser. Not everything about the film always rings true. And some of the revelations about the afterlife are disappointingly clumsy and clichéd, but for the most part Ghost is a film that's remarkably assured, and delivers on what it promises.Swayze is the yuppie investment councillor Sam Wheat who enjoys a blossoming relationship with Moore's artist Molly Jensen. It all goes sour when Sam is shot and killed by a mugger. But remains on Earth as a spirit. Unable to be seen or heard by anyone. And incapable of physical human contact. But when it turns out his death was all part of an elaborate setup, Sam enlists the aid of charlatan psychic Oda Mae Brown (Goldberg, gloriously entertaining) to warn Molly that the killers are after her now.Although a lot of people were drawn to Ghost for its romantic elements (the pottery scene is now infamous) what I found more entertaining about Ghost was the logical approach it takes in weaving a story from a spirit's POV. When Sam becomes a ghost, it takes a while for him to learn the rules. He learns right away that he can't touch anything. But it takes longer for him to learn that its not impossible for him to regain the ability to move objects. He discovers this when he meets a more seasoned ghost on a subway train (the late Vincent Schiavelli).Ghost is actually a film that draws up some fascinating dimensions concerning the spirit world. Its when it directly addresses the aspects of Heaven and Hell that it slips up but I'll go into that later. In this film, there are many people who have died but haven't moved on. There's an almost spiritual community living among us. Sam is a relative newcomer, and is taught by that subway ghost to channel his emotions into manipulating physical objects. For the simple reason that he's not physical anymore.We also learn about the limitations of being a ghost. It is possible for spirits to communicate with the living by possessing them. We get to see this twice. And it happens to Whoopi twice. The first is played strictly for laughs after Oda Mae learns her charlatan psychic powers are for real. Ghosts have flocked to her to be heard once more. One ghost gets impatient with her and possesses her body. When he's forced out, it saps his energy for a short time. The second instance is more poignant when Oda Mae allows Sam to use her body to caress Molly (although the film shows Sam doing this, and not Oda Mae).Another thing of interest is the surprisingly smart screenplay written by Bruce Joel Rubin. Not only does he handle the spiritual side of Ghost with consummate skill, but he also crafts a credible thriller, and keeps things ticking along nicely, balancing the drama with comedy whenever things threaten to get too maudlin. Jerry Zucker's direction is also worthy of mention because its so confident and assured. Surprising considering he comes from a background of screwball comedy.As for the performances, they're a little uneven. Although Patrick Swayze is not one of the greatest actors to grace the Earth, he's quite well suited to the part of a ghost. In fact this is probably his best role. But its in his scenes with Whoopi where he really shines. They make quite an amusing double act. There's one inspired scene where he has to talk her through closing an account and half the time she misinterprets his instructions. Or when he (eventually) convinces her to hand over a cheque for 4 million dollars to some nuns (a bit prophetic for what was to come for Whoopi!).Demi Moore is typically flat as a pancake and spends half the time crying her way through the movie. In the supporting cast, Tony Goldwyn does well as the sleazy best friend who set Sam up for drug money. And Vincent Schiavelli gives an interestingly live-wire performance as the ghost who helps Sam get in touch with his inner self.But its Whoopi Goldberg who steals the film out from everyone else. She's downright hilarious from the moment she appears. She's clearly having a ball as the fake medium who's more surprised than anyone when she finds her powers are genuine. She gets all the best lines and she knows it. And she has greater chemistry with Swayze than he does with Moore. She deserved to walk away with the Oscar. Sometimes they do get it right!The special effects have lost a little of their sparkle over the years but hold up well. The images of Sam moving through a human body and seeing blood and inner workings is striking. Or seeing him walk through doors and leap from train to train is memorable. But the scenes of the light of Heaven and demons from Hell are cheesy as anything, and recalls some of the limited imagination of Flatliners, made the same year.But Ghost still commands a certain attention and is a great deal of fun. It sometimes gets a bit too mushy for its own good, and wicked people punished for being bad and good people rewarded for being good is too simplistic. But thanks to a slick narrative, good plot twists and great performances (and in that I mean Whoopi!) Ghost is a film that flies high.",Ghost

I remember that Premiere Magazine did their annual Top 20 prediction list of what would gross the most money that summer, and Ghost wasn't even in their list of 20. But the critical reviews were high, and the word-of-mouth was so strong, that it ended up being the #1 summer flick that year.

108,roghache,"Cute, funny, romantic fantasy thriller...but some disclaimers",5,16 March 2006,"When I saw this movie some years ago, I confess that I found it cute, funny, and romantic. However, I've matured a bit and now find that despite its love tale, suspense, and humor, I have several difficulties with it. First of all, I can accept ghosts as pure fantasy (as in A Christmas Carol), but the villains being dragged off after death to a presumably unpleasant place is neither amusing nor trivial, not something you should joke about.The ridiculous plot is entertaining. The story revolves around an unmarried young couple, an investment banker Sam and a ceramic artist Molly, who have just begun living together. However, Sam is suddenly murdered one night by a 'thief' in an alley while walking home from the theatre with Molly. The dead Sam discovers that he is trapped as a ghost (it's a fantasy, remember?) and must warn Molly that she, too, is in danger from his murderers. He is unable to communicate with her, so enlists the assistance of a reluctant phony psychic named Oda Mae, who realizes she can hear (though not see) Sam.Major sex symbols play the leads. Patrick Swayze is cast in the role of Sam, who in the afterlife must bring about justice for his murder as well as warn his beautiful, endangered lover. Molly is played by Demi Moore, an actress definitely not my favourite, though I admit she is suitably sensuous in this role. The best performance is definitely given by Whoopi Goldberg, who won a Supporting Actress Oscar for playing Oda Mae. The psychic's role is kind of a crazy one, but Whoopi pulls it off brilliantly.*** WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD *** This popular flick has of course a legendary, super romantic, tearjerker of an ending that requires a whole box of Kleenex. That final scene where (the late) Sam is able to physically interact with Molly for one last final farewell, and comes up behind, touching her as she's molding the clay, all to the unforgettable, haunting (no pun intended) strains of Unchained Melody...you'll picture this scene forever after every time you hear this song.All terribly touching, except I hate to put a damper, but I have to agree with a comment I noticed on the Message Board. Pity Sam and Molly weren't married to start here. They weren't apparently committed enough before living together to take vows pledging enduring love and fidelity through all circumstances, so what is so wildly romantic now about this farewell scene? Yes, they were engaged apparently, but I had to kind of laugh at one reviewer's comment about them moving in together and beginning 'premarital LIFE', a euphemism surely for the real meaning, premarital SEX. Anyway, I lapped that farewell scene right up myself along with everyone else way back when, but I kind of question now whether it wouldn't have all been just a little more meaningful if this same cute fantasy had featured instead of the engaged live ins, an endearing pair of young newlyweds.It's a fun, touching movie, but there ARE many more meaningful and genuinely moving love stories out there in the cinematic world. Remember this is a FANTASY, and don't get either your morals or your theology from it.",Ghost
109,alainenglish,Touching and hilarious romantic thriller,9,14 December 2008,"""Ghost"" has been riffed as a piece of romantic cheese, but really it is a classic movie incorporating everything from romance, horror and laugh-out-loud comedy.A well-to-do accountant Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze), shares an uptown apartment with his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore), a clay potterer, a lady with whom he is very much in love. However, Sam is murdered in an attempted mugging and as he remains on earth in spiritual form he must find a way to protect his girlfriend before the killer strikes again...Swayze and Moore work well as a couple and you really believe in the connection between them. But you need some eccentricity in this kind of picture, in order to balance out the romantic element. The film gets this in the form of Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg). The joke with this character is that she is a fake medium, who learns to her surprise that her powers are in fact real. Goldberg is excellent in this role, her timing is perfect and she is hilarious throughout. Also of note is Vincent Schiavelli as the deranged Subway Ghost, who teaches Sam how to affect the world around him. This a brief but scene-stealing performance.The villains come in the form of Tony Goldwyn, as Sam's slimy, double-dealing and increasing desperate best friend. Rick Aviles is also well-cast is low-life hit-man Willie Lopez.Best of all is Patrick Swayze who heads the cast as the title character. Swayze takes a lot of riffing for his performances, but having seen him in three movies (including this one) I don't know why. Sure he's not a great actor, but he's not a bad one. He creates a terrific chemistry between him and Moore, and an even better comic chemistry in his scenes with Whoopi Goldberg. His partnership with the latter really makes the picture. Check the scene where keeps her up all night singing ""I'm Henry the Eighth I Am"".The film is wrapped up nicely with a lovely moving theme tune and some good ghostly special effects. Despite some serious moments, in the main the film is very light-hearted and doesn't take itself too seriously.Definitely one to watch for a good night in.",Ghost

111,luke-a-mcgowan,Like a cake - a thick layer of sticky icing with a bit of substance,5,4 April 2015,"You can honestly skip the first half hour of Ghost. Its not worth your time. All you need to know is that Patrick Swayze is handsome, Demi Moore is cute and they love each other. A lot. Like seriously, they love each other. They even make clay together.Still with me? OK, good. Once Swayze's character is killed, the story picks up. Swayze performs well as Wheat, his grief and his anger bubble on Swayze's face. When Whoopi Goldberg pops into the story as Oda Mae Brown, she provides a bit of entertainment but I know she's capable of more. Moore is great at the emotional side of Molly, but doesn't do much more than that. Vincent Schiavelli pops up as a poltergeist haunting the subways in New York, probably the most interesting character. A little bit of imagination gives Schiavelli's character incredible depth. The way Swayze interacts (or rather doesn't) with the other characters is very well executed, and requires good acting chops from all involved. The pacing is good but writing a bit sloppy. There is a reason the only thing anyone ever thinks of from this film is the clay scene. The music and chemistry between Moore and Swayze are the film's strongest assets.Ghost is sweetly sentimental, a nice watch, but definitely didn't deserve two Oscars, and didn't touch me in the way I had hoped it would.",Ghost

113,The_Core,Entertaining but silly,7,17 February 2002,"I find ""Ghost"" to be a highly entertaining bit of silliness.  The believability factor here is absolute zero, so leave your brain at the door -- but the film is funny, entertaining and moving at parts.  The (much discussed) ending IS in fact sickeningly sweet and sentimental (as well as straining credibility to the point of embarrassment), but it can't put the film into the ""new age drivel"" category since the movie never does take itself very seriously.Overall, a very entertaining and engaging film with some over the top moments, and an ending almost as ""bad"" as Fatal Attraction.  You don't have to enjoy love stories to like this film (although it will help) -- if you can suspend disbelief (or just ignore it) and don't have too many preconceived notions of ""after death,"" you will be entertained.7/10",Ghost

Of course she over-acted in every scene - what else? This movie needed all the help it could get. I couldn't see where in New York City this film was shot, but that's the way it looks, guys. SO chic to have a million-dollar loft in dangerous parts of the city.I think Patrick Swayze and Demie more and Tony Goldman (and the many extras) did their roles o.k., such as they were. I don't think Jerry Zucker could have done much more with Bruce Rubin's script. I suspect there was a lot of re-writing as the movie was filmed. The love-story aspect was good - thank heavens Swayze had ""the subway-ghost"" to teach him........I thought it was a much more recent movie - sure I saw an ad in the local paper for it. Re-release?

117,kyle-cruse,Something for everyone,9,20 June 2009,"Although it might sound like a cliché phrase, I feel that ""Ghost"" is a film that has something for everyone in it. Such a combination of fantasy, romance, thrills, drama, and comedy would be risky in many other films, but it works very well here. The film involves Sam (Patrick Swayze), a man who is murdered on the streets and, as a ghost, discovers that the man who killed him also plan to kill his girlfriend (Demi Moore) and rob the bank at which he worked. He attempts to communicate with a psychic (Whoopi Goldberg, Oscar-winner for this role) and get her to warn his girlfriend. The main plot is a fantasy by nature, though the cross-genres are very evident here. It is a very romantic film, and I believe that Swayze and Moore have some of the greatest on-screen chemistry I've ever seen. There are thrilling scenes involving fights for those who like action movies. The film is also decently funny at times, mostly thanks to wisecracks and situations by Whoopi Goldberg. I have never professed to be a fan of Goldberg, but this role was completely enjoyable and made the whole film even more worthwhile. It takes about 30 minutes for the film to really get going, and some parts can be somewhat bizarre, but hold on. The rest of the film is excellent in just about every way. This is an all-time favorite, and I believe everyone can find some aspect of the film they can enjoy.***1/2 out of ****",Ghost

Today, it is hard to believe the success of this movie. It grossed over $505.7 million at the box office on a budget of $22 million and it was the highest-grossing film of 1990. Adjusted for inflation, as of 2015, ""Ghost"" was the 93rd-highest-grossing film of all time domestically in the US. Furthermore, the film was nominated for five Academy Awards and won the awards for Best Supporting Actress for Goldberg and Best Original Screenplay. Swayze and Moore both received Golden Globe Award nominations for their performances, while Goldberg won the BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Saturn Awards in addition to the Oscar.While the acting certainly isn't bad, it's not impressive either.

Demi Moore was newly married to Bruce Willis and at the start of her lucrative career. Whoopi was still funny and amusing and you couldn't see a trace of the nasty person she would become. Tony Goldwyn was so young and not yet presidential. The acting is a little bit campy but that was also how it was done in the late 80's when NYC was still gritty and full of crime.

126,steven_torrey,Ghost--Shakespearian justice,10,23 June 2010,"When I saw this movie in 1990, I was impressed with that sense of justice that occurs at the end of the movie. The Ghosts carry off to hell the soul of the perpetrator of murder immediately after he had been killed by a large shard of window glass.At the end of 1995 Richard III with Ian Mckellenan, Richard falls off a girder into what could be easily construed as the fires of eternal damnation as punishment for his evil machinations.In Road to Perdition, Tom Hanks as Michael Sullivan gets justice for the murder of his wife and son, even to the extent of killing his own foster-father. Foster-father and Michael Sullivan are in a church basement when his Foster-father, Paul Newman as John Rooney, says to his son: ""Neither one of is bound for heaven."" A pivotal point in the movie reminding the viewer that Michael Sullivan does not want his son on the Road to Perdition, and hence the necessity of the ending.These ideas of judgment in the afterlife are as old as Dante. In the Inferno, evil doers are afflicted in the afterlife in mockery of the sins they committed in the temporal life.And that idea itself is as old as Plato's Gorgias where the Ferryman carries souls to a place of purification or a place where there is no redemption, so dark are their sins.In a day and age where hedonism plays such a powerful role in the American soul, in a day and age where people can lose their soul to drug addiction in less time than it takes for a TV sitcom and for less money than a pack of cigarettes, these movies from Hollywood remind us of an afterlife where a soul is punished for an eternity.",Ghost

129,jaddison383,Movie Entertainment at it's Finest,7,19 June 2007,"I went into Ghost a little apprehensive. I had heard so much about it, and it was supposedly the crowning moment of one of my favorite actresses: Whoopi Goldberg. However, my apprehensions were instantly wiped away. This movie lived up to all of it's praise! It's the story of two young lovers Sam (Patrick Swayze) and Molly (Demi Moore). They have just moved in together. After a night out on the town, Sam is brutally killed by a seemingly random mugger and Molly holds Sam's bloody corpse in her arms- all while Sam's spirit watches. He has been left to wander Earth and desperately try to protect Molly. He gets help from Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) a psychic fraud who has more power than she realized. Together, Sam and Oda Mae begin to piece together the puzzle of Sam's death, and uncover something much more sinister than they ever imagined.The whole cast does an excellent job here. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore play the roles of grieving lovers perfectly. Ms. Moore is especially affecting. But it's Whoopi Golberg's fantastic performance as Oda Mae Brown that truly steals the show. Her performance is hilarious and endearing throughout, and she takes the film to an entirely new level. She's really is half of what makes it so good.This, in my opinion, is a great film. It entertains, it thrills you, and it even moves you. The writing is also excellent. The only place the film suffers is the special effects. Even they are fine- accept for the demons. The demons of the film are laughable. That is one major downfall.

I saw it first all those years ago and I liked it much more at the time.But, if you REALLY want to see how an actor should NOT act, just watch Swayze's performance for a Masterclass. In this movie, he has just two facial expressions in his repertoire. The soppy loving one and the WTF one. Most of his movie was spent with the WTF one cemented on his dial and that really does detract from what would otherwise be a better movie. The other main character in this movie, Carl, played by Tony Goldwyn, obviously drew heavily on Swayze's performance with his own very similar line in soppy and WTF expressions.The one real saving grace in Ghost is the positively delicious Demi Moore as Molly. She was worth the price of admission in 1990 and these days she justifies this month's Netflix subscription all on her own.I still kind of like Ghost despite Swayze and his clone.JMV",Ghost
133,CihanVercan,"When You're DEAD, It's ALL OVER; but When You're LOVED, It's FOREVER !",8,25 September 2008,"The imaginative but well-conceived idea of dishing up a romance upon lovers communicating spiritually owing to one of them is dead, was first filmed by Steven Spielberg 8 months before the Ghost's silver screen release. Spielberg's movie Always(1989) had classy use of visuals fulfilling the needs of viewers with mystery-based expectations. Yet, Always lacked the sense of essential romance concept, despite having the same plot and even the same storyline in Ghost. Originally the idea has been created by Chandler Sprague and David Boehm.However, Ghost accomplished of what ""Always"" tried and failed to accomplish. Thanks to the great acting trio of Patrick Swayze + Demi Moore + Whoopi Goldberg, for together they registered indelible moments into Ghost. It is scraped in our memory how in time Molly and Sam happen to keep their thoughts off each others' feelings, and that taught us: ""Love begins with emotions, ends with thoughts"". On this account they never called off their faith on believing that they will keep an enduring love affair. These indelible scenes in Ghost are conceptually cut where the editing was so impressive that instead of trying to make the story more plausible, it empowered the devotion of lovers onto their relation. The scene which Sam's ghost drew upon Oda Mae's body to break the longing with Molly by kissing her is an imperishable cinematic instant. I was in love with someone, and it was February,2005; we were both watching the Ghost on TV, both talking on the phone. Then that scene came upon(Sam's ghost kissing Molly in Oda Mae's body), I felt lost deep in my heart seeking the girl I'm talking on the phone. I heard she was crying and sobbing, and keep saying to me: ""I will never forget the first time you kissed me and I don't need to be alive to recall this"" Ghost is one timeless romantic masterpiece that had its moments. For me the kissing scene was the best kiss in movies of all time. MTV had honoured this kiss as well, several years after the release of the movie, as the best kiss in '90s. Superimposing that, the scenes where Oda Mae Brown convinces Molly that Sam's ghost is around her and then Molly reasons with police that Oda Mae knows what nobody is able to know but Sam and herself only, are the scenes that deliver the magic beyond eyes and beyond ears.To watch Ghost is in the to do list of what to do when you're on a date.",Ghost

My biggest gripe is the god-awful ""evil"" special effects that contrast so poorly against some exemplary night shots of New York. I can sense Adam Greenberg howling at the special effects supervisor. It leaves me wondering how much better it could be made today from just a technical standpoint. Swayze did his best work here and injected just the right level of humor and horror--- unfortunately some of it is marred by less than state of the art SFX work (oddly, I could make the same argument to STARMAN, albeit Jeff Bridges' performance was far superior).

136,n-mo,Worth a good try,7,10 June 2013,"There are many movies which deal with death and the afterlife. The problem with most of them is that their unwillingness to respect any established boundaries of moral theology ungrounds the entire universe and leaves a product that is unhuman.""Ghost"" does not make that mistake. Although the metaphysics are clearly fantastical, we can suspend disbelief, because it is quite clear throughout that love and good works are the path to salvation, while hatred and evil deeds are the path to damnation. While there is no overt religious iconography, there are still a few satisfying if amorphous suggestive elements that a discerning eye can easily connect to formal religious doctrine.Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae is often written off as just another ""Magical Negro"" trope. It is true that hers is a black supporting character whose role in the primary plot is to expedite, through (highly) extraordinary means, the resolution of the white protagonists' conflict. However, Oda Mae is a far more interesting character than either Sam or Molly, both in personality and in backstory, and is also, unlike Sam and Molly, dynamic: along the way to getting them out of their glut, she is forced to confront her rotten past as a charlatan and turn her life around. There is a partial inversion of the trope here, for it is the undeveloped, static and almost supernaturally angelic Sam who ends up leading the formerly banally criminal Oda Mae to salvation, and she repays him by helping to save Molly, the woman he loves.Although, it's not entirely clear that Sam was actually meant to be so bland, and indeed, if you're watching the movie looking for personal inspiration, he and Molly might not be the best in terms of making an emotional connection. It's clear that they love each other very deeply, and for many people that may well be enough to make an emotional connection.

After a tragic mugging episode the banker Sam loose his life and leaves Molly to face the cruel reality on her own. Sam is persistent to let Molly know that he is still there watching and protecting her. By the act of coincidence Sam finds a way to communicate his loved one with the help of fraud sidekick Oda Mae Brown (hilarious Whoopi Goldberg whose Academy Award-winning performance was very well earned!). There is some twist and turns, some difficulties but nothing can stop the true love finding it ways. Even if it does mean beyond the grave.""Ghost"" was the unexpected hit movie of the year 1990. It won two Oscars. Dazzling Goldberg got a Golden Man for Best Supporting Actress and Bruce Joel Rubin got his prize for his writing skills. It launched the era of new special effect techniques, and boosted the careers of Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze.First time I saw the movie it didn't affect me as much as it did when I saw it for the second time. I wept like a little waterfall and felt strongly that there must be a life after death.Vincent Schiavelli was dark but sympathetic Subway Ghost who guided Sam on his path to become a real ghost.The film produced some of the funniest scenes in movie history. While Sam is trying to get Oda Mae to help him he tortures her by singing in a monotonous, deep-voiced way ""I'm Henry the Eight I am""! That's so great. Also the word ""ditto"" became famous. I bet the ""Ghost-generation"" has repeatedly said it to their loved ones.If you manage get your mind open and let ""Ghost"" into your heart it effects might just surprise you! 9,5/10",Ghost
139,kupcr,"This Is NOT A Horror, More Of A Romantic One",8,27 May 2020,"I decided to watch this one again after so many years. It is indeed one of my favourite Whoopi Goldberg movies. She's WONDERFUL in this. I loved her work since 'Colour Purple' and 'Jumpin' Jack Flash'. In 'Ghost', she plays a medium named Oda Mae Brown who may not have people's best interests in heart and she gets entangled in a sheme that gets people killed. I hope you will watch this film, since it does have Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore in this. The story follows a banker by the name of Sam Wheat who is in love with Molly, played by Moore. I really appreciated how she was able to immerse herself in her character, with the late Swayze's becoming more and more emotionally tied to her, but Sam's friend Carl, played excellently by Tony Goldwyn, eventually shows his true colours and they discover that he was not to be trusted.",Ghost
140,miken-3,Great!!!,10,6 February 2005,"This is one of my top 50 favorite movies. Everybody is great in it from Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore to Whoppi Goldberg. Even the two villains were excellent though I heard that the actor who played Willie Lopez actually passed away not long after making the film.Sam Wheat a banker, is murdered during a mugging while coming from a show with his girlfriend Mollie. For some reason Wheat is still walking the Earth, now in ghost form. He follows Mollie and finds that the killer was really after a password that he had to authorize funds transfers through the bank. Now Mollie is also in danger from the killers and Sam feels helpless.Sam then happens upon Goldberg, who is running a scam as a medium who can communicate with the dead. Apparently, Goldberg can hear Sam talk so Sam uses Goldberg to try to communicate with Mollie and warn her of danger.Sam then realizes that the only way to protect Mollie is to be able to use some sort of physical force. The only problem is as a ghost he has no physical substance so he cannot touch anything. Or can he? Sam learns that maybe he can touch objects when he encounters another ghost who is able to do just that. The other ghost turns out to be one of the most entertaining characters of the film.The movie has it all from a love story, to excellent comedy, fairly decent special effects and a great story.",Ghost

I would say this is probably one of Whoopi's finest acting performances - OK it might be lightweight and comedic, but hey, there's nothing wrong with that!!! And it takes a great actress to pull off comedy the way that she does! Plenty of sentimental moments. It's simplistic in its message, but that's not a flaw, it's an accolade. If you've experienced somebody very close to you who has died, this is the way you would like to think that they cross over, if you believe there's something else after this earthly life. The sentimental scenes are acted beautifully. Sit back and enjoy!",Ghost

Ghost is lighting in a bottle, perfect acting jobs by three people in Hollywood that get no respect, (Moore, Swayze, and Whoopi Goldberg. A wonderful story of fantasy and love mixed with comedy.

145,jofitz27,Excellent,10,8 January 2005,"Patrix Swayze is one of my favourite actors. The first time I saw him on screen, he was in Point Break, and was great. When I rented this out and found out he was a character in Point Break, I was much more hopeful. And am glad. This, no matter what anyone says, really is a great great film.Sam and Molly are a seemingly happy couple living in an apartment in an American city. Sam is in the financial business and Molly is seemingly a house-wife. His supposed best friend Karl and him are partners, only when he is betrayed and killed. His never-ending love for Molly allows him to stay on Earth, but only as a ghost, hence the title. After an emotional scene in which he sees his dead body, he is determined to make contact with Molly and warn her of the trouble she is in. He finds help in a phony ""pshycic"" who actually has powers, and she, reluctantly (after a hilarious encounter) decides to help him. At first, Molly doesn't believe the seemingly impossible equation. But as more and more things fit, she begins to believe. Could it be possible? No matter how many bad things you hear about this film (hopefully you won't hear many) do not listen. I'm not a huge fan of romantic comedies but this, as well as making you laugh endlessly, keeps you on the edge of your seat as well as entertaining. Emmaculatly well done, this is a never-ending classic that has found a safe, comfortable place in my film collection. Overall: ***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)",Ghost

I saw it last night for the first time and surprise, surprise, 15 years later I do understand why people all over the world flocked to see, to devour this soufflé, again and again. Bruce Joel Rubin won an Academy Award for the screenplay, I remember Jodie Foster handing him the statuette with a smile worthy of a British diplomat. But in fact, the screenplay should have propelled the Academy to create a separate category alongside Best Original Screenplay and Best Adapted Screenplay. Yes, Smart Ass Screenplay of the year or Most Commercial Screenplay. Jerry Zucker does a masterful job allowing Rubin's stroke of genius to unfold without major interference. Demi Moore is scrumptious and what Maurice Jarre does with her tears deserves an award of its own. Patrick Swayze suffers with a certain amount of dignity, his anger is very virile but his expressions of longing are pure Lana Turner. What makes the whole calculated enterprise worth every bit of its hype is Whoopi Goldberg. She brings the tale where it really belongs. A comedy. A ghostly comedy about enduring love.",Ghost

149,nelliebell-1,Ditto,9,20 January 2006,"Perhaps it is worth a mention prior to anything more serious that unfolds with Ghost, however the very opening sequence is both eerie and initially hard to define.The quick movement to a sort of pedestrian interplay removes the stark and if you will undefinable aspect of the very opening with the braking down some old wall and as viewers we are then provided with the story that as suggested as pedestrian.If I recall even the music attached to the scene however short its appearance equaled a position that was more interesting than its duration allowed for,however it did not seem to have been meant to provide much more than that.Ghost,like so many movies,provides the viewer with what appears but does not allow for what is.The question when any pretense requires our cooperation is if in fact what we are being asked is either worthy or in fact believable?Is what we are being asked by our watching this picture worthy of a more serious consideration?The story is not so easy to unravel as the supra natural plays a part in the drama and even allows for our lead male to provide an unflinching dare as to the eternity that awaits.It is without question a brave and desirable emotion that makes for the truth and that is what is believed in.The lead is worthy but some of the other aspects are not.Sam Wheat is a genuine good guy and though we do not perceive this initially he is very intelligent and even accomplished as his position with the bank symbolizes.The counter to Sam Wheat is not so easy to pigeon hole as both Molly Jensen and Carl Bruner are very much on the same side as both seek to deny the existence of perhaps a soul but just as important to deny Sam Wheat a life.This though is not customary in the consideration of Molly but there is nothing in her characterization that would suggest to me that they not only knew each other but truly loved each other as well.I felt we were not looking at the real thing but the mere suggestion which is as it is a mere suggestion.It is a critical perception to understand that there is cause as to why nothing that can be suggested is believed in either.The Law as to these events is so uncaring and unbelieving that they sought out the truth to kill more so than to be convinced otherwise that there is a truth of any sort to be gained.The only truth the law recognizes is the law and the law needs to get its way.What does that mean?It means that there are many weaknesses to this pictures underpinning and the presence or for that matter the place that law enforcement should represent is terribly lacking and without a face,it is without a heart.There is such compelling evidence that any real detective work would of uncovered Carl Bruner and Willy Lopez and perhaps required both Federal as well as International Law concerns with the revealing of the person on the other end of the phone.But this picture seems to have drawn a conclusion about something else and it is something else that it wants to showcase.Molly like Carl does much to deny the existence of the heart and soul of the picture by not allowing for some far fetched idea about the supra natural but it seems is won over by perhaps the pictures lead Female in Oda Mae Brown.The character of Oda Mae Brown has the ability to communicate with the dead and it is the place that Sam Wheat finds a kindred soul and a receiver if you will for his cries from the world beyond that allow this picture some leeway.Indeed both Sam Wheat and Oda Mae Brown are critical to love and justice even unto the end of time.Both of these performances are very good and should provide real entertainment.Molly is not as suggested a full bodied presence though indeed the appearances suggest otherwise but that is neither here nor there as Molly does not believe and as such has a more difficult time determining just how that kind of information became the property of some foreign body in this character Oda Mae Brown.She eventually seems to have been won over but not before the very soul of the picture rises having been provided with the truth so that the heart and life being required now leaves this world behind and is allowed to rest in peace.The end of the picture is very good,it is if you will a truly emotional parting and an ascension that is believed in.A degree of success is achieved through this if you will miracle however it is very lovely and very charming and well worth the viewing pleasure of the audience.The darkness that awaits all who heed not to repent will befall them as they did to the Willy Lopez and Carl Bruner character.There deaths in the picture occur with a chilling fearful acknowledgment of the designs of the darkness and the results that it provides for.It is a true admission when Carl gets it in the end and like a moment in time does not believe that the end of time has come for this particular criminal.This is where the picture does provide some interest and it is in its attempt to a moral underpinning that allow for the furtherance of the supra natural conceit showcased through out the picture.Why conceit?Because that is where the answers are not here in this world but in the supra natural and though it is the supra natural,the underpinning is of a world that we do not possess the natural ability to know which only through some sort of miracle we will ever have just that kind of ability.",Ghost
150,mrspasm,Scariest Films Of Al Times,10,26 July 2009,"I feel that I should warn anyone who was attracted to watching this movie by the name alone- This is not just a horror film- It's the most terrifying, mind crushingly disturbing piece of art in history. After watching it I spiralled into a foul pit of depression for 17 weeks in which I spoke to no-one, said nothing, went nowhere, and felt only the knowledge of my own impending doom rushing inevitably towards me from all angles. I was enclosed in a tomb of hatred, an OLAP cube filled with emptiness, nine inch nails driven into my very soul my eyeless creatures whose only joy is ill-gained by their concentrated torture of the insane. There was not exactly darkness, but there was an all encompassing absence of light, of life, or breath; it was like existing inside the dying lung of a smoker, like swallowing cement, like choking yourself with the cold feet of a dead neighbour. Imagine a dream where you lose your shoes and have to tie Jennifer Lopez and Andie McDowell to your feet just so that you can push Bernie Mac up a vertical cliff face in a barrel.After a few weeks I began to have visions of a new world filled with creatures called Burlapians in which I was an Alien slave recently released. Everyone spat on me as I walked by, and I wasn't allowed to enter a Burlapian café for a caramel square. Soon my despair began to manifest itself as boils on the inside of my eyeballs. These boils burst, sending my eyes out of my now devastated carcass of a face, and onto the floor. Born from the boils of my despair was another race of miniature creatures which I named Rubtuckuryans as I was delirious from the pain. I couldn't see them as my eyes were lost, and even now I doubt their existence, but I felt that they were there and that they were mine, and so I commanded them. If you have never felt the sensation of 14 million little men running over your skin then let me tell you it is among the most exhilarating and revitalising experiences of my life. For the first time in my life I was at one with a larger society. I was their leader, but more than that I was them and they were me. I was worshipped from all quarters as God, Mother, and Saviour, but by the Burlapian classes as a creature to be derided and shoved. One afternoon when the town was asleep, I sent my 14 million little soldiers on their first and final mission; one of which none could be certain of coming home. They entered the houses of each Burlapian and wreaked the most horrific forms of vengeance ever imagined. I felt sick at the carnage created by my hand. Sick with joy. Sick with sickness. There were many casualties, but the few survivors who stumbled back to me no longer felt a part of me. They had committed such acts that I could no longer fathom their existence and so I screamed to the heavens and launched myself of the nearest mountain top. I hit the bottom at around 150 miles per hour and splashed beautifully across the gray wilderness. At last I was happy and free. I could now come back to life. I woke with a start to find I had grown a bushy yet stylish beard and some odd bacteria between my toes. The TV license people assumed I was dead and so no longer send me a bill. So everything worked out in the end.If you wish to avoid such a trauma then go watch The Exorcist or another less harrowing horror movie. This is too much. The way the hands merge with the clay, the way the spirits come screaming from the shadows to claim the newly dead souls as their own, ripping from our world onto the next, Whoopee Goldberg.

152,jehaccess6,Terrific performances in a sweet movie.,9,2 December 2007,"This movie really was a great follow-up role for Patrick Swayze. I was intrigued by his performance in 'Dirty Dancing' and wondered how he would approach this very different role. I was pleasantly surprised by Patrick's ability to shift gears from dancer/actor to straight actor. His portrayal of a man's eternal love for his soul-mate was very convincing. His portrayal of an investment banker was not as strong. That huge mane of curly hair did not seem to fit into the image of a corporate team player.The strength of the film was in the chemistry between Patrick 'Sam' and Whoopi Goldberg 'Oda Mae'. These two performers played off each other so flawlessly, it was magic. It made for a strong comedic theme in a performer not noted for his comedy skills. On second thought, perhaps it was much more Whoopi than Patrick.The chemistry between Patrick and Demi Moore 'Molly' was not as strong. They had flashes of excellence between more mundane moments. The scene where 'Molly' making pottery on a wheel turned into an amorous encounter was a very sweet moment.The performance of Tony Goldwyn as best friend/traitor 'Carl' was extremely creepy and convincing. When he attempted to take advantage of grieving 'Molly' I first suspected that the plot would involve 'Carl' having 'Sam' murdered so that he could move in on 'Molly'. That did not exactly happen, but it seemed 'Carl' would have enjoyed this as an additional bonus to the money he wanted so badly he killed for it.The finale made the film. Even the hardest heart melted at the love and loss experienced by 'Sam'. He showed how beautiful and loving 'Sam' really was. He had bonded with 'Oda Mae' too and it no doubt made her decide to become a better person from his example.",Ghost

157,sharkattack1978,Ghost really has the power to make you believe,10,4 March 2008,"This film has helped me through so many bad times. Round about the time this was released on DVD i lost my mum to cancer. This was the last film I watched with her so nowadays it has sentimental value. This is a perfect film to watch if you're depressed as it does make you feel better after you watch it. This is my fave movie ever. I watch this nearly every month because I love the movie so much. This cannot be repeated twice, there can't be a sequel to it, It's a golden tear film (meaning weepie) The power that this film has is unbelievable. If you have lost a loved one then you'd know the power that i'm talking about. The acting is superb. Patrick really does make you believe in this character and this nightmare he is going through and by the end you really do feel the magic that the character goes through. It does really make you wonder what that life beyond death is really like. The romantic side of this film doesn't miss a beat. Patrick and Demi's chemistry is paramount to the story and it doesn't feel faked, it feels real. The inclusion of Whoopi Goldberg's character gives it a lighthearted style humour which by the end has a message to it. Jerry Zucker who recent flicks before this one were Airplane! does a great job mixing the heartfelt sentimentality with the stand out humour that you get when Patrick and Whoopi are together on screen. Whoopi quite rightly deserved that Oscar she got for this role. Her acting was brilliant. Two cast members has been outlooked by every one but without there characters this movie might not have worked. I'm talking about of course Tony Goldwyn as Karl and Rick Aviles as Willie. The subtle acting brings out their most evil side and you are genuinely shocked when you found out he was in on it the whole time. How could you allow your best friend to be murdered? You feel that their just desserts are quite literally deserved after how you see them as and what they had done to Sam. It is scary in some parts and even a little gruesome but the message does still shine through. Love is forever if you believe. By the end yes even i was in floods of tears. That is the power that this one has, to literally bring you to tears. No matter how hard you try, it will always do that. I have watched this time and time again and I still cry buckets at the end, even before the scene even starts, I'm already filling up. The end scene is the standout moment of the film. It is the magic of GHOST. There is no more powerful word than goodbye. Industrial Light and Magic create an effect that pulls at the heartstrings and the acting from the stars pulls even more. The real magic of this scene is Maurice Jarre's powerful soft instrumental theme of Unchained Melody. The soft violins lets the tears flow. It is truly beautiful. Even right now i'm thinking of it and i'm getting a lump in my throat. If you haven't seen this yet, see it now. If you want a great tearjerker, they don't come better than this.",Ghost

OK - whatever... Jurassic Park came out like two years later - and those visual effects are still as amazing as ever! i think this movie gave very little time and effort in regards to the effects, therefore... they suck... why do we need to know or see that when you're a ghost and you pass through someone's head, you can somehow see all the tiny blood cells and veins inside?! unnecessary... pointless...i think the only redeeming part of this movie was whoopi Goldberg - who is a genius! i thought her performance 100% deserved her Oscar and am so proud that she won. the humor she instills in her character just breathes life into an otherwise dreadfully dull movie. i actually laughed out loud at one or two of whoopi's lines! ha ha!basically - GHOST was OK, definitely not Oscar-worthy at all (except whoopi!), not even deserving of all 5 of its nominations! overrated, dated, cliché, white noise in terms of movies in general.******/********** (6/10) i don't recommend this title, unless you're a fan of whoopi and you're ready to sit through bland movie to see her...",Ghost

However the best part of the movie is what was probably meant as comedy relief, to build up the tension for the romantic moments.It's not a good sign when the secondary plot takes the cake, relegating the core of the story to a role of pretty-but-shallow dressing.Furthermore, the ""mysterious killer"" story was so predictable it ruined whatever interest it might have had.And the love story, sorry, but I just couldn't find a good reason to care about Sam & Molly... Who are they? Why were they in love to the point of getting involved in a threesome with a potter-wheel?""Ghost"", as a love story, falls short in terms of characters' development. As a murder story is too predictable. So it's at its best as a comedy. Not totally intentional I suppose.Whoopi Goldberg as the charlatan-medium is really funny, and she manages to give some depth to an otherwise stereotypical ""fat black woman"". And Oda Mae is the best character of the movie, by a mile, just to underline how poor the effort in character creation was.The production is fine, and the script paved the way to a plethora of ""romantic dramas"" and ""romantic comedies"" in the following decades.To this day, ""Ghost"" enjoys a vast popularity, despite its obvious shortcomings.

How unfortunately the only person who can see or hear him is medium Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), so the pair must work together in a race against time to save Demi's character Molly Jensen's life when it to comes under threat. When I say the power of love, you say; Pretty Women, Dirty Dancing, an Office and a gentleman and the Notebook, but for me the true heavyweight in the world of romance is Ghost, the very epitome of love conquering all. You can't spell forever without love.",Ghost
162,the-evil-cult,Blunt Film,8,18 September 2004,"Ghost has an interesting premise and good use of suspense. Whoopi Goldberg's character stuck out too much and the movie's comedy aspect probably didn't mix in with its romantic aspect. Nevertheless the romance was done well and the theme music was nice. Ghost's Christian spiritualism may partly explain its box-office success. Character seemed to be a product of plot, and not the other way around. Hence many of the characters are stereotypical. Skin color seems to correlate with wealth and intelligence. At times the romance lacked subtlety, but romance is hard to pull off without reverting to clichés.7/10",Ghost
163,Arcturus1980,I have grown to love Ghost,9,26 July 2011,"Ghost is the latest of a dozen or so films that I have come to appreciate much more over time. I had seen it a few times in the '90s and liked it, but not on the level of yesterday's viewing. Every film is a world unto itself, and generally speaking, the more interesting the world, the better the film. I like the world of Ghost. I like the treatment of the supernatural. The denial thereof and other character annoyances can be rationalized away quite satisfactorily. I would, however, prefer a more restrained Whoopi Goldberg, who is a little out of control for the sake of humor. It is something of a comedy after all.The special effects hold up very well. Maurice Jarre's score hits the mark (no surprise there). Jerry Zucker directs very competently. Bruce Joel Rubin won the Oscar for his marvelous original screenplay. Demi Moore is a must for Molly. Likewise for Patrick Swayze as Sam. His regrettable and untimely death adds to the mystique. Only a 6.9 on this site, but nothing talks like money with over a half-billion dollars worldwide. If you last saw Ghost many years ago and thought it good, not great, I suggest you rewatch it. It quite touched me, and may do you as well.",Ghost

My ex-wife loved it, but I saw nothing remotely interesting that would catch my attention.My reasoning behind the 4 out of 10 star rating is for the soundtrack and not-too-shabby acting, although Demi Moore looks like she was so attention-starved it was almost too funny.

(Hollywood in the 80's were marked by a series of teen films and crappy semi-serious films that were so maudlin they seem comic in retrospect). Ghost is one of these just plain awful films. Bad acting, bad writing and terrible ""special effects"". It is a sappy piece of trash that was popular with people who see one or two films a year.

We all have relatives we've known who are now dead and we can relate to the pain of loosing a loved one.  But this movie shows something beyond that death.  Love beyond the grave, and it just impacts you.  The acting was wonderful, when they wanted suspense they made suspense, when they wanted to make you laugh they made you laugh, and when they wanted to make you cry they made you cry.  You will never forget this movie, I was 10 when I watched it the first time and I have not forgotten this movie since then.  I watched it again a few years ago and it was even greater than the first time I saw it.  There is sooo much power in it.  I can't even explain how deep it goes.

Patrick Swayze will always be recognized for his part as Sam, probably second behind Johnny from Dirty Dancing. He is one of those guys who tries to act all macho, but he is obviously sensitive and down to earth. His girlfriend is Molly, played by Demi Moore in an equally memorable performance. The most memorable performance, though, is that of Oda Mae Brown, played by Whoopi Goldberg. Goldberg won a very deserving Oscar for Supporting Actress, as well as the same award at the Golden Globes. She is the psychic fraud who is able to communicate with Swayze, whose ghost refuses to move on to the next life.

192,PopcornJury,Ghost is a highly romanticized love story that happens to feature elements of crime and suspense. A worthy rental for those interested in the afterlife.,7,29 November 2010,"Ghost is a highly romanticized love story that happens to feature elements of crime and suspense. It's a movie that begs the question ""What happens after you die"" and offers a spin not often thought about in regards to the afterlife. The film, starring Demi Moore, Patrick Swayze, and Whoopi Goldberg has been praised by some and criticized by others. It got nominated for Best Picture when it was released in 1990 and received a variety of other nominations. I tend to walk with those who praise the film, regarding it as a authentic love story that, although super cheesy, really does provide a sense of wonder as to what one may be able to do after they die.Ghost starts out like a very traditional love story. We're introduced to Sam and Molly (Swayze and Moore), a young and in love couple that just moved in together in an old New York loft. After a few romantic interactions, one being one of the most arguable romantic ever caught on film (the pottery scene set to the tune of Unchained Melody), we realize that this couple couldn't exist without one another. Their love is such that it could quite possibly only exist in movies. Regardless, we believe in it, we appreciate it, and we remember it throughout the rest of the film.What happens next shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with the story. Sam is killed in the streets while walking home with Molly. He sees the light, but decides he isn't quite ready to go just yet. Instead, he stays on Earth, to be with Molly, only to come to the realization that no one can hear him, see him, feel him, or talk to him. He's simply a fly on the wall, someone who's able to look over the ones he loves, but provide no assistance in how things play out. That is, until he meets Oda Mae Brown, a local psychic, who's able to hear his voice and play a crucial role in saving Molly from the men who Sam believes murdered him for money.Ghost is more successful at being a love story than a crime drama, but it does make sense as a background to the story. Sam is not only able to track his killers (without them knowing), but he's also able to warn his wife of the incoming danger and give her the clues necessary to solve the crime. The most interesting part of the film is seeing Sam and Molly interact through Oda Mae Brown. At first, Molly doesn't want to accept the fact that her dead boyfriend is literally standing right next to her. It takes a number of personal insights (the color of her underwear, the location of their first date, and a reference to ""ditto"") to make her a believer, but once she accepts that Sam is present in the afterlife, the story starts to transform into a romantic thriller that hits all the right notes in both of its respective genres.If there's one thing that doesn't really work in Ghost, it's the final twenty to thirty minutes when Sam learns how to move things, punch people, type on keyboards, etc. To me, it feels a little fake, and loses out on the premise that made the film so promising in the beginning. He can essentially do things that a ghost shouldn't be able to do, and to me, it takes things a little too far in terms of believability. Some people would argue that the whole film is too far of a stretch, no one can hear dead people. I for one, accept that piece of the puzzle, but as far as an actual physical presence that can interact with psychical surroundings, I don't feel like going that far.Regardless, Ghost offers a romantic love story that will make your heart melt. Whether or not you appreciate the crime backdrop will depend vastly on the person, but the love story should be quite universal. See this movie, realize the hype, download Unchain Melody, and think about those you love. Could you live without them? Would you stick around to see them through? Ghost asks a lot of questions, but provides clarity on one: Does true love exist? Yes. Just let Sam show you.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com",Ghost

The excellent cast intensifies all these aspects: Good-hearted Sam (Patrick Swayze) doesn't want to move on until he can DO something - to protect the woman he loves and to right the wrong done him. Lovely Molly (Demi Moore) is outwardly tough, yet somehow fragile as she faces the loss of her soul-mate. The pain in her eyes is so real, the tears so believable. Hilarious Oda Mae (Whoopi Goldberg) lightens the action with a bright touch of humor. Even the creepy evil-doers are truly frightening.

Swayzee play Sam Wheat a very much in love man, who's life is tragically cut short by his nasty friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn). Too scared to 'step into the light' Sam stays on earth and soon befriends crooked Oda Mae (Whoopie Goldburg) who suddenly finds out her talents for talking to the dead are actually for real.

195,Stenian,"Has its moments, but aged quickly and was undeserving of Oscar nominations",6,14 November 2020,"I first remember watching this in the early 2000s. I was in my young teens. I really enjoyed it and I had remembered most of its lines. And interestingly, even back then, it was rather campy and aged. But hey, I didn't mind. It is still one of those movies that age really fast. As time went by, I started to notice its flaws.Before getting to its quality, let's start with the music. It was, alongside the special effects, just campy and very 80's. The music was by Maurice Jarre, an artistic composer that was behind the epic films like Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago. The score of this film sounded like it was composed by some 80s synthpop band. Really superficial and synthetic suspense music that did NOT complement the beautiful orchestral theme music. I honestly expected the Terminator to pop up with that cheesy synthesized score during the chase scenes. I wonder, why would Jarre compose such music during the suspenseful sequences when he created a beautiful theme for this film? The two genres of music did NOT MESH well.Maybe they filmed it in the more retrograded locations in NYC, because it looked like it was made in 1985 or something. The costumes, the hair, etc. Very awkwardly dated. Only Demi Moore looked normal and modern. Speaking of dated, the special effects were horrendous. The screaming sounds of the ""demons"" were amateur at best. Like watching a low budget 1980s horror movie.Now Whoopi Goldberg was hilarious and amazing as Oda Mae. But was she really deserving of on Oscar? I would've given her a Golden Globe for Best Actress in Musical/Comedy. Definitely not an Oscar. Her character was a comic relief in nature, not much different than Chris Tucker in Rush Hour. I thought Demi Moore was more worthy. Those emotions and that sorrowful face really deserved an Oscar (IF you had to give this movie an Oscar though). I cried when she shed a tear. She was that contagious.As far as its multi-genres go, I wasn't a big fan of its genre mishmash. It should've either been a romantic drama, a mystery thriller or just a plain comedy. These genres just didn't mesh that well. Maybe the writer could've done it better. Because Titanic, another 1990s romance film, perfectly blended romance, drama, suspense and action.In conclusion, an alright movie with some nice, tearjerker moments towards the end backed up by the beautiful score (erm, not including the music behind the chase scenes). But totally undeserving of Oscar noms, especially Best Picture, considering its quality is just as good as an average 1980s/1990s TV movie.

It takes an interesting premise of a man returning as a ghost after his murder and muddles it with a rather silly money laundering plot. Many actions of the villains, and the reactions of side characters to various goings-on, are unbelievable.Would the banker hand Ode Mae a cashier's check for $4 million dollars after she acts like a complete lunatic and more than a tad suspicious? And why is that bank scene so padded and long? The 'comic relief' it provides isn't worth its extreme lack of credibility.Could the killer, Willie Lopez, be less sneaky? He's always after Ode Mae with guns blazing even though he's a hired killer and practiced burglar. I just can't believe, even with Sam's help, that Ode Mae could avoid this guy catching up with her eventually.As for Carl, he has to be one of the most unbelievable villains I've ever seen in a film. There's absolutely nothing about him that would suggest he's capable of plotting a murder. Not only is the actor miscast, but the character is so underdeveloped, it reminds me of movies I'd make with my friends with a video camera when we were in junior high school.A few other things that bothered me: The subway ghost goes from psychotic to helpful in an instant.The policewoman who coldly dismisses Moore after she tells a fairly convincing story about things Ode Mae told her. Even if she isn't convinced, would she be so rude to a recent widow that she believes has been conned? Demi Moore's hearing seems to go on the fritz a few times also. She can't hear Willie Lopez sprinting out of her apartment after the cat attacks him? She can't hear Carl talking to and threatening Sam in the kitchen while she's out of the room for a moment (she returns to the room after the rather loud argument and says, 'Were you talking to someone?' He drops a large knife out the counter (clink!) which she doesn't hear or notice when she's 5 feet away from him.)If ghosts are capable of moving things around with ease, wouldn't there be a more widespread phenomenon of such occurrences? Or are Swayze and the subway ghost the only ones who have ever figured it out? For a movie that tries so hard to be serious, there are far too many of these things to write off as suspension of disbelief.I did find a some clever or satisfying bits in the film, like the floating penny, some of Swayze's learning curve of what he can do as a ghost, and the idea of the demons dragging evil-doers to their ultimate punishment (although the special effects fail here).It's sounds like I despised this film, but I still gave it a 6 because despite its many flaws, it still entertains and the flaws aren't as glaring on the first viewing. Those who generally enjoy love stories or find pleasure (even guilty ones) in Lifetime Original Movies will more easily overlook the bad stuff.Lastly, the performances are mediocre at best. Goldberg does the best job of anyone, but the writing is too silly to make her character truly believable. Swayze does his best work here, and it's still not so great. Moore cries a lot. Goldberg didn't deserve an Oscar in my opinion, and the film itself certainly didn't deserve its win for Writing or a Best Picture nod.Grade: C+",Ghost
197,putneychick,Still enjoyable after 30 years!!,10,2 January 2021,"Thought I will give myself a treat and watch ""Ghost"" since I have not seen it for ages. It is still such a watchable film due to the main characters and tight story line. Whoopi is outstanding in this role. Wished that she will play another role like this again soon! Miss her in films -boring watching her do talk shows. Patrick Swayze - such a talented actor that lived a short life. Demi was absolutely angelic in this movie - her natural beauty shines through and through. And the music - I loved the old record player with the display of records and decking one record on the player and then it goes back into the slot and come down the next record. Where can I get this vintage record player?:-)",Ghost

199,ken98465,"Bad Writing, Bad Acting, Bad Directing, Good Righteous Brothers Tune",5,23 April 2000,"This is one of those movies that you feel like you SHOULD like.  It's so noble.  The scenery and special effects are quite good.  But in the end it is just another mediocre movie starring Patrick Swayze. I don't like dramas that rely on characters doing the stupidest possible thing in order to keep the plot moving. I liked Demi Moore's performance (perhaps because her character is most sympathetic), and Tony Goldwyn gives a good effort, but Whoopi and Swayze's scenes made me cringe (particularly the bank scene). 5 out of 10",Ghost
200,Sterling52,"Beyond words, but I'll attempt it",9,6 September 2008,"Although often marginalized by my contemporaries, colleagues, and the world of academia at large, the character of Ode May Brown is one of the most riveting, pivotal, and important literary characters of the past two centuries and quite possibly ever. Not since Charles Dickens' character of Louis Fontaine and Shakespeare's obscure and typically underrated Thomas Jack Abercrombie has a character sparked a national revolution, packed theaters (stage, projection, or otherwise), and redefined the term ""exoneration."" The 1980's, similar to 1923, was a time of prosperity, indulgence, and limitless thinking. With this hotbed of bohemian sentiment and excessive wealth to invest in the outrageous, the timing was perfect for imaginative works of zaniness and the fantastical. While stock-brokers were hitting it big on Wall Street, Andy Warhol was working in his ""factory"" in New York with Basquiat, Robert Greenwald was directing the yet unknown glitter-encrusted light and roller-epic ""Xanadu"" and Ridley Scott was preparing for work on his unicorn fantasy dream known as ""Legend."" Nobody was prepared for the cesspool of cinema stinkers to come in a period known as ""the nineties."" Being the final decade of a century,one would think the world was ready for images and sounds that were out of this world. Instead, the world was treated (heavy on the sarcasm) to such gems as ""Reality Bites,"" ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" ""The Piano,"" and ""Basic Instinct."" Not only were these films and every other film in the decade minus two completely devoid of anything spectacular or colorful, but they lacked the charm of the previous decade. In fact, the only other creative work to hit cinemas in this decade in addition to the piece discussed in this manifesto was Evita (review coming soon). The decade had the number 90 in it and was a time of grunge, filth, over-sized sweaters, garbage, flannel, and various other low-life things. The stage was set for something better for audiences to feast on. Breaking into this ""Bleak House"" that was cinema in the mid-90's, 1990 brought us a revolutionary picture that nobody would ever forget yet everyone strangely already knew because it was so engrained into the fabric of their being. Tired of grit on their movie teeth, people ate up this film with such enthusiasm. This film was Jerry Zuckers, ""Ghost!"" (Editor's note, the actual film title does not have an exclamation point in it because the marketing person at Paramount Pictures is an idiot. The exclamation point has been added because it should have had one in the first place.). Everything from the music (who will ever hear the Righteous Brothers' Unchained Melody the same way again?) to the special effects were unfathomable. However, while the film was superior to every film effort up until that point, the actual film paled in comparison to a small unassuming character housed within the feature presentation. Much like a priceless Merlot in a Dixie Cup or scribbles writing musings from Plato, ""Ghost!"" was simply a cheap container from Wal-Mart to hold something which surpassed everything anyone has ever known. That character was Ode May Brown. A character with such warm charm and charisma that anything that surrounded it was rendered meaningless and often profane. It is well known that the actress Whoopi Goldberg won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Ode May Brown. Many of my fellow and sometimes accomplished critics feel that her performance was nothing short of, well, amazing. This is the general malaise' and rhetoric that plagues both my writings and my acceptance in the mainstream media world. But I ask, and perhaps I digress, but to what capacity was Goldberg actually participating in? Going against the grain, I feel that Ode May Brown existed before Whoopi was even born and her character was not acting at all. Furthermore, the writer of this entry loathes Goldberg and feels that she has completely the only task she was put on this Earth for and can just as well disappear for all I'm concerned. The only thing about about Ode May Brown and the only thing Whoopi can do on this Earth that is worthwhile would be to make ""Ghost! 2!"" I'm not sure what exec. at Paramount has not set this production into motion, but rest assured, once this article gets out, ""Ghost!"" sequels WILL get made which, unfortunately, will revive the career of Ms. Goldberg, but more importantly will bring back Ode May S. Brown (if you know what the S. stands for, please e-mail me!!!) and her 2 lovely sisters to the big screen. For me, this mythic character is the most enthralling...""thing"" I can imagine and I would pay sums of money to learn more of her origins. Prequel anyone?",Ghost

204,aysx87,Cheesy,6,27 October 2011,"This is a lovely story that's so, so cheesy. You have to watch it to see how much cheese is totally emanating from... well, everywhere. I like the accompanying plot twists and the villains are pretty villainous yet somewhat white-collar-gone-mad, which is a v. scary combination. At the same time, I felt like Moore took so long to believe her husband was a ghost despite all the details the psychic told her that a lot of the plot hinges on her being, well, idiotic? And what was going on with the kiss with the villain (where it's not romantic if she doesn't smack him and scream at him to get out, instead agreeing to have dinner with him?) Other plot holes include where Swayze takes over Goldberg's body and then begins to caress Moore, and I was so confused--almost illogical. During the entire romantic scene, I was wondering what it must really look like... Goldberg's character herself is really annoying, especially when Swayze has to coach her through a bank move--it was idiotic (again), and the plot hinged on it.This has really nothing to do with ghosts or the eternal or anything mysterious (there are scenes of demons from hell that are pretty ridiculous and over the top); it's just your standard love story... except they can never be together again. I love the performance by the subway guy, who is v, v, passionate. If this is about true love that lasts eternally, though, it's kind of depressing. I thought the special effects were kind of nice for the 1990s (of course super over the top in 2011). In general, a very standard, CHEESY movie that is helped by the strong side plot of crime and avenged death that drives the love story.",Ghost

I think it's the best thing Demi and Patrick have done (I admit I haven't seen all their work), and I think Demi should wear her hair that way all the time--to me, it's much more becoming than her later long styles. I was so happy to learn that Whoopi won an Oscar for her performance--she was funny and scared and puzzled and all the things Oda Mae would have been. I've just reviewed the list of awards this film won, and believe it deserved every one of them. As the loathsome Carl, Tony Goldwyn should probably have won one of the awards too, because he did a great portrayal of the classic coward, the type who tries cozying up to someone to get what he wants the easy way, but has no way of coping with problems except to go kill someone or hire it done for him.

Then all of a sudden Sam gets shot for money and his spirit is set free to the mortal world. So basically he's trying to stop Carl from killing Molly and Oda Mae. Oda Mae (Whoopi Goldberg) made this movie happen with her witty humor and talent. She defiantly deserved that Oscar for her role. I hate Carl for betraying Sam the way he did. That was messed up. I love the chemistry between Oda Mae and Sam and how she had to help him to warn Molly. That was terrific. I love this movie so much. Best romantic comedy of the early nineties.

209,Harley66,"Whoopi, Swayze and Moore at their best",6,8 September 2008,"Ghost is a great supernatural thriller with a humorous edge. Sam Wheat and Molly Jensen (Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore) have decided to live together. He is an investment banker and she is a sculptress. Paul (Tony Goldwyn) works with Sam. Sam and Molly are truly in love, the only problem is Sam cannot say the three little words that Molly wants to hear. When she tells him she loves him, all he can say is ""Ditto"". Sam and Molly are refurbishing their dream house. They are enjoying their life together. After attending an Off-Broadway production of Macbeth, Molly decides it time to get married. They are mugged and Sam is shot and killed. His spirit starts to ascend but he cannot leave Molly, so he is stranded on Earth. Ghost Sam follows Molly around. But he has problems passing through doors. Sam gets trapped in the townhouse. When the door opens it is not Molly but the man who killed him. He realizes that his death was not random. Sam follows the killer home and discovers that Molly has something he wants. On his way back he notices a storefront Sister Oda Mae Brown Spiritual Adviser Contact The Dearly Departed. He is curious and enters. Oda Mae (Whoopi Goldberg) is a charlatan psychic but during her séance, she can hear everything Sam says. Sam realizes she has the gift and decides use her to warn Molly. Of course, Molly has a hard time believing Oda Mae. Even when she does believe, she still has doubts. Eventually, Sam finds out the whole truth. But the man behind the killing is getting desperate and he needs to get rid of the last witness, Molly. Jerry Zucker was most famous for Airplane and other spoofs he created with his brother. No one expected this level of sophistication in his direction. It starts out as a romance, then becomes a supernatural movie with comedic elements and ends up a mystery, which it was the whole time. Each handled with precision. Patrick Swayze had a series of hits but all the films would be considered light weight. This was his first acting triumph. Demi Moore was known for good performances in B Films. This was her first great performance in an A Film. Whoopi Goldberg took show business by storm. Mike Nichols discovered her on woman show and brought it to Broadway. This started her meteoric rise. Next Spielberg cast her in the lead of The Color Purple and Whoopi received a Best Actress Oscar Nomination. Since then, she was a star but never found another defining role. That is until Ghost. She takes Oda Mae Brown to a level even the writer and director did not expect. Her ability to go from high drama to slapstick without it looking unreal was perfection. I knew when I saw the film that this was her Oscar performance, and it was. Ghost has something for everyone in it.

All the chemistry between actors work very well. It's a movie that plays with your emotions constantly, not a dull moment. Sixth Sense is boring compare to this movie. Very creative writing, very smart. Even the editing, the transitions were ahead of its time.

212,gazmccarthy,A movie that can't make its mind up what to be,6,5 November 2007,"I went into watching Ghost thinking it would be just a soppy romantic fantasy drama. I was wrong. It offered so much more. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver.I was confused by which direction the movie wanted to go. It fell between too many stools. At one point it tries to be all out, serious romance, then thriller, then fantasy comedy then slapstick comedy. It fails to nail any of these sub-genres and ends slightly messy.For a film that tries so hard to get you to accept Swayze walking round as a ghost, it fails to convince in many other areas such as: are we really meant to believe Swayze's best friend would get him bumped off just for money? Plus, was there supposed to be mystery around who was behind his killing? Let's look at the characters we've been introduced to so far; Sam, Molly and Sam's friend....well, it doesn't exactly take Sherlock Holmes to deduce who it is! The execution of the whole plot line with Carl getting Sam killed is so poor I feel it lets the whole film down. The special effects in the film also sail close to the wind. They are particularly poor with the demons who come to take bad people down to hell. These black blobs with their wailing are more comical than frightening.The character of Carl is a curious one indeed. Waivering between a total wimp and a would-be killer, it just becomes a muddled study of someone who never really gives much resonance his role in proceedings.And as for some great love story? It's OK, but for more than half the film Sam can't really interact with Molly, just through Oda Mae, which is just too madcap to be taken seriously. Goldberg, as with Swayze and Moore, delivers a competent performance but no more than that.After viewing this film I am bemused that it is held in such distinct regard some 17 years on. A decent film elevated to something it isn't and is ultimately a letdown.Shame.",Ghost

It is a deeply emotional movie, with both great depths and peaks. Each performer adds to the film, whether it be the great side characters, or the stellar main cast. Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze are a believable, well-cast couple. The special effects are cool, and have held up very well, considering that I (re) watched this movie tonight 31 years after its premiere.It makes me hope for life after death, and makes me appreciate the love I've felt and the love I'll see again.

214,grayure,Whoopie Goldberg was the best thing in this film,3,12 March 2006,"Whoopie Goldberg was the best thing in this film, overrated beyond belief when it came out, and overall fairly shallow although it has its moments. Demi Moore (she of the ""beautiful hair"" - see ""Friends"" where Phoebe cuts Monica's hair) seems to be trying an Audrey Hepburn impression taken from Breakfast at Tiffany's, which only serves to remind us of who is the better actress (Hepburn can act her socks off while still being cute and elfin, Demi Moore just looks cute and elfin). As for Swayze, it's the only thing I've ever seen him in, and likely to remain so, judging by this performance. The guy may be cute, if you like that sort of thing, but I found his acting so bad that at times I laughed out loud. To be honest, I thought he could give William Shatner a run for his money. It was left to Whoopie Goldberg to show us what real acting is like, and although her character did not have much variety or development to work with, she managed to steal the show. The film had some comic moments and was not a total waste of time, but touching it was not. Only bother if it's raining and you really have nothing else to do.",Ghost

I think that the first 30 minutes or so is a bit slow, however the overall storyline is decent (despite some predictability too). But I think this film captures the notion of real life, the afterlife, grief, unconditional love and faith pretty well!

Enough said, it's time you watch it - only then you will know what i am talking about :)",Ghost
232,Dolemite_motherfcker,A fair movie but nothing special.,6,8 September 2009,"Ghost made serious money in theatres. It was the highest grossing film of 1990. It had incredibly broad appeal with it's slick combination of action, romance and comedy. Does that make it a great film? No, but Ghost is still worth a watch. The originality of the film's premise made my first viewing of Ghost quite enjoyable. I mean in how many movies is the main character a Ghost for most of the film? This is the only such movie I have even heard of. However, it is when you look beyond the novelty of the Ghost premise, that you see the film for what it really is; a very routine, predictable piece of Hollwood film making. This is not a bad film. It's just not interesting enough to be worth more than one or two viewings,especially for fairly experienced movie buffs like me. That said, I still recommend that you see Ghost some time or another. The fun performances of Whoopi Goldberg and especially Patrick Swayze and the entertaining ghost effects make the movie worth viewing, but just don't expect a timeless classic.",Ghost

I had the opportunity to watch it again today and changed my rating upwards.The angels coming from heaven and the demons coming from hell might be a little hokey but it gets the idea across. All the actors did an excellent job on this story including instantaneous reactions to supernatural events which overtake them suddenly. This movie is not just Patrick Swayze candy. (The more I see his acting, the better developed are his acting skills. He grows with each part and is way past the ""bouncer, dancer, guy from the wrong side of the road, etc.) He does seem to be working on his craft even though the stories of his personal road of life have not portrayed an easy time.Whoopi continues to delight me. I become a bigger fan of her talent and her humanity every day.Demi also continues to grow with every picture although my two favorites still remain ""G.I.Jane"" and ""A Few Good Men"". Maybe she just looks good in uniform --- and I am a 56 year old woman married for 33 years --- don't let your imagination take you to wrong places. Having wanted to be in the military myself in younger days, she epitomizes to me how a young woman officer should handle herself while dealing with the difficulty of proving herself worthy every day to wear the uniform. Yeah---I think it is an honorable estate to serve this country and not every one is capable of making the grade! So much on those thoughts!!! All in all, ""Ghost"" is romantic, funny, suspenseful, and a good movie for a Saturday night!",Ghost
236,jasmineposhtv,FOREVER A CLASSIC,10,1 December 2018,Classic. I'm now 23 and own this on DVD. My mom used to watch it and I myself saw it once and fell in love.

Still a must see & must have.,Ghost
237,ben-john-son,Interesting idea but....spoiler alert it isn't very good.,4,14 December 2019,"Although this movie is regarded as a classic I just didn't find it to be as great as everyone else seems to think it is. It's an interesting idea but the are a number of flaws with it that I feel we're very easy to spot and leave the film quite problematic. First off, when Patrick Swayze's character becomes a ghost he's able to sit in vehicles, ride subways, sit in chairs yet unable to touch or move any other objects. Next, there's an scene where Patrick Swayze is following his killer home, the killer walks into his apartment and leaves the door open, as Swayze walks into the apartment he closes the door, as a ghost, which leaves you to wonder why was he suddenly able to touch an object when he wasn't before and why did this killer decide to leave his door wide open. Swayze's facial expressions and acting were absolutely terrible and took away any emotion I was supposed to feel for his character, while Demi Moore had scenes that left me wondering if she decided to make those choices herself or someone else on set had a hand in it (in a good way). Overall the movie is problematic but an okay way to waste two hours on a movie that's known as a top film from 1990.",Ghost
238,sandyonmovies,A love story with a lot of heart and Whoopi Goldberg.,8,6 March 2013,"The problem with romance movies is trying to make the love between the two main characters look believable to the point where you really think that their love would transcend death. Ghost's problem? Making Swyaze's Sam believable as a ghost who would risk his afterlife to protect Demi Moore's Molly. And I was somewhat sold primarily because of Swayze's performance. As Sam, Swayze looks like a man who has literally lost everything except for this love he has for Molly. Moore's performance was kind of lackluster to me, there were times where I was just kind of put off by her.However, when Sam and Molly are together and are just looking into each other eyes, I completely believe them. The chemistry between them is sexy. The dance scene when Sam possesses Oda Mae Brown's (Whoopi Goldberg) body is just electric. Or the scene where they're fooling around with the pottery wheel is incredibly sexy.Overall, the acting is believably good. It's really not that shocking to learn that Whoopi Goldberg won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as Oda Mae. (Ghost also won for Best Writing, Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Music Original Song, and Best Film Editing.) Unlike other romantic movies, the plot doesn't disappear behind the love story. The twist with Sam's death, the story with his best friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn) made the movie even more enjoyable to watch. When movies are bogged down with the love story, it takes me out of the movie, and Ghost did not suffer that problem.Ghost has an interesting plot with a variety of characters, strong acting with cheesy 90s special effects makes it one of my romantic movie favorites.I love movies that can make me cry simply because of the love story and this one definitely hit the mark. For all those girls who watch those Nicholas Sparks movies need to watch a real 'romance' movie that's good. Ghost is one of the best.Highly recommended. 8 out of 10 stars.",Ghost

Love Story - another classic love story. Those films have stood the test of time and faired quite well.This movie, however, is so sappy, melodramatic, poorly-acted... it's just pathetic. If there was an Oscar for the most crying by a lead actress, Demi Moore would get it for sure.The special effects are a joke - even for 15 years ago. The acting is downright pathetic: Patrick Swayze, as washed-up as they come. Demi Moore, never really been much more than a pretty face. Whoopi, other than Star Trek: The Next Generation - has made zero good decisions since ""The Color Purple"".Back then (in 1990), I would have said, give it a shot.

It's no wonder why Whoopi Goldberg
won her Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for this film. Oda Mae Brown is a legendary character on film and the way Goldberg brought her to life is truly a remarkable performance.
Patrick Swayze was romantically emotional and heroic in this movie.This movie brings many emotions to the viewer. It's nice to think of those who have passed away being right there with us still. A tear jerker for sure.
If you've ever lost a loved one and want to believe there's still life after death remember the love we share with one another lives on. This movie proves that. Love is everything , Love is beyond all. This movie in fact upheld the victory of love and hope.
It does make you think about your personal relationships as they stand now, and to value them.So many genres in this film blend together so perfectly to create this. It has elements of comedy, mostly given to us by Whoopi in her performance. But it also has elements of suspense, horror, and fantasy. But most importantly love.
Ghost really has the power to make you believe.",Ghost
244,jellysquad11,Amazingly Underrated Classic,8,17 November 2012,"The movie ""Ghost"", when it came out, was extremely popular, and for good reason. The story was far from what could have been a very cliché plot. I like to think of it as ""A Christmas Carol"" meets John Grisham novel. The romance in the movie was well played and very touching. Even though this movie may have some spiritual content that Christian's may not agree with, it does express the relationship between good and evil in and out of this world and touches upon spiritual warfare with demons and angels. Heaven and hell are both shown in detail, but it makes it look like if you do good things you go to heaven, and vice versa. I believe that this is not the case in my faith, that all you have to do is accept Jesus into your heart; but even so people of all religions should enjoy this movie. The suspense and action did not disappoint. The real star of this movie was Whoopi Goldberg, who stole every one of her scenes with her bold and loud presence, personality, and humor; she well deserved her Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as Oda Mae Brown. She wasn't the only actor who did exceptionally well though; Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Tony Goldwyn made a fantastic ensemble. Swayze and Moore had beautiful chemistry together with the memorable pottery scene. The whole movie works as a whole and it great entertainment, one of my favorites. **8/10**",Ghost

It has sci-fi, suspense, horror, action, drama, romance, sex, comedy, every thing. You're cringing, then crying, then laughing your butt off. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore play two lovers torn apart by death, seriously making you cry. While Patrick and Whoopi banter and argue to make the funniest scenes. You have your bad guys, the slimy and the scary, but yauaugh, the ending is a bit gross- be warned. But still, you cannot miss this movie, it is sooo gooood.

The actors were really good and correctly cast, I think. The plot made sense and the characters were believable. It's a little known fact that lots of comediennes's favourite movies are actually thrillers. My favourite movie is this and it's also a thriller too. How bizarre... Sam Wheat (Swayzee) is in love and has moved in with his girlfriend, Molly. (Moore) What he doesn't know is that his friend Carl is about to betray him. Whoopi Goldberg puts humour into this black storyline to create a lighter feel to the movie which I think is good to have. This movie kept me hooked the whole time. Dead on great film.

251,joni-h,Love Demi,7,4 February 2012,"The imaginative idea of writing a romance upon lovers communicating spiritually for one of them is dead, was first filmed by Steven Spielberg 8 months before the Ghost's silver screen release. His movie Always(1989) had its visuals fulfilling the needs of viewers with action-based expectations. Yet, Always was lack of the sense of romance, despite having the same plot and even the same storyline of the Ghost. Originally the idea has been created by Chandler Sprague and David Boehm.However, Ghost accomplished of what ""Always"" tried and failed. There were indelible moments in Ghost, which were lessons to whom wants to be loved. It is scraped in our memory how Molly and Sam kept their thoughts off each others' feelings, that taught us: ""Love begins with emotions, ends with thoughts"". On this account, they never called off their faith on believing to last endlessly together. There were also indelible scenes in Ghost, where the editing was so impressive that instead of trying to make the story more plausible, it empowered the devotion of lovers onto their relation. The scene which Sam's ghost drew upon Oda Mae's body to break the longing with Molly by kissing her is eternal.I was in love with someone, and it was February,2005; we were both watching the Ghost on TV, both talking on the phone. Then that scene came upon(Sam's ghost kissing Molly in Oda Mae's body), I felt lost deep in my heart seeking the girl I'm talking on the phone. I heard she was crying and sobbing, and keep saying to me: ""I will never forget the first time you kissed me, the next would be the end of my life"" Ghost is one timeless romantic masterpiece that had its moments. For me the kissing scene was the best kiss of all time. MTV had honored this kiss as well, several years after the release of the movie, as the best kiss in a movie of the last decade of the 20th century. Superimposing that, the scenes that Oda Mae Brown convinces Molly that Sam is around her and then Molly reasons with police that Oda Mae knows nobody is able to know but Sam and herself only; are the scenes that deliver the magic beyond eyes and beyond ears.To watch Ghost is in the to do list of what to do when you're on a date.",Ghost

The other good thing about this movie was how they kept the story simple and focused. However, the drama never worked for me. Movie telling you how to feel all the time combined with cheesy romance and bad acting wasn't something that I can ignore.

Patrick Swayze is not a great actor, and neither is Demi Moore, but they can pull it off when they need to, and here they do as fine a job as they do in any other of their films. Whoopi Goldberg has always chose these kind of roles--independent women with lots of talent (remember Eddie?). The film has no cohesive photographic style, though, and the art direction is similarly disjointed. Still, if you need a feel good ghost story, you can go in for this one. I am still dealing with my most unpleasant ghostly experience (I lived in a haunted house, and I recognise how unbelievable that sounds).",Ghost

Shot at a time when Patrick Swayze was still riding high on the wave of fame brought about by ""Dirty Dancing"", this movie serves to prove his critics wrong. Though not considered a great actor in the mold of other ""pretty boys"" like George Clooney and Leonardo DiCaprio, Swayze more than holds his own in ""Ghost"".It's a movie, first and foremost, about love. Along with it, there are other issues such as betrayal, death, and trust. Sam Wheat was murdered by a thug after watching a theater performance with his longtime girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore), and finds out only in death that his best friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn) was the one who hired the thug to kill him.It's a powerful message the movie sends- how love can transcend all tangible and intangible barriers, as long as the heart is willing to believe in the one you love. Even as a ghost, Sam does everything he can to try and protect Molly from all dangers.The film has many touching scenes guaranteed to leave tears flowing freely: when Molly weeps in her grief at home while doing the pottery, and Sam wants so badly to comfort her but she can't see or hear him at all. And nothing will beat the scene when Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) was outside her door, trying to convince Molly to open the door, but Molly refused to believe her. Then Sam uses the power of his mind to move a coin up from the floor to the door and finally into the palm of her hand. The moment was magical.Great casting, acting, and directing- this film will leave you spellbound long after the credits roll.Almost perfect. 9/10.",Ghost

This is movie was fun with the comedy (Applause to Whoopie) and the dramatic change the movie comes to. The love scene between Sam and Molly was the best. So sweet and sensual, really declaring their love for each other. Poor Molly though, her heart is ripped from her chest when Sam dies. She had no idea it was a setup, but that's when Whoopie comes in and talks to Molly through Sam. It is really a wonderful cast and such great characters. I thought at the end of the movie that heaven was going to allow Sam to come back to life, but I guess not. With them thinking Sam had no idea that he was going to die. But the ending was really a tear jerker and when he got shot at the beginning. I give this movie a FULL 10! I'm also a huge fan of Tony Goldwyn. Amazing actor!

259,Toxus,...So what can a ghost do afterall?,5,14 April 2004,"It is one of the few times i rate a rather light movie less than the overall rating. This movie has many flaws, according to me. I mean...the movie turns around from the things a ghost can or cannot do. So, from the movie we see that a ghost cannot touch people or make them feel its presence. They cannot hear it. Additional, a ghost cannot touch material things, such as doors, unless it concetrates hard. Yet, we can see the ghost walking on the road, walking on the floor of its house, taking the stairs (!!!!) to go to the next floor. We can see it jump...so does GRAVITY affect ghosts? What are they made of then? Don't get me wrong, im not the kind of guy that would search a movie for flaws to judge it, and i have enjoyed many films about ghosts and other supernatural things. But, in this movie, i could not understand what the ghost could do. It couldn't touch a door to open, it could walk right through it. OK. Yet, he couldn't walk through the walls? Or worse, through the floors? Or he could sit on a couch???? Could he feel the material things, yes or no??? There is a difference between claiming the ghost can move things with the power of its mind, soul or whatever, and claiming a ghost can naturally walk, jump, feel the wall but not the door, pass through the wall of the train and land on the floor of it??? (pardon my English). Those mistakes, can naturally be made since we are dealing with supernatural things, but if they ruin the whole point of the movie, then yes it affects the way im gonna rate it.",Ghost

261,elena-paperny99,Time and Passing,9,25 December 2019,"I saw this movie when it came out, with my parents; both of whom are gone now. The love between Sam and Molly is shown with sweetness and tenderness- even beyond death. And Tony Goldwyn is absolutely hateful as his despicable and sleazy friend, who makes the moves on Molly, much to the late Sam's chagrin
. Vincent Schiavelli is alternately frightening and poignant as the eternally angry Subway Ghost, gone ""before his time"", who ultimately tests Sam's own otherworldly potential. A true ""Lost Soul"".
True, some of the special effects are a little cheesy, but this can be forgiven as the medium was fairly new. They do, however, manage to get their points across. And Whoopi Goldberg is terrific as the dubious medium, Ota Mae, who gets more than she bargained for!
But I actually wanted to speak about two other players here: Rick Aviles, for one, who plays Willie - the cause of Sam's tragic death. I used to see Mr Aviles on the F train to and from NYC back in the '80's, as a younger working person. He did a funny comic riff with the passengers for contributions, before he moved on to the comedy clubs. I'm sorry that he passed so young, not unlike Sam Weed.
And a word about Laura Drake, who played the cynical female policewoman whom Molly's character encounters earlier in the film. I had the pleasure of meeting Ms Drake some years back, as she worked at my mother's nursing home as a sort of ""creative director"" for the patients, for a limited time. She'd lead them in discussion about current events, or the arts, and was quite charming and down to earth. At times, she'd speak with Mom one on one about family, and even typed something for Mom as a favor to give to my father. She told me how much she genuinely liked my mother, and I never forgot her warmth and kindness. I hope wherever she is, she is doing well.
Amazing what a film can trigger in us through the passage of time. One thing I'm sure of, the love truly ""never dies"".

Does Molly keep the penny that Sam slid her underneath the door as a good luck charm forever? My friends think I'm silly for quoting Ghost lines all the time. They think I'm way too into this movie! I just tell them ""(insert name) you're in danger girl!""I pushed a penny under the door for my husband and he didn't know what I was doing. I said ""It's for luck"" and he replies ""What's wrong with you?!!"" I tell ""It's for luck. The love inside....take it with you."" He's confused, I think he thinks I'm talking to white people on the phone during Arsenio. I say ""It's Sam Wheat!!"" He left me long too long ago. He had a transfusion to make on the second floor and he stole my pen. He wanted to keep it. He made up for it by buying some Asian Pears. I told him ""Don't you see!.. I'm not a fake!....not about this...."" Whenever someone calls on the phone, and we don't know who it is, I say it must be Rita Miller. That's our running joke. I get gas from time to time.",Ghost
270,abhinyana,"My opinion of ""Ghost""",10,28 June 2006,"Long before I saw the movie, ""Ghost"" ~ which became probably my favorite movie ~ I had said that this is how it happens; some people die so suddenly and unexpectedly that they don't realize they're dead; they can see and hear everything here, but cannot be seen or heard by anyone except people with a special sense of clairvoyance or something of that kind. Now, to be in that state, not understanding what's happened, and trying to communicate with people they can see and hear but getting no response, must be a most miserable condition; just think how it is to be 'sent to Coventry' in this world, by people around us, even for only an hour or a day: not a pleasant feeling at all! And this, I think, is the rationale behind the funeral ceremonies performed for the dead ~ or should be. That movie strengthened my conviction that this is so. I recommend watching it with this idea in mind; it makes a lot of sense; it would be interesting to know of the research that went into the making of this film. If someone could enlighten me about this, I would greatly appreciate it.Thanks,Abhinyana.(abhinyana@hotmail.com)",Ghost
271,rikoigme,Love defeats everything,9,3 October 2021,"""Ghost"" is an iconic mystical melodrama released in 1990. It was directed by Jerry Zucker and got glowing reviews and two Oscars for ""Best script"" and ""Best actress"" by Whoopi Goldberg. It was also the highest-grossing film of 1990. In the film we learn the love story of Sam (starred by Patrick Swayze) and Molly (Demi Moore) which doesn't last long because of Sam being murdered by the robber. However, Sam stays on Earth to warn his significant other that she is still in danger with the help of a fake medium Oda May Brown (Whoopi Goldberg). The film combines melodrama, fiction and thriller, humour, romance and tragedy and all of it is spiced up with an impeccable cast and the best soundtracks.It cannot be gainsaid that the script is mostly moving, but in some parts pretty hilarious. The entanglement that the main character faces makes viewers be on pins and needles about the ending. It is also coherent, credible and convincing because of the special effects and the professional acting of the cast. The lead actors try their best to show how real love can be more powerful than death itself. Besides, the variety of genres in this film makes it fascinating for almost everyone, no matter males or females, elderly people or youngsters, housewives or entrepreneurs. The soundtracks, especially «Righteous Brothers-Unchained melody» immerse viewers in the atmosphere or the film.The best thing about the film is the two key scenes where the ethereal love of the main characters is shown: the scene with a potter's wheel and the farewell of the lovers. Being touching enough to make everyone cry, it also makes one hopeful and enraptured, especially because of the lovely songs chosen by the film production.One disadvantage of this film is its triviality and obviousness. There are many films with the similar idea for the gist. Also, protagonists and antagonists are pretty clear cut so there is no intrigue. However, original though it isn't, the plot is still riveting and mesmerizing.Overall, I believe this film is worth watching and you won't regret it.",Ghost
272,taharoa,"True meaning of ""love""",9,8 May 2007,"I for one am not accustomed to writing or critique a movie however I feel that ""Ghost"" is one movie that is well deserving of commentary.First time viewing this movie soon after it's release, opened the floodgate of tears and the memories of losing my mother at such a young age rushed at me as I watched ""Sam"" (Patrick Swayze) struggle coming to terms with his untimely death and roaming his home town as a ""ghost"". Choosing to remain on Earth in search of and hold accountable the person(s) that caused his death, all in the name of protecting the love of his life, ""Molly"" (Demi Moore).I, like so many others have viewed this movie over and over many, many times and each time we notice different things or segments be it quite noticeable or minute; scary or not, humorous or not, but whatever the case may be all of these I feel, we lose or miss the fundamental nature.With regards to the actors, I acknowledge Whoopi Goldberg is a 'breath of fresh air"" and hilarious to watch. But I truly commend Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore - they played their roles exceptionally well, portraying the true essence of this film - ""love for one another"" in every sense of the word; love in the way humans were designed to do so.And, this is captured in Sam's parting words to Molly just before he walks into the light, when he tells her about the love inside, it doesn't die, you take it with you. This in itself describes what I feel is the whole essence of this awesome movie. The music and lyrics of ""Unchained Melody"" encapsulate the true essence of this story.I highly recommend to anyone who has not seen this wonderful movie to do so and receive it with an open mind and heart.",Ghost
273,faronson,Highly Overrated,1,12 June 2002,"I saw this film when it came out, as it was being recommended by everyone I knew.  I found the ""romance"" to be forced and contained little to no chemistry.  It was nothing more than a poorly constructed and thinly veiled ""who-done-it.""  I knew ""who done it"" half way through the film and there was really nothing left to watch after that.  I won't even get into my opinion that it wasn't particularly well acted.  That this film made it to the top 20 of the American Film Institutes 100 Great Love Stories is a sad commentary on our culture.For a truly passionate romance that contains some of the same elements without the muddling influence of a murder mystery, see ""Truly, Madly, Deeply,""  which came out around the same time.  Among other things, the acting is magnificent.",Ghost
274,hippyjem2k,awesome,9,4 January 2003,"In my opinion this film is probably the biggest tear-jerker I've ever seen. It is the only film where half an hour after the film has finished I'm still sat there in floods of tears. Brilliant. This film is funny, scary, weird and romantic.",Ghost
275,sunny-Kwon01,Is this only a romantic film?,7,29 June 2010,"I watched this movie twenty years ago. It was too long ago. However, thinking of the movie 'Ghost' made by Jerry Zucker, first of all, I hit upon the clay- forming scene with a sweet melody. I can't help thinking of this as the most impressive and romantic scene among a lot of scenes. But is this only a romantic film?Sam (Patrick Swayze ) and his girlfriend, Molly (Demi Moore) move in an apartment together in New York. They really love each other. However, on the way home after watching the movie, Sam is robbed and murdered by a mugger. He doesn't go to the other side, with him becoming a ghost. He is kept on this world in the form of a ghost because of his love with Molly and the murderer who killed him. Soon he recognizes that a ghost can't communicate with people in this world. But he comes across a psychic, Oda Mae (Whoopi Goldberg) who can hear ghost's voice, contrary to ordinary people. With the help of her, Sam uncovers the truth behind the murder and saves Molly from danger. He finally leaves this world, assuring her that he loves her forever.I'd like to say this movie is a diverse genre. It shows a mixture of various elements that are difficult to categorize it into only one genre. First of all, it looks like a horror movie. The first scene starts at the dusty and foggy house with faint atmosphere. However, I changed my thought about that. Two lovers' fantastic and romantic clay-forming scene makes me sure that it is rather a romantic movie than a horror one. While most love stories are usually based on their conflicts and problems of their life in this world, it is a unique romantic movie that deals with a love story between a ghost of a dead person and his girl friend who lives in this world. Meanwhile, the murder that Sam was killed breaks out. Complicated plot is developed like a mystery in order to find a murderer and to save his lover. So, again I can think of it as a thriller and a mystery. Last, to solve the murder case, a psychic who plays a critical role in it is so comic and ridiculous that she can help me free my tension and fear. I can conclude it is a mystery and thriller and comedy. I'm also surprised to see the director, Jerry Zucker create his ghost who feels sorrowful and mournful, even though other directors have used a ghost as a horrible existence, a non-emotional or revengeful one. Exercising his imagination, he makes his movie fantastic and warm-hearted like a variety of gift sets. He also makes use of sweet music and arouses empathy between me and the ghost. The acting of Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore is very attractive to me. I can't forget their fantastic facial expressions with delicate emotion. They look like a real couple. Whoopi Goldberg won a Supporting Oscar as a psychic. I totally agree that her acting is excellent enough to get it. She shows a lot of comic acting and looks like a real cheesy fraud. She is too talkative but cute and sometimes childlike. She looks strong in personality but in fact, she is tender. The song, 'Unchained Melody' perfectly looks good on the clay-forming scene. The song is emotional and touching in itself. And then it stirs romantic emotion twice more than any other scenes do. The plot of it is too predictable, and at the last part it is rather too corny because there is a obvious structure of conflict between the good and the evil. Nevertheless, it gives tension to me until the criminal is found. Last, this shows too common a message about where the ghost of human beings go after death. The message is that good people go to heaven in the afterlife with mysterious and brilliant lights from the heaven and that on the contrary, bad people go to hell with dark shadowy lights. In spite of too clumsy a message, it still draws my attention.I watched it again last week. Even though too much time has gone by after my first watching, I still have a same opinion that it is touching and emotive. If you fall in love with someone or you want to love in the future, I strongly recommend you should watch it.",Ghost

277,actingisreacting-872-663660,"Sam may be dead, but this film lives on eternally.",10,29 December 2016,"Whenever anyone asks me what my favourite movie of all time is, I say 'Ghost.' I remember seeing it for the first time when I was really young, and I still love watching it. The music alone (Composed by Maurice Jarre) is enough reason to watch it, but there are many other reasons too. Action, suspense, humour (Yes, humour. It's actually quite funny at times.) It's touching, thrilling, and other-worldly. Even if you're not a religious man, this film makes you believe in the afterlife, but only if you go to see a film, and suspend your disbelief.I know this is a relatively short review, but I hope it inspires people to check out the wonderful performances of Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and of course, Whoopi Goldberg.Having re-read my little review, it comes across as a political speech. I really didn't say anything!",Ghost
278,j-cooney,"A film beyond words, although I'll supply many",10,5 December 2005,"Although often marginalized by my contemporaries, colleagues, and the world of academia at large, the character of Ode May Brown is one of the most riveting, pivotal, and important literary characters of the past two centuries and quite possibly ever. Not since Charles Dickens' character of Louis Fontaine and Shakespeare's obscure and typically underrated Thomas Jack Abercrombie has a character sparked a national revolution, packed theaters (stage, projection, or otherwise), and redefined the term ""exoneration."" The 1980's, similar to 1923, was a time of prosperity, indulgence, and limitless thinking. With this hotbed of bohemian sentiment and excessive wealth to invest in the outrageous, the timing was perfect for imaginative works of zaniness and the fantastical. While stock-brokers were hitting it big on Wall Street, Andy Warhol was working in his ""factory"" in New York with Basquiat, Robert Greenwald was directing the yet unknown glitter-encrusted light and roller-epic ""Xanadu"" and Ridley Scott was preparing for work on his unicorn fantasy dream known as ""Legend."" Nobody was prepared for the cesspool of cinema stinkers to come in a period known as ""the nineties."" Being the final decade of a century, one would think the world was ready for images and sounds that were out of this world. Instead, the world was treated (heavy on the sarcasm) to such gems as ""Reality Bites,"" ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" ""The Piano,"" and ""Basic Instinct."" Not only were these films and every other film in the decade minus two completely devoid of anything spectacular or colorful, but they lacked the charm of the previous decade. In fact, the only other creative work to hit cinemas in this decade in addition to the piece discussed in this manifesto was Evita (review coming soon). The decade had the number 90 in it and was a time of grunge, filth, over-sized sweaters, garbage, flannel, and various other low-life things. The stage was set for something better for audiences to feast on.Breaking into this ""Bleak House"" that was cinema in the mid-90's, 1990 brought us a revolutionary picture that nobody would ever forget yet everyone strangely already knew because it was so engrained into the fabric of their being. Tired of grit on their movie teeth, people ate up this film with such enthusiasm. This film was Jerry Zuckers, ""Ghost!"" (Editor's note, the actual film title does not have an exclamation point in it because the marketing person at Paramount Pictures is an idiot. The exclamation point has been added because it should have had one in the first place.). Everything from the music (who will ever hear the Righteous Brothers' Unchained Melody the same way again?) to the special effects were unfathomable.However, while the film was superior to every film effort up until that point, the actual film paled in comparison to a small unassuming character housed within the feature presentation. Much like a priceless Merlot in a Dixie Cup or scribbles writing musings from Plato, ""Ghost!"" was simply a cheap container from Wal-Mart to hold something which surpassed everything anyone has ever known. That character was Ode May Brown. A character with such warm charm and charisma that anything that surrounded it was rendered meaningless and often profane.It is well known that the actress Whoopi Goldberg won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Ode May Brown. Many of my fellow and sometimes accomplished critics feel that her performance was nothing short of, well, amazing. This is the general malaise' and rhetoric that plagues both my writings and my acceptance in the mainstream media world. But I ask, and perhaps I digress, but to what capacity was Goldberg actually participating in? Going against the grain, I feel that Ode May Brown existed before Whoopi was even born and her character was not acting at all. Furthermore, the writer of this entry loathes Goldberg and feels that she has completely the only task she was put on this Earth for and can just as well disappear for all I'm concerned. The only thing about about Ode May Brown and the only thing Whoopi can do on this Earth that is worthwhile would be to make ""Ghost! 2!"" I'm not sure what exec. at Paramount has not set this production into motion, but rest assured, once this article gets out, ""Ghost!"" sequels WILL get made which, unfortunately, will revive the career of Ms. Goldberg, but more importantly will bring back Ode May S. Brown (if you know what the S. stands for, please e-mail me!!!) and her 2 lovely sisters to the big screen. For me, this mythic character is the most enthralling...""thing"" I can imagine and I would pay sums of money to learn more of her origins. Prequel anyone?",Ghost

It has a nice story, and it just makes you believe and love in the most genuine way that you can. The way Sam (P. Swayse) loves Molly (D.

280,johnnycastl3,A love story between realms,10,4 January 2014,"One of the greatest love stories ever told with all the right ingredients of a successful title. Romance, mystery, heartache, unsuspected friendship, betrayal and revenge, all perfectly encapsulated in one gorgeous story.We have a young Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) and the ghost of Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze), her murdered lover. Sam tries to save Molly from dire circumstance with the help of the hesitant Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), a gifted psychic.The majority of the film's great success is owed to the magnificent and electric on-screen chemistry created between Swayze and Moore as the two torn lovers. Their connection is truly believable, and with the support of one of the grandest love songs of all time, 'Unchained Melody' by The Righteous Brothers, you can't go wrong.Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae Brown is everything you would expect of an eccentric swindler come psychic, and makes for good humor amidst the turmoil.""Loney rivers flow, to the sea, to the sea...

As the name says Ghost, its not more of a horror-flick, but a movie that has everything in it, yes the drama, thrill, crime, comedy, romance, scifi!! It's for every other movie fan, but unfortunately there's no horror in it! Yes but there's a ghost(Sam), he is murdered by a man, while being with his girlfriend outside some theater, however that girl ( Demi) thinks that he was somewhat accidentally killed, but actually he was murdered by their trusted good pal named Carl in this movie. Sam stays in this world as a ghost and he has to tell his girl that he was killed and the killer is gonna kill her too! There's much more then that, little bit of comedy shared with the spiritual contractor lady, some sci-fi and some interesting thoughts put into this movie. There are some touchy scenes, they might make you feel the movie! In the end, a must watch , I'm not going to tell you all, so you can watch this. Overall, i'd give this movie 7.5/10!

After watching it, I found it hard to come back to reality I didn't want it to be over and I just kept thinking about it.The film opens with eerie music....for god's sake, the film is called 'Ghost'. But it's not scary. It does, however, make you think about a few things - life and death, afterlife, and those you love. And how you would feel if an invisible ghost started beating you up.'Ghost' is just brilliant - its more than a romance: it's thought-provoking, hilarious at times (thanks to Whoopi Goldberg), thrilling, mysterious and even sometimes shocking. It's everything! I have to say I didn't know much about Demi Moore before watching this film - and I didn't think much of her either. But now I can see what a talented actress she is. Her performance in this film, as well as that of Patrick Swayze, was heart-rendering.Definitely should watch it - it may not have the biggest, best special effects like we have in the 21st century, but it doesn't need them. FAB!!",Ghost
