0,MartinHafer,Perhaps you just have to be a teen...and still live in the 1980s.,4,2 February 2017,"Back in the 1980s when ""The Breakfast Club"" debuted, I was in my early 20s and never got around to watching it. I know it is considered a classic so I finally saw it tonight...as there was nothing else I wanted to see on TV. And, after having watched it, I really wish I hadn't. I think most of the reason is because I am 52...hardly the target age for the movie.The story is about five teens who are forced to go to Saturday detention at their high school. The teacher supervising them mostly leaves them alone...as he's an apathetic jerk. As for the five, they all seem to be caricatures--archetypes of sorts. And, through the course of the film you slowly begin to learn more about them.As I said, I am hardly the age for this one. However, even aside from that, I can think of quite a few 80s teen films that are simply more fun to watch...such as ""Better off Dead"" and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"". I just felt bored as I watched ""The Breakfast Club""...totally bored...even when the characters later began to spill their guts and supposedly 'got real'.By the way, one scene would probably be seen today by many as a sexual assault. When the punk kid (Judd Nelson) is hiding under the table, he buries his head in a girl's crotch and she clearly did NOT want him to do this. Perhaps it was funny in the 80s...today folks would probably not be as impressed by this scene. Sensitivities have definitely changed.",The Breakfast Club
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Cool, fresh and relevant- another classic John Hughes film",10,27 September 2010,"While I slightly prefer Planes, Trains and Automobiles, this along with Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of John Hughes' better films. It isn't a perfect film I agree as admittedly the characters are clichéd and there are minor logic lapses, but here's the thing- the more I see The Breakfast Club the more I like it. It still has its freshness, and while I never had a detention when I was in school even from what I've heard from people who have this actually makes detentions cool. And it is still relevant not only to the teenagers back then but now too, it does ring true a vast majority of the time what with its justified grievances, self-pitying whinges and hard-hitting home truths. The cinematography is nice and fluid, typical Hughes really, and the soundtrack adds to the film's coolness. Hughes directs wonderfully, and the script and story are well written and I think memorable. While their characters are clichéd, that I agree, the cast do a great job with what they have. Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall and especially Molly Ringwald give very appealing performances and interact well together. In conclusion, I love this film, while not perfect I like it more every time I see it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Breakfast Club
2,bkoganbing,Enforced socialization,9,17 September 2013,"The 80s was the decade of the Brat Pack and the decade of John Hughes who did films that spoke to teens and 20 somethings of the era. His enduring classic was The Breakfast Club a character study of a cross section of teen America of the Reagan years.In my childhood and adolescent years the culture had a great divide on what made the young tick. The model were shows like Leave It To Beaver and The Donna Reed Show. All the kids were wholesome and clean cut. The polar opposite was found on the big screen in Rebel Without A Cause and dozens of pale imitations of hot rodding kids. And the girls for the most part were just orbiting satellites around the males.That's the most radical thing about The Breakfast Club I Found. The teen princess Molly Ringwald and the weird girl Ally Sheedy are most definitely not satellites around the males. Although Ringwald could have shown up on The Donna Reed Show she like the others is a complex character with her own issues regarding school and life. Sheedy was something unique, an oddball who not only doesn't fit in but regards that as a virtue. Not that people weren't like her in real life, but just not shown on the big screen or small.The 'good' kids are jock Emilio Estevez and overachiever scholar Anthony Michael Hall. Superficially both of those could be Donna Reed or Brady Bunch characters. What's revealed is both are just trying to fit into their assigned niches in life and both question why is there so much pressure to succeed. One has suicidal intentions because of it.Judd Nelson is your James Dean character, good but truly the least original of all the charter members of The Breakfast Club. He could truly have been part of the motorcycle clique that Dean belonged to in Rebel Without A Cause. Dean himself bared his soul, Nelson took a bit longer to do it on the screen. For him and Sheedy detention is just part of the day. The other three are new to it and in the normal course of school day they would not be caught dead associating with these two or in fact each other. They all have their cliques except Sheedy who is a total loner. In the end they find they have a lot of the same issues and anxieties. Detention enforced socialization on them.Paul Gleason plays the school principal and in his career he took out a patent on these authority figures who are so alien to the kids. He did the part of the principal in so many films and TV shows his appearance almost became expected like Margaret Dumont in a Marx Brothers comedy. The Breakfast Club became his signature part.The Breakfast Club is a true classic, long and deep on character almost like a Eugene O'Neil play.",The Breakfast Club
3,Leofwine_draca,The pinnacle of the 1980s high school comedy?,5,12 June 2015,"THE BREAKFAST CLUB is certainly a well-regarded and well-remembered film from prolific director John Hughes, but I'm guessing it's a film where you had to be there at the time to get the full impact. I've only seen it for the first time 30 years after it was made, and after that time it feels a little dated and not particularly funny. Certainly not on par with a film like PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES, which I saw as a kid and still love today.There isn't much story here, as this is a single location drama involving a group of high school kids spending time together in detention. Each character is a stereotype on the outside: the prom queen, the jock, the geek, the outsider, even a prototype emo. As the dialogue and the situations progress, we get to know these characters inside out and find out what makes them tick.You can't fault the acting here, as it's all rather good, particularly from Judd Nelson as the outsider. Paul Gleason is a real hoot as the antagonist teacher. But it's fair to say that all of the characters, outside of Nelson's, are rather dull, and their various problems seem either trivial or rather weak compared to most people's. It's a good idea for a film and I can see why it was a success due to people identifying with it, but I think it's a case where the reputation is better than the actual movie.",The Breakfast Club
4,SnoopyStyle,iconic 80s John Hughes movie,9,3 November 2013,"Five students have Saturday detention in Shermer High School. Teacher Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) is tasked to monitor the kids and orders them to write an essay. They would call themselves the Breakfast Club consisting of the Brain Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), an Athlete Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez) , Basket Case Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy), Princess Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), and the Criminal John Bender (Judd Nelson).They would talk, fight and become friends. It's got all of the John Hughes moves. It's got a song and dance. It's got his teen dialog which was unlike most teen movies, and so real. Many that followed would be heavily influenced by his style and it would become the new standard for a teen movie. It's arguable that he created his own category of films that would become a main staples of movies. John Hughes plus ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" would usher in the 80s teen movies.",The Breakfast Club
5,Hitchcoc,Just a Little Over the Top,7,1 December 2016,"I'm not as enamored with this film as some of the previous reviewers. There is no subtlety to it. It's as if a group of people went into a room and decided on what types to throw into the mix. The premise, of course, is a group of students who are making up detention on a Saturday. The teacher in charge is resentful, so other than an occasional peek into the library where they are wasting the day, he has little, if anything, to do with them. What follows is an interaction among just about every type of kid there is in a high school. And that's where it falls down because they have little depth. They have been designated, in my opinion, to play their role. We have the spacey girl, the athlete, the nerd, the popular girl, the rebel, the abused, and so on. While their conversations are interesting, it doesn't play to the much more complex kid. It's not a bad movie by any means, but some are seeing it as groundbreaking. It's not.",The Breakfast Club
6,kosmasp,Time of your life,8,11 March 2019,"Depending on when you watched this first (or will watch it), it will determine how much impact this will have. Obviously if you've watched it back in the day, sentiment will kick in too. And while I wouldn't go as far as to say this hasn't aged well at all, there are some indicators that the impact today for some new viewers will not be the same as back then.Having said that, the movie still holds up, as we get some missfits thrown in together and mixed up. All with different backgrounds, all with different issues and problems. All rebelling in their own way though. Against the ""teacher"" of course. But the authority figure here stands for more and the class struggle, the growing up struggle, the maturing struggle, the being in school struggle - all stand for something. So while you may not feel the biggest association with any of the characters, if you really dig into the movie, there is much to find here",The Breakfast Club
7,classicsoncall,"""Being bad feels pretty good, huh?""",7,28 June 2018,"Ah yes, the quintessential teenage angst movie. Though I'm way past the target audience age for this picture, I can relate to some of those feelings I had when I was a high school student myself, many, many moons ago. Today I'm sure, the pressures on young students have to be considerably greater than the ones experienced by the Brat Packers appearing in this picture over three decades ago (as I write this), certainly a lot more than when I was a student going back a half century. But the primary issues still remain - how to fit in, how to find one's place in the world, how to appeal to the opposite sex, and on and on.The thing I found particularly compelling was teacher Vernon's (Paul Gleason) assignment. He asked the students to write an essay on 'who they THOUGHT they were'. That's distinctively different from asking them 'WHO they were'. There may be some subtlety there for the average person, but if one were to be honest and offer a careful reflection, 'WHO' one is and who one ""THINKS' they are ought to be pretty close, unless some serious self denial exists. Of course that could be a definite possibility, as perhaps in the case of Allison (Ally Sheedy). Her Goth exterior masked a sensitive person aching to break out, with the group dynamic offering an opportunity to show her true self.The character I felt to be most a parody of a real person was Judd Nelson's 'Bender'. His dialog and actions were so over the top and inflammatory that under real life circumstances, someone like Andy Clark (Emilio Estevez) probably would have decked him early in the picture. The eventual camaraderie that developed among the five students felt more like a function of the screenplay than what actual high school students might have come up with on their own. The biggest problem I had with the story was the actual punishment - nine hours!!! detention on a Saturday seemed almost unconscionable. And for Vernon to commit himself to nine more weeks of it at the expense of Bender's behavior only said to this viewer that he seriously needed to get a life. But overall, the picture did convey a lot of the feelings one might have had back in the grueling days of high school with all it's attendant trials and tribulations. Having just experienced my own high school graduating class's fiftieth reunion (yikes!!!), I can fairly say there were some things I would have liked to do over again if given half a chance.",The Breakfast Club
8,gavin6942,The Quintessential Film of the 1980s,8,16 July 2013,"Five high school students, all different stereotypes, meet in detention, where they pour their hearts out to each other, and discover how they have a lot more in common than they thought.Typically when you have this sort of plot, it is going to fail miserably because it is so contrived and stretches the bounds of the imagination. I mean, really, even if these kids had detention together, would they strike up a conversation or just sit silently for eight hours? But in the 1980s and in the hands of John Hughes, it works. This film, more than any other, defined the 1980s for a generation and really crystallized what it meant to be in the Brat Pack. Sure, we might not say all these people are in the BP and not all the BP is in this movie (it is a a very fluid, malleable category), but this is a must-see and one that most of us can watch again and again.And of John Hughes' films, only one (""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"") has debatably had a longer-lasting impact.",The Breakfast Club
9,lee_eisenberg,So do we remember school positively or negatively?,7,29 December 2005,"I am not someone who came of age in the '80s, so for me, movies like ""The Breakfast Club"" are mostly remnants of the past. Still, there is a reason that this movie is probably the best remembered of the teen movies from that era, and continues to impress people today. The plot of course has nasty principal Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) making five students do detention and write about why they got put on detention and what they think of it all. The students are jock Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), nerd Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), hoodlum John Bender (Judd Nelson), princess Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), and kook Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy).As the movie progresses, it becomes clear that what these students did that led to their detention is almost immaterial. The important thing is their experience together. Bender holds some hostility towards Standish for her status, Johnson can figure out how to escape any situation, and Reynolds seems an outcast no matter what.Maybe ""The Breakfast Club"" isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it remains a cultural artifact. It's worth seeing for what it is. Bender's cynical attitude might disturb some, but all that I can say is, some people are really like that.",The Breakfast Club
10,jboothmillard,The Breakfast Club,8,12 June 2007,"This kind of teenage comedy drama involving rebellion reminds me of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, being very good, but not completely as entertaining as gross teen comedies, e.g. American Pie. On the other hand, it is much more memorable than Ferris Bueller. Anyway, basically a bunch of teenagers, all strangers to each other, and all different stereotypes, meet in detention, and are told to stay in the room Principal Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) has placed them for eight hours, and in that time, write no more than a thousand words to describe themselves. As the time passes, Andrew 'Andy' Clark - the jock (Emilio Estevez), Brian Ralph Johnson - the geeky brain (Anthony Michael Hall), John Bender - the troublemaker (Judd Nelson), Claire Standish - the princess (Molly Ringwald, looks very similar to Bette Midler) and Allison Reynolds - the weird (and hardly talking) one (Ally Sheedy) get to know each other, even through their arguments and misunderstandings, and find troublesome and unusual ways to entertain themselves and each other. But also, as they open up to each other, they find they have more in common than they thought, the bit when their all sat in a circle talking was improvised. Also starring John Kapelos as Carl the Janitor. Anyone who watches this film can certainly relate to at least one of the characters, all fantastic, and the dialogue and comedy elements are perfect, very impressive. It was number 27 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!",The Breakfast Club
11,Woodyanders,A highly astute and affecting portrait of 80's adolescent angst,9,18 March 2018,"Five distinctive teenage archetypes -- competitive jock Andrew Clark (an excellent and engaging performance by Emilio Estevez), surly rebel John Bender (an intense and volcanic portrayal by Judd Nelson), flaky misfit Allison Reynolds (a delightfully kooky turn by the adorable Ally Sheedy), stuck-up popular gal Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald at her most radiant and captivating), and gawky nerd Brian Johnson (ably played with depth and nuance by Anthony Michael Hall) -- are forced to spend detention together on a Saturday. During the course of the day the kids let their guards down and reveal their true selves to each other. What makes this film so special, touching, and resonant is the smart and insightful way writer/director John Hughes sees beyond the restrictive superficial labels that society places on people in order to reveal that every one of these familiar teen ""types"" is actually a flawed and complicated warts'n'all human being. Moreover, Hughes not only firmly states that no one person easily fits into a simple one-word category, but also manages to see the intrinsic frailty and humanity of all the main characters: For example, Bender initially comes across as an obnoxious and antagonistic jerk, but ultimately gets exposed as the enraged, yet pitiable toxic product of an abusive and dysfunctional home life. The uniformly top-notch acting keeps this movie on track: The five leads all do sterling work, Paul Gleason breathes fire and finds the wounded resigned heart beating underneath the boiling anger of mean authoritarian principal Richard Vernon, and John Kapelos makes a nice favorable impression as easygoing janitor Carl. Worthy of its lofty status as a landmark 80's teen classic.",The Breakfast Club
12,Tweekums,Possibly the best high school film ever made,10,17 June 2011,"During the 1980s there were plenty of films set in US high schools; John Hughes made the best of these and 'The Breakfast Club' is a contender for the best of his films. The film takes place on a Saturday when five pupils have to spend their day in detention; they are 'brain' Brian, 'athlete' Andrew, 'basket case' Allison, 'princess' Claire and 'criminal' John. While there they are told they must write an essay about who they are and even though they are meant to sit in silence they get to know each other as the day progresses. At first they think they have nothing in common but after arguments, discussions and confrontations they discover that they aren't that different. While they are getting to know each other the teacher who is supervising them end up in the basement discussing how children have, or haven't changed over the years.The actors do a great job; with Ally Sheedy as Allison, Molly Ringwald as Claire, Emilio Estevez as Andrew, Judd Nelson as Bender, Anthony Michael Hall as Brian and Paul Gleason as disenchanted teacher Mr. Vernon. Set entirely in school there is little action; the strength of the film relies almost entirely on great dialogue excellently delivered it doesn't hurt that there is a great '80s soundtrack either! Considered a comedy there are plenty of laughs to be had but there are also several poignant scenes that are almost tear-jerking in the run up the a great feel good ending. If you have yet to see this film I strongly recommend it; it is a classic of its period and genre; a real must see.",The Breakfast Club
13,moonspinner55,High school fantasy...,5,30 September 2005,"Group of cynical teenagers spend a day's detention together in their high school library. When ""The Breakfast Club"" hit theaters in 1985, I was just a few years older than these kids and I still didn't relate to them... Their slang is meant to get laughs (it's on a broad scale), but most of the regular dialogue is over-the-top as well--such as Emilio Estevez's embarrassing monologue about covering some nerdy, naked kid with tape. The students are extremely bitter (even Molly Ringwald's girl from the popular clique, whom we never get to know); writer-director John Hughes hopes to fill in the gaps with shock-laughs, some of which register and some don't (Ally Sheedy's loner at one point says she wants vodka, but never again gives any hint that she's an alkie; Hughes tries to cover by making her a compulsive liar). There's a laughable built-in apologia for the kids' problems (blame it on their folks), and a ""romantic"" wrap-up that smacks of commercialism. The young cast is colorful and wiseass funny (with the exception of Judd Nelson, over-doing the schoolyard bully shtick); they make the sketchy material seem better than it is, for ""The Breakfast Club"" is just a high school fantasy that only pretends to be based in a recognizable reality. ** from ****",The Breakfast Club
14,blanche-2,wonderful John Hughes film,8,15 March 2013,"John Hughes wrote and directed this '80s film, ""The Breakfast Club,"" starring some young up and comings: Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, John Kapelos, and Paul Gleason.The story concerns five high school students who are forced by the principal (Gleason) to serve detention for eight hours on a Saturday and to write an essay on who they think they are. There's the troublemaker/big mouth, John Bender (Nelson) who manages to end up with something like two months of Saturday's worth of detention by the time he's done; the rich, pretty girl, Claire Standish (Ringwald), a strange girl who makes noises but doesn't speak, Allison (Sheedy), a nerd, Brian (Hall), and and the sports star (Estevez).They're not supposed to talk but of course they do, and at first, this takes the form of insults. Then they start sneaking around, smoking dope, talking about their families, their problems, and their secrets, and before you know it, they have all formed some sort of a connection.This is such a wonderful film, about kids who for one reason or another, feel like outcasts and find out that just about everyone does feel like an outcast in high school. The things they hide behind are stripped away and the real people are exposed.The acting is wonderful, with top honors going to Nelson, who without a doubt has the showiest role, and Estevez, who delivers a powerful monologue at the end. You could have knocked me over with a feather when I realized that this young blond kid was Anthony Michael Hall, whom I only knew from Dead Zone - but there was no mistaking that face. Paul Gleason is a riot as the harried principal, who feels totally out of touch with the students.Highly recommended - The Breakfast Club is one of the best youth films of the '80s or ever probably, with the great John Hughes touches that help make it a remarkable experience for the viewer.",The Breakfast Club

In one day, they all learn that they could be friends.John Hughes, who wrote, produced and directed this film pretty much ran the 80s when it came to teen films. Of course, the error in this film, the one that never makes sense to me, is when Allison gives up her quirky individuality to put on makeup and become like everyone else. Even when I was young it felt hollow and it seems even more empty today.P. J. O'Rourke, who worked with Hughes at the National Lampoon, summed up the film in a way that makes me question so much of it. He said that the movie lives up to Hughes's politics, in that the students do not organize a protest together but, ""like good conservatives do, as individuals and place the highest value, like this conservative does, on goofing off. Otherwise known as individual liberty.""Everyone wants to have a moment of rebellion but when faced with the opportunity, so many of us put on makeup and try to fit right in.",The Breakfast Club

18,sunwarrior13,Greatly Explores Inner Lives Of Teenagers,10,26 October 2011,"Whenever I hear the song,""Don't You Forget About Me"" by Simple Minds,it only reminds me on the 80's teen-age classic film,The Breakfast Club - one of the best films ever made about High School students.I personally feel that John Hughes once again delivers upon making this film.Breakfast Club is a film written and directed by John Hughes. The storyline follows five teenagers that represent different stereotypes namely: the princess;the jock;the criminal;the brain; and the basket case as they spend a Saturday in detention together and come to realize that they are all deeper than their respective personalities and nature.The movie stars Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez,Judd Nelson,Anthony Michael Hall and Ally Sheedy. The plot follows five students at Shermer High School in the fictitious Chicago suburb of Shermer, Illinois as they report for Saturday detention on March 24, 1984. While not complete strangers, the five teenagers are each from a different clique or social group.They are Allison Reynolds,Andrew Clark,John Bender,Brian Johnson, and Claire Standish - who seem to have nothing in common at first, come together at the high school library, where they are harangued and ordered not to speak or move from their seats by the antagonistic principal,Richard Vernon.The students pass the hours in a variety of ways. Gradually they open up to each other and reveal their inner secrets.At the end of the day, the students bond together when faced with the villainous principal ,and they realize that they have more in common than they may think, including a contempt for adult society.The Breakfast Club is definitely a warm, insightful, and very funny look into the inner lives of teenagers.Equal parts are funny, smart and sincere.It takes a look a little deeper into the teenage psyche and came back with something more challenging like how to grow up from their fears and anxieties in life. In the end,anyone who happens to be High School or have been in High School could relate to the issues faced by the people involved.The performances of the movie were great especially that of Ally Sheedy as the basket case and Molly Ringwald as the princess.Aside from that,the direction of Hughes is superb that he definitely proves a point that he is the best director when it comes to teen films.And just like what I said,the song attached to the film ""Don't You Forget About Me"" by Simple Minds remains a classic song.In the end,this is one great teen movie that even adults would appreciate.",The Breakfast Club

20,hitchcockthelegend,"They only met once, but it changed their lives forever.",9,23 August 2009,"5 kids, all with differing hang-ups, all from differing back grounds, are sentenced to Saturday morning detention at Shermer High School.......Of all the teen based films that have been made in the modern age, few can match The Breakfast Club's vibrancy and simplicity of worth. Written by John Hughes in just a couple of weeks, the film has five young actors in one locale, that is driven by dialogue, and for better or worse, managed to tap into the zeitgeist of a whole generation of teenagers. It would be churlish, nay even foolish, to suggest that all within The Breakfast Club is a triumph. For every moment of genuine warmth and poignancy, there is unintentional humour, and in one character make over scene, Hughes is seemingly saying that you should scrub up love as beauty is not in the eye of the beholder!Yet Hughes' film is standing the test of time as a perennial favourite of everyone who wasn't born with a silver spoon in their mouth. There is something totally engaging watching as the nerd, the weirdo, the princess, the jock and the rebel poke fun at each other to only then pick apart their respective defences. With the final result being something not akin to chest thumping brilliance. Those irritants that were prior in the piece now merely fading pock marks of the teenage zits we simply had to scratch. Not only boosted by one of the finest title songs as Simple Minds belt out Don't You Forget About Me, The Breakfast Club also contains a fine ensemble cast that infuses a sense of reality in the script. Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson and Anthony Michael Hall are particularly memorable, whilst Emilio Estevez {one excruciating dance sequence aside} and Ally Sheedy work well enough with what they are asked to do.Iconic for many, and resonating to even more, who would have thought such a simple picture could have such lasting, and unadulterated appeal? 9/10",The Breakfast Club
21,preppy-3,Quite simply one of the best teen films of the 80s,10,11 December 2002,"Five teenagers are assigned detention on a Saturday morning and afternoon. They are a jock (Emilio Estevez), a hood (Judd Nelson), a rich girl (Molly Ringwald), a geek (Anthony Michael Hall) and a basket case (Ally Sheedy). During the course of the detention (and with a little help from marijuana) they open up and talk and begin to know each other.A dead on target examination of teen life in 1984/85. This was a very challenging thing to do--release a film about teens just talking and relating to each other. It also was (unjustly) awarded an R rating for the frequent swearing--but that's how high schoolers talk!I was in college when this came out, but I saw it with a friend who was still in high school. According to him the movie got everything right--the clothes, dialogue, styles and music were accurate. He said it was one of the few movies that accurately showed how he felt. I felt the same way. I think any teenager can relate to this movie. The movie is somewhat unpleasant (some of the kids really attack each other verbally) but there's plenty of comedy mixed in too.The cast: Estevez (what ever happened to...) is just great as the jock. He gives a very believable and moving performance especially in a speech about his father. Nelson, however, is horrible as the hood. He looks the part but he's way too eloquent and his acting was pretty bad. Ringwald and Hall are perfect in their roles, but they WERE teenagers when this was filmed. Sheedy does what she can with a criminally underwritten role. John Kapelos (as a janitor) is hardly in it (I'm assuming his part was severely cut) and Paul Gleason (a good actor) is given a very 1-dimensional role--the evil adult. He does what he can with it.The movie isn't perfect--parents are the root of all the kids problems; there are annoying lapses in logic (like how does Ringwald get to see Nelson at the end and Sheedys character wasn't assigned detention, so wouldn't Gleason know that) and there is a whole dance sequence squeezed in.Still--a truly great teenage movie. A definite must-see. A bonus is that the movie opens with one of the best songs of the 1980s (and a big hit)--Simple Minds ""Don't You Forget About Me"". This is rightfully considered a classic.""Who'd your mom marry--Mr. Rogers?"" ""No--Mr. Johnson""",The Breakfast Club
22,Boba_Fett1138,Great character movie.,8,16 February 2005,"For the fans of movies with some good character development this is a must see.""The Breakfast Club"" truly is a movie with some brilliant character development and good dialogs. You'll have to like this kind of movie to fully appreciate this movie however. The main actors, Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall and Ally Sheedy all give some brilliant performances. It's hard to believe that that kid Anthony Michael Hall is the same guy that would later play Johnny Smith in ""The Dead Zone"" TV-series, I would never had recognized him!But to me the movie is not exactly perfect. I didn't particularly liked the ending and I've said it many times before but let me say it again; The 80's music is absolutely horrible! And did people really danced to 80's music like they did in this movie? Because holy poop, that was scary!All in all a perfectly watchable movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Breakfast Club
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Any teenager should watch this at some point,8,13 February 2005,"This came on the TV just as I was writing my review of Little Nicky, right after aforementioned title had ended. The title seemed familiar, so I decided to give it a chance. I hadn't expected the great film that I got out of it. This should be viewed by any teenager, at least once, at some point. The premise is as simple as this: put five typical but very different high school kids in detention the same day at the same place. The film follows them, as they spend the whole day at the school, and eventually warm up to each other, open up to each other and finally, grow to like and accept each other. This is one of the only John Hughes films(of the ones he directed himself, at least) that I've seen, so I'm not entirely familiar with his directing style, but I like what I've seen so far. The plot is very good, and a lot less pretentious than most teen comedies. It doesn't try too hard to be funny... it just is. The acting performances are all top-notch. The characters are well-written, credible and most importantly, interesting. The film keeps your interest better than most teen flicks. The humor is very good, not overly crude or offensive, but still teen-oriented. The dialog is well-written and equally well-delivered. A great film which should be seen by any teenager. I recommend it to anyone that is or has been a teenager. 8/10",The Breakfast Club
24,view_and_review,Not as good the second time around,4,4 February 2007,"Why I used to like this movie, I don't know. I'm sure it had a lot to do with me being a young pre-teen, aspiring to be just as cool as the cast of The Breakfast Club; that and whatever Molly Ringwald did in the 80's was supposed to be good. Watching this movie as an adult was very dissatisfying. The movie only reaffirmed a prejudice I already had, and that is: for the most part, I can't stand teenagers.Five teens at a nice High School in Chicago get Saturday school. Immediately we're shown the different personalities: the wealthy popular girl, the jock, the geek, the misfit, and the recluse. Throw in the loud, obnoxious, overbearing, drill Sargent of a teacher to watch over them and you have a cult classic. It isn't a mistake that the five kids represent just about every group from the high school social hierarchy, and how could you have a movie if there isn't any conflict? Up steps Bender (Judd Nelson), the 30 year old high school student with no hopes of being a contribution to society. He provides instant wise-cracking and obvious behavioral issues. He is the straw that stirs the drink, without him there is no movie. He is not remotely pleased unless he is completely degrading someone else. Yet, what you find is that high school kids are so fickle, no matter how much another teen insults them, angers them, or risks their future, they will cover for him and eventually follow him if he is the loudest and the boldest of the bunch.Bender, and the rest of his temporary ""cellmates"" all have some type of familial problems, and that is what ultimately makes them alike. Of course that is when the audience is supposed to have a sympathetic heart for these screw-ups because they aren't to be blamed for how they behave. And what better way to bridge the gap between you and your fellow teen than over a joint? I didn't finish the movie and I didn't think I had to really. I'm sure they all got along in the end, or at least came to a mutual understanding of respect though they don't like each other. The movie was far less funny and far more vulgar than I remember. Then again, my memory was stemming back to when my intellect was far less developed and my vocabulary consisted of the very cuss words used throughout the movie. All I got from this movie is that teenagers are fickle, dumb, and they like to smoke weed.",The Breakfast Club
25,anaconda-40658,Detention Generation.,9,6 May 2015,"The Breakfast Club (1985): Dir: John Hughes / Cast: Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estivez, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy: Title regards making the best of a bad situation as five students spend an entire Saturday in detention and the stereotypes are only a surface coating concealing real emotions. Judd Nelson plays a trouble making rebel. Molly Ringwald plays the prom queen with the wealthy parents. Emilio Estivez plays the wrestling jock. Anthony Michael Hall is the class nerd. Ally Sheedy is the outcast. They elevate beyond stereotypes with broad characters and genuine emotion that viewers can relate to. Director John Hughes understands teenagers and their confused role in society, which is perhaps why he is celebrated within this class of film. He previously directed Ringwald and Hall in Sixteen Candles as well as produce and write several other projects. The library detention room gives a appropriate claustrophobic feel as the students weigh out the time. It begins with aggressive introduction until Hughes reveals the pressures that these students face and how they are effected. Some claim that this is the best of teen movies. It is stagy but it does create a worldview likely to provoke a response from the number of viewers who know the drama of detention. What Hughes establishes is the differences in upbringing and the promise of adjustment as they enter society. Score: 9 / 10",The Breakfast Club

Despite their differences, they talk and eventually bond over the course of the afternoon.Though this was popular, film is nothing more than an unrealistic examination of the very stereotypes it apparently decries, that is judging people without knowing them. Worthy message, but film, despite some moments of insight, is really superficial. The Judd Nelson character(the angry rebel) is such an obnoxious jerk, that you don't want to see him end up with Ringwald(the princess) It is an unintended irony that the Paul Gleason character(not deemed worthy of sympathy it seems...) is more often than not right.And I doubt they remained friends during school hours for long, though film was at least wise enough to pose the question.",The Breakfast Club
27,FlashCallahan,I'm glad they never made the Lunch Bunch Sequel...,8,31 January 2013,"They were five students with nothing in common, faced with spending a Saturday detention together in their high school library. At 7 a.m. They had nothing to say, but by 4 p.m., they had bared their souls to each other and become good friends. To the outside world they were simply the Jock, the Brain, the Criminal, the Princess and the Basket Case, but to each other, they would always be the Breakfast Club....The first thing is, if you never saw this film between the ages of fifteen and seventeen, you will not get the what the fuss is all about and that's a damn shame. I saw this for the first time in nearly twenty years, and it didn't have the same impact it did when I was fifteen.It's simple, but brilliant, and could be Hughes finest hour. All the cast are great, but Nelson and Gleason are the most memorable. They have a great chemistry when they argue, and give the film it's main point of focus.Ringwald is great too, but this is because she fuses with Judd, and because of his character communicating with her so much, makes her more interesting.The rest of the cast are good, but are just that bit boring compared to the other three.It's funny, heartbreaking and tense all in one go, and when you are fifteen, it's life changing and important.When your thrifty five, it's funny to see the dancing, and how young people look, but not as important as it was.Saying that, it's a phenomenal movie and the epitome of my favourite decade.Please Hollywood, never touch this wonderful movie",The Breakfast Club
28,Aaron1375,For a movie that has like one location it is really good.,8,4 October 2010,"I actually enjoyed this movie though it is definitely a movie I would usually not care all that much for. Most of the time movies about people in high school or have such a limited amount of locations are not my thing. I like a movie that goes all over the place as a movie for me is an escape and the more locations the more locales I escape to. This film takes place in a library at a high school and focuses on five teens who are stuck with detention on a Saturday. Four of the five are not used to this type of situation, but one is quite used to it. I don't know, for some reason it works, it is by far the only Brat Pack movie that I really enjoy and I think it works for a lot of reasons. The humor is pretty good, the serious situations are realistic and the movie does a nice job of turning this five virtual strangers into friends. Granted, I still hate the fact the one person ended up with no gal at the end, but it is only a minor complaint to be sure. The cast does a very good job with their roles as they have to for this movie to be a success because it is sort of a character study. They only leave from the library briefly, so yes the movie does for the most part takes place entirely in that place so that scenery can be a bit boring. The guy playing the principal does a rather good job here too and like I said a lot of funny exchanges occur between him and the more delinquent student played wonderfully by Judd Nelson. I also really enjoy Ally Sheedy's performance as the shy, kind of weird girl. Molly Ringwald can do the character she played in her sleep and Emilio is rather good as the football player. Anthony Michael Hall plays the nerd and rounds out the cast very nicely. Good movie if not really heavy on the locations, heck it could be a stage play.",The Breakfast Club
29,Wuchakk,"Forced, artificial dialogs with eye-rolling character arcs",4,1 March 2017,"Released in 1985 and written & directed by John Hughes, ""The Breakfast Club"" is a teen dramedy about five high school students from five different sub-cultures during an all-day detention over the weekend at their suburban Chicago school. Molly Ringwald plays the popular girl, Emilio Estevez the jock, Anthony Michael Hall the Brainiac nerd, Judd Nelson the dope-smoking rebel and Ally Sheedy the neurotic misfit. Paul Gleason and John Kapelos are on hand as the host principal and janitor respectively This movie has a big reputation as an 80's teen flick, but I was wholly disappointed. Most of the discussions between the five students from different cliques come across contrived and unconvincing. Some of the dialog is actually cringe-inducing. The hoodlum could've worked as a character, like the Fonz or Vinnie Barbarino, but he's such an annoying, loud-mouthed jerk that he loses all sympathy, particularly when he verbally rapes the redhead on multiple occasions for no ostensible reason. *** SPOILER ALERT*** The fact that the two end up together at the end adds insult to injury. ***END SPOILER*** Not to mention two others that unrealistically couple up. It's strange that ""The Breakfast Club"" is billed as a comedy because there's very little that's funny, although it's occasionally entertaining, like some of the music sequences. Unfortunately, Hughes wasn't into the heavier side of rock and so the soundtrack consists solely of bland 80's new wave bands, like his other 80's teen flicks (e.g. ""Sixteen Candles,"" ""Pretty in Pink"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off""). Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of quality songs, like ""We Are Not Alone"" by Karla DeVito, but where are the heavier popular bands of 1984, like Van Halen, Scorpions, Judas Priest, Ratt, Dokken, Queensryche, Def Leppard, AC/DC or Motley Crue? Is it asking too much to have ONE song that actually rocks?But the music is the least of the movie's problems (and isn't really a problem at all, except that there aren't any heavy tracks). The actors are fine, but Hughes' dialog is unconvincing. As such, you don't buy the characters. The script needed a serious rewrite. The movie runs 97 minutes and was shot in the suburbs north of Chicago. GRADE: C-",The Breakfast Club
30,The_Void,A product of the 80's,6,23 February 2005,"Often regarded as something of a minor 80's classic, The Breakfast Club still stands up today as a decent, and fun drama. The Breakfast Club tells a simple story of five kids at high school being put into detention. The premise is simple, but it's what's behind the premise that's more important to the film as we learn about the different characters. This film will always be remembered for it's casting of 'the brat pack' over it's portrayal of teenagers coming of age, but that's not to say that it's deeper side should be ignored. The way that the characters are presented initially is very much two dimensional - with them all fitting into set teen groups. We've got a nerd, a prom queen, a tearaway, a 'jock' and a basket case and it all seems very convenient that five such different people should end up in detention together. However, this is how the film portrays it's point, as it shows that the kids are more similar than their exteriors would suggest, and that is explored through their innermost hopes and fears; which is actually done quite well.The film cuts music (mainly 80's style heavy metal) into the drama, which works at times but at other times is extremely annoying. It can be hip and cool, but it also becomes annoying fast and this isn't good when you're trying to watch a low concept movie that relies on it's dialogue and characters rather than any kind of razzle-dazzle. The acting in the movie is a mixed bag, with different actors being really realistic at times, and then really out of place at other times. Emilo Estivez trying to make himself look hard being a case for the latter. The film does feature many extremely unlikely occurrences, such as our protagonists smoking illegal substances in a school library, and one of them making a trek through the school roof; but the script always keeps it afloat and it's kept interesting by the way that the characters are varied and different to one another. After what the film has been building for it's duration, it fitters out with a damp squib ending that appears to be tacked on just to make the audience feel good and it's a real shame. Still, up until the ending the movie is a lot of fun so I still give it a thumbs up.",The Breakfast Club
31,safenoe,The Brat Pack,9,8 June 2021,"This is the movie of the 80s that's for sure. It launched the Brat Pack for sure, and really captured teen angst here in America. Anyway, what a social commentary this movie was! It was more about high school suspensions that's for sure.",The Breakfast Club

I grew up in the 1980s and I can relate to this group of teens. This film was serious and funny, dark and light comedy all at the same time. John Hughes is one of my favorite directors of all time. Maybe it's because to the kids of the 1980s, we grew up knowing his films and the lines and the characters and everything in between. I lived in the suburbs. The characters here in this film are casted excellently. Molly Ringwald owes her career to John Hughes' films, so does Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, and Emilio Estevez. We can't forget Paul Gleason and John Kapelos who play the principal and the janitor who worked a Saturday to remember. We all grew up with the lines from the film especially Johnny's. THe film touches a lot of issues like teen suicide, depression, child abuse, emotional and psychological abuse, and running away. We love the music and we remember the ending. We will always wonder what happened on Monday morning after their detention. What a school library, they make some public libraries to shame.",The Breakfast Club

Last on TV were they do follow some University students they came together to watch this flick and so I thought, a must see.And it is still a must see.

34,Mr-Fusion,Like a middle-finger to adults,7,23 June 2015,"I was an adult when I first watched ""The Breakfast Club"", and it spoke to the high-schooler in me. A real head-turner, this one. What makes it so resonant is the authentic depiction of high school teenagers - five disparate archetypes brought together during detention. I say archetypes, but I think everyone in the audience can relate to (at least) one of the characters. Hughes' writing is the blood that courses through the movie's veins, but it's got a cast that really makes the whole thing work (especially Paul Gleason). Also a pretty good soundtrack (not just for ""Don't You Forget About Me"", but also ""Fire in the Twilight"", easily my favorite). And there's something about the locations in a John Hughes movie. His choice of high school is both something that feels close to where I went, and a place I want to visit one of these days (his forte wasn't just writing and soundtracks; the man really knew where to shoot).This is a movie with real staying power. And the only thing I have to say against(?) this movie is Ally Sheedy's makeover near the end. It never sat well with me, and it's an unnecessary perpetuation of the importance of looks (just before we hear Anthony Michael Hall reading their rebellious letter to the principal, at that). I dunno, that's just me.7/10",The Breakfast Club

We all know that such events in high school are quite mild and not very realistic compared to the high school killings throughout the country.   Judd Nelson (John Bender) ""The Cabin By the Lake"" 2000"" gave an outstanding performance which launched his great acting career, I was always amazed by his great style of acting, he can do almost anything he is given to perform.   Molly Ringwald (Claire Standish) ""Cut"" 2000, gave a great supporting role, with all kinds of sexual abuse being directed to her by John Bender, even looking up her skirt and making demeaning slander to her character for being a Virgin.   This is truly a classic film by today's standards and should never be put under a microscope and picked apart.

36,StevePulaski,Want Some Strange to Go With That?,10,4 July 2010,"We all know school could either be a time of fun or pure hell. IT's especially hell if you're a victim of a stereotype which what all five of these kids are by their nicknames listed above. The only thing all five have in common is that they share a room for an entire Saturday because of some bad thing they did. It's eight hours with people that go to the same school, but simultaneously are completely different because of their social standing in school. But they come out with a life changing experience. Its absolutely a feel good movie and a movie that no one can hate.It's Saturday March 24, 1984 at Shermer High School in Shermer, IL which is where five teens need to spend their entire day. Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), John Bender (Judd Nelson), Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), and Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy) are the victims and although go to the same school, they are all from different cliques or groups in the school. They are secluded in the school library from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM, they can't talk, they can only sit and think about what they've done, and write their 1,000 word essay. They are occasionally visited by Principal Vernon (Paul Gleason). Though when he isn't in the room, they do the exact opposite of what they are supposed to.As time passes the kids learn about one another and know they each have a struggle to overcome and they need to rise above their stereotype. By looking at these kids you can tell who is who. Stereotypes have been around forever and though most are true can be hurtful and humorous. This film focuses and says to look past your stereotype and be who you can be. Let people see you as they want to see you. In my opinion the most deepest and heartfelt John Hughes film to date.Some kids my age would think it's a boring, lackluster film that isn't funny. I find it extremely fun and it only gets funnier every time you watch it. The movie is more than half dialogue which is why kids would be bored by it. But what else is there to do in detention on a Saturday? A kids moral to the film is be yourself, look past your bad quality, pick out the positives, and be who you are. A teacher's moral should be when you place five high school students in a room and expect them to keep quiet for eight hours, they will talk eventually.Starring: Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, and Paul Gleason.

37,Smells_Like_Cheese,The movie that made detention and high school a little cooler,9,16 June 2005,"I really did enjoy ""The Breakfast Club"", and I can truly agree with people that this is a classic. There is a main reason why I liked this movie and it's not because of the acting or the way it was made.I'm a high school graduate(Class of 2003), and after high school you really take a look at what your years were like. Were you a jock, cheerleader, nerd, weirdo, junkie, party girl/boy, pretty, ugly, skinny, fat...? It goes on and on. Either one of these roles we were in high school and we did get harassed at least once by someone and all you could think was ""Why me?"". This movie helps point out what the problems were, everyone has their own problems and pressures and take it out on other people. While the kid who pulled a knife on you might go home and have his father beat him almost to death. The nerd you knocked the books out of their hands, might go home to parents who are pressuring them to get the best grades they can and put their social life behind. It continues and high school is always going to be like that, sorry to those who are still in school.""What will happen?"" ""You mean on Monday?"" They whole time during that monologue between the kids at the end, I kept on thinking, and they'll go back to their regular lives afterwards.I will always recommend ""The Breakfast Club"", because you will have a true taste of what high school is like.9/10",The Breakfast Club
38,blanbrn,An 80's classic that I know by heart. It proves growing up is tough as your judged by your peers.,9,8 December 2009,"1985's ""The Breakfast Club"" is a classic I now know by heart having seen many times it's a classic 80's film that never gets old and it captures the times of youth so well as many people remember people they went to high school with that are just like the film's characters. It's a memorable classic from John Hughes as it was nice to see he really showed what teens went thru.Anyway four high school kids spend a Saturday afternoon of detention together at an area Chicago high school for their apparent misdeeds and misunderstandings among peers. It began at 7AM and was to last until 4PM in which they were to write an essay telling who they think they are. Yet none of them had anything to say, at least nothing to say on paper! Interesting and very thought provoking along the way is how they find out facts and info about one another by communication and it turns out to be quite different from each one's perceived stereotype about one or the other.The performances are stellar and memorable you have your typical cast of characters that you come to know in any high school first the prom queen sweetheart Claire(Molly Ringwald), the odd basket case(Ally Sheedy), the brain Brian(Anthony Michael Hall), the jock(Emilio Estevez)and the criminal and most memorable performance was from the delinquent John(Judd Nelson). Each deal with the typical teen problems of peer pressure, acceptance, drugs, sex, and parent issues yet each along the way learn they are a special person as they were meant to be the way they were. A notable performance that was standout was the now late Paul Gleason who was tough and cocky as the school principal who monitored the afternoon stay.Overall great film one of the best and most remembered from the 80's that really showed what growing up in high school was like as each character of the film could be memorable to someone that you probably remembered in school. As the film ends each go their separate ways leaving you as the viewer to form your own take of how each one's life turned out. One thing was learned without writing an essay their was a princess, a jock, a basket case, brain, and criminal and each accepted their stereotype. One thing to remember and one message to take from this film is everyone is different, everyone was meant to be different, and everyone will be different always remember that. As you will cheer for ""The Breakfast Club"" time and time again.",The Breakfast Club
39,MovieAddict2016,One of my (personal) favorite comedies. John Hughes strikes again!,10,7 January 2004,"Parents have never understood the youth of the world. Elvis used to be evil. Now he's too tame for modern music enthusiasts. Just imagine how tame Eminem will seem years from now. And as a scarier thought, who (or what) could be worse than some of the singers on today's market?John Hughes is locked in a time capsule, still bearing the mind of a teenager, and he is able to tap into these feelings of teenage angst. That is what separates ""The Breakfast Club"" from, say, ""The New Guy,"" or one of those other stupid teen films of recent years.And the jerk, played by Judd Nelson, isn't meant to be cool. He is a jerk, and if older viewers took the time to pay attention to the film, they would perhaps realize that the point of the film, from the very beginning, is to establish that this so-called jerk is only acting like one to get attention. Because he is obviously shunned at home. He's an outcast. And unlike other films that refuse to establish their characters, ""The Breakfast Club"" introduces him as a jerk, and proceeds to explain why he is that way. This is what makes this movie tick.I knew a kid like Bender (Nelson) once when I was in school, and generations of kids continue to go through the exact same things. Once they reach a certain age, though, it seems as though all adults suddenly break away from the teenage emotions. John Hughes never did, I guess. (Although he certainly tapped into adult behavior with his best film, ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" [1987], a welcome introduction to Hughes' adult comedy, hinted at in ""Vacation"" [1981], which he wrote.)The film opens with a quote from David Bowie that just about sums the entire film up. We are introduced to five kids spending eight hours of detention at Shermer High School in Illinois. They are: Andrew the Jock (Emilio Estevez), Brian the Nerd (Anthony Michael Hall), Bender the Criminal (Judd Nelson), Claire the Princess (Molly Ringwald), and Allison the Basketcase (Ally Sheedy). They are looked over by the school principal (Paul Gleason), who assigns them the task of writing a report on why they are here in detention and what they did to get there.To say that the outcome is predictable is an understatement. We know who's going to get together with whom from the beginning, but getting there's all the fun. Watching the characters come to appreciate their differences and learn that they're more than just billboard examples of angry teenagers is more than half the fun.Teenagers are not as unaware of who they are as some people always think. John Hughes knew this, and deliberately tapped into this state of mind as no other director has done before -- or since, for that matter. Sure, they've tried. (Hughes' ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" was just about the only other film that tried to show teenagers as something more than stupid hormone-crazy rambunctious adolescents, but as young adults who were trying to grow up fast -- the scene where Ferris and Sloane pretend their water is wine is good evidence of this.)Hughes' teenage characters were not the clichés they are now when ""The Breakfast Club"" came out in 1985 -- this film has proved to be the steeple of teen clichés (many of them poked fun at in ""Not Another Teen Movie,"" which features a cameo by Ringwald). Think of ""2001"" or ""Halloween"" -- the drifting spaceships and psycho killers chasing sex-hungry teenagers is now routine, but it wasn't then. The Jock, The Nerd, The Criminal, The Princess, and The Basketcase weren't clichéd back then, either -- although Hughes purposely chose these references to the characters in order to let Brian, The Nerd, say that they were more than just that in the beginning of the film when he's reading his essay in voice-over narrative.I seriously doubt whether this film is any better than the work of Coppola, Cortiz, Kurosawa, Scorsese, Welles, et al. If I were assembling a list of ""the greatest movies ever made,"" I'd never include this.But sometimes the greatest films aren't just the films that are technically perfect, but those that connect to you on one level or another. I know that my all-time favorite comedy (""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"") may not be considered better than something such as ""Some Like it Hot,"" but that film doesn't affect me the same way. I either don't connect with the story, the characters, the feelings, or I just don't appreciate the film as a whole. I appreciate ""The Breakfast Club"" in many ways, and for that reason it will always be considered one of my favorite films. Even if it is kinda sappy.",The Breakfast Club

41,cherold,John Hughes Masterpiece,10,30 December 2016,"I love this movie so much, both for reasons peculiar to me and because it is just beautifully made.The basic idea is simple; five high schoolers who fit into archetypes like nerd or popular girl spend a Saturday in detention and begin to connect outside of the normal high school paradigms.The movie is, to a great degree, about the traps we make for ourselves, and the movie is clever for making you think you know exactly who these characters are in the first 20 minutes and then showing you the more complex reality.The movie is well acted and nicely structured. It mainly goes for a reasonably realistic approach, although at times it goes a little crazy, as in a scene in the halls that is reminiscent of the musical sequences in The Monkees.I didn't see this movie as a teenager; I was actually 30 the first time. In part, I like high school movies because they give me the school I would have liked to have (my school experience was closer to Welcome to the Dollhouse). The movie also gave me a revelation about my own tendency to see people (myself and others) as types; the movie let me, to some extent, let go of that. So my experience of the film is very personal. But watching it last week, decades later, afraid that it would turn out to be a dumb movie overinflated in my head, I was still impressed by what an amazing film this is.",The Breakfast Club
42,Robert_duder,The essential coming of age film for the eighties,8,2 June 2007,"The Breakfast Club is for its generation in many ways what I feel The Graduate was for the late sixties. It captures the generation and in some small iconic way manages to make bold statements with seemingly 'teen film' type dialect. Anytime anyone hears 'The Breakfast Club' they fondly remember it making this an absolute classic and giving it deeper meaning than what it might appear to have. The Breakfast Club didn't treat teens like kids but rather portrayed them frankly, openly, and unabashedly, . It took stereotypes that are still to this day very existent in any high school, mixed them together and let every single one of those stereotypes have their moment and explain their side. It even went so far as to show the stick togetherness of youth and the eighties theme of wanting more from life and confusion and being young in an adult ruled world. The Breakfast Club is timeless.For all it's simplicity the cast nail every one of their roles and become icons to every teen out there. The story and cast seem to focus on John Bender played with eerie certainty by Judd Nelson. Bender is the bad ass in every sense of the word. He's the kid that skips school, breaks all the rules, does dope, drinks, has the hard home life, the bully, the shop class kid and he manages to incorporate all of this into a character you end up rooting for somehow. Even the other kids in the detention with him despise him and yet seem to look to him for leadership and come out with a better understanding of where he's coming from. He is the rebel to say the least. Nelson's portrayal is one of the movie greats hands down. Emilio Estevez is terrific as the jock Andy Clark who also has the reputation for bully against the kids who aren't as athletic or 'cool' as he is. Estevez has a quiet demeanor in most of the film and yet is very effective in showing a different style of parental control that somehow matches Bender's but is very different. Anthony Michael Hall is just brilliant as the brainy Brian Johnson who is the most down to earth out of all of them and seemingly the one with the most academic potential and yet you feel the most sorry for in the life he leads inside the school walls. He might be the most unfortunate out of the group socially and it's wearing thin on his mental state. He too turns in a brilliantly quiet performance. This might have been the performance of teen queen Molly Ringwald's career as the snobby, popular, and self obsessed Claire Standish who wants nothing more than to break the mold she has made for herself. She longs to rebel. Ringwald is just amazing in her role. Ally Sheedy is also good as the quiet, disturbed, rather odd Allison Reynolds. Honestly I didn't get or appreciate her character or performance as much as some of the other ones but nonetheless I'm sure others consider her performance brilliant and that's what The Breakfast Club is all about....appealing to everyone in a different way. Regardless the core cast of teens in detention are terrific and their firecracker intensity and chemistry is unmistakable whether fighting like mad dogs with each other or covering for one of the others' mistakes. Paul Gleason turns in a memorable and classic performance as Richard Vernon, the tired, and worn out teacher who is left to watch the Saturday Detention kids. He's harsh and abrasive and downright fed up with kids in general it would seem. Basically he appears to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown. As basically the only adult in the film and the only character outside of the core kids group he does a good job.The Breakfast Club is so incredibly basic. A cast of basically six people, all set in a library and briefly in other sections of the school and yet it's like an hour and a half adventure. They learn so much about each other, and themselves and rebellion and life outside of school and it's all just from being with each other who happen to be polar opposites of each other. It's just brilliant. I have no doubt that sometime in the future...probably soon...The Breakfast Club will be remade and it simply will never capture the original magic because I'm not sure they even knew what they were doing. There is just a certain honesty to the characters, a certain brilliance to it's simplicity. It's not perfect, I mean ultimately it is a 'teen flick' and many adults who didn't see it as a kid won't ever understand it. The film is chock full of gratuitous foul language, sexual references, drug use (by the kids) and yet this is life...this is what is dealt with then and today and probably in the future...this is more reality than it is fiction. At the same time the film is darkly hilarious, has some incredible one liners, and manages some romance which for me is where the film hits a stand still. The brief romance between Ringwald and Nelson is perfect for the film because as he points out to her, making out with him and getting even with her parents ""...in that capacity, would be outstanding."" It's rebellion not romance. But the sudden and forced romance between Andy (the Jock) and Allison (the outcast) is ridiculous and unnecessary but then again it's a very 'eighties' kind of move. All Allison needs is a make over by the popular girl and the popular jock is all over her...it's a dream come true. I think it clashes with the main message of the film. Nonetheless you can't exist until you've seen The Breakfast Club. It's a stone cold classic and a must see. 8.5/10",The Breakfast Club
43,ElMaruecan82,The coming-of-age classic where even the clichés and cornier elements contain shades of truth...,8,18 September 2017,"From Homer meeting Marge to the five high-school students' epiphany in ""The Breakfast Club"", it seems like only good things can happen during detention, it is probably true and now that I'm twice the age I was when I could live such opportunity, I can only mourn the incompleteness of my youth, desperately devoid of such heart- to-heart conversations that can make a difference over the course of one's life.Yes, I wish I hadn't tried to avoid these situations like leper. See, I was the class brain and I could relate to the pressure endured by the character of Anthony Michael Hall, the obsession with marks, grade, the constant need to please the hierarchy whether in school or at home. And when I thought that maybe I could make a good comic-book drawer and live out of my passion, it was too late, I had lost all credibility in front of my papers, and I couldn't believe it myself. Only at the age of 35, I'm still recovering from unemployment, trying to reassemble the pieces of the puzzle and trying to achieve one tenth the dreams, or let's call them ""the projects"" I had.Sorry I'm losing space for my own shenanigans, but retrospectively, thanks to ""The Breakfast Club"" 'or because of it, I realized that I didn't get the right advice and didn't enjoy the teenage years as it is supposed to be enjoyed. Of course, the movie doesn't imply that it is a time to be enjoyed, but most certainly to be cherished and embraced because this is exactly when you can figure out what kind of path you want to draw to your life. It's perhaps the most important moment in your life when you must learn to say ""no"". The five kids who get reunited in detention possess varying degree of strength and conviction, but the point of the film is that combining their forces together, they'll learn to say ""no"". I wish I could have the power to say ""no"".And I still don't know whether I blame my parents or myself. This is quite well captured by John Hughes, this sort of in-between situation, the film doesn't necessarily put the blame on the parents but rather express in the youth' awkward way the resentment we have toward ourselves for not being capable to stand for our beliefs. That's what leaving childhood is about, stopping to behave like children and act according to your vision of things. Sure your parents ""know better"" but they know from their own experience, the point of life is to live your own experience. Besides, the film isn't entirely against the parents since it also questions the power of peer pressure and ""friends"". It's all about useless burdens that prevent you from being yourself, or trying to.I don't like playing the labeling game although I'm aware this is what drove the writing but well, here it is there's Andrew the jock (Emilio Estevez), the wrestling champion who actually shares many similarities with the brain, Brian (Hall) both have parents pressuring them to be the best, to collect grades and points. Yet Andrew is handsome, good-looking capable to handle himself while Brian can't only perceive life under the prism of pleasing whoever provides the rating. He reminds me of Lisa Simpson's need to have a mark when the teachers were on strike. There's the pampered prom-queen, Claire (Molly Ringwald) she's rather open-minded, well- spoken but can't seem to get rid of her precious/prude image. Allison (Ally Sheedy), the other girl is the total opposite (Ally Sheedy) Gothic, making noises and acting as if she belonged to some institution.The real catalysis of the communication process is the bad boy John Bender played by Judd Nelson, the guy is the authentic rebel and by teasing each one, gives enough rope to anyone to vent their anger, let the hearts talk and make the whole movie happen. His strong antagonism with the mean principal Vernon (Paul Gleason) escalates to a real personal hatred, which mirrors the problems he's got with his own abusive father. Granted it's not the most earthshaking revelation, but it seems interesting that the most confident of all the guys and the one who actually gets the ""pretty girl"" is the one with troubled parents. I don't know if Brian felt the way I did, but sometimes I wish I was more of a Nelson, you know tough guy toughened by life. And you know why? Because you'll always have an excuse to behave like a thug, but never like a wimp. And girls hate wimps anyway. So for all the verbal abuse, Claire was victim of, she ended up giving him a tender hickey. And for all her attempts to pass as a weirdo, Ally surrendered to the call of femininity and after a makeup session with Claire, caught the eye of Andrew. And for all his gentleness and complicity with Ally, Brian was still a virgin at the end. You call them clichés? Not at all, the film highlight one important aspect of being a teen, a paradoxical need to conform to other norms than yours, all they need is a catalysis, some marijuana, some make up, anything, but while praising non-conformity, each one paradoxically conforms himself to another model.The film isn't totally flawless, I don't care much about the actors looking too old for their parts since the message is more important than the messenger, I just wished the adults were portrayed in a more three-dimensional way and that the characters' arc didn't involve some clichés such as the ugly ducklings and girls love bad boys. But even when it uses clichés, they're actually more truthful than pseudo messages about being yourself. The film works and when it doesn't, it still hit a chord of truth.",The Breakfast Club
44,paul2001sw-1,Saturday is det time!,6,18 March 2006,"Watching this seminal 1980s movie certainly stirs feelings of nostalgia: I'm roughly the same age as the film's central characters, and my school also had Saturday detention (although not quite in the form depicted here). With its archetypal characters, essentially static, dialogue-driven scenes, and internal dance routines, 'The Breakfast Club' is actually quite theatrical; but not without merit. On the downside, there's a dreadful period soundtrack (Simple Minds, anyone?) and some of the incidents are a bit obvious and ploddingly handled. But offsetting this, there are also plenty of genuinely funny and true to life moments. What is a pity the film is somewhat overbalanced by Judd Nelson's character; for sure, he's meant to be an attention seeker, but Nelson just seems too old for the part, more like a man pretending to be a boy than a real angsty teen. In the movie's second half, the character is quieter and the benefits are clear. The film has a crowd-pleasing bias towards the pupils in detention (as opposed to their teacher), and it ends with one of those make-overs beloved of Hollywood teen-movies, where the plain girl becomes beautiful (but only if you have a certain aesthetic preference). However, there's still more to think about about than in the average movie of this genre, not least the idea that the power of one human over another is always (in some sense) applied through consent. And compared to the likes of modern successors like 'American Pie', there's a sweetness here lost in the last 20 years.",The Breakfast Club
45,g-bodyl,Good Film for Teens!,8,23 July 2012,"The Breakfast Club is a very good teen film but is it a classic as most people make it out to be? I do not think so. All what happens in this film is people talking to each other. That, in my opinion, does not make this an instant classic. However, this movie is amusing for the most parts. The dialog is very addictive despite that is what all there is.This film is about five teenagers who have Saturday detention. They use this detention time to open up and bond with each other.The acting is pretty solid. I really like Judd Nelson as John Bender. He provides lots of the fun of this movie. I also liked the late Paul Gleason as the principal. He is really funny in this movie.Overall, this is a good film that explores the inner dimensions of a teenager. John Hughes directed a good if somewhat talkative film. I rate this film 8/10",The Breakfast Club
46,lesleyharris30,"A Strong, Dialogue Based Masterpiece,",9,31 July 2015,"The Breakfast Club is a brilliant movie with a really well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It's very deep, meaningful, emotional and even quite fun, it manages to fit all of this in to ninety minutes. The characters are realistic and all of them are very relatable, which is the main thing that makes this movie so appealing, no matter what group you were part of in school, this reminds us that no matter how different certain people may seem, we are all one. I think this message is perfectly conveyed here. It could have jumped in to dark territories more, it comes around every now and again, such as John talking about his issues with his father, or Brian telling us about nearly committing suicide, but it glosses over these dramatic moments very quickly. I would have liked to see it developed further, it would have added an extra layer to the characters. The cast is fantastic, this is the type of movie that could not have possibly worked without good actors, and thankfully they got great ones here. The chemistry between them all is perfect and they convey each school pupil-type, such as jock, outsider and nerd, perfectly, but it's also very real. Most eighties movies, like Revenge of the Nerds or Porky's, exaggerate these personas, but John Hughes always made it very life like, and Judd Nelson, who I think is the highlight of this movie, is easily one of the greatest characters he's ever created. Funny, charming and also quite emotional, there really is no other movie quite like the Breakfast Club, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy drama. A group of high school students are forced to serve detention on a Saturday. Best Performance: Judd Nelson",The Breakfast Club
47,A_Different_Drummer,Rated less than a TEN ... seriously???????,10,14 June 2016,"Just revisited the film and was gob-smacked at how good it is/was.As a reviewer, I have come to realize that people see films in two basic time frames. The first viewing, when, basically, they simply want to be entertained THAT MOMENT and don't care about much else ... and later, when they think back on a film they saw, and think, hey, there was something special about that film, I would not mind seeing it again...? This film is not merely a classic but one of the best films ever made, across all genres. The script is to die for. Remember that early films were based on stage plays (because that was all they knew) and early TV was based on films. This script is so pure it could have been a stage play, a really great stage play, and I think that is the acid test.I also think Judd, Estevez and Hall gave the performance of their lives here. I realize that could be taken as a compliment or a critique of their later work. But that is how I see it. Estevez for example was brilliant as Billy the Kid but really that role was just an extension of his role in Breakfast Club .. with bullets.Brilliant. Just brilliant.",The Breakfast Club
48,Irishchatter,"Weird, unexpected, depressing and romantic!",8,23 November 2015,"I just can't think of the words properly to describe this movie. Firstly, they all didn't get along by saying nasty things to each other and John Bender being such a complete dope to them all especially that teacher who was supervising them. Then the five of them were getting high and dancing all over the place with 80's songs playing in the background like lunatics! Finally at the end, they get all lovey dovey with this order emo girl/jock and prep girl/bad boy. Good mix but it was very unexpected from a teenage film like this! I wouldn't call this film 'The Breakfast Club', I would call it the 'Bad Teen Club'. I'm serious, the name sounds cheesy but I suppose interesting at the same time. I did enjoy it but I felt a lot of mixed vibes while watching this movie!",The Breakfast Club

All The Characters wonderful and you can relate to all of them, and i thought the story was fantastic, plus The cast are all simply amazing in this!.It's brilliantly written,and each character has there own special talents. Let's see you got the Wrestling Jock, The Prom queen,The trouble maker,the brain and the princess, all very 5 unique characters, all put together on a Saturday in a detention hall, in my opinion that is quite a unique premise, and John Hughes pulls it off perfectly, plus Judd Nelson cracked me up throughout the film, the only thing that bugged me was we never did get to hear the rest of his joke!. I found the closet scene quite powerful, as Gleason (Principal Vernon), delivered some harsh words for Judd (John Bender), as it also has some other great emotional moments as well, plus it leaves the viewer thinking a lot after the movie is finished.What i also liked is how all of the 4 characters constantly made Principal Vernon look like a fool (the toilet paper scene for example!), and how they always defied his orders, plus, each character had there own problems, and i really enjoyed hearing the stories all the characters told!. My favorite character had to be Bender, he was just simply put hilarious, and while i didn't agree with some of the things he said and did, more often then not he had me cracking up with laughter, and i always wondered if they would remain friends if this were to be a real story, plus i loved the scene when Bender keeps getting more detentions. This is simply put a masterpiece in all aspects John Hughes is a genius, and if you haven't seen it, i demand you go see it right this instant, you won't regret it!.The Direction is wonderful!.John Hughes does a wonderful job here, with fantastic camera work, and just keeping the film at an extremely fast pace!.The Acting is amazing!. Emilio Estevez is fantastic here, yes he is a jock but a very likable one with feelings, and you really care for his character and feel what he is going through, he also had some classic scenes with Judd Nelson, i loved him! (Estevez Rules!). Judd Nelson is AMAZING here, he is extremely hilarious, and actually very likable in my opinion, while i didn't agree with some of the things he said and did, more often then not he had me cracking up, he also had a really good heart as well, i loved him! (Judd Rules!). Anthony Michael Hall is excellent here as Brian, he is lovable as the genius, and i loved his lines, plus his speech at the end was awesome!, he rocked. Molly Ringwald is awesome as the prom queen, she is beautiful, and had a great personality i liked her lots. Paul Gleason is fantastic as the asshole Principal, while i hated him, he was extremely good at it, he was especially good in the closet scene, and had some powerful lines!.Ally Sheedy is wonderful here, i loved her character, and was my 2nd favorite next to Bender's she is also very fascinating and quite beautiful!, i loved her. John Kapelos is good as the janitor. Rest of the cast do fine.Overall if you haven't seen this Do so immediately it's a true classic!, John Hughes is a genius!. ***** out of 5",The Breakfast Club
50,atlasmb,A Teen Classic By John Hughes,10,13 May 2019,"It has been opined that ""The Breakfast Club"" is the best of John Hughes' teen flicks. The others---""Sixteen Candles"", ""Pretty in Pink"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", and ""Some Kind of Wonderful""---deal with similar themes, but they follow more conventional story arcs.In ""The Breakfast Club"" five students spend eight hours together in the high school library for an all-day detention. On Saturday. During that time, they are forced, by proximity, to interact and to better understand each other.When they first enter the library, they are strangers. Though they attend the same school, they are separated by cliques and class. Hughes uses various methods in his wonderful script to make them or allow them to see beyond the boundaries of peer pressure and group conformity.When we first meet them, we think we know them, based upon outward appearances and our own personal experiences. When I attended high school, there was a girl who was athletic, attractive and who always had a smile on her face. She was a cheerleader, which contributed to her popularity. Years after high school, I had the opportunity to get to know her personally and I discovered that she had a home life that was far from idyllic, it not dysfunctional. She dealt with stresses that belied her confident, seemingly happy, behavior.In this film, director and writer Hughes shows us the realities behind the facades. He uses a number of techniques in the process. First, the students are united in their opposition to the adult authority figure that is Mr. Vernon (Paul Gleason), who is charged with maintaining order. He is an obnoxious martinet, so it is easy for the kids to form a bond through their dislike of him. Eventually, they become complicit in defying his authority.The main way Hughes moves the story, creates tension, and reveals (and bonds) the students is through the character of John Bender (Judd Nelson), the sarcastic, anti-establishment rebel who likes to shock. Seemingly, he brings no lunch for the day. Nelson handles this central role with aplomb. Surprisingly, we find that he is probably the most intelligent person in the group. In later life he might become an artist, always offering a critical eye, challenging conventions. But for now he exhorts raw emotions and pushes the exposition of the story. At one point, he sacrifices himself for the group, further bonding them.Other methods used in the script to bond the five are one-on-one conversations, whistling in unison, music and dance (used as catharsis), smoking marijuana, exploring the contents of purses and wallets, and, eventually, group conversations.Claire (Molly Ringwald) is the well-connected social butterfly. She is popular and virginal. She brings sushi for lunch in a bento box.Andrew (Emilio Estevez) is the jock. Like a white knight, he is a winner who stands up for principles. He and Claire can socialize, because they dwell in the upper strata of school society. He's a wrestler, and his large lunch is an abundance of caloriesAllison (Ally Sheedy) is the most mysterious of the group. An anti-social loner who rarely speaks, she seems to exist in her own inner world. Her lunch is obviously self-made, consisting of a sugar sandwich she constructs from Pixy Stix and Cap'n Crunch.Brian (Michael Anthony Hall) is the nerd, the straight A student, the college-bound square with no game. He has a fake ID so he can vote. For lunch, he has a thermos of soup, a PB&J sandwich and apple juice.We also meet Carl, the custodian, who upsets expectations by demonstrating that he is observant, philosophical, and capable of social commentary. He says he is the ""eyes and ears of this institution.""As the hours go by, we learn that Bender has an abusive home life, Claire has parents who don't care about her or each other, Andrew is bullied by his father to achieve athletic goals, and Brian brought a gun to school due to academic pressures. Most pathetic of all, Allison is spending her Saturday in detention because she had nothing better to do. She is also a compulsive liar and a kleptomaniac.Each of the students, like all adolescents, is struggling for self-identification. And an understanding of sexual roles and mores. And how to deal with the pressures of conformity. In the end, they realize that peer pressure will continue to affect them when they return to school on Monday. But they wonder will their new-found friendships continue.One of the best scenes is when Allison, transformed by a makeover from Claire, presents herself without her face being covered by her untamed hair, and becomes vulnerable. Though she is fearful of their responses to her new face, she is hopeful. On Monday, will she remain that way?There is never a group hug, but bonds are formed and we see, in various ways, that promises are made. We are left wondering what the new week will bring for the five who found that ""We're all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it.""Hughes weaves a complex tale of discovery that rings true and will not go out of fashion for a long time.",The Breakfast Club
51,The-Sarkologist,A group of miscellaneous high school kids are forced to do detention on Saturday,9,28 October 2011,"This movie is one of those movies that I see as the for-runner to movies like Empire Records and Pump Up the Volume. Here we have a group of teenagers getting together and trying to understand the nature of the lives and the world that they have entered. What we have here are the teenagers of the 80's, a time that had much more promise than the 90's, but we are here standing on the edge of the bleakness that comes out later. What we see here is that there is still a chance for friendship, but I guess the important quote comes from the lips of Brian Johnson: will we still be friends on Monday.The Breakfast Club is about five students, all different, who are put onto Saturday detention for certain wrongs that they have done. They are not supposed to talk, but rather write an essay describing who they are. The problem here is that we are dealing with teenagers who really don't know who they are, and this comes out through the lips of John Bender, the school criminal, but essentially far more insightful than the others. They do finally find out who they are, but they do this by talking to each other and coming to understand why they do what they do, and finish off by writing a short piece telling the vice principle that he really has no idea anyway.This movie is about identity and trying to create ones own identity. The one major thing we see here is that the students are trying to break out of the moulds that their parent's have put them in. The jock Andrew Clark is no different to the nerd Brian Johnson. The reason is that both of their parents put lots of pressure on them to succeed, but only in different ways. Clark must not only be successful at sport, but also must muck around like his Dad, but the first time he does it, he feels a huge amount of guilt for the pain of his victim. Though it was fun, he cannot help thinking about the guy who suffered.What this movie does is that it makes us think what the point really is. Is it really worth suiciding simply because you get an F in shop, and is shop really all that stupid when somebody else sees it as his favourite subject. What we see is that five different people are coming together and learning about each other. They are being brought into different worlds, and being forced to accept those who are different. In the end they sort of all become friends, though in some cases, such as Brian, they really aren't willing to break through their prejudices.",The Breakfast Club

53,zkonedog,Maybe The Greatest High School Movie Ever Made,10,11 March 2017,"In the grand scheme of things, there are relatively few films made that contain almost zero wasted time/scenes. The Breakfast Club is one of those rare exceptions to the rule, as director/writer John Hughes crafts a film that utilizes every single moment.For a very basic overview, this film centers on a group of five high-schoolers serving a Saturday detention sentence. They come from all walks of life: The Rebel (Judd Nelson), The Jock (Emilio Estevez), The Princess (Molly Ringwald), The Wierdo (Ally Sheedy) and The Nerd (Anthony Michael Hall). While being lorded over by Principal Vernon (Paul Gleason), the self-dubbed ""Breakfast Club"" start to get to know each other a little bit and ultimately come to the realization that they may actually be more alike than different.This film is an absolute treatise on the life/struggles of high school students. Ostensibly driven by Nelson's hard-edged Bender, each stereotype is carefully picked apart and laid bare for the world to see. For example: Is Claire truly a good girl, or just fooling herself? Is Andrew happy with his high status, or just playing the role to conform to parental expectations? Is the instigator--Bender-- a legitimate jerk, or simply extremely misunderstood? These psychosocial quandaries are deconstructed so expertly (and quickly--it's only a 97 minute runtime) that you won't know what to believe by the end. Which is exactly how Hughes wants it. He leaves it up to the viewer to decide who ""The Breakfast Club"" members really are. You can view them as Mr. Vernon does, or have the opportunity to delve in deeper if you so choose.Lest you get the sense that this movie is super-serious, it is also filled with moments of hilarious screwball comedy. From the now-infamous hallway chase scene to more subtle touches like a comparison of detention lunches, you'll be chuckling more than you think.Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give The Breakfast Club, however, is that the scenes in the final 15-20 minutes are some of the most ""earned"" in cinema history. The writing, acting, and directing all set the scene for an equal parts insightful and fun final act.This is about the easiest 10/10 ranking I'll ever give a film, seeing as how it is so mesmerizing from literally beginning to end. It remains the standard for high school films 30+ years after its 1985 release.",The Breakfast Club
54,Petey-10,Teens of the 80's,9,29 May 2006,"The plot is very simple.Five teenagers have to spend their Saturday in detention.These high school students come from different backgrounds but find out in the end they're not too different from each other.The characters are known from pretty much every teen movie.There is a jock Andy (Emilio Estevez), a prom queen Claire (Molly Ringwald), a nerd Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), a weirdo Allison (Ally Sheedy) and a criminal John (Judd Nelson).All these people do a lot of growing on that one Saturday in detention.Paul Gleason plays the principal Richard Vernon.I was shocked to read from IMDb site today that this great man has passed away.He was a brilliant actor.You can's imagine any other actor doing the role of the principal in this movie.He shone also in Die Hard, a movie I saw for the first time as a 12 year old kid and was blown away by it.In both of the movies he played a similar kind of a character, a tough guy you don't wan't to mess with.Or you'll get in trouble.Paul Gleason will be missed by many.You did a good job. John Hughes directed The Breakfast Club in 1985 and it became a cult favorite.It still works today because it has a good story.Good stories will never die.The time has passed since that.It has been 21 years.The brat back is gone and all the members are all grown now.The fame they had then doesn't exist anymore.But they all got out of detention and life went on.",The Breakfast Club
55,TheMovieDiorama,The Breakfast Club is one detention that I could sit through again and again.,9,17 February 2019,"As an avid cinephile, I often see this coming-of-age teen drama in many ""best of all time"" lists. So naturally I was hesitant to take the plunge, considering my modern eyes that are used to the likes of 'Lady Bird' and 'The Edge of Seventeen'. Alas, I dived right in head first and let me tell you one thing, this may just be the best film I've seen from the 80s. A bold statement, but rest assured I shall back up my opinion with this extensive review. Five students must spend their Saturday in detention, to which they soon start communicating with each other and acknowledging their different lifestyles.It would be foolish to class this as just an extended weekend detention featuring irresponsible youths and an unlikeable teacher. The Breakfast Club is so much more. Hughes' intuitive screenplay plots these random strangers into one room and allows them to naturally unravel through confrontations and verbal conflict. Yet, it is through this process that we start to see these childish students as young adults who are trapped by the upbringing of their parents. Their morals, ideologies and behavioural patterns all stem down from the adults who raise them, and Hughes understands this. It is what powers the dialogue, the infectious characterisation and blossoming friendships. The differing personalities, each with nicknames (The Criminal, The Princess, The Athlete, The Brain and The Basket Case), act as a catalyst for the sizzling bonds that are being formed. John and Andrew's alpha-male stand offs complement Brian and Allison's solidarity within the group.Right from the first five minutes, the characters were interesting and the screenplay immediately kicks into action. Each student was bustling with personality, and it was refreshing to see. Proceeding scenes consist of discussions, arguments and revelations that gradually allow them to open up to each other. Hughes delicately focuses on each character and gives them a chance to reveal their secrets that make them feel trapped. The enclosed environment assists in sharpening the dialogue, ensuring it is always at the forefront. There is a beautifully constructed twenty minute scene when all five of them are just sitting on the floor and talking about themselves. Peer pressure, abuse, compulsive lies and even contemplating suicide. Very heavy themes that teenagers in stressful situations do unfortunately experience. Couldn't take my eyes off for one moment. Palpable drama. Each performance was memorable, although Nelson reigns supreme with his boisterous role. Estevez was probably the weakest as he occasionally succumbs to monotony, but still gave an engrossing performance. Simple Minds' 'Don't You (Forget About Me)' suits the film perfectly and welcomes the 80s aesthetic appeal. And Hughes' direction was solid!My only two criticisms would be the rushed conclusion and the relationships that developed abruptly, and when John's head was up Claire's skirt which I found to be distasteful (despite suiting the character). Small nitpicks for a film that beautiful bends school stereotypes and transforms a tedious detention into a riveting drama that I shall not be forgetting anytime soon.",The Breakfast Club
56,pmtelefon,"An '80s ""classic"".",7,25 May 2019,"How ""The Breakfast Club"" leapfrogged all of the other great '80s teen movies to become the classic of the genre is a bit of a mystery to me. When I saw it in the theater (MovieWorld, Douglaston, NY) I liked it but never did it cross my mind that this movie was going to be the '80s movie that future generations would be watching. I mean both of my daughters had to watch ""The Breakfast Club"" in school (even though it's rated ""R"" and filled with cursing and parent bashing). It is a good movie but the ""serious"" scenes are a drag to watch and, at the end of the day, kind of silly. It is actually the scenes with Mr Vernon and janitor Carl that save this movie. They are the best characters in movie not the whiny teens. All that said, ""The Breakfast Club"" is required viewing. At least once.",The Breakfast Club
57,damianphelps,A Nice Movie,6,28 September 2020,"A much loved film that's entertaining and fun.A lot of people connect with the portrayal of teenage life in the 80's usually identifying with one of the character or personality types. For some of you, it may be recognising and laughing at your parents and what they thought was cool at the time.This is not a deep analysis, its a comedy so everything is relatively light and fluffy and wrapped in positive messages.Its a bit of fun that most people will find enjoyment from :)",The Breakfast Club
58,insomniac_rod,The ups and downs of being a teenager perfectly displayed.,9,11 February 2007,"I'm glad I watched ""The Breakfast Club"" before highschool ended (years ago). This is the perfect movie that displays (without marked comedic events) how difficult a teenager's life can be.Sure, ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" displays the comedic part and how happy a teenager's life can be; but ""The Breakfast Club"" displays the truth and the burdens about it. We're all confused as teenagers because we don't know what to expect of life, we don't know how to fight against our inner fears, and we don't know in resume what the heck is going on.Through characters with strong personalities, we learn about how can different personalities be well, very different and that's why it's impossible to have never chemistry with many different ""social"" groups from highschool. We have the nerdy guy, the rich spoiled girl, the sports stud, the bad guy with an attitude, and the Gothic chick. All of them have great chemistry between each other but they know that if it wasn't for detention, they wouldn't even talk to each other.The greatness of the movie is that it shows how different and equal we are at the same time as teenagers. I mean, we all have problems that deal with family, friends, society, etc. But we can also share our experiences and find solutions. Also, it displays that students aren't always the problem because there are some teachers that will make the road to growing up very difficult.The situations are comedic and dramatic. A perfect mix. This is an essential teen comedy-drama that should be watched by everyone who is about to end high school. The ending is satisfying.",The Breakfast Club

By the end of the day, they have bonded together, accepted each other for who they are, faced their fears and truths. That is a what a good movie. Over the course of the day we have a real a..ehole of a take no s..t principal, wonderfully played by Paul Gleeson. Watching him get riled by Bender (Judd Nelson, the standout performance in this, which honestly has you mystified as to why he never received more acting nominations during his career) is just too much fun. The actor's conversations, issues, whatever, become absolutely mesmerizing to the audience, we wanna feel part of the group. By the end of the day, one detentionee, a basket case as you will, has made a total transformation, another great performance here. Even the janitor is made interesting, popping up here and there, one piece of dialogue he delivers to Gleason, regarding these teens, stays with me. Truly this film is an aphrodisiac for movie buffs.

So they all start befriending each other and they all come up with a brainwave to try and escape detention. But will the 5 high schoolers escape?The acting was very good(from Emilo Estevez who is Charlie Sheen's brother who was in The Mighty Ducks,to Molly Ringwald to Anthony Micheal Hall)down to the soundtrack(Don't You Forget About Me),this 80s movie is timeless. If they ever thought about remaking it I wouldn't think it would work. One scene I remember was the misfits escaping and they spotted a janitor and hid so that the janitor wouldn't find them.I did a review of this a while back but for some strange reason it got deleted. If you haven't seen it then be sure and check it out the next time its playing on TV. From the man that brought you Home Alone 2 I give this movie a thumbs up.",The Breakfast Club

Each one has their way of life, how things run in the house, and furthermore, they build a bond. At first, everyone except Allison are getting to know one another, however John always being the ""bad seed"", seems to love trouble. I like the part where he tried to escape, only to fall through the ceiling and into the men's room. Then I liked the part where John looked up Claire's skirt while he was trying to hide from Principal Vernon(Paul Gleason). When Allison is made over, she gets the jock, and John gets Claire, too bad for Brian, however, I bet he's too busy for girls.

It rambles in its sugar-coated sweetness, headed seemingly nowhere, going nowhere, and landing you nowhere for your trouble.

65,hellraiser7,High School Blues,10,21 January 2015,"In high school I've always passed by a lot of people and even some of the clichés there in. I've always wondered even to this day, who was that person that passed by, what were they thinking, or what did that person think about when she looked at me.This film is one of my favorite movies in general and it's my favorite teen film from one of my favorite script writers John Hughes. John Hughes just always knew how to mix both humor and humanity very well, most of it from the dialog they delivered which felt like something any everyday person would say. Or even the amount of depth each of the characters had and that they were all in some amount of pain that most of use everyday deal with.Watching this film as a teenager it really blew me away because it really talked to me. Looking at this film now as an adult it's like reading a journal passage, I'm able to say yeah that happened to me.The whole film is pretty much like one big bottle episode, this film I feel executes it well, despite it being a film where nothing really happens it has an energy that just keeps things moving so you don't feel like you've been in there too long. And due to the dialog, depth and what each of the characters due in their time in a confined space, it keeps itself interesting.I even like how they use the school library which I'll admit is probably the most impressive library I've ever seen, it looks more like a collage library. But I like how spacious it is and really induces a positive atmosphere and freedom of movement which works to the characters advantage because here they have total freedom to do and be whatever they want. The humor is great from the suttle to big jokes. One of my favorite jokes no down is seeing Andrew as he is a bit stoned he is dancing and doing some gymnastics to some rock music on the second floor of the library and we see that moment when he breaks the glass door by just screaming at it. That always cracked me up, this guy has superhuman vocals. But also that's just something I'd love to do if I ever had the library or a mall to myself.The characters are all great, because their all three dimensional their not the steriotyipcial teen you might see in one crappy TV teen drama too many, but in a way actually feel like people that actually can exist.Bender played well by Judd Nelson is a lot of fun. He's a so called rebel that is a blow hole that you love to dislike or like depending on the time. Yes the guy is a bit guilty of anti social behavior, there are times he can really be antagonizing from his attention getting complex and comes really close to pressing that wrong button with everyone.However my favorite character is Alison played by Ally Sheedy. I'll admit when I was a kid I actually did have a crush on this actress, yeah I know there was Molly Ringwold but I was just attracted to Ally more. This is my favorite role from her as she plays a shy girl, her character literally doesn't say a whole lot in the film but to me she doesn't need to, sometimes you say a lot by not saying anything at all.This character in a way is a lot like myself in real life, OK not entirely but there are some thing about her I can relate to. The fact that she doesn't talk much, and it's not always because she's shy it's just that she doesn't feel a need to talk and when she talks she feels like it or there actually is something to talk about.Other things I like is the fact that she's an introvert, this girl is just constantly full of surprises from her quaky need to take random things for no particular reason but we also see that she's an talented artist as she was able to draw a really detailed landscape sketch. Even like some of her chemistry with Andrew, despite there being not many interaction scenes between the two I really felt both made a connection.I really love it when we finally get down to the really serious stuff when finally everyone just opens up. One issue I can really relate to is Brian's when he talks about the pressure he has to go though everyday to maintain being a A student and to never get an F because his family can't have it. This really made me feel for Brian not just the fact I was also like him but that it really gets an issue about our education system how they've set the bar too high. I know there is such a think as challenging intelligent minds but there is such a thing as being too challenging, which to me always messes me up and depletes morale. I do believe in success but you also have to let people be people.The ending is interesting because it's open ended and sort of left to your interpretation because after their time is over you can't help but wonder what's going to happen Monday morning, or if all or any of them will remain friends. But so it goes with life itself, they all got though today but tomorrow is a new day. However it also has a sense of hope as each of them in that short span of time have all grown a little and because what they all truly are people.The real education is outside the classroom.Rating: 4 stars",The Breakfast Club
66,jadavix,Timeless teen classic,9,10 September 2021,"You know how teen movies and TV shows always feature a sampling of all the generic groups in high schools, for mass marketability? You know, movies like ""American Pie"" and ""Road Trip"" where the friend group will feature a jock, a nerd, a cool guy, and of course a dead-average regular kid, usually to be the protagonist? This insures that the audience will be able to relate to someone in the movie, they'll like the movie, they'll go see the movie, they'll recommend the movie to other people, it will make more money...The problem, that people seem to have forgotten, is that this is totally unrealistic. How many nerds were friends with jocks in high school? How many from one group even knew the names of those of another?""The Breakfast Club"" always impressed me because it's one of the few movies to acknowledge this fact. All the teenage characters are members of different cliques that would never have anything to do with each other, but the movie provides a reason to put them together, and their differences and similarities are explored.It's the performances of the five leads that anchor the movie. They are amazing, and you believe in and care for every character. It is no surprise to me to learn that the movie was rehearsed like a play by the cast, allowing for free improvisation. I love movies based on plays, because they generally have deeper characters, more interesting dialogue, and more complex feelings.The movie is not perfect. Hughes allegedly wanted it to be longer, and I wish it had have been, and I somewhat agree with Molly Ringwald that the dance scene feels unnecessary. Despite these minor misgivings, though, ""The Breakfast Club"" is a timeless teen classic. Even the cliques haven't really changed that much.",The Breakfast Club

They are all anti authority, but they all can understand each other in their own ways.The stars of this movie reads like who's who of the teen stars of the '80s. They all went on to have successful careers during the '80s. They did have charisma, and were entertaining to watch. The movie might have not worked well if it wasn't for the stellar acting by Judd Nelson.This is an interesting movie that the whole movie happens within the school. It captures the social mood of the 80s well. Kids back then definitely had more peaceful outlook towards their life than now.

68,dee.reid,"Saturday morning detention was never this funny, moving, or heartfelt",10,27 February 2009,"""The Breakfast Club"" is arguably the best movie ever made about teenagers that it's no wonder that it's such an essential piece of 1980s teen fanfare/nostalgia. This movie is all of funny (sometimes hilariously so), moving, and heartfelt. The most authentic thing about this film is that regardless of the blatant stereotyping of high school cliques (honestly, not a whole lot has changed since 1985) and melodrama, this movie pulls at the heart-strings in ways you never would have thought were possible for a film such as this. And this heart-string-pulling is sincere and honest, making my assertion that it's authentic correct.For early Saturday morning detention, five suburban Chicago high school students have showed up as punishment, with Principal Richard Vernon (the late Paul Gleason) presiding over the festivities. They've all done something to land here this morning, and they each represent the various cliques in their school: Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez) is the stereotypical jock, Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald) is the stereotypical beauty/princess, Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall) is the stereotypical nerd/brain, Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy) is the stereotypical shy-quiet girl/weirdo/outsider, and John Bender (Judd Nelson) is the stereotypical rebel. As an aside, when I was in high school, I fell into three of the five categories here: nerd/brain, shy-quiet guy/weirdo/outsider, and rebel - in that order.As I said before, they all have their reasons for being there, and on another day in another world they would have absolutely nothing to do with each other. But this is not the normal world. This is writer-director John Hughes's teen world, and in his teen world, anything goes. Of course these kids don't like each other; Hughes makes sure of that, but as the day goes on, barriers are broken, alliances are made, and each of these kids discovers that they have more in common with each other than they think - of course after having gone through a lot of pain to get there. They have sincere heart-to-hearts with each other that are not like anything seen in another film of this genre. Spliced in with the drama, Hughes's flawless screen-writing does give these kids some time to have some fun and stave off the boredom and mess with Vernon, with well-placed scenes of comedy, even slapstick comedy, that get as much laughs from the comedy as the tears we shed from the heart-string drama.""The Breakfast Club"" is a first-rate teen comedy/drama with some first-rate performances from some of the top ""Brat Packers"" from the time. Estevez, Ringwald, Hall, Sheedy, and Nelson are a brave, once-in-a-lifetime cast that do their characters plenty of justice. These kids may be stereotypes, but they're three-dimensional stereotypes, and real people with real feelings and real troubles. (These former Brat Packers, now fully-grown adults, would reunite 20 years later at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards to receive a special honor.)John Hughes never quite repeated the success of ""The Breakfast Club,"" and his career began to decline toward the '80s and into the '90s. But ""The Breakfast Club"" is unquestionably Hughes's masterstroke of teen comedy/drama. He was able to give teenagers a three-dimensional gloss and show us that these teens are indeed real people with real feelings and real troubles.Saturday morning detention was never this fun.10/10",The Breakfast Club

71,drqshadow-reviews,Empathic and Honest; a Classic Teen Discovery Piece,9,12 July 2016,"The most timeless film of the Hughes / Ringwald / Brat Pack era, and clearly the most serious, personal work of the director's career. The Breakfast Club is an up-close, introspective look at five essentially disparate souls who share one cramped Saturday together in detention and, along the way, discover there's much more to their peers than what they wear and who they hang with. Reminiscent of theater, much like the closed-room classic 12 Angry Men, this isn't a flashy picture but it really doesn't need to be. This film rides entirely on the strength of its authentic, revealing dialog and the astonishingly mature, resounding performances of its cast, who contribute many of the sharpest, most memorable lines via ad-lib. It's about trust (or lack thereof), pushing others' buttons, being honest with oneself, testing new boundaries and revealing a shared, deep-seated uneasiness about the perilous approach of adulthood and its inherent responsibilities. Emotions run high at this age, and they respect no class distinctions. The cast may be extremely small, but it delivers across the board; Judd Nelson's damaged loner, Ally Sheedy's bashful antisocial, Anthony Michael Hall's over-stressed bookworm, Emilio Estevez's high-strung jock, Molly Ringwald's pretentious priss. Each role a potential career-maker, and not a missed note in the bunch. It's an existential essential, a notice to uncertain adolescents that somebody understands, and a reminder to their grown-up counterparts that they, too, were once just as troubled.",The Breakfast Club

74,jimbo-53-186511,"It's OK, but John Hughes has done much better",5,25 June 2013,"I'll start off by saying that I'm a big John Hughes fan and I've loved several of his other films he's brought out. Unfortunately, Breakfast Club (in my opinion) definitely stacks up as one of his weaker films. As I'm a generally positive person, I'll start off with the parts of Breakfast Club that I enjoyed;Firstly, the bicker and humour between John Bender (Judd Nelson) and Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) was pretty funny and whilst these were sporadic moments throughout the film, they did help to raise the film from being a tedious mess to an average watchable film. The way that Bender constantly winds the teacher up and him getting really angry with the students did provide some 'comedic' relief. There was also the 'eventual' character development about 25 minutes from the end. This 15 minute scene where the characters (Andrew Clark - Emilio Estevez, John Bender - Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald - Claire Standish, Ally Sheedy, Alison Reynolds and Anthony Michael Hall as Brian Johnson are all discussing why they are in detention, and their relevant faults was probably one of the best scenes in the film as we learn more about the characters and we get to see what makes them tick.There were however a few problems with Breakfast Club, for a start there is the total implausible scenario with the detention. OK, so 5 students are given detention 4 reasons that are unknown (apart from 3 out of 5 students) and the other 2 students reasons 4 detention seem 2 have been ignored. Secondly, they spend a day in detention with one of the most idiotic teachers that have ever existed. First of all, the teacher who is supposed to be supervising the students is one of the most idiotic men that has ever lived. He doesn't realise that one of his students has clearly tampered with his door meaning that it won't stay open, when he locks one of the students in a cupboard, then the student tries to escape and crashes through the ceiling, he doesn't know who it is, but comes running out to the students and asks them what happened to which they say they don't know ( obviously so that they can cover up for the character of Bender). Why they would cover for someone who is as big an asshole as 'Bender' I will never know.The final thing that bugged me about Breakfast Club is the unrealistic romance between Bender and Claire ( he was horrible to her throughout the film, but then when she discovers that he is a little insecure she decides to be his 'girlfriend'. This seemed totally implausible to me, friends 'yes' but boyfriend and girlfriend was just too ridiculous to me. On the other hand, Alison and Andy's romance was much more believable and made the film slightly more plausible.All in all, Breakfast Club is a reasonable film which does get the message across that no matter what your background is, that you can find a bond with anyone. Also the character development in the last 15-20 minutes was excellent and certainly in my mind raised the film from awful to average. This film is worth watching once, but it is certainly not one of John Hughes better works, my recommendation would be to watch Ferris Bueller's Day off, Planes, Trains and Automobiles or either of the first 2 Home Alone films which were all better than this film.",The Breakfast Club
75,yusufpiskin,Just a classic - the birth of the teen/school genre,8,9 March 2020,"I always feel a little apprehensive going into older movies that are so universally loved like the very, very popular The Breakfast Club. Films of this type instill in me all manner of preconceived notions because they are so engrained in the pop culture consciousness and as a result, though I have not seen them, I feel as though I already have. Even though this movie was before my time, I felt optimistic that I would most likely enjoy it to some degree but would also somehow be unable to fully embrace it without the luxury of the added nostalgic good will that often comes from seeing these things in one's youth. It turns out that The Breakfast Club was able to transcend all of this baggage I brought with me and prove to be the real deal. I loved this film.The dork, the jock, the rebel, the beauty queen and the eccentric artist are all forced to coexist in the same situation together, a High School weekend detention. Though these five individuals would never interact in their day to day routines, here they are forced to learn about and understand each other for the common purpose of making the best of their oppressive situation and their mutual hate of the hypocritical and authoritative Vice Principal who rules the day with an iron fist. Initially they show hostility to each other, still programed to focus on their differences, even the ways they eat lunch are vastly different, but through some well-written conversations and the more they explore each other's personal lives, the closer they come to realization that they are all the same. All of this sounds extremely cliché and it's a story we have seen in many different manifestations over the years yet somehow, miraculously, everything that transpires in The Breakfast Club feels completely believable, honest and most importantly, original. It is a common phenomenon, usually seen in war situations or prison, where different walks of life are able to work together to ameliorate the time spent together. Friendships are formed hard and fast because there is really no alternative. John Hughes brilliantly applies this concept to an environment that we can all be familiar with. All of the cliques and characters' social images become irrelevant when removed from the harsh gazes of their judgmental and petty peer base. The entire cast is magnificent and I even liked the mysterious and omniscient janitor character that really has no basis for being there other than just an added bonus to appreciate.The film ends with new relationships formed and the five come out the other side as their own new clique. One of the things I like best about The Breakfast Club in retrospect is that there was never a sequel. That would have ruined the ending. We the audience are left with the choice to wonder that, when Monday rolls around, will these 5 be walking into school together proudly hand in hand, or will they snap right back into the preassigned social niches to avoid all of the explaining that would surely need to follow. That's going to tell you about your own outlook on life how you choose to imagine it. I don't feel that this experience is going to seep into their Monday-Friday school days but I like to think that when Bender is sitting in his next two months of detention by himself, he can look forward to some visitors stopping by to keep him company, if only through a window. Or maybe Bender has always been there and always will be, a sort of grungy spirit guide, waiting to shepard each new group that filters through.",The Breakfast Club

Ally Sheedy is also great, as she plays Allison - I already knew of her from 'Short Circuit' and 'WarGames', she's done some solid stuff. Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez and Anthony Michael Hall all add heart and meaning with their characters.Other than the on-screen talent, it isn't really that great a production in all honesty. The message is brilliant and it deserves the plaudits it gets, but take away Nelson, Sheedy & Co. and it's a much, much weaker film.",The Breakfast Club
77,hu675,One of the best and memorable coming of ages films of the 1980's.,9,17 November 2007,"Five students are in detention on a Saturday for different reasons:Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), who's a football jock. Brain Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), who's grade A nerd. John Bender (Judd Nelson), who's a metal head and a trouble maker. Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), who's a popular student. Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy), who's a oddball. This detention for this unusual day on the weekend, which the Principal Richard Vernon (The late Paul Gleason) wants the students to write an essay to explain themselves why they are here and write a little about themselves. These five students hangs out each of them with a different crowd and they barely know each other expect probably seeing each other in the hall, every once in a while. Since they are there from 7am to 5pm to write this essay. These teenagers hate each other guts at first but they started to talk to each other. They become loose and they talk about their personal feelings about home, life, friendship and why they are there on detention on a Saturday.Written and Directed by John Hughes (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, She's Having a Baby, Uncle Buck) made an strong dramatic comedy that is also coming of age film. Hughes is certainly clever with his dialogue and his character that could be heavy at times. But his characters are fascinating, funny, sad, truthful and real. The latest DVD from Universal is great. DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an fine DTS 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in Dolby Digital 5.1). DVD has an documentary with interviews with the cast, the crew and fans of the feature. DVD also includes an lively audio commentary by fan of the film Jason Hillhouse and actors:Nelson & Hall. This film was an box office success, it was well received by the critics, the audiences loved it (especially preteen and teenagers) and it has an fairly good soundtrack as well. This movie went on over the years to be a classic picture of the 1980's and it's still pretty up there to being a coming of age film. This is certainly one of Hughes best films (also ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"" is other instant comedy classic from the director). This is the movie not to be missed.

Five kids are in detention for the length of a movie. The first two acts do a good job of establishing their characters and giving you a look into their motivations.

It is undoubtedly the greatest waste of great music since The Graduate. Like the Graduate, it has non believable characters who aren't interesting and a lame expository plot line. Two things make this movie remarkably bad. First, it takes what should have been a good idea, showing the ideas of a group of characters, and instead using a whole movie to turn them into ridiculous stereotypes. It becomes evident early on, however, that this is told from the point of view of the one character who is too tough for that (if you ever notice, when someone recounts an event, the one constant is that the narrator is always tough and decisive), which brings us to the second major flaw. The character who tells the story is a whiny brat with an unbelievable superiority complex which most teenagers certainly can't relate to, who gets everything his own way or else, and does nothing but belittle and mock everyone else. Probably the worst script ever.",The Breakfast Club
80,gcd70,"Very enjoyable, observant teen flick",6,17 December 2007,"For all the critical flack John Hughes has received for his many teen films which have raked in the dollars, he showed us in ""The Breakfast Club"" that he has a certain understanding of modern day youth.Writer-director Hughes gives us an incisive look at five young students who spend a Saturday detention together in their school library. Complete strangers when the day begins, they gradually open up and form an unlikely but strong bond by the day's end.Hughes' well written and passionate characters are convincingly given voice by the impressive young cast. Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald and Emilio Estevez are particularly sharp, while Ally Sheedy and Anthony Michael Hall both lend decent support.The main message of the film, to take our youth more seriously and give them an even break, is well handled by Hughes as each very different teenager is portrayed as a real human being with feelings and attitudes relative to their own situations. Hughes covers each topic of adolescence well, and with due seriousness, while still keeping the humour rolling and maintaining the very strong 'teen' feel about the whole thing.Unfortunately the love tie-ins and romantic ending are a little too soft and probably unnecessary too, but that and Paul Gleeson's 'teacher with an attitude' character are the only disappointments in a very enjoyable, semi-cult teen film.Backed up by a great rock soundtrack penned for the movie by Keith Forsey.Monday, January 17, 1994 - T.V.",The Breakfast Club
81,dworldeater,"Classic, John Hughes best",9,5 December 2016,"I think John Hughes was great, he made some classic comedies and was undisputed champ of the 80's teen comedy. While I enjoy movies like Weird Science and 16 Candles and think they are funny, The Breakfast Club is by far the best of the lot and holds up the best. To be fair, The Breakfast Club is not strictly a comedy and has a lot of depth and is truly a brilliant, brilliant movie. I grew up in the 80's and I felt John Hughes portrayal of social classes in high school during this period were fairly accurate and throughout the course of the film he deconstructs the stereotypes that were prevalent during this time period. The Brat Pack ensemble cast here is excellent and speaks to a generation of kids and represents them fairly accurately. I spent a lot of time in detention and in school suspension myself, so I identify most with the Judd Nelson character John Bender. I also identify heavily with Ally Sheedy's character as well and dated a girl a lot like her in high school. I could not relate much to Emilio or Molly Ringwald's characters, but they were very well performed and real. The film is very intelligent, well made, funny and the performances are very organic and very good.

I saw it for the second time last week and I was surprised how well it held up - probably because the actors are so good at portraying actual human beings, unlike most 'teen' comedies.  I liked the dramatic sections better - Ally Sheedy and Emilio Estevez share a very heartfelt scene that is very well done.  The end of the movie drags it down slightly, as the movie stretches the credibility of the relationships that have developed.  But it is still a very good movie.",The Breakfast Club
83,Jonny_Numb,The Way We Were,8,22 October 2007,"There are certain works of literature, cinema, and even television that have to be viewed at a certain crucial point to truly engage on the level they were intended. My first viewing of ""The Breakfast Club"" came when I was a high-school senior (at the insistence of my then-girlfriend), and while I didn't see the film as an accurate reflection of any experiences I had had, I certainly liked it. I viewed the film several months later as part of a psychology class I was taking. And now, with high school 8 years in the past, ""The Breakfast Club"" plays better than ever. While this quintessential John Hughes snapshot of '80s teens can veer into corny, outdated lingo and other dubious asides (the 'whistling' interlude), the overall effect is no less potent or genuinely intended. The premise is simple: 5 seemingly disparate teens, identifiable by one distinguishing trait (Athlete, Criminal, Princess, Brain, Basket Case), are stuck in an 8-hour Saturday detention session, during which they reveal themselves as uniquely layered individuals. The performances are the stuff of legend--each actor brings a vulnerable edge to their deceptively cliché titles (and, of course, part of the film's charm is seeing which characters we can most closely relate to). Hughes is as good at staging goofy comic moments (such as a hallway chase set to synthesizer percussion) as he is at the more quietly emotional and raw scenes. The adult characters (represented primarily by Paul Gleason's bitter principal) are somewhat problematic, coming across as short-fused boogeymen...yet still, this seems to be part of Hughes' (mostly accurate) teenage perception, where the notion of 'adult' remains an elusive, mysterious concept. ""The Breakfast Club"" is a mix of comedy, drama, and nostalgia that is by turns hilarious, affecting, and wrought with the kind of naive complexity that makes youth at once joyful and painful.",The Breakfast Club

I'd go so far as to call Breakfast Club a classic, it's heartwarming, funny, and completely original. The movie differs from teen comedies (that are just as good)in one major way, it manages to be witty, create unforgettable characters while still getting a message across, somehow through all this completely avoiding falling into cheeziness.There will always be those teen classics that stand proud as being truly just GOOD movies-and Breakfast Club is about as good as it gets.",The Breakfast Club

Then again, it was release at my birth year. All the teen movies where we see all those social classes like the jocks, the nerds, the goths, the band-mates and the popular girls, all get first exposed in this movie. But maybe the audience nowadays will find many of the words and idioms used rather strange. Saying sporto instead of jock and saying dweeb instead of nerd sounds very far off even though the audience will catch the meaning quickly via the context. The movie also has real nice and natural flow portraying high school teens where they can be shouting in conflict in one time and be in discussion in a civil way the next few minutes later. The acting overall is kind of a mixed point. Emilio Estevez did well in portraying the cool and determined character while Judd Nelson did well in grabbing all the attention for his character.

Fitting seamlessly into certain stereotypes the five misfits consist of meek geek Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), the jock-type wrestler Andrew (Emilio Estevez), the rebellious nihilist Bender (Judd Nelson), the popular in-girl Claire (Molly Ringwald) and the reclusive loner Allison (Ally Sheedy). Captivated by their societal roles the separate individuals initially feed off everyday school structures copying the relations and attitudes carried around classrooms. However through conflict and subsequent revelations the group starts taking on a different dynamic, revealing that the roles attached to each person does not exclude mutual understanding.Arguably John Hughes most artistically accomplished film, ""The Breakfast Club"" ventures through well-tread territory to bring a still omnipresent feeling of purpose. Although the frisky dialogues don't achieve boundless heights, they carry enough wit and substance to make for a cognitive piece, still however troubled by oversimplification. What however comes off worst in the movie is the forced humour, which blends sourly with the more cerebral plotting and interaction of characters. So hopelessly out of sync the impact is severely deflated leaving several confrontational scenes still relevant, while the rest fails to be as brisk and influential, as back when the movie was first released.",The Breakfast Club
90,eric262003,"Relatable Characters Who Not Only Discovers Themselves, But the People Around Them",7,10 October 2020,"When it comes to those classic teen dramas from the 1980's, ""The Breakfast Club"" is way beyond a typical nostalgia trip. It's a journey where young teens who have nothing in common, are under authoritarian rulings for the misdemeanours they committed are at first there to serve their time. But as the day progresses, they have not only eventually fulfilled their journey of self-discovery, they have learned to understand each other and see that they are all in the same, facing similar angst, parental troubles and getting by in the tough days of high school life. Even though a lot of things in this movie are dated, the message carried out will have a lasting impact that has aged well through time.Set on a bright Saturday morning at fictional Shermer High School, five troubled teens who have broke school rules have to report to the library for a fun weekend of detention where they must stay from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. and write a 1000 word piece of who they think they are. The quintet are students who are from different walks of life each carrying their own personal burdens with them, like most high schoolers. We have the arrogant delinquent John Bender (Judd Nelson), the eccentric loner Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy), the stressed out athlete Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), the awkward academic, Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), and the rich prima donna Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald). While stuffed in an isolated library surrounded by books and newspapers, these bored teens who want nothing to do with one another eventually start to open up with one another, each discussing the reasons why they're here and slowly they begin to understand one another and begin to reevaluate their own personal demons. In many ways, 'The Breakfast Club"" can pan out similarly to the works of great playwrights like William Saroyan and Eugene O'Neill, but instead of drowning their sorrows in a bar getting inebriated, they're lamenting through boredom and juice boxes.At first, they all each have a disdain for one another and would never think twice of hanging out together and when this is all done, they will forget about each other and move forward with their lives. Right? Wrong! In normal scenarios that would ring true, but through time and a break from the monotony, we find the obnoxious Bender verbally chastise Claire and then it evolves into each one opening up to one another.Though they're exchanges with one another might result in some interesting anecdotes, the reality shouldn't come as a shocker as it comes naturally that we as humans are social and it would be a matter of times before someone breaks their silence. The revelations of the characters are familiar troupes we've heard before and because we all experienced these people in our lifetime as we walked the halls this is not at all surprising. It's revealed that Andrew's father demands perfection from him which is why he taped a smart kids butt cheeks together. We discover Claire is facing troubles living up to her friend's standards and that her parents use her as a shield to conceal their marital problems. It's confirmed that Bender is from an abused family where his father physically and verbally torments him and his mother tags along with the torment, therefore detention is like a vacation to him. Brian reveals that because he's failing shop class and because his parents won't accept failure, he decided to contemplate suicide so he brought a flare gun to school to show he's not bluffing. As for Allison, I'm sure there's a reason why she's there, but it was never revealed though she claims she's just taking detention because she has nothing better to do. But we know she's a compulsive liar. But what I'm getting at is these situations don't need to be overtly climactic. Because these are all relatable characters and it's a great service that they all want to know each other and are willing to hear what the other has to say.Under the direction and penmanship of John Hughes, who in this stage was directing a few teen dramas at the time like ""Sixteen Candles"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", and ""Pretty in Pink"" featured an elite group that was collectively known at the time as The Brat Pack meaning that the movies that were made at the time had them crossing paths now and then. One of the things that make these teen dramas stand out at the time was that their portrayals were handled in an honest way. Not like others who are saturated with sex-craved nymphos or those out of touch nostalgia flicks pining for the days of old.""The Breakfast Club"" brags a Brat Pack ensemble with a cast who did and would often collaborate with each others in the years ahead. Ringwald and Hall starred in ""Sixteen Candles"" while Estevez, Sheedy and Nelson would see each other again in ""St. Elmo's Fire"" in which they play college graduates instead. Judd Nelson as Bender really shines here with the aggression that's ignited in him, he was the first to break silence and really gets the movie jumping and turning this boring detention session into something more exciting, even going far to sneak into his locker and joining the gang for some pot and a dance montage.If there is any weakness in this story is that though the teenagers are very well developed, I wish I would've said the same about the adults. They're either one-dimensional or both. The principal Mr. Vernon (Paul Gleason) is nothing more than a world-weary, child-hating educator who's position in life is rubbing off on him. Meanwhile the custodial employee Carl (John Kapelos) is on for a few brief scenes just to rub some unnecessary philosophical diatribe just to prove he's more than just a guy who makes a living cleaning up after students and staff. Like they'd listen to a toilet scrubber and a mop pusher.Granted this movie deserves an unfair ""R"" rating probably because of the overused naughty words coming out of the mouths of these teenagers. But though tamer than today's fare I would've thought PG-13 would have been a more sufficient rating. Great movie for more conscious minded teenagers who are willing to not judge a student for what they are but for who they are and to reach out and embrace friendship acceptance with no boarders or limitations.",The Breakfast Club
91,Sandcooler,"A classic, but maybe not a particularly great one",8,21 September 2010,"The one thing I truly respect about this movie is that it's never boring, despite the fact that's it's pretty much all set in one room and with the same five characters over and over and over again. There aren't really any events to speak of, these guys just talk to each other for the entire movie and somehow it stays interesting. Not that any of the characters is even all that compelling, I think this movie is mainly saved by the acting and the fact that it's so delightfully 80s. I mean, just check out the cast: they've got Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald AND Anthony Michael Hall. John Hughes did not like half work. Also the music our standard cool guy (Judd Nelson) listens to is the kind of stuff that anyone who's not in 1985 would instantly laugh at. ""The Breakfast Club"" is truly a product of its time but then again, what the hell is wrong with that? Apart from the stilted ending, this movie is simply very entertaining.",The Breakfast Club
92,Matt_Layden,Ultimate Teenager Flick?,8,5 June 2010,"A group of kids are sent to detention on a Saturday for various reasons. They are all different, from the nerd, the jock, the rebel, the princess and the weirdo. These kids manage to find out things about each other and themselves while serving detention. Even though I was born in 1987, two years after the film was released, I can relate to it. That's what makes The Breakfast Club so damn good, kids generations later can still relate to the characters and their problems. John Hughes is the one person in the film industry who got what teenagers desired, were scared of and felt. The man was/is a legend and the 80's belonged to him. The Breakfast Club is one of my favourites from him. Planes, Trains and Automobiles still takes the top spot, but The Breakfast Club has more of an emotional connection to the viewer. The cast, also known as the Brat Pack, do a wonderful job filling in their high school clichéd roles. Emilio Estevez , the mighty duck man I swear to god, plays the jock. He has an intense and emotional scene that felt like an anthem for millions of teens going through the same problems. The same goes for the other characters, all have problems in their lives that every other teenager can relate to. Whether it's Judd Nelson and his abusive father or Michael Anthony Hall and the pressure to do well in school. Paul Gleason is wonderfully evil as the principal who seems to have a hate for these kids. His speeches are great to listen to and he nails the role. His performance is my favourite the in the film. Look out for that John Hughes cameo at the end as the kids are picked up from detention. That's a little something extra for you folks at home that dig that kind of stuff.The music rocks, the theme is still played today and is immediately associated with the film. There are many memorable scenes, too many to mention and the overall feel of the film has numerous re-watch capabilities. When people think of John Hughes, the one film I think that they will immediately go to is The Breakfast Club. Not only was it the film the teenagers of the 80's could relate to, but it's a film that will live on and touch the hearts of many others. It's funny, depressing and emotionally challenges you. It doesn't treat you like an idiot, Hughes knew his audience and treated the kids with the intelligence he knew they had.",The Breakfast Club

The Breakfast Club deals pretty well with teen issues even if sort of cookie-cutterish. It too has great music in its own right to push it into the high excellence class. It stands out as a page in time moving farther and farther away. Sure its not really close to some of the great films in cinema, and with that comment growing up with this movie puts these opinions as biased. Still all the cast are memorable if a little shy in general. John Hughes has in this one of his best movies. It's quick and heartfelt with believable character growth.

They have absolutely nothing in common, they never talked to each other before and they never would, but somehow they will have to get through eight hours of detention. Of course they hate each other, but before the day is over they find out that they have more in common than they thought.This is a teen movie, but it certainly isn't a typical one. I mean: no teens that get killed, not a lot of screaming... No, this is an intelligent and timeless movie in which every one of us will recognize something from him or herself. It was shot in 1985, but it still hasn't lost its relevance. The different characters are perhaps a little bit stereotypical, but I don't consider that as a bad thing. It helps you to identify the different types of people that can be found in a large community like a school.I really liked this movie and I would recommend it to everybody. Teens can recognize themselves in it and adults know all to well what it was like being a teenager. This is certainly one of the best eighties movies. I give this movie an 8/10.",The Breakfast Club

It has a teen film formula and uses clichés to produce pathos. Enjoyable aspects like a dance sequence is incongruous for where the story had got to, and a single setting meant the performances sometimes came across a little forced.

99,frankde-jong,One of the best teenage movies of the eightes,8,7 November 2020,"John Hughes was specialized in pictures about (and for) adolescents. Not of the rancit type such as for example ""Porky's"" (1981, Bob Clark) but more of the comedy type like ""Sixteen candles"" (1984) and ""Ferris Duellers day off"" (1986).""The breakfast club"" (1985) is a relatively serious film in his oeuvre. It has aged well and gives us a good picture of what it was like to be a teenager in the eighties. Just like ""Rebel without a cause"" (1955, Nicholas Ray) gives us a good picture of what it was like to be a teenager in the fifties.I deliberately compare ""The breakfast club"" with such an all time classic, because I am not sure that film is of a lower quality (apart from the fact that it evidently did not have a James Dean in its cast).The film uses an old trick of mostly crime or horror movies. Put some people in a place that they cannot leave. See for example ""Key Largo"" (1948, John Huston) in which a hotel is isolated by a hurricane. In horror or crime the function is evidently that people cannot flee. In ""The breakfast club"", in which a group of five high school students are punished with a saturday detention, the function is that they cannot possibly avoid each other the whole day long.If possible they would gladly do, because they don't know each other and are of a very different type of personality and/or of a very different background. This is accentuated when it is lunchtime and the rich girl (the princess) turns out to have a basket of sushi (in 1985!).Gradually however they get into a coversation and find out to have the same problems and anxieties. Often the problems have something to do with keeping up with the expectations of their parents. The father of one of the boys even calls his son ""his project"".Finally there even is a sort of mutual trust or intimacy between them. The prime merit of the film is that it shows the growing of this mutual trust without the conversation containing any spectacular revelations.",The Breakfast Club

I on the other hand didn't love it like everyone else. I personally think the film is overrated. I'm not saying it's a bad film, but it's certainly not the best teen comedy. It's not really a teen comedy though, it's more like a teen dromedy. Hughes has done some great films like Ferris Bueller. Since he just died recently I've decide to write some reviews on the films he's done. The Breakfast club doesn't fit in the best category. I don't know what the film goes under. Hughes did such great films like Uncle Buck, Planes, trains, and automobiles, and Sixteen Candles. John Hughes changed teen films for us. Really he didn't change it, he invented it. There wouldn't be teen films without John Hughes. Johhn Hughes did fantastic films, but I didn't love The Breakfast Club. i'll admit it was inspiring, but it wasn't his best.

101,bobsgrock,An ageless film that transcends all generations.,9,17 April 2009,"Of all of John Hughes' classic films of the 1980s about teenagers, The Breakfast Club is the most famous, the most sympathetic and the most endearing. It also is the film that has defined a generation of young people who were growing up in a time where they truly didn't feel that they belonged in any one category but now as they are probably in their 30s or 40s I am sure they can look back on their teen years as better than they thought.The setup is well-known: five kids with nothing in common, all from different points on the society scale stuck in detention on a Saturday who come to realize that there is more than just stereotypes in the room with them. The other four are people, people who hurt and have feelings and friends and parents they have problems with as well as a domineering principal they cannot relate to. These common bonds are doors, opening to show them the truth not just about each other but about teenagers in general and the true difficulties they all face.As mentioned before, of all of John Hughes' films, this is the most serious as well as endearing towards its characters. Hughes wisely doesn't talk down to them but puts them all on an equal plane, which forces them to look past the outside caricatures and see the person inside. The acting then brings this out fully, with Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez and Anthony Michael Hall giving perhaps the best performances of their careers all in this one movie. The performance that sticks out most to me, though, is Judd Nelson as the criminal-mind John Bender. He is the most outrageous, so he breaks the ice between them and really starts the ball rolling. He kind of takes a back seat in the narrative in the third part, but still gives the best performance , one that I think is Oscar-worthy and truly captures the anger and frustration someone in his situation would be feeling constantly.There are times when it can be hard to watch as these five break down the walls that separate them, but it is all worth it in the end. Not just a classic teen film but also one of the best of the decade, The Breakfast Club still applies today to teenagers who feel out-of-place or misled in their lives. That is the film's greatest achievement: it is an ageless story that transcends all generations and speaks to each of us no matter who or where.",The Breakfast Club

103,baumer,John Hughes could make a movie in a phone booth.,10,18 June 1999,"If Spielberg was the king of fantasy in the 80's then John Hughes was the quintessential teen movie director.  He usually writes his own material and that combination of writing and directing has kept us entertained for the better part of 20 years.  He hears things that most other people can't and he conveys his message with the clarity of a bell ringing.  Breakfast Club is one of those movies.With an all star young cast, they lend instant credibility to the characters that they play.  My fave character because of his honesty is Bender.  He is the only character that seems to have a beef with everyone and when he picks on the person, he holds nothing back.  This movie is one of the best teen flicks to come out in the eighties.  Along with Fast Times, Sixteen Candles, The Sure Thing, Weird Science, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Say Anything, this movie gives an honest look at what it was like growing up and attending high school in the eighties.  This is a must see.",The Breakfast Club

105,jaredmobarak,You'll get the horns  The Breakfast Club,9,3 April 2009,"It may not be the funniest film that John Hughes crafted, but The Breakfast Club is the one that I think made the biggest impression on me. Revisiting it—so many years after its creation, as well as many since I last sat down to watch its entirety—gave me an interesting experience. How the three friends with me had never seen it is beyond me, but that fact caused something I never expected. Each moment of weight, those moments when the kids explain the pressures of each high school ""social class"" and why they are spending their Saturday in detention, still hit me as they did when I first watched it. However, my friends just laughed straight through, seeing the cheesiness and the way Andrew's ""buns-taping"" incident played out in a homosexual-like nature, amongst other reasons. As a result, I began to wonder if the film only holds up to me because I had seen it when I was younger; it holds a place in my memory and heart. Maybe watching it for the first time today just can never have the same impact; it's time capsule sensibilities just too much for the contemporary young adult to relate to. Either way, I could never discount its poignancy or subtle humor and I'm sure it will still be my favorite Hughes film when I'm fifty.John Hughes is an enigma. The decade from 1980-1990 was as good as you can have in Hollywood for him. With films like Uncle Buck, Planes, Trains and Automobiles, and Vacation, this guy was the end all be all for comedy. After Home Alone, though, his golden touch disappeared and he's never been able to rekindle that magic. It's gotten so bad that he's resorted to a penname, giving his writing credit for Drillbit Taylor to a fictional Edmond Dantes, (Dumas is rolling in his grave with that one). But those early films are classics. I completely understand my friends' experience of The Breakfast Club, I could see those homoerotic connections and the idiocy of some lines and events, but I couldn't bring myself to laugh at them. If they weren't there, I might not have noticed at all, that is how high an affinity I have of the movie. Until someone points out the shortcomings, (if they even are, I mean this is almost 25 years old), I see it only as how it is.What really wowed me upon watching again was how effective this film is with just dialogue. Besides a couple journeys outside in the halls or Dick Vernon's escapades, the entire film takes place in the library, much of which includes the five stars sitting on the floor. When Estevez tells his story, it is made even more impressive by the fact that it was a single take. The camera moves horizontally as he speaks, allowing those in the foreground and desk legs to obstruct your view until the pan moves further. Yet he continues his monologue, voice breaking and tears streaking  it really is a powerful scene. Every kid that goes to high school experiences the trauma and drama and messed up social structures created, every kid can see a little bit of themselves in one, if not all, of the group. Call them clichés, call them stereotypes—these five kids are you and I.I think we should also acknowledge the accomplishment of Hughes with this film, more than others, and what it has done to Hollywood. Many of his successes came with buddy comedies or family oriented vacations, all of which had multiple environments and bigger budgets. However, The Breakfast Club was so much more with so much less. Without this film becoming a hit based on dialogue and character interaction, we may never have seen the likes of Kevin Smith's Clerks, (a self-proclaimed fan who references Hughes often in his films), or the independent insurgence that was a result. This was one of the films that showed people a smartly told story that is relevant to its audience could be better than one in the moneymaking system. You could have young upstarts like the ""Brat Pack"" raking in the money. Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, and Molly Ringwald got their start here along with other 80s fare. You could argue that Judd Nelson's peak was as John Bender, that scared criminally inclined kid acting out on the weak and naïve to have some semblance of power and worth, something all but absent in his home life. And my favorite, Ally Sheedy, shows that being an individual—being yourself—is all that matters. Everyone here caters to their friends and their clique except for her. She transcends it all and becomes an island to herself. By far the shining light of the film in what she represents, I am still almost hurt that she lets Ringwald ""doll"" her up at the end. She is so much cuter when disheveled.I can't not mention Paul Gleason's stellar schoolteacher, who has seen the kids get cockier and himself more serious, or John Kapelos' Carl, the ""Man of the Year"" turned janitor. They just go to show how well fleshed out every character is here. Sure they all embody those aspects we single out, distilled into one host for the purposes of showing us a projection of high school, but I don't care. There is just something about The Breakfast Club that can never be changed in my eyes, no matter how much I understand new viewers' trepidations on its quality. A nostalgia pick for sure, I'll still recommend it to everyone I meet. If they can't get past the datedness, it's their loss.",The Breakfast Club
106,mattymatt4ever,"A flawed, but often entertaining and insightful film",7,9 January 2003,"OK, so I've said it many times, I'm tired of high school movies sticking with the stereotypical characters of the jock, the geek and so on and so on. That's why I appreciate a movie like ""Ghost World,"" which breaks free from the stereotypes, concentrating on two social outcasts and portrays them as INTELLIGENT people who don't say ""like"" and ""you know"" in every sentence. But the characters of ""The Breakfast Club,"" though forming from those stereotypes, aren't one-dimensional.  Eventually, we all arrive at the truths of why the characters are the way they are.    Some of the efforts are heavy-handed (I doubt Judd Nelson's character would get so ticked off at someone's alleged insult that he climbs onto the spiral staircase like a monkey and curls up in a ball), but few films even attempt at getting to those truths.  Each character is flawed in their own ways. Even the super-smart nice guy, played by Anthony Michael Hall, says a few things that shouldn't be said.  Even the tough-as-nails, by-the-book teacher, played beautifully by Paul Gleason, has a few screws loose.  At first I felt total sympathy for his character, but then I realized how condescending he was towards each of them and I said to myself, ""Hey, two wrongs don't make a right.""  He'd bark at every one of the students, using a condescending nickname.  There are teachers out there who feel their kids are so unruly that they have access to torcher them however they please.  If I were in his position, I'd probably twist Judd Nelson's head off, but then again...I'm not planning on being a teacher.  If you don't have patience for kids like that, you should consider a career change.Nelson's character is disrespectful to everyone, but how is he supposed to be respectful to others, but when he himself was never given any respect?  I was still very annoyed by his callous remarks, but to criticize someone's unruly behavior, you must first realize where that behavior stemmed from. The character who I didn't quite understand was Ally Sheedy's.  I think hers was written with a little too heavy of a hand.  How can she go from not saying a word (and I mean that literally) to being brave enough to look Molly Ringwald in the eye and ask if she's a virgin (as well bringing up many other provocative questions)?  If you look at the transition from her in the beginning of the movie to her at the end, you think to yourself, ""How did this happen?""  What brought upon this change in character?  She's walking down the hallway with Emilio Estevez to get some sodas, he asks her, ""What's your poison?"" and she just spontaneously blurts out, ""Vodka,"" and explains how much she loves to drink?  I was the quiet person in high school and I never went through a drastic change like that through the course of a day, though I certainly dreamed to.     ""The Breakfast Club"" has some dull moments and some that are downright silly, but altogether it's a funny and moving film.  It may not be the deepest high school movie ever made, but it's certainly deeper than recent fluff flicks like ""She's All That"" and ""Never Been Kissed.""  It's definitely worth a look.  Plus, you gotta love that theme song...""Don't you...forget about me.""My score:  7 (out of 10)",The Breakfast Club
107,hnt_dnl,One of my favorite 80s movies,10,9 March 2008,"The way I judge the true quality and greatness of a movie is if I still find it as or more enjoyable today as I did when I first saw it. The Breakfast Club falls into that category. There's a reason that Entertainment Weekly listed this as the NUMBER ONE teenage movie of all time. I just saw this movie again a week ago, and was just as into it as I was in 1985. While it obviously has the dated 80s look in some of the characters (that's the way they looked back then; they can't help it) and music, the core theme of the film still resonates today.It's about a group of disjointed, confused, and outcast youths who, in one way or another, are trapped by the circumstances of their schoolhouse cliques, family lives, and by themselves. But on one Saturday morning and afternoon while they are all in detention, all of their fears, secrets, and inner demons are revealed to each other, sometimes on purpose, sometimes not. Andy, John, Claire, Brian, and Allison all come reluctantly together and find they are not as different as they all thought on this Saturday, which represents a turning point in all their lives.The cast is perfection. Five actors who were members of 'The Brat Pack' star in this movie: Emilio Estevez (Andy), Judd Nelson (John), Molly Ringwald (Claire), Anthony Michael Hall (Brian), and Ally Sheedy (Allison). Their various interactions are completely realistic, powerful, and poignant. And the two couples that pair off near the end are perfectly chosen. Of course there has to be an odd man out (and we all know who that is). What's amazing is that although some of these actors had worked together before and they were all friends in real life, they completely pull it off that their characters are essentially complete strangers (except for Andy and Claire, who travel in some of the same popular circles). All the performances still hold up today. That's a big reason the movie is still very good.Additionally, Paul Gleason (as Principal Vernon), who has to oversee the 5 misfits' detention and John Kapelos (as Carl the Janitor) are perfectly cast. The scene where Nelson's rebellious John Bender and Gleason's authoritarian Vernon go back and forth may be the best scene in the movie. And Carl the Janitor's 'big' scene where he speechifies about knowing all their secrets is hilarious.Make no mistake, even though this is easily classified as a 'teen' movie, there are some real powerful moments in it: the Bender-Vernon face-off, Andy's speech about what he did to get in detention and how remorseful he was about it (the long, tracking shot of just seeing Andy and no one else for a while added power to this moment), and Brian's all-too-real admission of why he got sent to detention (a real scary moment, this one hit me the hardest b/c I can relate to how he felt).All in all, an extremely well done film that still holds up amazingly well today.",The Breakfast Club
108,classicalsteve,The Must-See Film for 80's Youth Is More a Character Study than a Story: Good But Not Great,7,3 March 2015,"If there was ever a Hollywood-backed film personifying the anxiety of Generation X, it was ""The Breakfast Club"". If you were a teen in suburban America in the 1980's (as I was), this was your film, or at least it was supposed to be. The Boomers had ""The Graduate"" and ""Easy Rider"", the Silent Generation had ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""American Graffiti"". We have ""The Breakfast Club"". Or do we? Is it a cinematic masterpiece or overrated? Let's take a second look at this cult classic because as of this writing, the 30th anniversary of its release is coming up in 2015 with theatrical viewings scheduled around the country. Generation X'ers will be lining up to relive their teenage years. While in his 30's, John Hughes had a brief directing career making films targeted to Generation X'ers. Hughes offerings were considered the fresh new voice speaking both to and from the point of view of Generation X, offspring of the sons and daughters of those who were children during and just after World War II, a.k.a the Silent and Baby Boom Generations. Hughes also directed ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""Sixteen Candles"", and ""Pretty in Pink"". Many of Hughes' films used the same talent. These youthful upstarts of our generation were fondly known as ""The Brat Pack"". (Some of the ""brat"" actors transitioned into adult careers while others fell off the radar.) Among Hughes' favorite talent were Molly Ringwold, Anthony Michael Hall, and Ally Sheedy, all present and accounted for in ""Breakfast Club"". By 1991, the Generation X'ers were becoming young adults, graduating from college and beginning careers and families. The voice of 80's teen angst was becoming passé. Hughes directed his last film in 1991, ""Curly Sue"", which paired a Boomer and a Millennial with disastrous results. It ultimately bombed at the box office. So does ""Breakfast Club"" uphold today? Well sort of yes sort of no. There is no plot per se, only a setting. The setting is the high school library where five teenagers are being held in a day-long detention on a Saturday for wrong-doings which are never made completely clear. The real story is about each character and how they get to know one another. The film's strength is also its weakness, depending upon your point of view. Each student comes from a different aspect of the student body of the fictional high school. They are in essence, prototypes, maybe even stereotypes, of each of the different faces of the school. Molly Ringwold is from the ""popular"" and chic crowd of girls who wear makeup and nice clothes. Judd Nelson is the rule-breaker, who we imagine never does his homework and goofs off at the back of the classes he takes if he's not cutting school altogether. Even from the get-go, we predict that this is not Nelson's first time in detention. Emilio Estevez is the jock, probably a football player and wrestler. Ally Sheedy is the loser loner female, who at first grosses out Ringwold. Anthony Michael Hall plays ""the brain"", a kid who gets straight A's, especially in science classes, but who is otherwise not part of the ""popular"" crowd.The idea is that these kids would never have even said hello to one another during a typical school day because they are all worlds apart. However, because they're in detention for various infractions, they are forced to meet and interact with one another. The main crux of the story is how the kids learn about each other and how they both fit and don't fit into their own stereotypes. They also begin engaging in behavior of their opposite counterparts, such as when Estevez smokes and does cart wheels on the upper floor of the library, similar to what Nelson's character usually does. This aspect of the film succeeds in spades. As a character study, it works very well. It could almost be a play.Where the story lags slightly is in its lack of a storyline. When I first saw it, I had high-expectations because it was already becoming the ""must-see"" film for my generation. After viewing, I found I generally enjoyed it, but seeing kids simply talking and having some fun for 90 minutes is not exactly why I want to see a film. Near the end, is the famous ""dance scene"" where the characters let loose and let it all hang out. Hall being the brain is the DJ. Dance scenes like this were very popular with Generation X films of this sort, but now they seem rather dated. I want to see characters deal with and overcome dilemmas, not just talk about themselves and dance around. Of course the subtlety is to see the characters change slightly by interacting with kids they never otherwise would have. While I believe it's a nice beginning of an idea, I don't think it's enough to carry through an entire film.""The Breakfast Club"" may be more important in terms of what it represents, the angst of Generation X, rather than it being a masterpiece of filmmaking and storytelling in its own right. The mark of a great film is when it speaks to later generations. I have seen ""The Graduate"", ""American Graffiti"", and ""Rebel Without a Cause"" many times, and they never seem dated, even though these were targeted to previous generations. Does ""The Breakfast Club"" do this for me? Not quite. It may have spoken more to me during that time, but it says less to me now. Maybe I wanted the cast to rip away the ridiculous sculpture in the middle of the library in the way that Dustin Hoffman steals away the bride at the end of the Graduate. Or for the kids to engage in something together, like the race at the end of American Graffiti. For all its honesty, even by the end of their detention, the Breakfast Clubbers were still in their own prison, the 1980's.",The Breakfast Club
109,Beta_Gallinger,A strangely and uniquely intriguing film from John Hughes,8,19 February 2010,"This is one of several teen movies the late John Hughes wrote and directed in the 1980's. It was released the year before I was born, and I think the first time I saw it was in 2007, after I had first seen ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", another one of Hughes's 80's teen films, but definitely a different idea. From what I remember, I thought ""The Breakfast Club"" was pretty good the first time, but maybe a little puzzling. I watched the 1996 version of ""101 Dalmatians"" this week, with a screenplay written by Hughes, and thought it was very dull. This was the first movie I watched after that one, and I thought it was so much better than that particular 90's film, though it's totally different. In fact, this 1985 drama (with some comedy) isn't like any other film I've ever seen! Five high school students in Shermer, Illinois (a fictional suburb of Chicago) are forced to come to school one Saturday morning in 1984 for detention. Each of these students appears to be of a different high school stereotype. There's Andrew Clark, a ""jock""; Claire Standish, a ""princess""; Brian Johnson, a ""nerd""; Allison Reynolds, a ""basket case""; and John Bender, a ""criminal"". Their principal, Mr. Richard Vernon, assigns each of them to write an essay during their stay in the school library that day about who they think they are. At first, the five of them don't seem to have anything in common, and are in for a lot of conflict, especially with John Bender's behaviour, giving the others a hard time. With Bender's big mouth and rebellious ways, he gets into even more trouble with the aggravated Mr. Vernon during his Saturday detention. However, as the hours of the day go by, the five students gradually get to know each other, and it turns out there's more to them than their stereotypes after all.It's probably not too often you see a movie that doesn't go any farther from one location to another than this one. ""The Breakfast Club"" is almost entirely set in one building, and all the scenes that don't take place in this building take place just outside it. One might assume that this must be very boring, but it's not. During my second viewing, I wasn't sure exactly what was keeping me intrigued around the beginning, but the main element of the film is probably the dialogue. The conversations, no matter how long they may get, are constantly gripping! It's really interesting seeing the students fighting (verbally and sometimes physically) but gradually learning more about each other, including their lives at home. The conflict between John Bender and Mr. Vernon is also unforgettable, and the acting and script were very well done, which obviously also helps carry the film. Hughes put some interesting characters into his story, with a strong cast to play them. The movie has a good theme song, ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"", an 80's New Wave hit by Simple Minds.As I write this, I haven't seen every teen movie John Hughes made in the 80's, but have seen ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"". The protagonists in both films are obviously high school students, but the films are different from one another. ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" is an upbeat comedy, whereas this movie does have some mildly amusing humour but is more of a drama. It's also significantly darker than its successor. However, they are both good in their own way, and both deserve their good reputation. This 1985 Hughes film may have some plot holes, and even after two viewings, I'm still not sure if I totally get it, but it's still a movie to hold the viewer's attention, and it seems many have been able to relate to it. Hughes was involved in some lacklustre efforts during his career, and ""101 Dalmatians"" is one of them, but this one is not. For the good films he made, ""The Breakfast Club"" being an example, I'm sure he will be remembered.",The Breakfast Club
110,Stampsfightclub,An excellent dramatic film that dives deep inside the teenage spirit,9,20 August 2008,"In one of John Hughes' most critically acclaimed films, 5 teenagers are in detention on a Saturday and are forced to interact under the watchful eye of Principal Vernon.After seeing Ferris Bueller's day Off and hearing friends discuss this 1985 drama, I was very eager to give it a watch, and was spoilt in one, if not the, best teenage dramas ever made.Estevez, Hall, Nelson, Ringwald and Sheedy are today big stars in Hollywood and it's fair to say that this film pushed them towards that status in a marvellous display of teenage emotions and antics in a great enjoyable and interesting drama.John Hughes has done it again with sharp writing, jokes and a great character driven plot that justifies the ideology of how parents can have bad effects on children.And this ideology of being brought up is very interesting to watch, and is portrayed well by all actors, and how the characters are all effected in different ways by their parents attitudes towards them.Though not designed to be funny, there are a few quirks in the plot that adds a delightful depth to the narrative and keeps the interest alive, and an ideology of what detention is like, and how it can affect your own mood.Though taking a while to get into, once the characters start interacting more does the plot really come together and capture the true essence of what goes on inside a teenage mind.Having an open question to the story will keep you watching to the very end, why is everyone in detention on a Saturday? This technique is well used and the final scenes are very dramatic and are worth hanging on for.The Breakfast Club is a sharply written, intense and intriguing drama that questions the whole concept of how children and teenagers should be raised. Hughes has brought this ideology to a dramatic light to create one of the best teenage dramas ever, not over doing it with unnecessary jokes and focusing on the characters and heir personalities which makes it an essential watch.",The Breakfast Club

113,The_Movie_Cat,"""I don't like what I see, I really don't.""",6,22 February 2001,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS. ONLY READ IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM
This was one of the ultimate ""cool to like"" films in the eighties, a film that had all teens doting on it because, well, it has so much ... meaning... doesn't it? Actually, no. Five students, at least three of them one-dimensional blandies, spend eight hours in detention where they allegedly ""find themselves."" Except only one of them has anything interesting to say.It opens with a written quote from David Bowie, the hallmark of student pretension, which then explodes into shards. Whoo, rock and roll! This is revolutionary filmmaking at its peak. Worst thing about the movie is that it temporarily convinced a significant proportion of society that Simple Minds were actually worth listening to.How old was John Hughes when he wrote this film? Fourteen, and full of angst? Like some awful sixth-form play, The Breakfast Club is filled with clumsily written amateur psychology. Molly Ringwald gets the brunt of it, and all the worst lines. Gems like ""You know why guys like you knock everything? Cos you're afraid"" meet ""I have just as many feelings as you do, and it hurts just as much when someone steps all over them."" Other characters get to say things like ""When you grow up, your heart dies"" and ""If you love someone, it's okay.""Judd Nelson chiefly carries the film as the only interesting character, and the one with the best lines. Saying ""eat my shorts"" four years before The Simpsons, and telling a teacher ""Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?"" he's by far the most appealing element of the movie. However, his describing of being beaten at the hands of his father is marred by loud incidental synth music, the hallmark of the eighties. Thankfully, there are no skinny ties or mullet haircuts, meaning it hasn't otherwise dated too badly in that regard.Some ill-advised comedy moments - The Bridge on the River Kwai parody, Anthony Michael Hall being stoned and Emilio Estivez breaking a glass door by shouting at it - work against the piece, and are quite cringingly embarrassing to watch. The film then takes on issues that the characters in the film seem to think are hugely important, but are really just everyday and banal. The group seem desperate to hold on to the secret that three of them are virgins, or that they don't get along with their parents, but such things are hardly Earth-shattering.Where the film really falls down is in the climax, where the group - who are now suddenly inseparable soul mates - turn into a bunch of bleeding hearts, mewling and wailing over what are really pretty much run of the mill problems. Judd Nelson aside, the rest of this crew has no cause for social dysfunction that isn't above the killingly ordinary. Maybe that's the point, but, like Flatliners, where a group of young students had their sins come to haunt them, the fact that people of that age won't have done anything of real note is called into question. Ringwald is cut up about the fact that her parents are so rich, and she has to agree with all her friends. ""You just don't understand all the pressures they can put on you."" Oh, shame. Sporty Estivez, meanwhile, is a high-school jock who once taped a man's buttocks together because he was trying to impress his dominant father. Okay, not nice, but not exactly the skeleton in the closet you'd wait ninety minutes to hear, right? I'm sure most athletic students do a lot worse things, every day of the week.Anthony Michael Hall, the least of the ""Where Are They Now?"" entrants, as no-one hires nerds for Hollywood films any more, was contemplating suicide because he couldn't make a ceramic elephant. Ally Sheedy, in the most thankless role, acts weird because her parents ignore her and she just wants people to notice her.All of which would be fine, and, indeed, despite the criticisms I've made, The Breakfast Club is nicely directed, acted and imminently watchable. But what cripples the film is its overreaching pretension, particularly the trite closing monologue, which is cliched and squalid. Like the tagline for the movie - ""They met only once, but it changed their lives forever"" - it smacks of corny movie trailer dialogue and is overearnest. Pat resolution has the group coupled off (except for poor Hall), with Estivez clinging on to Sheedy after finding she doesn't look that bad with different makeup. Rather a shallow indictment. Though the weirdest thing is, despite watching this and regarding it as a deeply flawed movie, I still voted it 6/10.",The Breakfast Club
114,gab-14712,Different Backgrounds Being Brought Together!,9,29 May 2020,"When people talk about teen movies, most minds stray to John Hughes's 1985 classic, The Breakfast Club. Like his previous feature Sixteen Candles, Hughes attempts to explore the teenage mind. Just like that film, this film is a relatable teenage character study. Each of the main characters are vastly different in terms of image and personality, but they eventually share a common interest; a seething anger for adults, mainly their Principal Vernon. The film is a little on the talky, philosophical side but John Hughes made every word count with his screenplay and style of direction. Hughes made each one of the characters relatable for the people who have been through high school, even downright likable at times.Believe it or not, Universal was highly skeptical of the film. When shooting began, Sixteen Candles was not released yet, so the studio was still dealing with an unproven director. Hughes was able to calm the film's investors. After all, his feature had a very small budget of a million dollars, and it was shot in one location. Hughes, being the efficient director he is, was able to concurrently shoot this film and his next one, Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Universal definitely made a bang for their buck. I think the film made forty times its budget domestically. Profitable it was! That definitely proves how the younger generation related to its teenage characters. Maybe the adult characters are one-dimensional, but does that really matter?The film's beginning is awesome. As the great 80's anthem from Simple Minds, ""Don't Forget About Me,"" is playing, the teenagers are introduced one at a time. Each of the teenagers are in for a special treat: an eight-hour-long Saturday detention under the supervision of their mean principal, Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason). The five personalities are the jock Andrew (Emilio Estevez), the brain Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), the criminal John (Judd Nelson), the princess and prom queen Claire (Molly Ringwald), and the insecure basket case Allison (Ally Sheedy). These five have nothing in common and do not associate with each other outside of class. Vernon makes each teen write an essay about what do they think of themselves. In the beginning, they may have thought they knew. As the day progresses, maybe they will learn more about themselves...and each other.The performances are all excellent. They deliver Hughes's dialogue in their own unique way. Judd Nelson was the least known cast member, but he was the glue that anchored the characters together. He was fantastic as John Bender. With Sixteen Candles in production, Hughes wanted Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall to appear in this film and they obviously agreed. Their characters here are a bit reminiscent of their characters from the aforementioned film, but Hughes did make subtle differences to give their new characters fresh air. Ally Sheedy as Allison is my favorite character though as she is the most relatable. She hid herself behind her hair and clothes...in a way not unlike myself. The adult characters are one-dimensional, but the actual performances are great. Richard Vernon is not shown in a positive light and Paul Gleason embraced that. John Kapelos plays the school custodian and philosophical dude.This film is heralded as one of the best teenage films of the 1980's and the reason is the relatable characters that John Hughes created, and the actors brought to life. Yeah there is a bunch of talk and philosophy, but its very important to hear what is said. These are five different personas and backgrounds that are brought together. Although there was not a sniff of curiosity in the beginning, they started to grow closer and closer. A universal theme that is very important, especially in today's world. Hughes did a wonderful job bring that theme to the screen. This is a well-acted and well-directed movie. The majority of the soundtrack may be forgettable, but not the Simple Minds theme song. Don't forget about this movie, folks!My Grade: A-",The Breakfast Club
115,Angry_Arguer,Audio in Montage,10,3 July 2003,"John Hughes will never win an Oscar for 'Original Screenplay', not even with ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"".  His films focus on white, middle-class teens of varying stereotypes.  Here, he throws everything into the blender.What surprised me about ""The Breakfast Club"" was the level of silence.  I'm serious, there is almost an equivalent level of quiet as in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  Whereas Kubrick used that silence for a purpose, Hughes must have run out of time in production.  Of course, when music is used in ""Breakfast Club"", it's not Blue Danube Waltz.  The library is too large to create any mood, but, with a movie like this, don't expect an ""ALIEN"" level of quality in production design.  The editor must have been on vacation because the movie could have been 15 minutes shorter and made stronger because of it.  John Hughes' director of photography doesn't catch many memorable images, although Emilio Esteves' monologue is delivered with an obvious pan around reminiscent of ""Reservoir Dogs"".  He will never be a notable character actor, whereas everyone else seems to have a grip on their ideas--except when they're overacting. Question the social issues and problems that are smeared around like bloodstains all you want, I haven't the time for it.Dialogue is the movie's only asset.  Some of the conversations are rather...how should I say...enlightened for a bunch of teenage miscreants. Much of it is Hughes' standard recycled propaganda that he continued repeating, but he's not Kevin Smith.  Had Smith made this movie there would have been many changes, but how effective would they have been?  Indeed, the entire plot is hostage in a prison that never releases any new or inventive ideas.  The adults are the typical Hughes incompetents who 'don't understand' and the kids admit that they hate their parents.  What else is new?  Still, ""The Breakfast Club"" is worth watching for the minority that it appeals to as long as they aren't decayed from the wave of 'Modern Teenage Comedies'.  Just thinking about THOSE makes my head hurt.Overall, 3 out of 5 stars.  Love it or leave it, I still enjoyed it.",The Breakfast Club
116,Ruskington,One of the most overrated films of all time,2,14 April 2020,"It's actually quite difficult to think of a more overrated film than this abomination from John Hughes. My only explanation for all the high ratings is that people over the age of 40 are badly misremembering a piece of their youth that may have seemed edgy and contemporary at the time. In reality it is slow, tedious, directionless and the main characters are highly narcissistic and totally unrelatable.Hughes' films give the impression of a man who was an outcast at school and uses his 'art' as a way of creating some kind of cool childhood he never had. The actors look 25 (except Judd Nelson who could pass for 33) and you never once feel like you're watching actual high school kids. The dialogue is incredibly unrealistic and not one single moment in this film feels authentic. The overacting is relentless with Estevez the worst offender and only Ally Sheedy coming away with any credit.The idea that Hughes gives voice to the oppressed youth of the times is also laughable. This is a bunch of highly privileged middle-class kids getting a first-rate education and doing nothing but complain about it. The fact that a teacher working overtime is the villain of the piece tells you everything you need to know about the deluded infantile fantasy that is John Hughes' view of the world. And it's not just the teacher who is made out to be the bad guy. All their parents are alluded to as oppressive bullies who stifle their children's creativity and personal development, yet all these kids are healthy, well-dressed, educated and living in safe suburbia. This petty rebelliousness is a common theme in Hughes' work, particularly in Ferris Bueller's Day Off- one of the few films I despise more than this.There are also some alarming messages regarding the place of young women in society. Allison is cast as a socially awkward virgin until she is given a makeover by one of the school's pretty girls. Within minutes she has surrendered her entire identity, is dating a jock and set to live happily ever after. Claire ends the day making out with a guy who has verbally abused her all day and done God-knows-what under the table. And let's just ignore the fact that she ends the day kissing a guy she saw literally spit into his own mouth a few hours earlier.And finally, the award for the 'worst attempt at acting stoned of all-time' goes to Emilio Estevez for his rhythmic gymnastics display after a couple of non-inhaled puffs of weed. I dread to think how this guy would respond to cocaine or ecstasy.If this was an obscure indie film that flopped badly I would probably feel bad for the producers and never think of it again. But the amount of acclaim and adoration that people have for this monstrosity is baffling and infuriating in equal measure.",The Breakfast Club

Lucky I have great flicks like ""The Breakfast Club"" to turn to. I have seen the concept re-worked on many sitcoms and teen drama shows, so I didn't really find too many surprises, plot-wise, with this film. Five high school kids, all representing ""types"", are stuck in detention together one Saturday. They can't stand or understand each other, of course, but with some shouting and group pot-smoking, they get to. While the slang may be dated, the sharp dialogue and engaging performances are not. Considering 95% of the film takes place in a single room, the fact that it never outstays its welcome, and is purely entertaining yet thoughtful, is quite a triumph. The teens (including Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall and Nelson)are obvious clichés, but they are meant to be-- so we can pick apart that stereotype too. My teen experience wasn't quite like theirs (we don't have as much of the cliques here in Australia), but I found a bit of myself in each character.",The Breakfast Club

This film, in addition to a masterpiece, is very important for the growth of a teenager and also for many parents and teachers and we can all learn a lot from this movie.

121,Pedro_H,Kids spoilt rotten -- an American tragedy.,6,12 March 2006,"Five students are brought in to detention on a Saturday ( the reason why is a spoiler) and what they get up to during that one day trapped in the school library.They are school joker Andrew Clark (played by Emilio Estevez), nerdy Brian Johnson (played by Anthony Michael Hall), school bully/wise-guy John Bender (played by Judd Nelson), rich snob Claire Standish (played by Molly Ringwald), and total head-case Allison Reynolds (played by Ally Sheedy).America, America. The home of the ""punishment of luxury."" Nearly every home have a car, most home's has several TVs, nearly every home has a fully stocked larder, but hey, they can be poor in their own way. Not material poverty, obviously but spiritual poverty. This film is about that -- people that don't believe in anything or want anything. Indeed they don't want anything because they have it all already and a soul can't be bought ""down at the mawwwl."" This bit of fluff was a hit in America, but is considered late night TV elsewhere. Proof that this means something to the USA. This three act morality play comes from that well known device of ""throw strange people together and truth will emerge."" Works in drama, but in real life all that happens is that people ignore each other or stick to their own -- like they do on a train journey.It also follows that drama convention of people being capable of sudden change. The ending is a complete hoot -- I've seen people change less in a stage hypnosis act! (Talking of change -- cop Molly Ringwald's hair! Seems to change between each and every shot. Who would have thought she could have so many hair styles in the one day!) The Breakfast Club is -- in summation -- a movie that is more interesting in its critical reaction than what happens on screen. Its far too cheap and cheerful to really please me and it also leaves you with the impression that destruction and soft drugs are a route to fun. This might be true -- for some -- but you don't have to advertise the fact.",The Breakfast Club

Sorry in advance - I know this might be an unpopular opinion of a film regarded by many as a ""classic"".I couldn't relate to this film and found it overwhelmingly uneventful and monotonous.Perhaps it was a combination of things:The 1980sAmerican high schoolThe ability to bring a gun to schoolThe fact they had an unbelievable amount of freedom while on detentionDespite being born in '89, none of those things were relatable to me. The characters were well developed, but the storyline? Not so much. I felt like nothing really happened. Occasionally a random music break would wake me up.These critiques are not even touching on the fact The Breakfast Club is riddled with sexual harrassment and homophobia throughout. This is not a film that has translated well into 2019.All I can say is thank god for John Hughes giving us Home Alone and Ferris Bueller to make up for this boring mess.",The Breakfast Club
126,Min111,These are basically five guys in detention,10,12 January 2021,"I was surprised how good the movie was. You must see it. You can tell it's one of these true eighties movies. 'The Breakfast Club' is very funny. The movie will make you laugh. You shouldn't be surprised since it's a comedy movie. How was it funny? It was funny because of the school principal named Richard Vernon. This guy made me laugh when I watched the movie. He reminds me of one of my teachers at school though I don't think he's half as bad. He deserves high praise for his performance. Yes, he was also in the movie named 'Die Hard'. I knew he looked familiar from somewhere. Anyway, there are five high-school students who are serving detention on a Saturday. When I went to high-school, we also have Saturday detention, but I never actually received one. I like Saturday. In fact, I think it's the best day of the week. Saturday is the start of the weekend. It must be dreadful having a detention on a Saturday where everyone else gets to have a good time. Anyway, the student names are Allison, Andrew, Brian, Claire and John. These are five guys in detention. They have to make it through the day. The principle instructs them not to talk, move from their seats or sleep until they're free to go later during the day. He assigns them with an essay which the students don't bother to complete. He leaves the room, but he occasionally checks on them. I was eagerly waiting what the principle would do next. It keeps getting funnier. The students pass the time by talking among each other when they should be quiet. They don't obey the rules. These five students learn more about each other as the day moves on. One of the things the students learn is that they each have poor relationships with their parents. Allison is a shy girl. Andrew is a pro wrestler. Brian is a brainiac. Claire is a beautiful girl. John is a bad boy. The students also seem to have nicknames, but I won't get into that. I don't like John because he's a bully, and he harasses the other guys. He's the guy who's most likely going to cause trouble in detention. He has an argument with the principle, and they clearly don't like each other. The school principle, Richard Vernon, thinks highly of himself. He's my favourite character. I liked the part though where John received several weeks of detention from Richard Vernon. That was hilarious! You have to see it. The students do get to have lunch. I also really liked one of the soundtrack which comes on right at the end. The five students become 'friends' at the end of the day. I'm glad I seen 'The Breakfast Club'. I seen it a few times now. The movie gets a high rating from me.",The Breakfast Club

The more I watch it the more I like it. I think John Bender is the best character in this movie, played by Judd Nelson. Second was a tie between Andy and Brian played by Emilio Estevez and Anthony Michael Hall, but every character was great -even the janitor was great, and Paul Gleason playing Mr. Vernen was good too.

It's a basic idea of bringing together people from all walks of life to see how they differ and eventually find common ground.Judd Nelson looks like he's about 30 in this, all the rest look just about old enough to be at High School/College.Ally Sheedy is totally miscast as the loner and crazy chick. All the roles she's had since were all good girl roles. Molly Ringwald seems to have always been cast as a whiner in John Huges films.Nothing happens in this film. Sitting in the library, running in a few corridors and a ton of really dull dialogue to get to an obvious conclusion - they find some common ground.

131,policy134,And you thought that your problems were extreme,7,30 August 2005,"The very first Brat Pack flick (there had been others but not with the entire group). There are only a few missing like Rob Lowe and Demi Moore from St. Elmo's Fire. It is nothing like any of the undergraduate slob films like Porky's and the MeatBalls series. This flick tries to take teen angst seriously and it examines the various types you will find in high school, like the jock, the nerd, etc.Judd Nelson gives the performance he would be called upon to do again and again, the angry loner who has a terrible home life and who always seems to know everything much better than you. Not that his acting isn't good here but you get weary of seeing him shout and be provocative to everybody in the course of almost 2 hours. He would retread his character here in ""Blue City"" and ""Fandango"" and finally he couldn't get any choice films to his credit. The other Brat Packers do not have as flashy a presence as Nelson and you can see why they had trouble finding work after the craze was over.As for the film itself it is rather original. To set almost the entire movie in a class room was a bit of a gamble, especially since such high voltage action films like Beverly Hills Cop and Top Gun would dominate the box office for most of the middle to late 80's. There has to be some pretty impressive dialog to hold the audience's interest and nobody could write it like John Hughes. The fact that the F-word is spoken frequently was probably shocking to a lot of adults at the time and that is probably why it has an ""R"" rating.Be warned, though, that this is not a comedy and anyone who is expecting it will be sorely disappointed. John Hughes has also written great comedies like ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" but the mood of this picture can be interpreted as terribly depressing. There are some scattered laughs but it is only because the adult characters, especially the principal is such buffoons that you laugh derisively at them. All in all I will say that even though the pace is enormously slow the viewing of this film should not be missed because after all the Brat Pack was talented and they were fun to watch.",The Breakfast Club

133,oOoBarracuda,The Breakfast Club,8,11 April 2017,"""Teen King' John Hughes wrote and directed The Breakfast Club in 1985. The stacked cast included Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, and Ally Sheedy in a film that chronicled the life of 5 high school students from different backgrounds and social circles forced to spend a Saturday in detention together. Breaking out of their shells and opening up to each other prove to the group that they're not as different as they initially seem. A brilliant ensemble piece with exceptional character development and engaging dialogue cement The Breakfast Club as one of the seminal films of the 80's.Andrew Clark (the jock), Claire Standish (the princess), Brian Johnson (the nerd), John Bender (the criminal), and Ally Sheedy (the basket case) are forced to spend 9 hours together locked inside their high school in detention on a Saturday in March. They are supervised by Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) their principle who has reached the end of his rope with high school students has decided to force the students to write 1,000-word essays describing who they think they are. Initially, the question seems easy, as each student has been pigeon-holed into a label that they have subsequently assumed. As the day drags on, their walls are broken down and they begin to realize they aren't who the world thinks they are. Their motives for their actions are tested, and each of their facades gives way to reveal a whole person who is much more complex that even they realized before their detention began. Not only does each member of the group develop a better understanding of themselves, but they also begin to better understand each other, as well.The emotional complexity of The Breakfast Club is its brightest light. The film is able to tackle abuse, both emotional and physical, neglect, and failing to meet expectations in an incredibly relatable way that avoids the pitfall of being either over-indulgent or preachy. Not only do we gain a full understanding of the hardships of each student, but we gain an understanding of Richard Vernon, as well. A character who initially comes across as a throw-away character is actually riddled with layers, as well. Through long scenes with rich artful dialogue, each character in the film is fully fleshed out, a rarity in such an ensemble piece. With a cast of such well-known names, I was a bit surprised to see one actor seeming to carry the film. Each scene with Judd Nelson's Bender is so critical to the plot, and he plays his character so well, I can't imagine anyone else in the role. With so many seemingly little moments, such as Ally Sheedy's ""basket case"" attempting to look in the window at her parent before the car abruptly pulls away establishing the neglect for her character, really gives the audience the sense that every aspect of the film exists for a specific reason. The payoff is always magnified when each shot of a film adds to its resolution, making The Breakfast Club a true standout of its generation.",The Breakfast Club
134,garethcrook,TakeTwo Reviews,9,1 June 2020,"More 80s nostalgia tonight, but the authentic kind. The Breakfast Club might not be classic cinema, high art or even important. It never pretended to be... even with the Bowie quote from 'Changes' in the opening. It's pure pop culture. Typical coming of age stuff, typical perhaps if you're American. Growing up in England, watching this in the 80s, these 5 characters were relatable for their (supposed) youth, but exotic and exciting. School in England is not like Shermer High. These kids had cool haircuts (well Judd Nelson), denim jackets (Nelson again), they didn't even have to wear a uniform!... and Ally Sheedy was cute! I loved The Breakfast Club. Loved. Watching 30+ years on, well it's not the same. Bender (Nelson) is a prick, Claire (Molly Ringwald) is still annoying. Andrew (Emilio Estavez) is a bit flat. Only Allison (Sheedy) and Brian (Anthony Micheal Hall) have anything interesting about them. I'm complicating it though, it's not supposed to be complicated. It's 5 kids serving detention on a Saturday, a gang of mismatched misfits against the teacher. The teacher, Mr Vernon is ridiculous though, like Rooney from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but without the comedy. It's really not aged all that well, but despite all the cartoon antics, it still has heart. Yes it's full of 80s tropes, especially the obligatory nonsensical dance scene, but it's strength is still the outpouring of emotions from each of them. So forgive some now very questionable dialogue.... Bender really is a prick, sit back and enjoy John Hughes in his directorial prime. I'm going to tie a bandana around my boots and rip the sleeves off a flannel shirt.",The Breakfast Club

136,saadanathan,Classic of the 80's that aged bad 7/10,7,15 July 2020,"""The Breakfast Club"" is one of those 80's movies that you probably never heard of unless your parents grew upon it and told you about. The story is pretty simple: 5 teenagers are sent to detention on saturday and are forced to stay at the library all day while they are being watched by their teacher. along the way they find out they have much in common than what they tought. So the movie doesn't have where to fail, but keep in mind that the whole plot is happening at school on saturday and so to keep the plot moving and interesting is a big challenge. Unfortunately this is where the movie disappoints. Though the chemistry between the characters is wonderful, I think the fact that all 5 characters are trapped in a building with no twist or turn of events is where the movie fails in impressing the viewers. The characters are well written with each of them having to face their emotions and fears and allowing themselves to be more open to strangers. Bender and Allison are the more weird and bizarre characters in this film, Brian is the one who gives a closure to the film with the note he leaves to the teacher, thus making him a leader of the club. Overall this movie may have been a hit back in the 80's but became forgettable as time passed, John Hughes has proved before that he can do better than that take ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" for example.",The Breakfast Club
137,CinematicInceptions,Classic dramady with great relateable characters and some of John Hughes' best comedy.,8,4 April 2015,"Despite the constant changes in high school culture, this movie will remain a classic for a very long time. Anyone who has been through or is going through high school can relate to it, and you don't even have to be familiar with each stereotype to do it either. The way the characters are written is unparalleled. Everything each of them says is completely believable in context of them as a character and as a person. One of the really incredible things about the characters is the way that their exposition is mostly covered in the moments where they aren't speaking. While not everyone has been in Saturday detention, especially since it's kind of phasing out of use, there are many scenarios that current and former high-schoolers have first hand experience with.We all kind of understand how the characters can talk freely with each other as complete strangers, but don't feel comfortable discussing their problems with their friends. This complies with the growing tendency of friends not to be there to discuss each others' problems as really good friends should. I think this is mostly accounted for by teenagers, and I feel fine saying this because I am one, not wanting to look soft in front of each other, especially not their friends. But that's kind of beside the point. Anyway, as strangers, the five students can talk to each other without being judged as they would among friends.Even before they start opening up to each other, the students unite, mostly in reaction to the actions of Vernon. Those scenes are kind of cool because it's great to be able to rebel against the one in charge, even if you'd love to see the guy next to you get in big trouble. Through this, they all realize that they are a collective force against Vernon. Vernon is pretty good as villains go since he's kind of the traditional martinet that we've all encountered at some point along the way. His treatment of Bender also adds to the audience's hatred for him, even though Bender is constantly asking for Vernon to punish him. Basically the only other character is the janitor, who is also kind of interesting in how he knows all of the kids secrets, which I'm sure a lot of janitors do.The most moving scenes of the movie come when the students discuss their lives with each other, and this is really where they start to recognize the similarities they all have. All of them have problems with their parents, which everyone can relate to to a certain extent. All of them get defensive whenever their sexual orientation is put into question, also something that contributes to their characters. Some of them discuss why they were put in detention, which also brings out a lot of emotion. And they all talk about the difficulty of being their particular stereotype, though it's true that none of them fall under any physical stereotypes which can be a point of controversy. I've noticed that some other reviews don't like how the characters end up ""together"" at the end, but I would refute this. I think the point is that they *aren't* together and never can be. They leave indelible marks on each other, but probably will never even speak again, as so well explained by the Simple Minds song at the end.The comedy is mostly verbal, and even the situational gags are overshadowed by the classic lines that they generate. The silent moments can be pretty funny too, like the one or two times where they're all just shown sitting around trying to pass the time. Bender contributes most of the comedy since he has by far the most lines and tries to be sarcastically funny anyway. Allison's quirkiness also contributes some more subtle humor. Brain can be funny in his reactions to Bender (e.g. ""You're mom marry Mr. Rogers?"" ""No Mr. Johnson.""). Claire and Andrew don't have as many good lines, but they compensate by having more depth than the other three.I don't want to call this a must-see, but I would still strongly recommend it to anyone in high-school who hasn't yet seen it. It's good to watch on your own or with a small group, but make sure you can hear the entire time. Unlike most films, I would actually recommend that you buy it right off since its a film that you'll likely want to see many times. I wouldn't pick it if your'e seeking strictly comedy since, while it has lots of funny scenes, it also has a lot of emotion. Overall Rating: 8.6/10",The Breakfast Club

I love this movie, but it seems to be a little overrated by the children of the 1980's that get all nostalgic for this sort of thing. Some of the writing is bad and it's definitely dated, but it's one of the best teen dramas of all time. The five core actors and actresses worked great together.

139,Angeneer,Enjoyable but had higher potential,7,26 January 2004,"I would take Breakfast Club as a very enjoyable teenage movie. It might not have a clear point or top performances but it still retains its entertainment value. Apart from that, since the setting is minimal and the movie is concentrated on the dialogues, there was room for far better lines. Plenty of plot elements could be analyzed and explored deeper. It does not really justify the forming of the bond between the kids. Moreover, while only scraping the surface of their problems, it tries to communicate some vague moral lesson, without having truly elaborated on it before.",The Breakfast Club
140,ethanbresnett,Maybe slightly overrated but still a great movie,8,3 April 2021,"On the surface The Breakfast Club seems like a very outdated movie. From the clothes to the direction to the entire situation really. All of them scream 80s. However beneath the surface of this film are some great universal themes that are as engaging and relatable now as they were in 1985.It's a film about a bunch of kids who are going through the troubles that plague teenagers the world over whatever time period they are in. Struggling to fit in, trying too hard to fit in, not having the confidence to be themselves, putting on a spiky exterior to hide their own insecurities, trying to live up to their parents expectations. We cover a lot in this film, with each character carefully crafted to bring something emotional, poignant or funny to the conversations that unfold.Considering this is a film where not much happens, the characters needed to be engaging and they were. They were all different and had something to bring to the screenplay, and I loved all of the interactions between them. You really feel like you are going on a journey with them, and a lot is crammed in to only 90 minutes.As mentioned earlier the style is unquestionably 80s, which I liked. If you enjoy the vibe of similar 80s coming of age type films you'll enjoy the creative direction taken here.Lots to enjoy with this film. It didn't necessarily blow me away, but was very enjoyable and it was great fun getting to know and deconstruct these characters.",The Breakfast Club
141,DavidSim240183,A perfectly captured snapshot of teen awareness,10,25 December 2007,"Having recently written a review for John Hughes' Sixteen Candles, I now write about the film that many consider his best work, The Breakfast Club.Although I feel Hughes' best teen film is Ferris Bueller's Day Off, TBC comes in as a close second. Its certainly his most dramatic teen film. Indeed its a seminal 80s classic.TBC comes with a very simple conceit. Five teenagers are stuck in Saturday detention. All different kids from different walks of life. And they're all in detention for wildly different reasons. At first glance, they have nothing in common except being in detention on Saturday. But appearances can be deceiving.Our teen quintet includes Andy Clark (Emilio Estevez), the Jock. Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), the Nerd. John Bender (Judd Nelson), the Rebel. Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), the Prom Princess. And Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy), the Misfit.You've probably noticed each one of them represents a various stereotype. Each individual teen is a mouthpiece for a different clique or minority. And each actor does a superb job inhabiting the character Hughes has written for them.You'd almost swear Hughes had each actor in mind when he was still writing the screenplay. TBC is one of John Hughes' most aptly cast films. At least until Planes, Trains & Automobiles.TBC is also very stagebound. It begins and ends in this Chicago (well where else!) high school. Once the teens arrive there, they never leave it. In fact the majority of the story is told within the confines of the school library. We seldom see anything else.Hughes was wise not to include any extraneous subplots outside of school. He knew the crux and focus should be these five disparate souls. That's where our interest lies. And its why the film works so well.All Hughes has to do is put the five of them in a room together, and sit back and wait for things to happen. Although they're quite different people, they all react to they're situation with the same response, frustration. Some of them are just better at concealing it than others. (A quote from the film actually!).With almost astonishing smoothness, wondrous things begin to happen right before our very eyes. We see Bender act out his sheer contempt for the high school system by picking on the nearest convenient targets. Either the teens he's sharing detention with. Or Principal Vernon (Paul Gleason), the man who's brought them together.Claire feels someone at the top of the high school tree shouldn't be stuck in detention. And I suspect the same of Andrew. Brian may be a straight A student but I'll bet he can't figure out how he ended up here. And Allison is a passive observer. She hardly ever speaks. Her reasons for being here are as much a mystery to her co-conspirators as it is to us.You wouldn't think a story centred around five teens sharing detention would be so involving. But it is. And more. Its rewarding, fascinating, moving and even surprisingly funny. Each actor carefully and astutely engages in self-analysis, before cautiously sharing that knowledge with each other.Its hard to say who gives the best performance. Most people single out Judd Nelson's powerhouse acting for high praise, and while he's certainly impressive, he's not the standout. Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez and Anthony Michael Hall all work wonders with roles that tend to get bogged down in clichés. But for me, its Ally Sheedy who steals the show.Ally Sheedy is sometimes difficult to like. She often projects an aloof quality that very easily keeps you at a distance. And its for that reason why she inhabits Allison so well. For the first half of the film, Allison isn't allowed to say anything. Only sit and watch. But in an impeccably controlled bit of acting, Sheedy carefully sheds the layers she's built up around herself. And does it in the subtlest of ways.Like chipping in to defend Bender from Vernon along with everyone else. You can almost sense her growing weary with being the outside observer. She wants to learn more about these people who have been forced together by circumstance. And when she finally engages in conversation, its a real shock moment. Surely the finest bit of acting Ally Sheedy has ever done.But everyone else each has their individual moments to shine. Molly Ringwald brings the same keen intuition to Claire that she brought to Samantha in Sixteen Candles. In fact all of them sharply play their roles against all expectations.John Hughes has a real knack for matching the perfect actors to the characters he creates. He refuses to work with generics. He makes sure there is always some truth to be found in everyone. I'm not sure how much of this film was improvised, but I sense Hughes allowed the actors to discover each other in they're own time. The jewel in the crown is the scene where they share they're reasons for being here. A scene of equal heart, humour and poignant truth.The way dialogue flows is extraordinary. The five of them absorb you into the story without barely making a point of it. And although some of the revelations are not unexpected, like putting on an aggressive front to hide insecurities, the characters feel so fleshed out you'll barely notice.Hughes' keen ear for teenspeak is particularly astute here. The film is so compelling you never want it to end. But sadly it must. And when they part company, there's an unshakable feeling of poignance. These five innocents shared everything on this fateful Saturday. Come Monday morning, they may only know each other as just another face in the halls. And that's sad.The Breakfast Club is one of the defining teen films of its genre. A haunting, knowing and often devastating portrait of teen angst and aggression.",The Breakfast Club
142,moviemanMA,Essential,9,2 July 2005,"In John Hughes' classic 80's film The Breakfast Club, five people from five different clicks of the high school realm are forced to sit together for one Saturday due to their reckless behavior. The group consisting of, ""a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal,"" learn what it is like living in their shoes.The brain is Anthony Michael Hall and his character Brian is one of the more complex. He needs to keep his grades up so he can survive his home life. All seems fine in his world but little does the Breakfast Club know it is anything but.Andy is the athlete played by Emilio Estevez, is the person who always can fight his way out of a situation. If something needs to get done, he can do it. This pressure is poured onto him by his father. The wrestling team needs him and this Saturday session is the key to continuing his quest for college.Ally Sheedy plays the part of the basket case named Allison. She is the oddball of the group. With her secretive, quiet, and sometimes disturbing attitude, she is the one who must truly find out what she really is and what she wants out of life.The princess is played by Molly Ringwald. Claire is so self absorbed that even if she became friends with someone there she wouldn't tell anyone because it would ruin her reputation of being perfect and popular.Last but not least is the criminal played by Judd Nelson. As the smart-ass of the ""club"", John Bender (just called Bender) feels like he runs the show. Always nipping back at Principal Vernon (Paul Gleason) who runs this Saturday detention. Nelson delivers a mind blowing performance as this trash talking, punk dressing, and domestically abused teenager.Director John Hughes could not miss with any of his pictures in the 80's. Sixteen Candles, Ferris Buehler's Day Off, PLanes, Trains, and Automobiles, and Uncle Buck. All done within 5 years. All are priceless. This picture stands out among them.What makes this movie so memorable is the dialogue shared between these characters. They would have never met if it wasn't for this detention on a Saturday. They never would have shared so many deep, intimate thoughts that otherwise might have stayed locked up in ""the vault"". Each person tells their story of where they come from and why they are there giving us a feeling of relief in the end.With all the pieces put together, you get one hell of a movie and one that will be remembered for generations to come.

143,AvidClimber,The Breakfast Club — High school detention and colliding personalities on a Saturday,10,28 January 2013,"The Breakfast Club presents to us the five archetype of high school students. Every kid can find himself in those, if not in true form, by the mix of two of them. Even today, it holds true, if the lingo doesn't. I'm not talking about cliques, I'm talking about personality and acceptability.This is John Hughes' master piece in term of analyzing the teenage mind. You're faced with what makes somebody cool, why you get rejected, the walls that are built between the groups, and how they are built, maintained. You get the different angst they face every day: from parental abuse to parental absence, from peer pressure to bullying, from delinquency to suicide.Those very opposite characters are put together and confronted with each other's reality. As they argue, squabble, and fight, they never forget to form common cause against their oppressors.There's nothing negative about this movie, it's just starting to date a bit, but not too much. Hughes did a great job to keep the 80s out of his film as much as possible. The only thing that can irk, is some bits of youth lingo which is now outdated. Fortunately, very little is used, and the rest is still current.You have to see this, but keep in mind the release date and that it's all happening in the library. A single set.",The Breakfast Club

145,kdnor2011,I loved this movie,9,17 August 2011,"If I were to tell you to think of an 80's high school movie, you would probably think of this movie. But really even if I took out the 80's part, this movie should still be the film that pops into your head. If you went to high school, then you probably know these kids. It isn't just 1985 teenagers that can relate to this, I was a high school student from 2008-2011, and I knew a each of these kids, and even related to some of them myself.OK first my negatives. The shift from comedy to drama could have been a little smoother. It just seems to go from jokes to talking about suicide. Maybe that's just me. Also the Principal was played a little to over the top. I know this is what we all thought our teachers and principles wanted to say to us, but if they really threatened me, I would be probably think it was a joke. He should have been fired.But overall this movie was really really good. If I had to pick a character I was most like it would be part of Allison and part of Brian. I was just that kid in school who was just there. I wan't a jock, geek, or criminal, I was just there. So I thought I wouldn't relate to this movie, but it turns out I did. The reason the movie works is because of it's characters, because the plot on paper sounds really boring. Really it's hard to explain why the film works so well, you just need to watch it.Sorry this review isn't that great, but really there isn't much to say, it just does a really good job of portraying teenagers. If you haven't seen it yet go watch it, especially if you're still in high school.",The Breakfast Club
146,nickmesafilms,The Breakfast Club (1985) - John Hughes Strikes Again!,10,11 January 2012,"Written and directed by the late great John Hughes, ""The Breakfast Club"" is a comedy-drama told through the emotions of five different high schoolers: the nerd, the prom queen, the jock, the goth, and the rebel. The movie takes place on a Saturday in detention, when five kids express their feelings of their every-day life, and how they wish that it can all change one day. ""The Breakfast Club"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. I can watch this over and over again, and I'm still entertained by what this movie has to offer. John Hughes completely knocked this out of the park, and created his best movie ever made. The talented cast of Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, and Paul Gleason, in a scene-stealing performance as the school principal, is quite perfect in every way, and each performance made these characters look more like real human beings. This is a movie that I bet all audiences will relate to. This movie has consistent laughs, heartwarming messages, and memorable moments. This can give audiences a big reminder about being your own person, and how expressing your feelings can make you a better person. All teen audiences can watch this movie again and again, and they'll totally understand. I'm a fan of well-written teen movies that gives out heartwarming messages, and John Hughes does not forget to deliver. He's the perfect director to bring back the high school past of being a teen, and put it on film in a way nobody has ever done it before. This movie is an entertaining message from the heart, and it's worth watching over and over. ""The Breakfast Club"", in my review, ""an entertaining teen movie, with heartwarming elements"".",The Breakfast Club
147,Okonh0wp,"a good 80s film, but then again, who likes the 80s?",5,5 July 2004,"2 1/2 Stars: The Breakfast Club was arguably the most definitive teen angst film of the 80s, but then again, the 80s were a pretty bad decade for teenager films so that's not saying much. The film is about a group of five high school students who are forced to spend a day-long detention with each other.
The group comprises of a jock, a bully, a nerd, a beauty queen and a freak. These are five of the most blandly stereotypical characters ever to appear in a film, and even though this is a deliberate action designed to give the actors leverage so that they could more easily be dynamic later in the film, it's blatantly obvious. The teenagers, interact with each other in ways that they otherwise wouldn't have had they not been forced to spend a Saturday together. The strongest part about the film is that there's a lot of good dialogue as the ragtag group starts going through the mundane activities of trying to stop the school bully from getting them in trouble or asking for a piece of gum, to having conversation in which they get to know each other and finding they all had more in common, than they realized.However, if ever a potentially good film was set back by the ending, The Breakfast Club would have to be one of the best examples. If the idea was that these teenagers of different social classes were going to learn that they had more in common than they realized and eventually tear down those barriers, than why does the film end with the status quo, where the beauty queen ends up with the bad boy, and everyone gets together with someone except for the nerd who ends up having to write the group paper?",The Breakfast Club
148,La Gremlin,Should be required viewing for teens,10,23 March 2001,"Let's get my rants out of the way first.  I hate seeing this movie in the comedy sections of video stores.  Have those people ever sat down and watched it?  I'm willing to bet that they haven't. 
I've also noted that this is a movie people either love or hate.  Most of the people I know who hate it first watched it as adults.  That is a HUGE mistake.  Adults (and I know this because I find myself slowly, reluctantly transforming into one) tend to remember their teenage years with (can you believe this?) *FONDNESS*!  I'm serious!  Adults have it in their heads that being a teenager is *enjoyable*.""The Breakfast Club"" was one of the first films to try and show what kids really go through in high school.  Most teen movies prior were something more like ""Grease"", all nostalgia and denial, no trauma or disillusion. Then this movie arrived with scene after excruciating scene of adolescent angst.My humble opinion is this:  If you are currently in high school you MUST watch this movie.  If you wait, you'll be too old to get it.  It is, simply put, the greatest teen movie ever made.If you aren't tearing up by the middle of the second act, you are advised to check your pulse.",The Breakfast Club
149,jcbutthead86,The Greatest Teen Film Of All Time And John Hughes' (RIP)Greatest Film. A Landmark Classic.,10,8 January 2013,"The Breakfast Club is the greatest Teen film of all time and is not only a Teen classic of the 80s,but a film Classic for all times. With a great balance of Comedy,Drama,Great Direction,excellent performances and an well-written screenplay,The Breakfast Club is John Hughes' greatest film and is a landmark in Teen Films,High School Films and Coming Of Age films.Set on March 24,1984 in Shermer High School in Shermer,Illinois,The Breakfast Club tells the story of five High School students Brian Johnson,The Brain(Anthony Michael Hall),Andrew Clark,The Athlete(Emilio Estevez),Allison Reynolds,The Basketcase(Ally Sheedy),Claire Standish,The Princess(Molly Ringwald)and John Bender,The Criminal(Judd Nelson)who are from different social backgrounds and have to serve detention on a Saturday under the watchful eye of teacher Richard Vernon(Paul Gleason). While there in detention,the five students talk to each other and realize they have a lot in common beyond their stereotypes and social classes and the experience changes their lives forever making them known forever as...The Breakfast Club.What can be said about The Breakfast Club that hasn't been said already,it's a classic that revolutionized Teen films at the time and has a style and influence that has been imitated,but never duplicated. The reason,I think TBC works do well is because of the five teen characters and how we can relate to each of them in different ways discussing their fears,desires and problems with their parents. The Teenage years can be a funny,strange and confusing time for many people and Hughes puts it on full display with this film giving us three dimensional characters that are lifted beyond their stereotypes and showing true emotions and feelings and no matter what race,color or class you are you'll identify with each character. While the fashions and music are of the 80s,the feelings and emotions are truly timeless and heartfelt and one of the reasons TBC has stood the test of time. The screenplay by John Hughes(which Hughes wrote in 2 days)is excellent and well-written balancing Comedy and Drama and giving the characters memorable dialog,while they're laughs and funny moments,they're moments of great drama and truth in some of the scenes. Hughes was a true master of the teenage language and the dialog in TBC feels real and authentic almost like you're next to the characters hearing the dialog. I don't think that Hughes was trying reinvent or revolutionize the Teen genre,but unintentionally he did with this film and his other films as well bringing a depth and excellence that hadn't been seen in Teen films since Rebel Without A Cause and American Graffiti. The only 80s Teen films that can match TBC's honesty and truth is Hughes' other films and Fast Times At Ridgemont High. While Hughes' other films Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Sixteen Candles,Pretty In Pink,Some Kind Of Wonderful and Weird Science are also classics of the Teen film genre,TBC in my opinion will remain his most enduring and most powerful. What I also love about the film is the setting being in one location which is a High School library which is used to great effect and adds to the film. Making a Teen movie set in one location with no sex,nudity,parties or drinking(although the characters do use drugs in the film)seemed like a risky gamble at the time,but Hughes makes use of his one location and still keeps the film entertaining and interesting. The one location gives the film a feeling or style of stage play or an small independent film and Hughes in his own way made a film like 12 Angry Men or Glengarry Glen Ross,where instead of 12 jurors and real estate office workers,it's teenagers in High School. Despite the film being set in one location Hughes keeps the film moving at a quick pace and a lot of energy and as a viewer you are glued to the screen. The ending of the film is a great ending and makes the viewers asks a lot of questions and gives us no answers. It's a masterful ending that will make us the viewers put together the dots and answers and have us wondering what happened to the characters and is one of the reasons TBC is brilliant.The whole cast does a great job. Emilio Estevez is excellent as Andrew,the Wrestling jock who's pressured to succeed and win. Judd Nelson is brilliant in his career defining performance as John Bender,a rebel who is cynical,irritating,yet likable. Anthony Michael Hall is great as Brian,the smart kid who has to have high grades or will fail in life. Molly Ringwald is wonderful as Claire,the popular girl who is the target of Bender's irritation. Ally Sheedy is effective as Allison,the outcast who doesn't say much,but talks as times rolls on. Paul Gleason(RIP)is great as John Vernon,cynical teacher who hates the students at the school,especially Bender. John Kapelos does a fine and funny job as Carl The Janitor who offers words of wisdom to the kids and Vernon.The direction by John Hughes is simple,but great,with Hughes bringing a lot of energy to the film with his writing and direction. Great Job,John. Thank you John Hughes for giving viewers great Teen films that are timeless classics that will live on and be loved and cherished forever. RIP,John.Keith Forsey's score in the film is seldom used,but works and fits with film's tone. The film has a great soundtrack as well,especially with the film iconic theme song Don't You(Forget About Me)by Simple Minds and other great songs Fire In The Twilight(Wang Chung)and We Are Not Alone(Karla DeVito). Hughes' films always had great soundtracks and TBC is no exception.In final word,if you love John Hughes,Teen Films,High School Films,Coming Of Age films or films in general,I suggest you see The Breakfast Club,a true classic that will stand the test of time and will live forever in cinema and with audiences. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",The Breakfast Club
150,jackasstrange,The quintessential 80s film,9,11 March 2014,"The Breakfast Club is a mark in cinema history? Yes. The so popular genre, the teenager genre, which explores the teenager world through stereotypes, became widely popular in the 80s - and still is- and the vast majority of the films in this particular genre shows Nerds being ridiculed and bullied by the popular guys...the 'bad' teacher....a girl that wants to be popular and date the popular guy...etc etc etc. And the great majority of these teenager films are comedies involving parties and lots of sexual references. Basically this is what the genre is about. But then, we have Breakfast Club. The film is the examination and study of these stereotypes. There isn't one dimensional characters here. Its the anti thesis of the normal Teenager genre, and I say, the end of them all. We still have films about teenagers produced nowadays, but we know that the genre ended when Breakfast Club was released back in 1985. A film that chooses to explain the characters instead of robotizing them.The Breakfast Club is for the teenager films what Once Upon a Time in the West was for the western genre. The definitive end. And what an ending. 9.0/10",The Breakfast Club
151,smakawhat,Damn good,8,22 April 2000,"When I saw this film in the 80's as a teenager I totaly identified with it. I enjoyed the humor and the characters.  It was a riot and very real.  I knew many 'Benders' in my school (one I knew even killed himself) as with all the other characters.  It even meant more to me cause so many people liked to remark how much I looked like Anthony Michael Hall back then (who was in all these movies playing the same stereotyped character).Looking back the film is still great.  However, my only criticism with the movie now was that it didn't go far enough in letting the characters vent. I think that just reflects the time it was made. THe movie wasn't ready to handle HARD ISSUES not because it couldn't but because the time it was made no one was doing that.Kids now are faced with harder issues and are forced to grow up faster. Also kids are more accepting I think of other cliques compared to back then.. Except the geeks I guess...Anyway...  A film that will stand the test of time.Rating 8 out of 10",The Breakfast Club
152,Hermit C-2,John Hughes' finest.,10,21 May 1999,"John Hughes has been responsible for many entertaining movies but none better than this one, in my opinion. It works well as a teen comedy but there are a few curves thrown in that take it to another level.When a group of five disparate students arrives at their high school on a Saturday morning for an all-day detention session they represent five archetypes, one of which almost any viewer can personally relate to. There's Claire (Molly Ringwald), the high school princess who can't believe she's actually to be included in this motley crew. Andrew (Emelio Estevez) is a jock who's traveling down the straight and narrow path that athletics takes him, a path prescribed by his father. Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) is one of the school's brains. His very intelligence is the thing that diminishes in the eyes of others. John Bender (Judd Nelson) comes swaggering in like the top con in the yard. This is his turf. He works hard as portraying himself as an outlaw and an outsider but he's desperate for understanding and attention just like anyone else. Finally Allison (Ally Sheedy) comes scurrying in looking like a junior bag lady-in-training. She sits in the back, hiding behind her hair, apparently terrified to speak or to be spoken to.It promises to be a dull day but Bender will have none of that, as he seeks to make everyone as uncomfortable as possible. Over the course of the next several hours he leads the group on a series of adventures right under the nose of their principal, played by Paul Gleason in the film's only other substantial role. (One is required to suspend reality here to believe they get away with some of the stuff they do.)The first big surprise for me came when Bender pulled out his stash of marijuana and convinces the others, after initial reluctance, to join him in smoking some. Coming as the movie did in the middle of the Reagan years, one expects the kids to just say no. It's a brave stance for the movie to take, but it's also a completely believable turn of events.The real surprise, and the segment that makes the movie great, is when the five youngsters settle down on the floor and discuss who they are and how they came to this point. Andrew reveals he's in detention for pulling some horseplay only because he thought it was expected of him by his father. On the verge of tears he tells of the relentless pressure put on him to succeed. When he says of his dad,""God, I f*****g hate him!"", the viewer is shocked, not by the language, but by the sudden seriousness the film has acquired. This leads to a series of cathartic confessions and confrontations among the group that are angry, tearful and emotionally draining, but in the end it leads to a bond between the five that just a few hours earlier they never would have expected could be forged.This movie is best seen on cassette or on a premium channel, as the broadcast version cuts out all references to pot-smoking and also prudishly censors the dialog to a ridiculous extent. For example, ""Oh my God!"" is dubbed to become, ""Oh my lord!"" But if you're a real fan you might want to see this TV version since it contains a minute or two of action not included in the theatrical release.",The Breakfast Club
153,Brian-272,"An 80's icon film, a great hit due to the strong message it brings that all of us can relate to.",10,4 June 2001,"John Hughes I thank you for making a film that is so true in it's message times that we can all remember our high school days. High school is a point when you find yourself searching for that meaning well knowing what the world is about and dealing with problems and differences while always bumping over and stepping on others toes. The, Breakfast Club is a story of five Chicago, Illinois high school kids who spend a Saturday afternoon in detention and I will tell you that you find that in every high school in America you have students just like these characters in The, Breakfast Club. Even my small town high school had teenage high school students just like these that's why The, Breakfast Club is such a hit for the fact of the realism it brings. You have it in all different types first Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez) as the athletic type a high school wrestling champion all brawn and no brains, next Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall) as the brain and straight as the arrow student the next genius in the making, then the criminal and everyday rule breaker John Bender (Judd Nelson), then follows the princess and prom queen Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald) a girl that any boy would desire to be with, finishing out with a basket case and odd Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy). See what I mean now remember these types in your own high school. During the days detention these five discover they have more in common than they think. The, Breakfast Club has some of the better dialogue and acting in film history it's one of those films you learn to like and remember by heart and Judd Nelson gives the best performance of any cast member. The, Breakfast Club continues to receive numerous airings on cable many weekends you can find it on the TV as high as five or six times that's how well respected this John Hughes classic is, I have a copy of The, Breakfast Club in my video collection and view it many times. I think the Anthony Michael Hall character Brian Johnson says it all in the end that each of us found out who we are a athlete, a brain, a criminal, a princess, and a basket case. Remember it's meant for everyone to be different, everyone should be different, and it's OK for everyone to be different. I had friend tell me that once and I can well see how that message is shown in The, Breakfast Club.",The Breakfast Club

155,Coffee_in_the_Clink,"""You just bought yourself another Saturday""",9,12 April 2020,"John Hughes's 'quintessential' '80s film is still as relevant today as it was thirty-odd years ago. A film that really gets to the heart of the teenage characters as they languish together in Saturday detention with the highly-strung Mr. Vernon, who seems to hate them all. The four kids are representatives of four distinctive cliques; there's the weird girl Allison, the athlete Andrew, the prim-and-proper Claire who looks down on everyone, the nerd Brian and finally, the wild, rebel-without-a-case bad boy John. None of them would be caught dead in the other's company usually, but as their sentence in detention stretches from 7am - 4pm and they are virtually left their own devices in the library, their initial hostility towards one another eventually dissipates as they bond and realise they actually have a lot in common. But at the end of the day, the question is asked and we are left to wonder, What will happen Monday?""The Breakfast Club"" is well-deserving of its status as a classic 80s film but it also holds up to be more than that. It's undeniable charm and the excellent performances from the small cast make it one to remember. Hughes did not have much experience when he made this, and I believe he was under some pressure from the studio and producers, but he did a tremendous job, essentially filming a stage-production with the action all taking place (mostly) in the one room. This always serves to add a more personal feel to a film. ending, with the famous song by Simple Minds playing to Judd Nelson raising his fist triumphantly in the air, is one of the most iconic in cinema history, and is one of my all-time favourites.",The Breakfast Club
156,renegadeviking-271-528568,Interesting show,8,26 January 2020,"Out of all of the shiny teen dramas or rom-coms from the wash of the 1980s, this one has arguably aged better than most of them. I'm still not entirely sure if that's saying very much, but it just is what it is. This coming-of-age dramedy was originally released in theaters by Universal Pictures on February 15th, 1985. In spite of low expectations, it managed to gross over $51.5 million at the worldwide box office against a modest $1 million budget. It almost immediately received critical acclaim at the time of release and has been hailed as a classic of the genre in the years since. It also was re-opened in select theaters for its 30th anniversary back in 2015. Written and directed by John Hughes, the film was apparently intended to be his directorial debut. But after proving himself a capable screenwriter and garnering success for his work on Sixteen Candles, investors gave him the all-clear for a single location shoot. Numerous pre-stardom actors auditioned for various roles, including Nicholas Cage, Laura Dern, and Jodie Foster. In additional trivia, the first draft of the film's screenplay was missing for years until 2015, when it was discovered in the office cabinet of Maine South High School. Like many of his films, this one is set in a high school environment near Chicago city limits. Five students from different cliques- bad boy John Bender, popular girl Claire Standish, reclusive Allison Reynolds, star athlete Andrew Clark, and nerdy math wizard Brian Johnson -have all been assigned Saturday detention in the school library. Their strict and mean-spirited assistant principal Vernon wants them all to stay in their exact spots until the end of the day, ordering them to write a thousand-word essay about ""who you think you are."" While the students initially seem so different from one another, as they talk and open up they realize they have far more in common than they would have believed. The Breakfast Club is one of those films where, even if you haven't actually seen the film, you likely already know the general story. Whether it's the iconic final shot on a football field or the immortal poster photo, it's safe to say most people know what this film is about. Hell, even I knew a good chunk about it before watching it for the first time a few years ago. Almost everyone out there has a special teen-centric that they like to revisit for one reason or another. Maybe it's because it's simply a really good movie, or it could also be that it hits close to home for the viewer. For me, those movies are Ferris Bueller's Day Off and The Breakfast Club, and I frequently switch between which one I love more. But after this rewatch, I'm starting to think this one just barely pulls out. As mentioned in the intro, I genuinely believe that this film has aged a lot better than many of its contemporaries, even some of Hughes' other works. There are no era-specific references no one understands, no outdated technology that laughable by today's standards, no mention of brands that no longer exist. By confining the film to a single setting, we're treated to seeing a group of what seem to be stereotypical high schoolers stripped down to their very cores. What's especially affecting about The Breakfast Club is how honestly it's told from the perspective of the kids. There's no point in looking at the story from the AP's point-of-view because all he sees are an athlete, a brain, a princess, a basket case, and a criminal. Placing the story almost entirely inside this library is a stroke of genius because while it's dialogue heavy, there's enough space for the characters to move around in and reveal something about themselves. Later to be called the ""Brat Pack"" for their appearances together in other films, the five central actors are nothing short of iconic. Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, and Anthony Michael Hall all play the respective roles as John Bender, Andrew Clark, Claire Standish, Allison Reynolds, and Brian Johnson so perfectly. Even though they were extremely young at the time and somewhat inexperienced, it's hard to imagine anyone else in their roles. My favorite one has always been Sheedy because she stays silent for much of the first half before turning inside out in the second. Obviously, there are many who prefer Nelson's pot-smoking bad boy with a real heart, but I also want to mention Estevez as Clark. Not just your average high school, you can clearly tell that he has a lot of deep-seated regret and anger about his choices. Over on the adults' side, the only two major characters outside the core five are Paul Gleason as Assistant Principal Vernon and John Kapelos as the janitor Carl Reed. Gleason, who would play a similarly humorless role in Die Hard is so arrogant and unconfident that he often tries to flaunt his authority over the students, even as he makes a fool of himself. Kapelos, meanwhile, is very carefree and easygoing as Reed, not getting in the way of the teens while occasionally standing up to Vernon. Meanwhile, despite its extremely modest budget, The Breakfast Club is pretty impressive from a filmmaking perspective. Thomas Del Ruth, who also shot Stand By Me and The Mighty Ducks, opts mostly for Steadicam shots of the characters, staying focused on them or following their actions. There are a surprising amount of wide shots, illustrating the teens being trapped in such a seemingly large room. Every now and then when the students are talking together, the camera is roving around them as the speaker constantly changes. This matches up well with the editing by Dede Allen, which never feels choppy or poor. Instead, it moves between different shots and scenes with ease. There are virtually no cutaway gags, which enhances the comedic moments even more. Moreover, all of the teens are given almost the exact same amount of screen-time in the film, which makes 97-minute story feel well-balanced. There is a film score provided by musicians Keith Forsey and Gary Chang, and it's about the most '80s thing you're likely to ever hear. Nearly all of the original tracks consist of synthesizers and electric drums, tuned differently for the mood of the scene. This includes a love theme, which manages to avoid being super sappy. But let's be honest, the most memorable piece of music is Simple Minds' ""Don't You Forget About Me,"" which plays over the film's now-iconic ending sequence. It's actually a perfect fit for the film, as these kids may never meet each other again but will never forget their time together this Saturday. The song has also become the subject of various memes and parodies over the years. When it comes down to it, it's hard to think of a more widely known and beloved teen movie from a decade chock full of them. The director had a number of his own classic entries in his pocket, but none of them have aged nearly as well. Again, it's really just the simplicity here that creates the genius and relatability. The Breakfast Club is the quintessential coming-of-age movie for teenagers and adults everywhere. Even with a career marked by angst-ridden teen dramas, John Hughes managed to completely top himself relatively early in his career. The fact that so many movies in the modern era have used the basic template for their own plots is a true testament to its timelessness. Some were certainly better than others, but none will ever beat this generation-defining classic.",The Breakfast Club
157,luke-a-mcgowan,"Misses its own point, a sadly overrated experience",4,22 January 2016,"It had promise, but it wasted it all. The Breakfast Club is one of those movies that sound beautiful but when I watched it I found it undercooked in almost every way and then the ending was cloying, featured bipolar characters and went completely against the message it was trying to send.I'll give the film props for the five exceptional performances. Estevez and Ringwald inhabit their characters well, but the show is stolen completely by Anthony Michael Hall as Brian the Dork and Ally Sheedy as Allison the Basket Case. Judd Nelson is firmly in control of his character all times and is completely superb at all times. Whatever the characters need to do is handled superbly by the actors. John Hughes also provides key directorial choices, such as the character's lunches and how Hughes' characters completely ignore Brian because despite all their problems he is still the least popular. The dance scene in the film is delightful in isolation and there's something beautiful about watching the three boys in particular dance together.he Breakfast Club has a beautiful message that never gets across. I never bought any of the friendships because large portions of the plot felt rushed. It takes over an hour for the kids to even get on good terms. After that, there's some good stuff, but let me break down why The Breakfast Club craps the bed on its own message.It's meant to be a story about how five people with problems can become friends for one day. How are the relationships at the end of the film:Bender and Andrew: Bender antagonises Andrew several times and then this point is abandoned. Bender and Brian: The closest thing to a character arc is that Bender acknowledges Brian's existence. Bender and Claire: The romance with Claire is completely forced because just when they start to kindle positive words, he is horrible to her, then they kiss? It's like there are scenes missing. Bender and Allison: Nothing Andrew and Brian: Andrew is the first to be kind to Brian. There's a hint of something there when it's revealed that Andrew beat up one of Brian's type of kid. Then, nothing. Andrew and Claire: Nothing beyond a scene at the start where the two are established as the only two likely to interact. Andrew and Allison: He finds her very strange until she looks pretty on the outside. Then they kiss. -Brian and Claire: Probably the most underrated connection, she responds and says that its okay to be a virgin (as we later find out that she is as well), a huge deal from one of the most popular girls in school. Brian later finds the courage to tell her to shut up when she condescends him. However, this goodwill is all undone when she manipulates him with compliments into doing all of their detention essays for them. Rather than parting as equals, Brian ends up being the bottom of the barrel. Brian and Allison: The two most likely to interact with other members of the Breakfast Club, this is undone by chucking Allison into a romantic interest with the cool Andrew. -Allison and Claire: No interaction between the girls until Claire suddenly decides to make Allison look pretty. Honestly, I think she looked better before.The problem here is that all of the relationships are forced, counter-productive and harmful to each other. Rather than feeling touched, I came away feeling sour because now Brian is the fifth wheel for a pair of couples when the film had no business doing that. Brian is in a way the most important character of the film, and likely the one that many identify with the most. However, his character is completely left out in the cold because now we have two couples. Now instead of remembering the day - and Breakfast Club - fondly, both boys will just remember their respective girl. Honestly, I think Brian was better off without The Breakfast Club. I don't agree with a number of directorial and writing choices, notably the emotional manipulation of the audience who are supposed to feel something for Bender distracting Vern so the others can return safely to the library undetected. Are we meant to forget that they left to fetch weed (something I can't see Brian or Claire doing) and only at Bender's urging to begin with? Vern is used inconsistently throughout - he hears raised voices at the beginning of the film and yet cannot smell marijuana smoke or hear a person falling through a roof. His interactions with Bender are also inconsistent, with Bender suddenly affected by his insults even though they only marginally differ from what he's been saying before. Instead of its beautiful message, The Breakfast Club goes forward and imparts the following: Nerds get nothing in life. The Breakfast Club is about romance not friendship.Look pretty so boys will like you. Weed makes everything better.",The Breakfast Club
158,jonathanruano,Breakfast Club,7,22 August 2016,"""The Breakfast Club"" is simply a story about a few teenagers who spend a whole day in detention and talk to each other. The beginning of the movie struck me as a bit ordinary, because I felt that these students embodied caricatures of the prom queen, the jock, the nerd, the goth girl, and the rebel without a cause rather than three dimensional human beings. At the early stages of the film, only Judd Nelson was able to inject new life with a fresh performance as a troubled, aggressive young man with so much anger building up inside him and occasionally rising to this surface. Yet as the film entered its second act, a strange thing happened to me. I found myself becoming absorbed in the lives of all its young characters. These students, away from the teacher's glare, were sharing their deep personal pain and this was fascinating to watch. Lastly the final act was really a metaphor for healing as these young people consoled and healed each other with love. This psychological portrait not only makes for very good entertainment, but is quite touching. So while ""The Breakfast Club"" is not without its weaknesses, I recommend this film particularly for its second and third acts.",The Breakfast Club

The Breakfast Club presents different walks of adolescent life in such a way that it respects its subject matter and is not disrespectful toward teenagers or adult authority. Hughes cares about each of his characters and presents his film in an original method. Original and insightful, with a large cult following that it deserves. The only flaws are a bit too much melodrama and some unrealistic dance scenes. Overall, a worthwhile Hughes film with a wholly original craft.",The Breakfast Club
161,theinaniloquent,"""Five strangers with nothing in common, except each other""",10,6 May 2012,"I'm finally reviewing one of my favorite films, The Breakfast Club. Now I've always been a fan of John Hughes films. He has created heartwarming teenage-comedies that are fortunately not really teenage at all, and it actually hits you without being contrived. So the story starts when I got done finished Ferris Bueller's Day Off. I liked the movie, but found it a bit overrated. So I started researching more of Hughes movies, finding out that the fan favorite was Breakfast Club. I started to watch it, and when it finally finished, I didn't really like it at all. I was only ten at the time, and I'm sure that comes into the equation, but the movie didn't come off as it was all cracked up to be. The characters were so stereotypical it was painful, and when I was ten I found it to be completely boring as most of the film is dialog-heavy. So I passed the film off all these years, looking back and saying I would give it another chance, but never really happened. Yesterday night, I saw it playing on HBO. This was the perfect chance, as I was in the mood for a movie and there was nothing really else to do. So I watched it.. And here's the truth:It became one of my favorite films. I finally realized the characters were set up to be stereotypical because, by the end, you realize that each of these characters are hiding something. And that was really nice. The movie never even came across boring because the dialog was real and sometimes even a bit funny. You're never even going to think of it being boring, it was possibly one of the greatest dialog-heavy movies ever. And then the message contained was seriously grateful and miraculous. And the acting was really great. My favorite scene is where the group sits in a circle, and tells each other how they got into detention. It became one of my favorite scenes in cinematic history. It was real, truthful, and uplifting. I recommend this film for all people looking for something new and different. If you can't take more than five minutes of dialog, this film will bore you to death. But this movie always reserves itself a special place in my heart while watching it. It is a classic 80's film that dismembers clichés and then becomes one of the greatest films of all time. 10/10.",The Breakfast Club
162,antagonist117,"""The Breakfast Club"" should have won an armful of Oscars, but the Academy failed to see it for the triumph it was",8,18 November 2014,"The brilliance of ""The Breakfast Club"" is largely lost on those who think of it as a teen movie about high school archetypes. It's not a movie about a rebel, a princess, a jock, a freak, and a nerd; there are no such people. It is, apologetically, a high-concept play about people trapped in a room until they realize that their similarities are greater than their differences. It rips up Moliere—literally—and adorns itself with the clothes and music and fresh faces of the era's key movie-going demographic, but preserves the close character work, human insight, and polished bon mots of a ""serious"" work for stuffy theater-goers. Among the people who didn't notice the script's incredible energy and sophistication were the voters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who failed to nominate the script for Best Original Screenplay though it is worthy of favorable comparison with the likes of ""12 Angry Men"" and Jean-Paul Sartre's ""No Exit."" Similarly, the Academy failed to recognize the accomplishment of Ally Sheedy, who completely transformed herself from the sunny girlfriend of ""WarGames"" (1983) into the impish, shocking, hilarious Allison of ""The Breakfast Club."" Audiences focused more on Molly Ringwold's girl-next-door appeal, but she is slightly miscast as an alpha female and her screen presence pales next to Sheedy's show-stealing talent. Perhaps most damning of the Academy's ability to recognize quality when it comes in the guise of a popcorn movie is the lack of an acting nomination for Judd Nelson, who shows incredible range and depth as Bender. Nelson underplays and overplays in exactly the right places as Bender's determination to speak painful truths drives the film and sets off chain reactions within the ensemble. More snubs at Oscar time included the film's tense, cerebral score, and the songs that make up its now-iconic soundtrack of 80s pop picked to play during the beginning, end, and the choreographed montages that break what could be a one-act play into a traditional three-part structure. Some might criticize the montages for being silly, dated, and disconnected from the plot, and they would be right, but the segments are fun and they let each character reveal his or her nature in a non-verbal context by the particular way that they dance on banisters and slide down hallways. The only really indefensible missteps in ""The Breakfast Club"" come near the end, and the timing sours the experience. The makeover scene is hokey and regressive, a too-easy climax that was perhaps meant to suggest the mutability of image and the multiplicity of the individual, but that comes across as a defense of conformity. A related impulse to pair the characters off is unearned in at least one case and arguably both. The Anthony Michael Hall character's arc is too derivative of Billy Bibbit's in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" though the stakes are already high enough without being raised to life and death. After all, the really interesting question presented by the film is not whether these kids will live, but how they will live. That said, ""The Breakfast Club"" is not the only work of genius to botch an ending. Oscar voters, like Assistant Principle Vernon, saw only what they wanted to see and missed the chance to enshrine it in the canon. Popular opinion and critical consensus have been less blind.",The Breakfast Club

165,kingofdanerds,I am so glad that I watched this film as a high school senior (no sooner and no later),10,30 October 2020,"For years I have been wanting to watch the 1985 film The Breakfast Club because I heard it was a good film. Of course, I could never find a good time to watch it and it was not until fairly recently that I watched this film for the first time. The Breakfast Club is a 1985 film by John Hughes who has done films from Weird Science to Pretty in Pink. The film stars Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall, and Ally Sheady. This is considered to be a Brat Pack film. Brat Pack films are basically films that starred the aforementioned people and with the inclusion of Rob Lowe and others. The film was a success with critics, audiences, and even the box office and has since been labeled as the best coming of age comedy of all time and has even been selected for preservation by the Library of Congress.The film follows a group of high school kids. You have the jock (played by Emilio Estevez), you have the princess (played by Molly Ringwald), you have the nerd (played by Anthony Michael Hall), you have the rebel (played by Judd Nelson), and you have the basket case (played by Ally Sheady). All of them are in Saturday detention for a reason. They do not know each other but they will soon learn more about each other and most importantly, learn more about themselves.Wow. Just....... wow. This film...... it's......... Let's just say that I am soooooo glad that I watched this film as a high school senior because I do not think that the film would have hit me like it did had I watched it years ago or years ahead. This film is so relevant to me. It is very powerful and I did not want it to end. While the characters are basically these sterotypes, we learn that they are more than those sterotypes. We see that while none of these people have anything in common on the outside, we see that they do in fact have much more in common. That being the struggles they face and the expectations that they have to meet. All of the actors/actresses give amazing performances and very powerful ones too. The characters are all very releateable due to their common struggle. I myself am not a jock (I find myself being more like Anthony Michael Hall) but I still relate with the jock as much as the other characters. Throw in the power hungry Principle who is a perfect representation of a majority of the adults in the world. The film has a way of having fairly serious moments being separated by comedic scenes which are really fun. I absolutely love it! The comedic scenes are fairly iconic and are often parodied in all sorts of media. The soundtrack is awesome here is well.Breakfast Club was a truly powerful film that has some great themes about struggling to be understood and sterotypes. Much like the characters in the film, I think I learned a lot about myself by watching this film. Again, had I watched this film earlier or years later, the film would not have the same effect. I think this is one of the best films that I have ever watched in my entire life. I also believe that this is a must watch for high school seniors. If you have not watched this film, it is time that you have watched this film. You will not regret it.",The Breakfast Club

167,RhapsodyReviews,"Feel Good, Realistic Film.",9,8 September 2019,"Review:
'The Breakfast Club' is an American comedy-drama film written, produced, and directed by John Hughes. I've seen this movie more times than I can count. I just love it so much, mostly because it's so relatable to me. We all remember being a teenager. A crazy, intense time when your highs were higher and your lows were lower, and every experience was that much more significant. This movie really captured what high school is like no matter what year you attend.
The movie starts with five teenagers getting dropped off at school for detention on a Saturday. None are well known to each other, and even start off with not liking each other's different personalities. As the day goes on it seems like one kid, Bender (Judd Nelson) starts to push the others out of their comfort zones and seeing who they really are. See if they're all more than just a ""criminal"", a ""jock"", a ""princess"", a ""nerd"", and a ""basket case"".
This is definitely an 80's film in all aspects, including the acting. I try hard to not judge acting when it comes from the 80's and prior because we just live in a different world now. I will say though, that the acting from this ensemble is equal all throughout, nobody was a true standout good or bad, and that's refreshing to see. I think everybody did a killer job for the decade it was released.
What I like the most about this movie, other than the entire concept of the movie itself, must be how relatable it is. I was in detention a lot as kid and when I was with a group we always messed around and made it more difficult for the teachers because we all thought life was hardest for us. Its how kids are, and this movie expressed that in a way that my generation and even generations to come will still relate to. After re-watching this movie over and over I thought I would notice some things that stand out in a not so good way, but the whole movie has a solid story and was executed smartly. I will say however that the acting is subpar, even for an 80's film. It's not bad by any means, but there are times throughout where it seems like they knew they weren't going to get the right take, so they just kept one they weren't' happy with.
Overall, I strongly believe that everybody will find something to love with this movie and I strongly recommend it if you haven't seen it. If you haven't seen in it a long time, give it a watch again to remind yourself of how amazing it is.

168,PCT1970,Wake Up To The Brilliance of Hughes,9,5 May 2019,"I'm perplexed by this film being panned by so many. I'm going to give a brief background on Hughes, scenarios that came to mind regarding the negative feedback and then a brief analysis of the film. Hughes was one of the most influential writers / directors of his time. He was the master in the coming of age dramedy genre. His films were often referred to as, that's a John Hughes film. The title wasn't necessary. That's influence. This is my opinion and that's why I never suggest or not suggest that a reader 'Must See' a film. I leave it up to the reader. Who I am do decide whether a person watch a film or not. That's being somewhat narcissistic. That's a stereotype. This applies even when I feel a bravura film has been created. There are many scenarios I thought of which could explain the negative reviews . I'll list three. 1) The viewer lacks cognition, intelligence or wait I've got it a lack of a brain 2) The viewer doesn't enjoy the genre, therefor shouldn't have watched the film and shouldn't deprive others of enjoyment by declaring 'Don't Watch It'. 3) The viewer lacks self esteem, seeks attention and blasts out a brief review with no analysis in order to be the center of attention. That viewer has been stereotyped and could have been a character in ""The Breakfast Club"". Get it? I'm not trying to be insulting. I'm trying to convey my opinion with humor and straightforwardness much like Hughes did in his films. This film has resonated with viewers for over three decades so I can't think of a legitimate reason why a Gen-X (that's me) or any other generation can't relate to this film. The stereotyping in this film, unfortunately still occurs to this day. I participated in an actual Breakfast Club every Sunday morning which included a stoner, a jock, a delinquent (that's me again), a nerd and so on. The point is this film changed our philosophy and all were welcome. Now that's influence! I'm not going to go into a thorough examination of the film as it's message is laid out flat in your face, which Hughes was liable to do, and would be an insult to the intelligence. It doesn't take a Tesla-minded person to figure out the film's theme. There's another stereotype for you. The film. Five completely different individuals are forced to spend an entire Saturday together in a library due to detention. Were it not for that, these five wouldn't have blinked an eye at each other in the hallways for fear of association. The five are assigned an essay by Principle Vernon to describe who they are. Vernon is a biased and jaded character. One of the five, Bender, gives a blazing speech imitating what life at home must be like for each of the characters. This ignites a spark which causes the five to start thinking. They spend the day together hoodwinking Vernon and enjoying each other's company. The five eventually open up to each other, learn about each other, realize they all have similarities and forge a bond. At the end of the day they go their separate ways which is ambiguous and leave a single essay for Vernon. Vernon reads the essay which is narrated to the viewer by all five. It sums up the entire movie in a straightforward manner. The narration follows, "" Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever we did wrong. But we think your crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see us. In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each of us is a brain and an athlete and a basket case and a princess and a criminal. Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, The Breakfast Club."" This viewer imagines the five continuing to be friends even in the hallways of high school. This is a rare film that can make a real life change. It is sublime, virtuous, timeless and is Hughes' best coming of age dramedies and one of the most significant in it's genre, if not the greatest of all time. This review is my opinion which is what a review is essentially. Sincerely yours, a member of The Breakfast Club.",The Breakfast Club
169,Gideon24,John Hughes' Classic Tale of Teen Angst,8,4 March 2015,"Writer-director John Hughes continued his foray into teen angst comedy with the 1985 winner The Breakfast Club, a warm and winning look at five high school students trapped together in detention on a Saturday. We watch as these students get to know each other and eventually bond because during regular school hours, they pretty much navigate in separate orbits.Hughes' cinematic muse, Molly Ringwald plays Claire, a spoiled and popular princess who is in detention because she ditched class to go shopping. Claire spends the majority of detention fighting an attraction to John Bender (Judd Nelson), a thug who spends every Saturday in detention. Emilio Estevez plays Andy, a jock with father issues and Anthony Michael Hall plays Brian, a straight-A geek who seems to think being in detention is kind of cool. Ally Sheedy completes the quintet as Allison, a space cadet whose reason for being in detention is the funniest of them all.Despite a sort of music video directorial approach, Hughes screenplay compliments as we get to watch a bonding between these students occur, but not too quickly and pretty realistically.The performances are first rate, with standout work from Nelson and Hall. Mention should also be made of Paul Gleason, appropriately slimy as Mr. Vernon, the teacher supervising detention, who apparently has his own issues.This film was a box office smash and was pretty much an instant classic upon release. Teen angst has rarely been this much fun.",The Breakfast Club
170,patrick_dunne,Classic 80's teen movie by John Hughes. The Breakfast Club appeals to almost every body in its target audience,8,15 January 2006,"The Breakfast Club is a movie that most teens hold deep inside their hearts. Why? Simple. The Breakfast Club deals with some problems teens hold within themselves: Insecurity, hormones, trouble with parents, trying to be popular, bullies, etc. This allows the target audience to relate to it very well. The Breakfast Club takes these problems and sets them in each and every one of our characters. Andy Clark is a jock dealing with parents. Brian Johnson is a nerd dealing with bullies. John Bender is one of those bullies who spend every weekend in detention. Clare is an insecure girl trying to be popular. Allison she's just weird. (She has a sandwich with sugar from pixie sticks and Captain Crunch cereal. Yum.) These five students unite during one detention; each one of them did something wrong or broke a rule. This is how the film starts out. John Bender (the bully) starts up a conversation, and pretty soon secrets are revealed, and character development takes place. That is pretty much what happens during one day in detention.This movie is not only a well-made drama, but also makes a decent comedy. This film, of course is by John Hughes, who has made many comedies, such as Home Alone, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation and Planes, Trains & Automobiles. There are many scenes of humor. One of them is when the principal emerges quickly from the bathroom and tells the students: ""I will not be made a fool of"" and leaves with some toilet paper hanging from the back of his pants. So much for not being a fool.The Breakfast Club isn't complex or too inventive: It's just a drama made for teens; a drama with acting, comedy and fair realism; a drama that you will love, especially if you're a teenager.In short: The Breakfast Club's target audience is teenagers, and works well for them. Ask any teenager who has seen this movie, and they will most likely tell you that they love it. (Well, probably) Note: The film doesn't deserve the R rating. It's rated R for language, but the characters don't cuss as much as they would nowadays. They just use a couple of ""hells"" and ""damns."" Well, that goes for the version I saw on AMC.9/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",The Breakfast Club
171,maximkong,Another Timeless Movie - If only such a Club Existed,9,25 November 2012,"A good classic that expresses well about young people and how they live through their lives. Another great film that can relate well to any youth that watches it. It has many whacky moments that all 80's films have but i am impressed with how matured the characters are when they opened serious discussions that even friends nowadays tend to avoid. Although the movie is very old, the issues being brought up are timeless and the message conveyed here is very powerful. If all school kids watch this film and learn from these lessons, differences between people can be resolved, boundaries can be broken, and the world (starting from school level) will be a much friendlier place with lessor pretense.",The Breakfast Club
172,jdollak,Life lesson you already knew,6,10 February 2007,"A group of high school students band together during their Saturday detention and learn about each other, and come to some very basic conclusions.While I used to enjoy this movie a whole lot more, I find that a lot of these John Hughes movies have lost their edge as I grew up. The drama of seeing Bender act out his home life is not shocking, it actually seems to be more like an annoying attention-getting device. The most enjoyable elements of the film are smaller things - seeing the purse dumped out, hearing Brian Johnson detail why he's in detention.... But the larger message of the movie is useless to most people who have finished high school, and come to the realization that the labels and social cliques are meaningless and a poor way to arrange life. That's not to say that the film isn't fun. It's just not really worth taking seriously.My favorite guilty pleasure - Emilio screaming and shattering the glass.",The Breakfast Club
173,imbluzclooby,"Ahhhh, it spoke to a generation....whatever.",6,13 May 2013,"I remember seeing Breakfast Club when it first came when I was in the 11th grade. Many people hail this as the quintessential Generation X flick of the 1980's. What was John Hughes up to? He obviously had this penchant for blaming authority figures for teenage angst and problems in society. If that was his primary goal he definitely espoused it in all his other films as well. I think there were moments in this film that had sheer poignance when spotting the inner sadness in its characters. Several of the characters go through a sort of transformation and epiphany of how they see themselves in relation to others. The shame, the isolation and despair can be seen especially in Ally Sheedy's character.My biggest peeve about this movie is how it treats the characters and boxes them into these oversimplified stereotypes. If John Hughes wants to explore individualism and self-identity wouldn't he want to focus on how these stereotypes are often based on preconceived notions by others in that teenagers are more complex than he presents them? But the movie uses these stereotypes and wants to embroil them in a milieu to exploit discomfort as if this were one of those EST seminars for youngsters. Why can't a prom queen be a braniac as well as a popular social butterfly? Why can't a brainiac be a jock? Why can't a jock be a rebellious troublemaker? And why can't the oddball Goth-chick be a rebel as well? The movie intends to show very different characters in how they are all alike. But they aren't. In the beginning to the end they are still masked in their confined personas.I was also turned off by how the prom queen decided to make a pass toward the sullen Bender character after all that transpired between them. This was cinematic manipulation by making viewers believe that an insolent wild child can get the girl of any guy's dreams. What was even more disturbing is that he stated his intention to her that he wanted to be used to upset her uppity parents. It seems very out of character for her to suddenly just kiss him and offer him her diamond earring. Someothing tells me that this was a subtle way of displaying role reversals. The girl gives a guy a diamond earring instead of the reverse. The bender character, who is the strongest character doesn't change at all. He is still the hapless jerk he was from the beginning. I thought the most interesting character was the principal. Having worked in education I can understand his frustrations. He saw an institution he built his whole life's work around to crumble in a world of anarchy, disorder and uncertainty.What we see here is a generational gap between the older generation and the kids of Generation X and how much has changed in such a short period of time. Breakfast Club does have a message even though the scenes are contrived such as the corny dance nuances and silly pranks, but that's to be accepted in High School comedies.But the problems in public education today are far more egregious and worrisome than Breakfast club can even begin to convey.",The Breakfast Club
174,dataconflossmoor,Mix Fixations With Detention And You Get Candor!!!,10,30 May 2007,"The cast in this movie is sensational!! It stars: Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, and Judd Nelson!! The nefarious escapades which took place at this typical north suburban high school in the Chicago area, garnered a fascination with the movie viewer in 1985!! What this movie accomplishes, is the homogenization of teenage attitudes and trepidations which formidably afflict all of these barely post pubic adolescents, at a firmly entrenched, grass roots level!! The plot focuses on a detention on a Saturday morning that all of these kids have to serve..The cross section of ""delinquents"" so to speak, include: The student, the athlete, the princess, the basket case, and the criminal!! The student, Anthony Michael Hall, is besieged with lofty assumptions concerning his predetermined success.. Why is this so bothersome? There is nothing above the grade A! The athlete, Emilio Estevez, (Just being related to a Sheen, makes him talented) is hounded by the quest for stellar accomplishments merely because he is suppose to be the ""ultimate man""! The princess, Molly Ringwald, (As synonymous with the 80's as Duran Duran and deficit spending) was the spoiled rich girl, her hang ups with being enormously popular, brought on a myriad of potentially fatal insecurities!! The basket case, Ally Sheedy, will do anything for attention, eventually, being sort of ""creepy"" has to lose the mystique that might be associated with it! Finally, the criminal, Judd Nelson, (""Suddenly Susan"") who had the largest role of any actor or actress in this movie, his character was one depicting a malcontent who was disgruntled with a capital D!!! The precarious camaraderie which all of them seem to share is the burden of identity displacement The question all of them are pondering is: How did everyone get to be like everybody else? Watch the movie, and you will know what I am talking about! I found this movie to have an appropriately intense dialog!! The concise delivery on many of the crucial points that this film purported were totally convincing!! The poignant portrayal of the supercilious social perspectives, which pertained to these five teenagers, for this movie, were astutely formatted with an acrimoniously succinct realism! Also, the only aspects that delved into the obtuse with ""The Breakfast Club"" were deliberate!!! The movie depicted an extremity of candid feelings that evoked a bevy of demonstrative inhibitions by all of the characters in this film! Their fervor was effective, not to mention, absolutely phenomenal in terms of their feasibility!! ""The Breakfast Club"" is considered to be a 1980's classic! This film signified a radical shift in material priorities from the Woodstock era! High School kids were different, however, they were no less complex! One of the biggest problems which these high school kids are faced with is that they have to listen to each other, because, by and large, nobody in the outside world, really listens to them!! Unrealistic expectations were the culprit to emotional dissatisfaction with all five teenagers' societal plight!! ""Breakfast Club"" was a proverbial instance of whereby a dash of powerful and esoteric philosophies about adolescent attitudes did, indeed, go a long way. The positive identification with the 1980's is ubiquitous in this film. Every decade has a unique cultural mindset, ""Breakfast Club"" contributed to the trademark of 80's idealism. It is always enlightening when the comprehension of another individual is impetuous, as well as successfully humanistic while evaluating someone's tertiary responses. When these five teenagers served a detention on a Saturday morning, they wound up becoming the recipients of an auspicious life lesson! I would have to say that I like ""Breakfast Club"" better every time I see it! Amongst all of the other attributes it possesses, ""The Breakfast Club"" is extraordinarily funny! Best line in the movie: Judd Nelson says to Molly Ringwald ""You won't let a guy stick his tongue down your throat, but you can eat sushi!"" Remarkable movie!! PLEASE SEE THIS FILM!!",The Breakfast Club
175,jrfranklin01,Who Would've Thought...,9,3 November 2004,"There have been countless great stories told over time, so much so it's a wonder where directors get original ideas anymore. If someone told me now (much less back in 1985) that making a movie about five teenagers spending a Saturday in detention was going to top the charts, I wouldn't have believed them. But I'd be wrong, as that is exactly what ""The Breakfast Club"" did/does. This film leaves an immortal quality with it because it's so archetypal or universal. It shows use the insides of a group of teenagers who might, on the surface, appear totally different from one another but realize they are more alike than they ever could imagine. The brilliance in the film is in introducing five characters together, watching the hostilities/personas flare, and then seeing the stereotypes fade away as the ""delinquents"" begin to bond. All of this transpires during an era (the 80's) that seemed to leave its own legacy, producing ""The Breakfast Club"" in its wake. And childhood stars back then went on to become greater things: Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall (reminds me of my brother), and Ally Sheedy. Obviously, much of this cast needs no introduction and in seeing ""The Breakfast Club"" it's obvious how talented they were, especially Ringwald and Hall who were 17 at the time. It's sort of strange how in most films or television series they use older actors to play younger roles. Seeing Judd Nelson stomp around and act like a seventeen or eighteen old when he was really twenty-six at the time is hilarious in retrospect. It's makes Ringwald and Hall's performances all the more miraculous in being able to deliver the goods at such a young age (but then again maybe they were just acting like themselves at the time).I really can't give any part of the movie away to readers. But my belabored emphasis is because it's so good. It takes everything that makes a teenager a teenager (all the pastimes, rights of passage, peer pressure, and acting cool) and bottles it all up and shakes it around. Out come the pieces of five individuals who spend the day together and realize more about life (and themselves) than probably most people do. 9/10!",The Breakfast Club

And this film is about how the most ordinary and banal of occurrences - being a virgin, failing a project, hating your parents, stupid jock pranks - can all seem so earth-shattering to the people they affect.This film should not be taken too seriously. It's mostly tongue-in-cheek, the dialogue is often purposefully overly cheezy, the characters are all stereotypes and aren't too deep. Even the teacher is an overdone caricature. But it all works. And the greatest part is that this film isn't dated at all...well, aside from the evil hair-styles and horrid 80s music (couldn't they have used *good* 80s pop?? I wish I *could* forget about the Simple Minds!!)Some of it is *too* cheezy..the horrid synth music that rises to a predictable crescendo whenever something dramatic happens being a good example. The silly make-over (which ends up uglifying Ally Sheedy...she looked *way* cuter in her reject' form) and odd pairing of Sheedy and Estevez (where did *that* come from? All of a sudden. no prior hints, they're madly in love?? At least with Molly vs. Nelson you could see them eyeing each other and flirting all throughout the film... (-sigh- the nerds never get the girl...;)Anyhow, that aside, many of the lines are still memorable (Does Barry Manilow know you have his wardrobe?', How DOES one become a janitor?', No sir, because it's in Johnson's underwear...') And a lot of the quotes here have been used or referred to in many recent films (eg: Go). This film has a cool-factor of ten! It's hilarious, the interplay between characters is great, and even the cheezy parts are fun! The simple fact is that any aspect of this film that is groanable is smothered by all of the better aspects. And c'mon, being a high school teen is filled with cheeze anyhow, so it all fits in the greater scheme of things;)Overall: great direction, sharp dialogue, great acting (this was Judd Nelson's *best* role ever! And he carries this film as well...the other characters support him). Okay, so Emilio got the girl, so Judd Nelson pumped his fist in the air like a moron (hey, if *I* got to kiss Molly Ringwald, I'd be pumping my fist like a moron, too!!) This film is pure amusement, and behind it all we can nod our heads and say: yeah, this is what it was like! The pressures of being a teenager...life really could suck sometimes. And even though in retrospect it seem so silly, sometimes it's okay for the boring and trivial to be of earth-shattering importance...Take this film for what it is: a fun watch and a handbook to being a teenager, stereotypical or not.

It was one of the few films I like that didn't have constant action, but a clever interplay between stereotypes of my day.It's interesting now, at 28, I watched this movie again and it seems like a whiney typical American movie.  In a way a bit like the characters that appear on the Jerry Springer show.  People who try to blame their lack of successful on everything but themselves.The other thing I notice now is the obsession society has with young people. This generation of, lets be honest, pretty naive selfish people have a ridiculous amount of time and consideration devoted to them considering they're in the minority.Anyway a great theme song and an excellent movie at the age I was when I saw it.

The reason this one in particular is up there with the likes of 16 Candles, Weird Science, and Say Anything (by the way, I'm aware that Say Anything was not a Brat Pack movie) is because it shows that those perceived as one type of person are really just trying to find their real self... that's the basis of this movie: finding oneself.I know I said that this was a drama, but all great dramas have humor in them... this is one of them.Everybody has their favorite scene or line.

Will we still be friends?"" That questions causes Bender to shellshock Claire with a loud, ""As far as you and I ever walking down the hall together, you can forget about it!""

183,rmirchandani,A hilarious and terrifically cast high school movie that brings back memories!,9,21 September 2018,"The Breakfast Club is easily one of the best movies released during the 1980s. It beautifully captures the perks and downsides (mostly) of student's lives outside of high school. Even though, the movie was only set in a contained environment aka school, the teenagers who were in detention talked about their experiences at home. These teenagers were categorized as a princess, an athlete, a criminal, a brainy and a basket case (recluse). They were all forced to attend detention and sacrifice their Saturday. Out of all the characters I resemble myself the most with Allison aka the basket case.As someone who has never lived in the United States or went to an American school, it was extremely interesting and intriguing to see how American schools operate and what kind of regulations they have. When I went to high school (which is not that long ago) there was detention, but not on Saturdays. Of course some aspects of the movie are over exaggerated, but what high school movie isn't. Even today, these kinds of movies are over exaggerated and are made more appealing to the public. The writing and acting was surprisingly well done. From such young actors (at that time) I did not expect such a terrific performance. Molly Ringwald was amazing and stunning. She was without a doubt the star of the movie. Actually all of the actors exceeded my expectations and made me laugh. The Breakfast Club was an absolute delight to watch. It is so interesting to watch it now in 2018 and think about how life must have been 33 years ago. How the characters dressed in the movie is so different to how they dress now. I wish that I had a time machine and watch this movie in 1985 when it was first released and see people's reactions back then. That would be amazing.",The Breakfast Club
184,schroederagustavo,The Breakfast Club Review,8,17 May 2020,"Quite possibly the most 80's movie ever, the Breakfast Club is funny, witty, original and still very relevant and worth watching. In some aspects the movie's age shows, particularly in just how outrageously 80's it is, some of the jokes and references the film makes don't really hit as hard today as I'm sure they did 35 years ago. However, I do think in general this film will probably be a classic forever because the themes it handles, growing up, being sort of an outcast in high school, being popular, peer pressure. Like, no matter what group you ""belong to"" in school, this movie speaks to all of us. And even past school, I think the movie has some really cool things to think about, like how the principal think the kids have changed, buy maybe it's him that's changed, will we become like our parents? Is it inevitable? Regardless of the 80's things that may not have aged very well, such as the Barry Manilow joke, the whole weed thing (weed is mostly cool in 2020 I think and it most definitely doesn't make you do flips and scream and break a window, I think they were thinking, yeah crack, PCP, weed, it's all the same when they made the film), the outfits, etc. But the core themes are relevant today and I think will be for a very long time.",The Breakfast Club
185,lucasversantvoort,When Hughes still knew what he was doing,7,6 May 2015,"Ahh, The Breakfast Club. As I'm sure many will agree, watching this in your teens is a pretty interesting experience as few films you watch at that age deal with high school life and all its pressures with a lot of empathy. Because I saw it as a teen and liked it, I have a lot of strong, positive feelings toward it. Though as time goes on and because of the generational gap, you start to dislike certain things with some scenes becoming pretty cringe worthy. But it probably resides at the top of the mountain of films in this particular category.Right off the bat, we're introduced to our merry band of misfits: Andrew (Emilio Estevez), the athlete; Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), the brain; Claire, the princess (Molly Ringwald); Bender (Judd Nelson), the criminal and Allison (Ally Sheedy), the basket case. They have only one thing in common: they've all in their own way broken the school's rules and must spend the entire Saturday afternoon in the school library and write an essay on 'who they think they are', basically reflecting on their misbehavior. This essay is assigned to them by tough-as-nails assistant principal Richard Vernon, who symbolizes the 'villain' of this film, the school system and society in general (the parents, etc.) who are unable to invest the time and effort required to truly communicate with these children. As time goes on, our five characters begin to communicate and grow closer through a combination of humor and confrontational dialogue through which they all start to see each other not as their stereotype, but as a complex person and they realize they're not so different after all.This might sound horribly clichéd, but there are a couple of things to keep in mind: one, with The Breakfast Club, director/writer John Hughes basically popularized this type of film aimed squarely at teenagers and quickly became known as the voice of the teens who felt deeply misunderstood by everyone around them. (Hughes would expand on this theme with Pretty in Pink and Ferris Bueller's Day Off.) In other words, you can't simply judge this film with the mindset of today's world. On the other hand, as exemplified by the film's continued success, the film has attained a timeless quality. It's empathy for high school students with all its associated pressures has remained popular and thus relevant, even today. Two, what's crucial to this film's success are the actors. It's not often a film features mainly a group of actors the age of students who never act in a way that feels cheap or unrealistic. Despite any grievances one might have with Hughes' screenplay, the cast delivers it honestly from beginning to end. Also, there's the quite realistic way the group starts to communicateever so slowly. They don't start talking immediately, but remain silent at first, get bored, start picking on each other, etc. All these little interactions contribute to the end of the film when they're openly talking about and confronting each other with their thoughts, fears, doubts, lifestyles, etc.Going back to the grievances with the screenplay, there are a few things that have aged about as well as Hughes' career: for one thing, the film exudes the 80s out of its every pore, for better or worse. Seen today, it's likely some people would find the inclusion of a montage clip with rock music to be unnecessary and over-the-top. There's also the character of Vernon who exudes so much anger and has it in for these kids in such a way that it becomes hard to really take him seriously. He's the one-note adult who symbolizes all adults that fail to take these kids seriously and listen to them.Also, Hughes' comedy occasionally falls flat and feels inauthentic for a film claiming to speak for misunderstood teens. The scene where Andrew comes walking out of a room as high as a kite and starts to run around, 'raging against the machine' as it were, until he breaks a glass pane with his screams, all backed up by 80s rock feels clichéd nowadays despite its honest attempt at instilling the same, heartfelt enthusiasm in the viewer. There are a few scenes where the comedy is played solely for laughs and doesn't feel real, for instance the one where the group falls asleep and Vernon walks in, telling them to wake up. They of course remain fast asleep that is until Vernon asks who has to go to the bathroom upon which they all quickly – and in unison – raise their arms. It's this type of humor that in retrospect signals the trash Hughes would eventually write for films like Home Alone 3.But in the end, the good way outstrips the bad. With its cross-generational appeal, positive message and great acting, it's easy to see why this film has remained – and most likely will remain – so popular and appealing. When, despite the 80s clichés, your film still remains popular with teens even today, you know you've done something right.",The Breakfast Club
186,yongkang-27205,Quirky and unique ragtag team,7,31 August 2020,"This film on the surface definitely constitutes as one of those mindless things you watch and forget. The plot seems fairly monotonous throughout.However, I must say that yet at the same time, there is a certain attractiveness to its monotony. I had a couple good laughs out of this film. With the film dabbling a little into the drama that quite a few teens these days might face, it all seemed to fit together quite nicely. Whilst the characters all seems to be unrelated whatsoever, John Hughes still managed to piece the stories of the people together to form quite a wonderful piece.All in all, another typical teen movie from the 80's. However, if you watch the film with no expectations, you'll be in for a surprise.",The Breakfast Club

A ""Brain, a, jock, a rebel, a beauty, ad a recluse.

It was easy to tell the rebel and the jock but I thought Alley Sheedy was the beauty, Molly Ringwald was the brain, and Anthony Michael Hall was the recluse.

Bringing together a gang of his regular favourites to play each of those stereotyped characters who fill all his classic teen movies, Hughes shows the horrible, cliquey, competitive us-against-them culture permeating American schoolkids, school systems, and by extension society as a whole. This masterpiece has everything from hilarious slapstick to terribly moving anguish, without ever straying outside the narrow confines of a few rooms and corridors and a handful of characters. Anyone who hasn't already seen it really should give it a go, and if US schools are still like this after all Hughes has done to portray them as breeding grounds of unhappiness, something really should be done.",The Breakfast Club
189,kylehodgdon,Timeless Film With Many Classic Moments,8,22 January 2010,"""The Breakfast Club"" is an extremely fun movie that makes me smile to just think about it. I remember the first time I saw it, I did not know what to think going into a film entitled ""The Breakfast Club"", but I was very satisfied once it got rolling along.It is cool to see all of the different types of high school groups represented and to see them interact in a Saturday detention. Throughout the film they all slowly realized that despite the very noticeable differences on the outside, the all have a lot in common on the inside.I don't feel that this movie is outdated. High school life really breaks kids up into different groups like this, but when you get down to it and the groups disappear the different seeming individuals can coexist nicely.This movie is filled with many classic scenes, but, of course, the best scene is the final one with the bully character walking through the football field while ""Don't You Forget About Me"" plays loudly. Everyone who has seen this movie will always associate that song with it.",The Breakfast Club
190,KeremUlucay,A CLASSIC,7,22 January 2019,"Everyone compromises that The Breakfast Club has and its own atmosphere and ideas to tell. Movie has well written characters, especially John Bender. At the beginning of the movie, he is so complicated and incomprehensible. But when he explains his family, everything becomes more meaningful. Also every character has some specific traits and conditions. In the same time, every one of them is a teenager. That is what makes this movie a classic. But if I must clear, The Breakfast Club is not so successful about what it wants to tell.",The Breakfast Club
191,jbartelone,"The Greatest ""High School"" Film of All Time!",9,26 January 2007,"The Breakfast Club is an emotional powerhouse of high school life! Five people from many different diverse backgrounds are forced to share a Saturday detention together. After almost nine hours, they bare their souls to each other and actually become friends. (Well, to varying degrees.) This is a movie that you feel, because it portrays the ""cliques"" characters associated with high school life with such passion and power that you the viewer believe after watching this unforgettable film that you have known these people all your life! The Breakfast Club IS Andy, Claire, Brian, Alison, and John.The late Paul Gleason is chillingly realistic as the principle and disciplinarian. The tension that exists in his many verbal confrontations with John Bender (the most troubled and rebellious) is so dramatic, and captivating that it represents some of the finest moments that you will ever see in a movie! These kids and Mr. Gleason should have won Oscars for their performances because they were all THAT good! One may wonder, why haven't I rated this gem a full perfect 10/10? The Breakfast Club is SOOOOOOO good on so many levels that it hurts to find flaws with it, but here goes:1.) Carl The Janitor: The one guy that just doesn't work in this otherwise landmark film. He doesn't seem to have all that much to say except react differently to how Mr. Vernon and he feel about kids. It's not like he's a bad guy to have in the movie, just unnecessary. Bender makes a few snide remarks about him, and than we have a few lines of dialog when he and Vernon are in Vernon's office, and that's it. It's like Hughes said, ""Well, the setting is a Saturday School detention, so we can throw in a janitor."" He simply didn't need to be there and did practically nothing for plot or character development.2.) SPOILER! Bender being nice to Claire at the end: NO!!! NO!!!! Sorry!!! I don't buy it!The movie builds up with such friction where it is the worst between Mr. Vernon and John Bender. (Two people that would want to KILL one another because they hate each other so much.) Second worst friction is Bender's thoughtless and vindictive comments to Claire throughout the film. Remember this gem: Bender: (To Claire) ""Don't you EVER TALK ABOUT MY FRIENDS!!! YOU DON'T KNOW ANY OF MY FRIENDS, YOU DON'T LOOK AT ANY OF MY FRIENDS, AND YOU CERTAINLY WOULDN'T STOOP SO LOW AS TO SPEAK TO ANY OF MY FRIENDS!!!! AS FAR AS YOU AND I WAKING DOWN THE HALL TOGETHER YOU CAN FORGET IT!!!!! CUZ IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN!!! JUST GO BURY YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND, AND WAIT FOR YOUR F***ING PROM!!!""Claire: (Crying and sobbing) ""I hate you, you know!"" Bender: ""Yea??? GOOD!!!!!"" But toward the end of the film, we see Claire GIVING John one of her earrings and a goodbye kiss!!!???? Are you kidding me??!! Than he tries to initiate closer contact but she stops him. I can't believe that they would do that. He'd walk up to her, give Claire and extended middle finger and spit in her face. That IS John Bender. Some of the physical make-overs seem to reflect the writers/or directors beliefs that emotional personalities can change when a woman changes her appearance with make-up and lipstick. Hughes take a too-easy and simple way out here. Let's make John nice to Claire so that we can have at least two of the group give us this, ""And some lived happily ever after."" This movie would be a perfect 10 if Claire and John would have hated each other throughout. At least take out the exchange of the earring for a kiss. It brings down the whole friction and tension that existed so well between these two characters.I also believe that you need to be 40 or under to see The Breakfast Club and experience its most dramatic effects and inner-messages about group cliques and high school life. Adults older than that may not care enough about the characters the way the 70's-80's generation does. For people in that 70-80's cohort, many LIVED THE LIVES of these kids. Be 40 or below and take yourself back to many changing times and difficulties associated with high-school acceptance. If you can empathize with the 40 and under age, or couldn't fit in at your high school other than already established social cliques, this is a shattering and powerful movie that will never be forgotten.Score 9/10",The Breakfast Club
192,IrisNo11,A Classic Teen Movie,10,21 August 1999,"Teen movies such as ""Can't Hardly Wait"", ""Cruel Intentions"", and ""She's All That"" are bigger than ever thanks to stars such as Rachel Leigh Cook, Freddie Prinze jr., Jennifer Love Hewitt, just to name a few.  Yet before these movies and these stars, there was the 80's brat pack which featured Tom Cruise, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, just to name a few, and movies such as ""Sixteen Candles"", ""The Breakfast Club"", and ""Pretty In Pink"" caught the attention of teenagers around the world.The movie I am reviewing right now is ""The Breakfast Club"".  Before I saw this movie, I heard it was excellent, and it was, it really was!  And it kind of showed something in which all teenagers should learn, and that is to know each other before they judge each other.  In this movie,  you have the teen with a very high IQ, the outcast, the athlete, the basket case, and of course, the golden girl.  Spending just one Saturday together in the school library together without knowing a thing about each other let them form an everlasting friendship even though they are different from each other in so many ways!  And I guess that bond gave them the freedom to open their hearts to each other to search for some understanding, which they did.This is one of the greatest teen movies ever, and teenagers from both the 80's and the 90's, I think, can not only relate to this movie, but can also easily enjoy it.  And from what I've heard, they do really enjoy it! I'm an eighteen year old girl, and I must be honest, I did! :o)",The Breakfast Club

195,jamhorner,One of the Best John Huston Movies,9,11 July 2007,"I remember when this movie came out; I saw it with some of my high school friends and we though that it would be another dorky teen movie. We couldn't have been farther from the truth. This movie was so touching, so well made, so convincing and so unbelievably realistic. Need I say more? Judd Nelson was very convincing as ""The Rebel"" but also added a touch of sympathy to it. It's like; he's rebellious because of his home life but there is some sense of empathy to his character. All the characters have some sort of problems, family problems, that made them who they are and how they got in detention. It was a very emotionally strong movie and it really spoke about high school life and differences between clicks.What really makes this movie worth watching is also the chemistry and character development between these alienated and severely different groups of kids. At first they don't want anything to do with each other, but as the movie goes on, they grow to like one another. It's even better, considering how John Huston found so many different activities and lectures to pass the time in detention. How many kids haven't thought of some of the things that the Breakfast Club though of to pass time? This movie, among others, was the corner stone of teen angst and the general teen genre all together. John Huston knows how to write teen dramas, unlike some of the writers today.A great American classic.",The Breakfast Club
196,T-ZER0,"Don't YOU, Forget about this movie!",9,27 July 2020,"Breakfast Club was a movie I wanted to see for a while. I heard it was one of the best of the Brat Pack films. One Saturday, I woke up early, and with nothing better to do, I rented it and watched it. Let me just say, there is no better feeling than watching a movie that takes place on the same day you are watching it. It makes you feel like you connect to it more.The movie highlights the lives and different tropes of teens. A brain, an athele, a basket case, a princess and a criminal. In reality, even nowadays, these are types of teens. The movie takes place entirely inside Shermer High School. Which was not what I thought of when I first heard about the film. Still, it is enjoyable. My favorite scene in the movie is still the Lunchtime scene when Bender is talking about Brian's lunch. ""All the Food groups are represented perfectly. Did you mom marry Mr. Rodgers?""That line is classic!Let's not forget to give these child actors credit for how they portray them. There are several scenes where they improv their lines, and they do so well.I am glad I saw this movie, it's such a classic. Maybe when I am bored again on a Saturday. I'll make myself a bowl of Honey Bunches of Oats and put on this movie again. It's worth the time.",The Breakfast Club
197,tiskec,"""Why Does Everyone Like This Movie So Much!?!?""",3,27 October 2016,"**THIS REVIEW COULD CONTAIN A LOT OF SPOILERS. IF THE READER DOESN'T WANT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE MOVIE GETTING SPOILED FOR THEM, THEN I SUGGEST WATCHING THE MOVIE BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW. THANK YOU.**I personally don't get why people like this movie so much. All I got out of it was a bunch of kids in detention, being supervised by an over-aggressive teacher. I get that maybe the script did connect with some viewers, reminding them of high school and so forth. Me personally, I hated detention. I definitely shouldn't of watched a movie about it. In the movie, there just happened to be one of each teenage stereotypical high school kid in detention with each other. HA! When does that EVER happen? I mean, I guess it could, but doubtful and unlikely. Then all the viewer gets is nearly two hours of teenagers bit*hing at each other throughout the whole freckin movie. Ugg. On top of that, they try to screw with this as*hole teacher who's watching over them in detention. That guy was also super annoying. I wanted to punch him (his character) as soon as I seen him in the movie. That dude had a stick so far up his as*, people could've mistaken him for Pinochio. The only thing I liked about this film was the end. How Emilio left that note for the teacher to read. How he described everyone, and told him that they found themselves. The ending was very epic and had a lot of heart. That I will give props to the movie for. Other than that, I could do without the rest. The movies acting was good, the script was good. It was definitely a believable story. The dialog was also good. The story-line is what just didn't do it for me, it didn't provide anything of interest to me as a person. If you like deep, real life drama type stuff, then this movie is probably for you. That would be the only kind of audience I would recommend this movie to. I gave this movie a ""3"" based SOLELY on its ending. The ending itself is worth ""3"" points.",The Breakfast Club
198,joshuafagan-64214,Best John Hughes Movie,10,16 September 2015,"There are many John Hughes masterpieces. In many ways, he is the definitive filmmaker of the 1980s. In fact, he is often the first name that comes up when people think of the eighties in movies. But like some other great filmmakers (Soderbergh comes , his filmography is composed of some bad movies, some good movies, some great movies (including Ferris Bueller) and one masterpiece. This film is that masterpiece. I say way too often that a film takes a basic premise and makes it work. But for a film like this, such cannot go unmentioned. The first sentence of the Wikipedia recap is this: Five high school students from different walks of life endure a Saturday detention under a power-hungry principal. That right there describes the basic premise of the movie perfectly. There are only a handful of films that you can describe in just one sentence. This is one of them. You could hardly think of a simpler movie if you tried. But it works because of the characters.All five of them are, on the surface, your basic high school stereotypes, ones that films had played on a lot, but particularly over the preceding decade. But as they are thrown in a room and forced to interact, we discover that they are more than what they appear to be, that they are complex human beings that are often unfairly divided by our culture, including by many movies. It's kinda meta when you think about it.Anyways, it is a simple theme, yet a powerful one. That is probably why so many high school movies of the last few decades have tried (mostly unsuccessfully) to copy it. So many have done it, in fact, that is hard to remember that when this came out, it was the subversion of many movie clichés and patterns It was fresh and new and innovative.But that is not why this movie worked then and it is not why it works now. The characters this film runs through have humanity. Many of the failed rip-offs of this movie have just had a character prove that they are not a trait without giving off the feeling that they are not a character, that they are at least similar to a real person. Hughes didn't just understand what he was doing, he understood why. And that, with an assist from some truly impressive acting from the Brat Pack, is why this film endures. That is why this film is still watched and remembered today when so many other movies have been forgotten. This is why there are people my age who say that this is their favorite film of all time.This is not a heavyhanded film. It does not often shout. But when it does, you can almost hear it saying 'Don't you forget about me.'",The Breakfast Club

201,walsh-22,Rebel without a cause for the 80's generation,7,7 May 2007,"This movie is for the 80's generation of teenagers that were just as misunderstood as they were in the 50's and in today's society.The film is about teens with problems who are not understood by the adults or by their own peers and it shows how hard it is for kids to survive in that environment. 5 stereotypes come to school on Saturday for detention, not knowing one another and by the end, realising there is more to them then the labels people have give them. Emilio Estevez(Andrew) is a jock who beat up a kid and stuck his bum cheeks together to impress his father. We learn that his father doesn't like weakness and berates his son if he doesn't win and doesn't care how hard his son tries. Molly Ringwald is (claire), the princess who ditched class to go shopping. Her parents battle over her and she feels like she is being torn apart, that her parents don't really care about her and use her to win points against the other. Ally Sheedy is Allison a kook who lies and steals things. She hides herself behind a false persona and makeup so no-one can see the real her. Her family ignore her and the only thing better than staying at home on at Saturday was to come into school for detention to get away from her family. Judd Nelson (Bender) is a wise ass who is judged as a criminal and he is beaten up by his father. He is rude and shows no respect to the teachers. Anthony Michael Hall is Brian who is the brain. He feels like his family pressure him to get high grades and doesn't like himself as a person. He is troubled because his teacher found a gun in his locker. He thought about killing himself with it before the gun was found.John Hughes is good at showing teenagers in his films as not bad kids but kids that are just trying to survive teenage problems till they can leave school and their families. People who were teenagers can relate to that time when it felt like they wouldn't get through it and Hughes shows that there is more to people then labels and you have to talk to them to find out how they really tick as you never know who they are and can judge them too harshly.The actors work well together and I was brought to tears when they were talking about their experiences because I was thinking of my own teenage years.One of the scenes I absolutely love is when Allison is given a make over by Claire and the stare Andrew gives her when he sees her is so tender and he looks bowled over by her new look, like he is seeing her for the first time.

What our high school memory collage is made of, it varies from person to person ; bullied, awkward, spoiled, brat, ungrateful, never satisfied, restless, shy, anxious, angstig, nervous, happy, sad, shallow, and all the oxymoronic description of being a teenager comes to mind. But a few years passed before I really reflected on this film, and yes I have changed and so has everyone. A lot of these youngsters, Estevez, Ringwald, Sheedy, Nelson, Michael Hall are just the same as me and my high school friends, some made it, some continue to struggle but one thing for sure, we're all trying to survive this crazy, cruel but wonderful world.

203,turkam,Best of the Brat Pack movies......,7,14 November 2004,"It has been almost 20 years since I first saw this film as a 15 year old kid in 1985. Since then I've developed interests in directors far more intellectual than John Hughes. Assuredly, if I became a film director I would want to cite Akira Kurosawa as a main influence as opposed to John Hughes, but like Kevin Smith, I would have to give credit for the impact Hughes' films had on my adolescence. He was one of the few directors who focused on mostly teen films, though ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" and ""Natl. Lampoon's Vacation"" drew larger audiences. Among his films about teens, ""Breakfast Club"" is by far the best. It's central characters, played by Molly Ringwald and company, represented a cross section of teenage America. In an odd way, it resembles the Turkish film ""Yol"" by director Yilmaz Guney which came out in 1982, in this regard. ""The Breakfast Club"" fully examines the plight of these characters during the Reagan years which were difficult for many of us who grew up then. This film may not stand up to ""Rebel Without a Clause,"" perhaps the best teen film ever made, but it captures its' generation, its' period, and the secluded isolation which was teenage America in the 80s. I am not surprised it has become popular with teens today. It may not be ""Rahsomon,"" but it is a crowning achievement for commerical films of this period, and its' title song ""Don't You Forget About Me"" still hauntingly helps this film capture the loneliness and fear of rejection which always seems to loom over teeangers whichever generations hey find themselves in.",The Breakfast Club

A lot of great dialogue in this movie and each actor played their part perfect, except for Estevez.All of the characters in their own clique.

206,wadechurton,And they call this is a 'classic'.,1,12 December 2012,"Somebody actually wrote this? A lot of it seems improvised, and not well. In fact, it almost seems like someone simply transcribed some bad improv and that became the script. Am I supposed to identify with anyone in this '80s Classic'? All of the characters are less than likable and none of them ring true. Is Ally Sheedy's character supposed to be autistic or something? Because otherwise I don't get it. Scenery-chewing Judd Nelson comes off less a troubled tough guy than a slightly flamboyant bitchy queen. And he looks a good ten years too old to be going to high school. Not only do the cast not talk like school students, they mostly don't even look like them. Although billed as a 'comedy', there's not a lot to crack a smile over, although when that nerdy kid dropped the news he'd been caught with a gun at school and the others automatically assumed he intended to kill himself, I had to laugh. These days kids don't bring guns to school to necessarily kill just themselves. Frankly what this dated piece of pointless pontification most closely resembles is one of those 'workshopped' plays in which irredeemably pretentious folk get to indulge themselves and create something truly painful. In this case, it is five cipher-characters who just will not shut up for a couple of hours. In lieu of a proper ending, we get a quick dance montage (note Emilio Estevez' total lack of dancing ability) and everyone is everyone's mate for some reason. And you know what?

207,eamon-hennedy,Clever and engaging Brat pack comedy drama.,9,10 May 2006,"I only ever discovered this movie through an episode of Dawson's Creek I have to admit. It was an episode where the main characters of that show find themselves on Saturday detention and actually make reference to the film. It was only a few years later when I had taped a documentary off BBC One about Star Wars that I actually got around to seeing the movie itself as it was on straight after, prompting me to remember as the film was about to start, ""oh yeah, that Dawson's Creek film"". Suffice to say I enjoyed the movie immensely and it was only after a recent screening on Irish television that I got around to buying it on DVD, the day after said screening. I was surprised to find the film somewhat deeper, a little more intense and surprisingly philosophical when I watched it recently, seeing that there is a lot more going on here than unresolved sexual tension issues and pot smoking going on. This is a film about the fears of young adulthood and the even bigger fears of actually growing old and how disappointing life can be. This may be a film for teenagers, but it surprising how adult it can be, and how much a twenty one year old, or even someone older, can actually get something out of this film. Forget the fun and games of Ferris Bueller, as good as it it is, this is probably John Hughes' best film, offering up something more darker, but something ultimately a little uplifting, about a bunch of characters looking into themselves at a young age and not necessarily liking what they are seeing.The performances from all the cast are first rate, with special mention to Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy. Estevez, Ringwald and Hall are fine also, but these two get the best characters to play with, as do Paul Gleason and John Kapelos as two bitter school employees also realizing how disappointing life can be (a little note, keep a look out for the middle photo during the opening shots at the start of the movie to see how clever this film actually is, not to mention subtle). Add to this one of the best theme songs written for a film, in this case Don't You Forget About Me by Simple Minds, and what we have here is a bona fide 80's teen classic and an example of how teen movies today are nowhere near as good as they were when they had the Brat Pack starring in them. Today's teen movies are full of too much bad taste humour and stars who can't act, they aren't full of the pathos and genuine humour that this, and many other films, at the time had.

One of these teens is played by Judd Nelson. If you've gotten through those first two sentences without barfing, you might get a kick out of ""The Breakfast Club."" It's not a bad movie, despite the absence of plot and presence of Nelson. However, it's trying to be a portrait of a generation, and it fails miserably. If you want to know what high school was like for most of us in the 80s, try ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" or ""Heathers."" But if you want to know what high school was like for .02% of the American teenaged population, i.e. those who attended high school in a North Shore suburb of Chicago, then ""Breakfast Club"" is practically a documentary. Having dated (and married) a succession of women from this area, I can assure you that the students at New Trier, Glenbrook North, etc etc were just like Andy, Brian, Claire, etc etc -- self-absorbed, status-conscious and (back then at least) whiter than Arm & Hammer baking soda.For an iconic 80s movie, it sure has a stereotypical 60s perspective -- kids good, adults bad. There's also a trace of 70s smarm inasmuch as this movie posits that everything will be fine if you get stoned and talk about your problems. Whatever -- no one ever accused John Hughes of having great depth or insight, he's just a hack who turned his case of arrested development into a string of highly profitable schmaltz-fests. But in the mid-1980s there was so little of importance happening in popular culture that Hughes was heralded as some kind of artist. Furthermore, his young actors were proclaimed The Stars Of Tomorrow. They weren't. That's actually kind of a shame in the case of Molly Ringwald, who is genuinely attractive and talented but has been a punch line since 1988 after playing the same whiny brat in, like, 300 movies. In ""Breakfast Club,"" she portrays the whiniest brat of them all: Claire, the ""Princess"" character. Claire is pretty, popular and stuck up, but as you can probably guess, her polished facade masks almost unbearable pain, and she's more than willing to tell you about it. (Sad to say, I knew people in the 80s who said they could identify with Claire. Sadder to say, most of them were guys.) Anthony Michael Hall was never going to do ""Hamlet,"" but at this point in his non-career he showed some comic ability and as Brian, the ""Nerd"" character, he gets more mileage out of his terminally dumbfounded facial expression than he ever would again. Emilio Estevez probably wouldn't have risen above community theater without his family connections, but at least he's a better actor than his brother Charlie (faint praise, of course) and he seems to grasp the intended complexity of Andy, the ""Jock"" character, even if he can't convey any of it. Ally Sheedy isn't bad as Allison, the ""Crazy"" character, but she's probably there because Jennifer Jason Leigh wanted too much money and Winona Ryder was too young. (It should also be noted that if ""Breakfast Club"" was set in 1995, Winona would have played Allison as a Goth, been the heroine of the picture and walked off with an Oscar, bad joke intended.) As for Judd Nelson as ""Bender"" the burnout, well . . . someone should have told him that ""angry"" does not always mean ""yelling,"" ""intense"" does not mean ""creepy unblinking bug-eyed stare,"" and ""chewing the scenery"" is a metaphor for overacting, not a way to prepare for a role. (Seriously, he waddles on screen in his first scene like he's just swallowed the entire set of ""Risky Business."" Maybe he did. Has anyone seen that Porsche?) Still, every young man who dreams of a career on the silver screen should be made to watch Nelson's performance in ""Breakfast Club."" It's the thespian version of ""Scared Straight.""",The Breakfast Club
210,dwr246,An intelligent look beyond high school stereotypes,8,21 February 2005,"Ah, high school. The best of times? Or the worst? This film gives you a picture of a little bit of both as it intelligently explores five of the people behind the stereotypes.Five students - Andy (Emilio Estevez), the jock; Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), the brain; Bender (Judd Nelson), the hood; Claire (Molly Ringwald), the princess; and Allison (Ally Sheedy), the basket case - are assigned an all day detention on a Saturday. We are given a glimpse of their relationships with their parents as they are dropped off, and then they are greeted by their principal (Paul Gleason), a somewhat belligerent man who occasionally crosses the line into abuse. Their assignment for the day is to write an essay for the principal, who comes back periodically with the intent to do little else other than abuse them some more. While the five distinctive personalities clash in the beginning, with almost violent results, eventually, boredom and a little pot get them talking with each other, and we see how each of them feels the pressure of their assigned role, and what it's doing to them.It's a talky movie, so there's little action, although there is a rather amusing - and exciting - ""chase scene."" The high school it's set in looks depressing enough to suck the life out of anyone, which helps add to the feelings of being trapped that everyone in the movie seems to have. This is used very effectively to tell the story.What is interesting about this movie is the character portrayal. The characters are distinctive, moving beyond the stereotype to the real person underneath. While these students are perhaps more self aware than we would expect of students that age at that time, they do articulate their angst about life in a believable way. With them, we come to see the similarities in the pressures that their peers and parents put on them, and that they put on themselves. We see how much they dislike the inauthenticity of their lives, and how powerless they feel to stop it. Their powerlessness even relates to their new friendships, as Claire articulates just how hard it would be for them to move beyond their defined boundaries to maintain their friendships with each other. This lack of sugar coating makes for a much more powerful message in the end.The acting in the film is generally quite good. John Kapelos gives a scene stealing performance as the worldly wise janitor, while Paul Gleason goes way over the top as the principal (to the occasional detriment of the scenes he's in). The leads all give solid performances. Anthony Michael Hall plays the high school nerd to perfection, unable to comprehend that things are not necessarily how he thinks they should be. Molly Ringwald gives enough depth to her performance that you like Claire even though she is spoiled. Emilio Estevez gives us a sense of the anger of someone who has been pushed to bring misery to someone else in order to cover his own insecurities. Ally Sheedy plays her character's strangeness to perfection. But Judd Nelson arguably gives the strongest performance as a disadvantaged teen who knows a lot more than he lets on.If you don't like psycho babble, this film may not be for you. On the other hand, if you're intrigued by a portrait of teens just beginning to realize who they really are, you will probably enjoy this movie immensely, and you may even learn a little about yourself in the process.",The Breakfast Club
211,ericjg623,One big cliché made up of lots of little clichés,1,2 May 2013,"I just watched this on AMC. At first I was gonna give it 6/10, then later revised that down to 3/10 and by the end of the movie I was at rock bottom - 1/10.Why does this movie suck so badly? Not because it wasn't well made, or badly acted, but rather because the the story itself is just so awful. What we have here are a bunch of smaller clichés that add it to some very big clichés. All the principal characters are clichés, and so are all of the premises of this film. You have five high school kids who are all stock high school characters - the jock, the brain, the popular pretty girl, the long haired greaser ""Tough guy"" and, finally, the misfit. They are all stuck in detention for a day, under the supervision of the 6th cliché, the (I think) assistant principal, the perfect personification of (from the teenagers' POV) mindless adult authority. He might as well wear a swastika armband, so one dimensional is his character.Now, I suppose a conceit of this movie is the five kids aren't really clichés at all, but actual, real individuals who are forced into their roles by the neverending forces of social conformity (which is in itself yet another cliché), except, of course, they aren't. The jock really IS a jock, the brain a nerd, the popular girl popular, and so forth. None of them emerge as a true three dimensional character, at best they display a bit of two dimensions before reverting back to their one dimensional selves. And the principal doesn't even get that privilege, his character is a one dimensional authoritarian goon and is never allowed to rise above that basic stereotype.Speaking of adults, virtually every last one of them comes off badly, indeed, very badly. They, as described by the kids, are little more than beasts who demand perfection from their offspring and show an almost total lack of love or even affection. This is one of the movie's biggest clichés, the notion of teenagers as being wise beyond their years while their parents are essentially abusers, if not physically then certainly emotionally. Portraying all adults as rotten is not only completely unrealistic, it also feeds into the worst sort of egotism on the part of the presumed teenage audience for a movie such as this.Okay, so the kids (and their principal) are all a bunch of clichés. That's bad enough, but this film has other flaws as well. One, the misfit character, played by Ally Sheedy, seems to have no basis in reality at all. And nothing about the movie explains why she is who she is. Further, how clichéd (spoiler alert) is it that she ends up with the jock, this, after getting a makeover courtesy of the popular girl? Wouldn't it have been less of a cliché for her to end up with the brain? Also, her character would have been a lot more believable had she been genuinely unattractive, say, 30 lbs overweight, acne, and hair that was greasy looking because she never washed it. Instead, it was like - 5 minutes with a mascara brush and a little work on the hair and, Ta Da! she's beautiful! And a completely different person, too! Still, hers was probably the most likable character of the bunch, and she probably should have ended up with the nerd. By that standard, by FAR the most detestable character was the greaser. The tough guy with a heart of gold is an old staple in American entertainment, such notables include The Fonz and Vinnie Barbarino. But this guy has more like the heart of a sewer rat. That he is rude and defiant of authority is to be expected of this type of character, but his verbal attacks on the others, especially Molly Ringwald's character, border on verbal rape, so cruel and sadistic are his attacks on her. He was the one character whom you wanted to see the principal beat into a bloody pulp, unfortunately, that didn't happen. His is the worst cliché of them all, the sort of person, because he is a self-proclaimed ""Rebel"" and non-conformist, is transformed from being a complete A__hole into the conscience of sorts for this film. It is his character, perhaps more than all the others combined, who ruined this movie for me. Cruelty and sadism have their place in the movies (think ""Apocalypse Now"") but they absolutely don't belong in what is supposed to be a light teenage comedy.And that's about it. When I first saw this back in the 1980's (on HBO, probably) I didn't think this movie was particularly good or back. But having now seen it just a couple hours ago, I think it truly sucks.1/10",The Breakfast Club
212,cleary-joshua,Five teenagers are forced to stay in a room together and we learn so much about them....,8,26 January 2014,"Placing a small group of characters in a single setting for the entire running time of a movie is clever narrative technique – it forces them to talk to each other, and through this, we learn more about those people through their speech, mannerisms and interactions with each other. The concept of ""The Breakfast Club"" is exactly that. Five teenagers from all walks of society are forced to stay in a room together, and through this they bond and we learn so much about them. And it's also funny, nostalgic and a movie that only John Hughes could have pulled off well.The five characters are high school stereotypes, and I think there's one of them that each of us relate to. There's the jock, the rebel, the psycho, the prom-queen and the geek, and they all think they're so different from each other. At first, they argue and fight during their detention. Eventually, though, they realise that they're not so different, and actually have a shared hatred – the authority which is keeping them in detention. We see them rebel together, get high and reveal their darkest secrets. It manages to be charming and funny while never reaching cliché. Where Hughes is a master is character development, and he shows us how the characters are bonding and developing without being too preachy.The script and direction is very well managed, with John Hughes tapping into the teenage mentality perfectly. What's odd is how timeless the film is, with little having changed in school character-types over almost 30 years. The acting is also great, with Judd Nelson and Anthony Michael Hall giving especially strong performances. The film's focus on teenagers also gives a message about the problems of adults, and the one major adult character in the film, played by Paul Gleason, is also one of my favourites. He is written really well as the antagonistic vice- principal, and Hughes succeeds well in allowing the teens to usurp him, but not too easily.The one main flaw that the film has is in its single setting. It works for the majority, but there are definitely times where it lags and feels trapped by the confines that it has set itself. There is not much action in some parts, and the dialogue doesn't always carry it through. That said, it's funny and enjoyable, and an important piece of film for any adolescent to see. There's something for all of us to learn in the adventures of ""The Breakfast Club"".",The Breakfast Club
213,allyatherton,Probably the best high school movie of the eighties,10,21 August 2016,"A bunch of high school kids spend their Saturday in detentionStarring Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall and Ally SheedyWritten and directed by John HughesThis is another one that I somehow managed to miss during the eighties. But then again I was only thirteen so it was probably a little old for me.I was expecting this to be just like St Elmo's Fire and, although I really liked that movie, this was surprisingly totally different. It really is a great movie. It's very much a typical eighties film but this one has that something extra. It's funny in all the right places but also grabs at your heart strings with a splash of drama in all the right places as well. It's surprisingly well acted and probably has to go down as one of the greatest teenage high school movies ever made.A lot of the plaudits must go down to the terrific script and direction by John Hughes.I wasn't expecting to like this film as much as I did.

215,alexcomputerkid,There's honestly too much positive to say about it.,9,6 July 2015,"I've hinted and put it out there many times before but I can say I never got much out of high school. Sure, it wasn't unbearable but it was unlikable for me anyway I look at it. When your main hobbies are film studies, writing and attending as many hockey sporting events as possible, I came to expect to being alone on most nights. Sure, I had my fair share of friends but once my friends turned to drugs, I told myself I wasn't going down that road. Still, being that these friends were always close to me through junior high, I wasn't able to totally let them go. Basically my entire high school days were spent with drugs even though I never did drugs and alcohol during those four years.I was a straight C student with my GPA always somewhere in the 2.5 range. Considering my high school was always top in the state of Michigan and too much focused on ""excellence"", my grades were probably below average compared to others. That could be because I do have a learning disability but at the same time, school was just not my thing. Being at a place for seven hours every day and just not being a people person made school difficult for me. It was me usually sitting in classrooms for six periods where my interest level was pretty low.I can say that I found most of my senior year this past year to be kind of useless. I had achieved most of my credits for graduation years prior and I was stuck in an art class and material processing class because I needed classes to round out my schedule. I found it very ironic that I liked my business law class so much even though it was pretty hard and I even got an A in the class. Sure, my grades weren't hot for my senior year at times because I was really had no experience in drawing or doing woodwork but my grades were also low because was just at an end. I also think having a girlfriend my senior year helped with me lot. It helped from an emotional standpoint and it was nice having a person who was willing to support me when a lot of people weren't. From my first car accident, midnight drives wandering around town and to the poor matinée movies we sat through, it seemed like my best times of high school were with her in an odd way.The point I am trying to make is that everyone has high school memories and I could go much more in depth and give you a dozen more stories but this is enough. To fit into more my point about high school, if there's genre in film that's more cliché and without so many deep issues, it's the high school genre. Yes, you have your classics from it like any other genre but you also see so much of the same thing. Still you can find a charm in a movie like The Breakfast Club which is really like no other.Jonathan Bender (Judd Nelson), Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), Andy Clark (Emilio Estevez) and Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy) have all been served detention on a Saturday morning at Shermer High School. This film is a character study which goes into depth of many characters having deep conversations about the meaning of life and high school ideas in general, all set in a school library. Why this is such an accomplishment is because of the characters. Every one of these characters are given a background and thoughts. Andy is on the wrestling team and you can just tell at times he's just tired of being a jock. Andy wants to put himself in and talk about issues even though he shouldn't. Claire is the princess and let's her mouth get her into trouble most times. Brian is the brain who is facing too much pressure and more than he should. Bender is the rebel and who seems to find himself in Saturday dentition quite a bit. Ally is awkward, quirky and a wacko who's really all over the place. It's the Judd Nelson character who really leads this film in it's first acts but his cast-mates eventually step up near the close this film. These are characters that fit the role of people in high school. These are characters that are able to talk about things that have deep meaning for them. These are characters that are not normally in high school films or films in general. This is a plot that's as different now as it was back then. A high school film that is set in one day and one setting. The Breakfast Club is brave and I don't see it ever being topped as the best high school film around. There's honestly too much positive to say about it.",The Breakfast Club

With all its hype, this movie certainly deserves every speck of attention, because of its brilliance. 80's is considered to be the era of the underdog, when it dealt with movies. However forget about all of that - and watch this. It has the charm of 'feel good', together with the fabulous cast, all matched perfectly to suit their characters.

217,PeachesIR,Made strong impression on me at the time,8,12 June 2021,"I saw ""The Breakfast Club"" when I was 16 and, like the movie's characters, was in a high school in an upper-middle class American suburb. This film made a strong impression on me at the time, because it featured five rather stereotypical teenage characters-the wealthy princess, the nerdy brain, the cute jock, the obnoxious delinquent, and the goth kook-who talk their way into connecting with one another, scaling the social barriers of their rigid school ""groups."" My high school had much the same cliques and social stereotypes. ""The Breakfast Club"" is quintessentially '80s down to Claire's sushi lunch, Andrew's Nike running shoes, and Allison's dyed black shag hair, and of course, the Simple Minds theme song. The premise and plot are simple: the teens have all broken school rules, so they're serving a day of detention on a Saturday. It is set and feels like a play, entirely conducted inside the school, mostly the library, where the teens engage in intense dialogues. Eventually, we see beyond their facades, and they see beyond each other's too, exposing their pain and insecurities, hopes and desires.Criticism of ""The Breakfast Club"" at the time and by viewers since then is valid: these characters are high school stereotypes, the detention premise is a little odd (hey, it's fiction), Judd Nelson's John is over the top in his rebelliousness and soliloquies, crushes cross social barriers in unrealistic ways, and much of the dialogue is lofty and unnatural. I think director/writer John Hughes meant to do all of these things; this film was obviously unrealistic. Even watching at the time as a suburban high school junior, I realized that he was making a point with no attempts at subtlety. His famous teen movies (Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink) were not subtle.However, the messages of the film made an impact on me at the time and may still resonate with some teens today: we are all more alike than different. Although, I fear today's teens are more entrenched in their group and social identities than in the '80s, which saddens me. Hughes wanted us to dismantle our barriers; that is the movie's message.Looking back, I realize that my classmates, who were exactly like these characters, didn't turn out the way anyone (including John Hughes) may have expected. Our John Bender delinquent type outgrew his petty criminal phase, and now owns a successful business, is happily married and has two grandchildren. High school is not forever. The person you are as a teenager is a seed that sprouts into the person you become later.",The Breakfast Club

227,donuthaters12,Can't help but empathise and attach to these characters,10,30 June 2013,"John Hughes, who is known more for his writing rather than his directing. I have not seen everything Hughes has written, or even directed (Planes, Trains and Automobiles) but I have seen some of his popular and memorable work like Sixteen Candles, Home Alone, Weird Science, Pretty In Pink, Some Kind of Wonderful and Ferris Bueller. Something that I have picked up after seeing enough of his work is that he is a writer who creates these characters that are lovable and adored. When I was a child, I always wanted to be as fearless and clever as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and that is due to his writing. After watching this film, I feel that he has created his magnum opus in directing and writing but though it's his best, it has it's flaws.The plot of The Breakfast Club is a bunch of high schoolers serving detention. This is where I felt that Hughes' writing may not appeal to some people as this film is definitely not like other high school films out there. Hughes was bold to write about 5 people sitting in a library and talk. The film's goal is not very evident from the start but if you invest yourself within these characters then you would understand Hughes' intentions. It is about empathising the problems of others and understanding that teenagers are beyond the stereotypes society has placed upon them and that we all have our uniqueness that define who we are. This film focuses on these teenagers relationships, status and personalities. Hughes has created five very unique individuals who are viewed by each other within their stereotypes. This then takes the film into a dialogue and character driven direction in order to flesh out these characters and explore the emotions and hardships of their position. I personally found this film to be interesting and definitely relatable, which will be the reason why this film is universally adored.I felt that this was a personal film for Hughes and that he really cared for these characters. He achieved in crafting something that is so deep and at the same time entertaining which allows for one to revisit this film time and time again. What make Hughes so clever is creating young characters in his films that does not feel like they have been recycled from his other work. His most personal moment of this film, I assume, is the scene where they all sit down together and share their personal feelings and views. It really felt like Hughes has been in the situation before and just recreated it for this film.John Hughes and Thomas Del Ruth seem to have gone with a low budget feel to its photography and most of the camera's focus is on the actor's and their emotions and reactions. I felt that this style was appropriate and it does not distract us when key moments are taking place. There is very little movement to the camera and it allows us to take in scenes and focuses a little more on the characterization.The pacing, I thought was done well for a plot that takes it's time in moving things along. It takes it's time with these scenes, except for the hallway sequence which was paced a lot faster to induce tension. Some audiences may find this quite boring at times and may want for more things to happen.The music is driven by pop, new wave songs in the time period and fits very nicely with the setting. The music in this film gives people that sense of nostalgia and may not help themselves but to click along with it. I though, am a product of a later generation so it may not give me that heavy sense of nostalgia but it does get me clapping once in a while.This movie would have not worked and fallen apart if casting failed at acquiring actors who can understand the characters they are playing themselves. Thankfully the actors chosen are perfect and irreplaceable. Chemistry between the actors were excellent and all five play off each other well. These actors would end up working together commonly in later films.The Breakfast Club is a film that you may want to go back to, especially if you are a teenager, and relate to. It would make you think about others and understand the uniqueness that make that person an individual rather than a shade that can be identified solely on their surface.",The Breakfast Club
228,audrablum,It's not for everyone,2,10 February 2019,"This week I watched the dramedy The Breakfast Club (1985). The last time I watched this movie I turned it off halfway through as I am not a huge fun of slice of life films. The movie is basically a dialogue, character driven format with the central action being focused on the characters' internalization and reflection. Watching this movie for the second time I was able to better appreciate this film from a cinematic perspective. I could appreciate the storytelling, character arcs, and the central messages behind it. The thing that I wish was done differently was casting. Watching this movie it was hard to buy that several of the characters were in fact high schoolers. I would have enjoyed this film a little more if the characters looked like they were actually in high school. The music choices and editing choices definitely stood out and I'm not sure I agree with those choices as they seemed rushed and eccentric. The directing and editing were professional and seamless and added value to the movie. The actors are probably what made the film any good. It was good to see the whole movie through, but I probably won't watch this again.",The Breakfast Club

230,shadow_blade-89459,Classic,7,8 February 2019,"""Breakfast Club"" (1985) is a professionally produced comedic drama about five stereotypical teenagers that find they have more in common then just going to the same school after serving a day in detention. Keeping in mind when this film was produced, I feel slightly unsatisfied because there was no diversity in the film. The film storyline is still mostly relevant today through the character portrayals, but I find it hard to believe there were no other ethnic groups is the school besides possibly the janitor. Outside of this fact, this film is very good and mostly sound.John Hughes did a masterful job in his simplicity. I am led to believe he had the whole school and surrounding areas to go crazy with shooting, especially after they departed the library, but maintained one key location to focus on the story. There were a handful of technical issues within the film with either continuity or audio and at times there felt a bit of over acting. I think this film will continue to be relatable for many years to come even though the problems will change. The stereotypes are still current, and popularity is still a fixture in high school, but the problems have evolved. Overall, this film is a classic, even if it isn't for my personal pallet. I would recommend this film to anyone based on its storyline and minimalist approach.",The Breakfast Club

232,GluStick,One of my favorite movies,10,31 January 1999,"This movie is just pure greatness. I love it some much. It's got to be the best of the '80s. It's got a lot of humor and it was actully sad when they are all talking about their problems. The talent is really great because you really wouldn't expect it from such young people. I think the reason people like it so much is because it tells about almost every type of person. Everyone knows a John Bender or Andrew Clark. The people who are just always getting in trouble and the ones who are just obsessed with a sport. I really like it because I have experienced what each person went through. I've been a brain, an athlete, a basketcase, a princess, and a criminal. And some people just don't understand other people's problems. Just because you're used to getting bad grades doesn't mean others are. It can be really painful for them. This movie also tells about good friends. You can find them in the strangest places. Someone you think you absolutely hate, you actully find things in you both that make you just the same. This movie really changed me. And i'm really thankful for that. When you get done watching this you will always feel glad that you have the friends you have but you won't be embarrassed to show people that they are your friends even if they aren't very liked by other people. Watch this movie and you'll agree.",The Breakfast Club
233,mc1382,30 years on still a great film,9,17 February 2015,"The Breakfast Club (review): To coincide with the 30th anniversary The Breakfast Club i am going to be doing a review of this timeless film (kinda?) The Breakfast Club- Rating M (1985) directed by John Hughes and starring Molly Ringwald (Claire), Emilio Estevez (Andrew), Judd Nelson (Bender) Anthony Michael Hall (Brian), Ally Sheedy (Alison) and Paul Gleason (Richard Vernon ) is a Drama/Comedy about five high school stereotypes who have to be together in the result of a Saturday detention but later find out that their's a lot more to each other then they realized.First of all the acting more specifically the chemistry between the 5 leads they work effortlessly together developing and also demeaning each other until they come to like each other. My favorite is Bender one of the most funniest teen or maybe film characters of all time he constantly got a laugh out of me and really he is a good take of the criminal character despite at times how stereotypical he is.The writing (script) if you can believe it was written in just two days, now that's astonishing. Despite how much little time it took to write the script to is just as good as the acting is. The writing feels very natural and relate able and accessible (although some of it was improvised) still relating to teen problems today. The writing although using stereotypes redeems itself when the characters come to get to know each other more.The directing is just as good as the acting and writing. John Hughes got good performances out of the actors and does a good job in making the story cohesive.The cinematography is not stunning or have big CGI special effects but its not supposed to. The location in which it's set makes good use for the lack of cinematography.The music is decent apart from the Simple Minds track Don't You Forget About Me which is one of the signature song of the 80's. The song's are somewhat forgettable and really belong to the corniness of the 80's.If there are flaws with the movie it would have to be it's corniness at least in the Dance scene which is not really necessary but it's fun nether less but it does ruin this movie's chances of being truly timeless.The only other flaws have is the Principal he very one dimensional and doesn't have much of a character aside from being the oppressive teacher. While the main five leads start off like that at least they were developed at least that's my opinion.Overall this movie is a 80's hallmark that introduced the teen hallmarks without this movie we probably wouldn't have movies like ''Mean Girls or 10 Things i hate about you. Definitely check it out. Film Rating: 8/10",The Breakfast Club
234,mc1382,"""We're Not Alone""",9,12 January 2018,"What happens when you put 5 high school stereotypes together? You get The Breakfast Club. Directed by John Hughes this film follows 5 teenagers who have to serve a Saturday detention and write a report about ""who they are''. We discover the 5 personalities ""The Jock - Andrew"", ""The Criminal - Bender"", ""The Princess - Claire"", ""The Nerd - Brian"" and ""The Basket Case - Allison"". The characters are set up as stereotypes in the beginning but as the film progresses we see ''they're are not so different after all"".The film while slower in pace doesn't drag and kept my attention for the run time. The comedy from Bender, the awkwardness of Brian, The tough guy attitude of Andrew ,the snobbery of Claire and the weirdness of Allison keeps the film entertaining. The personalities of the 5 work well together and this allows for some great scenes.Their are also two other players in this story,Vernon and Carl. Vernon is the authoritarian figure and Carl is the laid back janitor. These two represents the different perspectives of the previous generation. Vernon is pessimistic and aggressive towards the current generation while Carl is more optimistic and empathetic towards the current generation. This conveys the theme of the generational gap and this allows for the audience to see different perspectives. Vernon and Carl are less developed than the 5 main characters and as such are more one dimensional. This is one of the few criticisms of the film aside from some questionable 80s dance scenes (although they are fun as hell).The most beautiful thing about this film is the theme of similarity and difference. This is conveyed in the group therapy scene where each of them reveal secrets about themselves. This shows the audience that each of the 5 characters problems are different but they're all going through a similar struggle. The struggle of being accepted by parents, peers, teachers and society at large. This is something that a lot of people can relate to including myself. I tend to identify with Brian's character the most.Give this film a try, you just might discover that ""we're not so different after all""",The Breakfast Club
235,dexter-3,Doesn't stand the test of time...,3,22 June 1999,"I saw this when it premiered, and liked it a lot better then.  This has not aged well.  Of course, I am almost 40, but these issues seem slight to me now.  The situations one now faces as an adult are Olympian in proportion to what these kids whine about.  So, here is an essential fact to remember when looking at this film:  Most teenagers think their parents don't care, don't listen, and don't know anything.  They're wrong.  The truth is, the world doesn't revolve around post-puberty teenagers.  The issues raised here most often occur because of poor communication (which is not necessarily always the fault of either parents or teens).  No one, not even grown-ups, have all the answers.  Deal with it.  And yes, sometimes bad stuff happens to kids like the Judd Nelson character, but if it ain't you, get over it.  (This does NOT mean I condone that behavior, or encourage people to ignore it if they see it.  It is here for drama.)  Think I'm full of s**t?  Look at the high school these kids ""go"" to...I went to one ""like"" it, and last time I checked, the people I graduated with were pretty much okay.  The problems they face now sure aren't ""high school"" in nature.Hughes does a lot of damage demonizing parents here.  The Estevez character may dislike his father, but he would thank him in the ""grown-up"" sequel (which could still be made...it's not like any of these actors went anywhere.  They're available).Some good scenes, b.s. ending.  A ""3"" out of ""10.""  No one ever reviews how the janitor and Bender interact and what they talk about, thereby ignoring what should be an integral part of the film and an insight into ""grown-up"" behavior.",The Breakfast Club
236,SpaaceMonkee,John Hughes Delivers,6,28 October 2020,"John Hughes takes an old premise - a group of high school stereotypes (jock, brain, outcast, popular girl, slacker) meets and addresses their apparent differences and secret similarities - and avoids the lame, predictable disaster that could have been.Watching the movie all these years later, it's a little jarring to have a female character that largely serves no role besides being an object of desire of two men and otherwise seems to lack any agency. Setting that aspect of the film aside, a good bit of chemistry between the characters lets the actors deliver on an absolutely killer script, which is the real movie magic here. Just ignore the occasional out-of-character articulateness throughout and enjoy the dialogue. It's the lifejacket that saves the viewer from drowning in an occasional tsunami of teenage angst.",The Breakfast Club

I'd like to think that if there was a second part to update us on what happened to the members of ""The Breakfast Club,"" that the character of Bender would have grown up to a better vision of life than he displayed in the movie.

242,anandrajeev979,"The Very Best of 80s , Great and relatable even after 30 years",10,17 February 2017,"So this review was meant to go after film's 30th anniversary in 2015 but I was not using IMDb so I am writing it now when I watched it again last night. Firstly , it's one of the films I can relate to every time as a teenager. Every 80s kid will tell you they got everything right. The characters rightly display the school life of children. The dialogues , what they say , what they mean and their feelings are honestly portrayed that's why it's one of the best. Modern movies have lost this touch and are far far far more clichéd but this one is gem. It's one of those movies that you don't want to eat up going for direction , script and all but for it's very heart. As a teenager , the story about 5 high school students spending 8 hours of detention together and what happen between them and why they were there and how they got out is worth watching. It clearly displays the pressure society and parents put on children. ""My Home Life is Unsatisfying"",""If you say you haven't you are a prude , If you say you have , you are a slut . It's a trap"" and many more dialogues like this capture what it feels like to be in high school.Especially the types which are perfectly portrayed with a message that no one is inferior. All the loners , this one's for you.It clearly states Everyone is bizarre , some are just good at hiding it. There is much more to this movie then I can ever write but I can say I will not forget those two hours as they serve a clear and honest reflection of my own life.It's honest.It tells what it is nothing more. Love , Friendship , comedy , relationship every thing is there and just in words which makes it more effective. Also It has Brenden whom you will never forget plus a whole lot of classic scenes like the dance sequence.",The Breakfast Club
243,ramsfan,"Entertaining and well meaning, yet flawed",6,6 February 2010,"On an entertainment level, The Breakfast Club is an effective, enjoyable film. The actors all do a credible job of portraying some of the various stereotypes present in a typical school setting: the ""jock"", ""the delinquent"", the ""princess"", the ""nerd"" and the ""loner'. As a high school student in the 80's, I enjoyed the film tremendously. But as a high school teacher for the past seventeen years, there are certain elements of the film that are both disturbing and a bit hard to swallow. Director John Hughes' slapdash and careless depictions of the typical high school experience somewhat detracts from a film that has noble intentions.In making his point- that we wrongfully judge people we really don't know- director Hughes asks us to accept some wild implausibilities along the way. The most disturbing is Paul Gleason's portrayal of Principal Richard Vernon. He is shown as a hard ass who belittles and threatens to the point of name calling and promises of violence. It is an outrageous, inaccurate characterization of a typical high school principal which wouldn't be tolerated for a second in the real world of education. It is obviously intended to engender viewer sympathy for the students, but it rings hollow.We're also expected to believe the school princess would hook up with the school dirt bag when she hated his guts two hours earlier and the school jock would hook up with the compulsive liar/weirdo. While it certainly is possible for students of varying experiences to come to a greater understanding of one another, it would undoubtedly take time- much more than just part of a Saturday spent together.The film is also a bit dated, with terms like ""wasteoid"" and ""sporto"" being thrown around, but in and of itself, that's not a big deal. Despite its faults, The Breakfast Club is a good watch.",The Breakfast Club

245,huntersmithx,One of the best coming-of age films ever made.,10,7 April 2020,"Truly great films about youth, and especially high school, are a commodity. It's rare that I'm deeply impressed by one nowadays (""Lady Bird"" and ""Eighth Grade"" being notable exceptions for the 2010's), so I decided to go back to Generation Z's favorite decade and finally see ""The Breakfast Club"" for myself. What a truly remarkable time capsule this is.Hilarious and deeply moving, but also naturally acted and plotted without giving into overbearing sentimentality or too many of the silly trappings of the genre. For my money my viewing of this was definitely the opposite of the saying ""Don't believe the hype.""

246,TeaBunny,The movie that defined 80's teendom,10,20 April 1999,"One of my all-time favorites. Sure it had some flaws (detention all day on a Saturday? What universe does THAT happen in?) but it's worth watching again and again. One word: chemistry. These actors had it, and their interaction is fabulous. Quality work from John Hughes (not as sappy as Pretty in Pink, not as wacky as Weird Science). Truly my favorite film of his. John Hughes made movies that are quintessentially 80's, but still look timeless and are not dated at all when you watch them today. Great script. The only major problem I had with it was Alison's ""makeover"" (which consisted of brushing her hair back and taking off her black sweater). Suddenly she is attractive to Estevez's ""jock"" character... please. She's still the same girl who had massive dandruff flakes and ate a Cap'n Crunch sandwich for lunch. But aside from THAT... one of my faves, a great, funny movie that everyone should see and appreciate but probably only 80's teens like me will relish. It takes me back.",The Breakfast Club
247,suvopyne49,Joy of Freedom,9,15 July 2012,"I was dilly-dallying for quite a long time in watching this iconic John Hughes film of the eighties. I should not have done that. It's not like we haven't seen this kind of coming of age films, but still this movie is one of the best in that category mainly due to the character development that we hardly see in coming of age teen dramas.The movie starts with a fine Saturday, when five high school students were forced to be in the school as detention. The first impression when I watched the first 10-15 minutes, I thought this could be the '12 Angry Men' of High School movies, at least thematically. It didn't disappoint me and that's saying a lot. Really, a lot. These five kids are quite different from each other, and they were proud of it. But as they began to talk amongst themselves(of course conflict arose at first) slowly, predictably but pleasantly they began to open up; and then we could very well relate to the characters. Each of those kids may be from a different background, from a different class of society, but there is that feeling of hard done-by that is common between all of them. That is where John Hughes was efficacious with this film. The characters are wisely chosen too. A brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal; the movie was able to do what it was intended to do because of these polarising characters. The performances of the actors in these characters are also one of the primary reasons of the success of the movie. The young actors, members of the core group of the 'Brat Pack' of the eighties did exceptionally well in depicting the varying range of emotions in their characters. Judd Nelson, especially, as the outcast tough-guy John Bender, managed to sway between being cool and also emotionally vulnerable deftly. All in all, this movie may not be a classic in terms of technical aspects but it has the heart in it that one cannot help but feel a whooping sensation when John Bender punches the air in that iconic end scene. The excitation of freedom, one may call it.P.S. Eightees' music was really cool.",The Breakfast Club
248,CheshireCatsGrin,Ending ruined it,1,28 May 2000,"The Bowie Quote gave it more seriousness then it deserved-this movie wanted to be something great from the beginning.  Well, by the end of it I realized that what it wanted was not what it was.Yes, I knew kids like everyone of the leads.  My class (of'97) was made up of them.  But as far as realism goes-the buck stopped here.  The Sheedy character was used to show transformation at the sake of keeping her core being, the only character who was sacrificed as not good enough as she is.
Each of us probably would have seen the end a bit different, but thanks to John ""Home Alone"" Hughes we all ""see"" it the same. I felt so manipulated to feel the way Hughes wanted me to by the essay it ruined the movie forever for me.  It was used to push the end of movie as if we were all too dumb to get it (or needed it drilled into our heads like a New York sidewalk.)",The Breakfast Club
249,Kalle_it,The cliché club - an overrated high-school drama,2,1 August 2016,"The Breakfast club is still inexplicably kept in high esteem by many, likely due to the ever so present nostalgia factor. Or to bad taste in movies, I suspect.There isn't much to say about a collection of every stereotype about teenagers and high-school known to man.A gallery of stock characters talks about standard angst-ridden topics that in such movies are 100x more serious and important than they are in real life. And as if the premise and the ""development"" (I use the term very very loosely, as there's no remarkable character progression) weren't sloppy enough, we get the sudden pseudo-feelgood finale, which makes even less sense in context.The ending is baffling because it implies a new scenario which is impossible because the few changes the characters went through were literally cosmetic, and the whole conflict between social expectations and actual personalities wasn't resolved! And how could it be resolved, when the ""characters"" are paper-thin and basically are what they are?! As the saying goes, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck!So, the Breakfast club has nothing interesting to offer besides a cookie-cutter teen dramedy with bland characters and a lame ending that sort of makes the whole story arc pointless.Watch only for nostalgia value. A concept that is lost on a non-American guy who, luckily, didn't have to deal with school-sanctioned sports, proms, clubs etc. Friends and ""enemies"" were chosen by affinity, or lack thereof, not by predetermined categories.",The Breakfast Club

252,ivony,80's all the way,9,7 July 2003,"Ok, I must admit that I am a fan of the 80's genre.  From ""one-hit-wonders"" to the ""Brat Pack"" and so on, the 80's gave us a plethora of insignificant albeit esoteric trivia.  Just as those who didn't experience the 60's and 70's firsthand can never understand what living in that time meant, the same applies to those that did not grow up in the 80's.  There's a certain charm...appeal...and yes, absurdity to it all.  Often times the write-off is, ""well, it *was* the 80's"".  Indeed, it was.  And so the Breakfast Club captures much of the essence of the 80's:  teen movies with the jock, the dweeb, and the menace to society (along with some ""moral"" we're supposed to walk away from the film with).  Ok, so it really had little impact on, well, anything but that doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment value of the movie itself.Breakfast Club is chock-full of one-liners you'll hear repeated long after the point of the movie has left your brain.  These one-liners make this movie (along with many others in the 80's) worth watching.  Sure, it's predictable.  Sure, it's ""cheesy"".  And sure, it's stereotypical 80's.  But dangit, it's fun!  I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this movie, yet it's lost none of its appeal for me.

It's not really a coming of age film... at 45 this movie speaks to me, holds a mirror, and asserts that self-acceptance and sharing heals.

255,ThreeThumbsUp,Transcendent 80s comedy,7,13 December 2010,"For a film that essentially takes place in one location (the library), it's rather remarkable that The Breakfast Club earns a 7.9 rating on IMDb.This movie succeeds because of the dialogue. The channel of communication between the characters is affable as each progressively divulges in their personal lives.We begin with five disconnected characters originating from a variety of domestic and social conditions. There is the quintessential jock, nerd, bad-boy, pretty girl and weirdo loner -- all serving an 8-hour detention on a Saturday.John Bender, played by the capable Judd Nelson, conquers the spotlight for much of the initial 45 minutes, probing his fellow classmates with a variety of contemptuous verbal thrusts. Bender effectively irritates all-star wrestler Andrew (Emilio Estevez) and prissy rich-girl Claire (Molly Ringwald) to the point where Andrew informs him that if he didn't exist, no one would care. Staying loyal to his boorish reputation, Bender pretends like the comment doesn't bother him, but deep down there appears to be some deep-rooted insecurities bubbling to the surface. His contemporaries aren't the only ones verbally jousting with Bender either as principal Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) frequently clashes with him as well. ""Dick"" -- as Bender acerbically calls him -- isn't exactly revered by the rest of the crew though. In fact, it's this universal resentment of their arrogant superior that eventually bands them together. When Bender falls through the ceiling after sneaking back into the library from a locked closet in which he was banished to, Vernon comes storming in demanding who caused the ""ruckus."" With Bender hiding under a desk, each vehemently denies any involvement, effectively covering for their once despised classmate.From that point on, each character gradually begins to destroy the superficial barriers that separated them, allowing the dialogue to transform from almost entirely idle and vindictive to somewhat fruitful, albeit harsh at times.More importantly, though, we learn WHY each character is on detention instead of just WHAT got them their.The ending is somewhat cheesy and clichéd, but not enough to ruin the film.

259,OllieZ,I won't be forgetting them anytime soon.,9,11 February 2007,"In the last few weeks, I have been watching all the John Hughes films again, like Sweet Sixteen, Ferris Bueller, Some Kind Of Wonderful (he wrote it) - and it seems that The Breakfast Club provides the most thoughtful insight out of all of them.The story is simple, about 6 kids in detention on a Saturday. What ensues is a film about bonding, the fragile nature of these kids and what it means to be a teenager. In the hands of other directors, this film would have probably focused on comedy too much, to sacrifice for the lack of a ""house party"" scene. But Hughes handles the pacing well, and the film never rushes the development.The characters are all stock - at least we think. As the film progresses, the vulnerability of these kids becomes more apparent. I don't wanna ramble on too much, but this film is the best teenage comedy made in the 80's...with Ferris Bueller.Estevez, Nelson, Hall, Sheedy and Ringwald are all wonderful in this film. Sometimes too much emphasis is on Nelson, but who cares when th rest is so good.Watch it, love it.",The Breakfast Club
260,silva-w-pius,That the grass isn't always greener on the other side.,8,25 July 2014,"Serving detention on a Saturday morning is a teens absolute worst nightmare, but then also having to do it with your natural born enemies, makes medieval torture seem rather tame. But only when their worlds collide could they find out they have a lot more common than they originally might have thought; whilst also finding out that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. It should come as no surprise to find out that the king of all teen films, had to be helmed by John ""the king of the 80's Hughes"", who with the most seminal of all teen and coming of age films ever in the Breakfast club, single handedly brought a fresh teen view and perspective to the adult masses. Of course he has ventured into the world of teen films before with the likes of sixteen candles and Pretty in Pink, but in The Breakfast Club he takes it t all new conquering heights. The American high school experience is generally always coupled with the notion of clicks, your cheerleaders, nerds, geeks etc. but when you see Breakfast club with its jock, popular girl, rebel, geek and the weird girl, it is plain to see where the archetypes and labels come from. It wasn't just the outstanding pioneering accomplishments Hughes brought to BC, but it was the uncompromising honesty and heart he brought to the film as well, which is its true selling point. Throughout BC 97 minute run, it never once degrades itself into the realm of pandering to cheap stereotypes and gags just to raise a few laughs and fill screen minutes, instead it chooses to explore the painful truth of adolescence; the never being able fitting in, never seeming to be good enough or never being able to comply with your parents ideals and their suffocating high expectations no matter how hard you try. Being a teenager can at times be about struggling to find 'self' when you don't know what 'self' is and being crushed by the weight of endless possibilities. Whilst at the other end of the spectrum it can be about having the world at your feet inviting you desperately to explore it in its entire splendour, as well allowing you to become the very definition of care free. So it was this fine exploration of the paradoxes and delicate balance of adolescence that Breakfast Club was so effectively able delve into, leaving a profound after effect on not only me, not even a whole generation, but on cinema itself. What I loved best about BC, was the verve and energy all the young actors brought to their roles, but trying to choose a favourite amongst the five main characters, is like trying to choose your favourite child, because each of them has found an equal place in my heart. Another aspect of the film I simply adored was the heart wrenching closing scene when despite everyone objections, popular girl Claire bursts everyone bubble by telling the painful truth, that no matter how strong they thought they bonded with each other, the fact remained that because they are all from different clicks at school, come Monday they would go back to being merely passing strangers in the school halls again just to save face in front of each of their friends. I've watched the film 4 times already, but as long as my computer keeps on working and the DVD keeps on playing, then I'm going to keep on watching.",The Breakfast Club

262,moviemachine,Awesome 80's!!,10,24 January 2002,"""The Breakfast Club"" is a movie about those five high school students getting Saturday detention. Emilio Estevez plays a jock, Anthony Michael Hall plays a nerd, Judd Nelson plays a criminal, Ally Sheedy plays a weirdo, and Molly Ringwald plays a prom queen. This movie is very funny. My favorite part is when Judd Nelson was hiding inside the top school roof from the principal, but fell down. That was funny. See this movie, it's great.

263,Nothinggrandproductions,An insightful comedy into the mind of teenagers,10,16 October 2013,"I've been on a bit of John Hughes kick, so expect even more reviews of his movies after this one. The Breakfast Club is my second favorite flick of his, a beautiful film that really gets into the mind of the teenager without even an ounce of belittlement. It just is. It displays what they are in a way that shows they are more than just a bunch of kids reflected in the conversations they have and the unfortunate way Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason), the school assistant principal, views them all (which I think shows the way plenty of adults view teenagers). It follows five teenagers who are sitting Saturday detention together and all come from different backgrounds. The ""criminal,"" John Bender (Judd Nelson), ""athlete,"" Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), ""brain,"" Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), ""basket case,"" Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy), ""princess,"" Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald). At least that's what they are on an extremely superficial level. It follows their time together on that Saturday that changed their lives, from having self-realizations and realizing how similar they truly are regardless of their clichés or stereotypes. To me, this is one of the defining movies about teenagers as were many of Hughes' films and they have remained timeless to this day. He shows that everyone has similarities regardless of what they are labeled as. Everyone has problems and bad things that happen to them especially at a young age where we are nothing but confused as to what we are and want to identify with something. From the opening piece of narration by Anthony Michael Hall's character to the finishing narration that completes said opening and the wonderful final shot as ""Don't You Forget About Me"" by Simple Minds plays, this movie is nothing but a delight. It's filled with plenty of comedic moments and in reality, most of the film takes place in one room which really shows the talent in this film. It relied solely on the actors and the writing, and it just works so well. Each actor plays their role to perfection especially Judd Nelson who is always the standout in this film as the stubborn punk/rebel. If anything, this is another prime example of how much Hughes' understands teenagers and wanted to show the world that they are real human beings, not just a bunch of dumb kids. Sure, they may do stupid things but plenty of adults are just as bad as said teenagers. Overall, people are different but that doesn't mean they aren't the same in many ways, that's the true key to this film, everyone has problems even if they are a criminal, athlete, brain, basket case, or a princess, labels just make them seem to be something they aren't.",The Breakfast Club
264,svendaly,Still works as the dysfunctional teen movie,7,13 July 2020,"Yes it's dated in many ways but equally still holds that mirror up to we are all different in childhood, no nothing of others' circumstances and will ignore and be cruel to people who could be friends just to ""save face"" in front of our crowd of friends.
The simple bleakness of the empty Saturday school provides a previously unnoticed desolation - and the connection between preposterous titmangle Judd Nelson and Ringwald seemed believable. The Cinderella/princess conversion of Sheedy less so, and we must excuse the rock video montage as fist pump climax as de rigeur for the genre",The Breakfast Club

It's probably not the most realistic if we're being honest, but sometimes wish fulfillment films can be great, too. Imagine how much better the world would be if we simply listened to one another and realized that we're all in more or less the same boat?

267,chimera3,Coming of Age in the 1980's,10,15 September 2017,"Even though I was born in the latter part of the 1980's, this still speaks to me. John Hughes knew what he was talking about when he made this timeless classic. My middle brother watched this in high school (when he was a sophomore or junior, I can never remember which) and he came home talking about it until he was blue in the face. In all honesty, I had never even heard of the movie before he started talking about it. Once the two of us sat down to watch it, I could see what he was talking about...and I loved it. Just about every high school out there has their distinct cliques, whether they are in a public high school or a private high school. Cliques find you whether you want them to or not. In my opinion, this was the go-to high school movie before ""Mean Girls"" was even an idea. Kids today should really sit down and watch this movie, regardless if they find it ""old"" like certain kids do. Once they get a taste of this, they will never go back. That is almost a guarantee.",The Breakfast Club
268,magicsinglez,When I think about this movie today I notice more how Brian (the nerd) is the true 'victim' here,10,25 October 2006,"Breakfast Club is one of the most beloved movies. All the action takes place pretty much in one room. The 'action' consists of kids talking to each other. I've seen the Breakfast Club many times over the years - if the movie were playing right now - I could mouth along and do the lines of each character. I notice completely different things about this movie over time. Maybe we look at the world around us based upon the previous information we've been given. We've been informed that being a victim doesn't make one timid, but the opposite, tough or pious. In a world where everyone 'reaches to grab the lowest rung of the ladder' (the lowest rung of the victim ladder) I think the focus of this movie is on John (stereotyped as the criminal). John's a bad-boy. His family is poor. He's abused at home by his dad. At one point in the movie Claire (the princess) says of John, ""Just ignore him"". John replies, ""You couldn't ignore me if you tried"" When I think about this movie today I notice more how Brian (the nerd) is the true 'victim' here (of course the movie is trying to make a point that they are all victims). Brian doesn't get the girl. John and Andy (the jock) often treat Brian as completely irrelevant. Even the school principle, caught up in events, refers to Brian as 'peewee' a couple of times.It only took me 20 years to notice, and, I'm a nerd myself. A society obsessed with victim-hood should at least get right who the victims are.The song that went with the movie was, 'Don't You Forget About Me' by Simple Minds. I think, in the end, I always remember Brian - the other kids asking him to do their assignments; in a sense, asking Brian to speak up for them - Claire saying, 'We trust you'. Guess they need the nerd-guy after all.",The Breakfast Club
269,Rayvyn,One of the most memorable 80s high school films...,10,16 August 2002,"I was one year from graduation when this film came out. I don't remember seeing it at the movies but I did watch it on cable numerous times. It is probably the best John Hughes film. The premise of the film was a group of students in detention on Saturday. The Breakfast Club was comprised of the full spectrum of high school going species. There was the jock, the popular girl, the stoner, the nerd and that weird girl that kept to herself and nobody talked to. These kids from different walks of life who should never be friends bonded and became friends at least for that day. It was moving to see them talk to each other about their problems and bond. It was cool the way they all banded together against the biggest ass of a teacher in the school. One of the most memorable things about the movie was the song. Simple Mind's `Don't You Forget About Me' was perfect and I can't hear that song without thinking of `The Breakfast Club'. Though I totally like the movie they did leave it somewhat incomplete. The question of whether they would still be friends on Monday or would they just stick to their own group. I wish they had made a sequel or just answered that question.`The Breakfast Club' is truly an American classic. I'm buying the DVD.Rayvyn",The Breakfast Club

271,E-un,The BEST John Hughes movie... the BEST 80's movie!,10,11 August 2000,"I love John Hughes' work.  That I have to say to begin with... but when I learned that this movie was all set in ONE place I had serious misgivings. I just hoped it wouldn't be tediouos.  How wrong could I be..?  This is such an intense movie, that it has you on the edge of your seat throughout.  Not bad for a movie with almost NO action. Secondly, even as someone who grew up in Britain, I can still relate to these kids.  The moral I think is that everyone has their own problems whether rich or poor, successful or a failure... and the old adage that the grass is greener but that it really isn't is one aspect of this movie.Thirdly, the dialogue is excellent; the script is so awesome and never fails to deliver.  It is so true, so profound and very believeable.  There is little schmaltz and we are left wondering if there is a happy ending at all...Fourthly, the acting in this movie is of the best calibre considering the average age of the cast.  Emilio is par for his usual course, Ringwald is superb, Hall plays the subdued academic geek too well, but the real winners here are Nelson and Sheedy... especially the latter with her very convincing portrayal of a basket-case.This movie is in my Top Ten.

272,Lunchbox-8,"Featuring a star-filled cast, excellent plot and dialogue, this is one of the greatest eighties movies.",10,4 June 2000,"""The Breakfast Club"" will forever be remembered as one of the greatest films for many reasons.  This seemingly simple plot thickens as the story unfolds. ""The Breakfast Club"" displays many popular features that most 80's teen movies possess.  For example, all of the young main characters are full of an attribute that seemed so often confronted in 80's movies that it defined many characters in movies from that decade.  Angst.  That simple word describes a feeling that every main character experienced for reasons not too diverse.  Angst is felt in this film's characters and is directed primarily towards teachers, school, and, of course, parents.  As each character explained their troubles to each other they realized how similar they were.  With a star-studded cast including Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael hall, Emilio Esteves, and, of course, Judd Nelson, this movie is easily summarized as magnificent.  Judd Nelson is featured in his most famous role as a bully, criminal, and typical high-school punk which every adult, young or old, can easily relate to.  With his seemingly simple personality he is used as the comic-relief as well as the individual who triggers character conversations.  These hilarious and somewhat immature conversations are really the glue which holds together this fabulous movie. The deep explanation of these multifaceted characters is exceptional.  The audience could easily relate to the troubles and pain that each character experienced. The main individuals featured in this picture each developed to understand each other and to think differently of themselves.  To truly experience the 80's, see this film and be amazed.",The Breakfast Club

Critical moments of the movie seemed forced, lazy, or stilted. But besides those faults I moderately enjoyed this movie. I just saw it on USA for the first time in about 15 years.

Even if you like someone as a person if they're in a different cliche high school won't let you 'hang out' more or less.

The film was so good in so many ways: the writing, the directing, the casting, the soundtrack all blended into the perfect recipe for a classic unforgettable portrayal of how savage high school can be. The acting was amazing when you consider the ages of the actors and how sensitively they portrayed their characters. And I cannot imagine a better theme song than the one chosen from Simple Minds for purposes of driving home a valid and many times overlooked part of a teenager's life: feeling invisible, unimportant, lost, and alone with the fear that they are the only person it is all happening to and that nobody would understand or care if they knew. It happened to all of us, regardless of whether we were the beauty queen, the geek, the jock, the nut, or the criminal...we dealt with parents, teachers, bullies, self-doubt, triumphs, joys, and first loves in the hallways and corridors of high school. If anyone denies that fact, they are lying to themselves. Thankfully, someone remembered all of it and made their memories into a classic film to let us all know we have not been forgotten. It is in this way that art imitates life, and changes us all. I hope nobody ever tries to re-make this perfect film.",The Breakfast Club
283,WilderMovieReviews,A timeless classic.,10,18 March 2012,"I decided to review this film mainly as an excuse to see the film again (although it's only a few months since I last saw it).The description of the film sounds awful. Five students get a detention! Seriously what kind of film is that and what strings did the director, producer and writer, the late John Hughes, have to pull the get it made? Most of the cast were relative unknowns, up and coming stars including Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy and Paul Gleason. The film is set almost in one location over the course of one Saturday. It is hardly the formula for a great movie. But for some reason the film turns out to be amazing. It went on to become the 16th highest grossing film of 1985 (the top film that year was Back to the Future). It is a true master class in film making. It shows what you can accomplish with the right script and the actors who can bring the characters to life. The cast is perfect, every one of them brings something great to the film from the teacher in charge of the detention, to the janitor. But for me the stand out performance is from Judd Nelson's performance as John Bender. At the time Judd Nelson was 25 playing a 17/18 year old, but it took the maturity of age to play such a troubled and messed up character. A character who's tough exterior hides the anguish of abuse. His is the most interesting journey in the film.The performances in it are so good because of the rest of the cast. Each actor feeds off the other actors performances and every one of them is better for it. This is what many films are missing, a great young talented cast putting it all out there. Other films that use this include The Outsiders, Young Guns, Red Dawn and St. Elmo's Fire (coincidentally all apart from Red Dawn star Emilio Estevez but it does star his brother Charlie Sheen so I guess it must be in their genes!).I absolutely love this film. It is in my top movies of all time and I never get bored watching it.If you haven't seen this film please give it a go. It is a true love it or hate it film. A film that can be watched over and over. A timeless classic.",The Breakfast Club
284,matt_tawesson-1,Great high school flick of the '80's!!!!,10,2 June 2006,"This movie came out in 1985, the year that I started kindergarten at the age of five. I did not see this movie when it first came out. I had first seen this movie on TV (I assume on the Encore channel) in the early 90's, when it was a fairly recent movie and not quite ten years old. After my first seeing of this movie, I really liked it. The characters were quite remarkable. It's about five high school students who end up having to sacrifice a Saturday of their weekend to serve a detention in the school library. These characters come from different backgrounds and have their own differences in life like most other high schoolers. When they got together at the beginning of their detention, they hardly knew each other, but hours later, they get to know one another and touch each other's lives in a very special way. These characters range from: a prom princess, a basket case, a jock (athlete), a nerd, and a criminal. Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, and Judd Nelson play these roles (in this respective order). Paul Gleason (who passed away a few days ago; God bless him) played the principal of the school supervising the students in detention. This could be a comedy in some respects depending on how you see the characters (I say it is in my opinion). The dialog is funny, even though it is graphic and descriptive on certain occasions. My favorite character is John Bender. He is funny, even though he was the type of person who lived a demeaning life with a lack of love and respect. I like the other characters a lot as well, especially Mr. Vernon (Paul Gleason's character). He was the one who would not take or tolerate any inappropriate kind of nonsense from anyone (obviously, no principal should, of course). I liked the scene where Vernon tells off Bender in the storage room for acting like such a smart a** in front of the other students. The next scene where John falls through the ceiling after telling the explicit blonde joke was a riot. The scene at the beginning of the movie where he spits up in the air and catches it back in his mouth was so gross. I can't stand seeing some people doing that; it makes me cringe and almost gag. I never ever spat when I was in high school. Totally inappropriate!! The characters were funny to some extent. I also loved the soundtrack music to this movie, especially the Simple Minds track, ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"", which is heard in a slightly different way in here than the regular radio version on the soundtrack album. This is the kind of movie that you can watch remembering your days (good and bad) as a high schooler.",The Breakfast Club

Damn, the whole school would be on lockdown and the kid would be in handcuffs lickity split. That's actually a minor and overlooked story element in the 1985 hit film ""The Breakfast Club,"" in which five kids from different cliques are required to attend Saturday in-school suspension. I just rewatched the movie and was surprised when the dorky character played by Anthony Michael Hall tells his classmates he had failed a project in Shop Class, which is why he brought the gun to school and got Saturday suspension. The other kids were dumbfounded that it would even be possible to fail a shop project, or that it would matter enough to be depressed or angry. The gun part of the story barely registered with them at all. When The Breakfast Club was released in 1985 the Columbine massacre was still 14 years away, and a short in-school suspension seemed like a completely reasonable way to deal with a depressed kid bringing a loaded gun to school.

Basically it's a film about people coming out of their stereotypes, in this case five typical high school examples, the jock, the criminal, the nerd, the princess and the basketcase. All the actors do extremely well in their roles while John Hughes' direction adds brilliantly to the changing mood of the film.The film is more like a stage play, for the most part it takes place in one room and allows the actors to explore their roles and expand on them.

288,Bats_Breath,"""The Kids haven't Changed, YOU HAVE""",10,27 June 2003,"I think this line by John Hughes in The Breakfast Club really hit the nail on generational gaps.  Keep in mind it was written back in 1983 or 1984. The principal played Paul Gleason, thinks that his students are the worst kids ever.  Carl the wise janitor tells him otherwise.Principal Vernon: ""Carl I've been teaching for 22 years, and each year....these kids get more and more arrogant!""Carl the Janitor: ""Awww bullsh*t man.  Come on Vern, the kids haven't changed, you have!!""Principal Vernon: ""These kids turned on me.  They think I'm a big f*cking joke""Carl the Janitor: ""Come on.  Listen Vern, if you were 16, what would YOU think of YOU!!?????""
EVERYONE take a long pause and think about this scene.  Think about the words written by John Hughes around 1983/'84.  Kids don't change, WE do.  We get older.  Kids get older.  Kids become adults, adults become anal and uptight about everything.  But a new batch of kids come along, and they are still.....well kids.  So all you people ragging on the kids today, oh come on now.  Shut up about how awful the kids today are, and how violent and messed up they are. ""These kids today, all they do is hang out at the mall, play video games and shoot each other"".  My god the same thing was said about teenagers back in 1983.  So all you former 80's high school grads, and even many 90's high school grads, stop acting like crusty old Principal Vernon.  Gen Xers were the whipping boys for the Baby Boomers for years, and now here we are putting down the next crop of kids, the Gen Y and Gen Z.  Even most teenagers and pre-teens today buy into the nonsense that they have changed and are so different and original with their bad ass selves.  Kids are kids, no matter what era.  I mean I was an early-mid 1990's teenager, and even many kids around today think they are so different from when I was a kid some 7-12 years ago.     Do we really want to be Principal Vernon?  Kids don't change, we do.",The Breakfast Club
289,wakemeup36,Bleh,3,20 December 2009,"So this is it? One of the most acclaimed and praised movies of the 80s? This?! I'm not sure I'm watching the same movie as all these folks so positive about this one.It tries to be very deep an meaningful but to be honest, it really goes nowhere. We have a pretentious bully, a spoilt daddy's girl, sports guy, a nerd and of course, a retard all in detention. What happens throughout the movie? In the beginning, they just have random scuffles with one another. And later, they open up to each other and basically talk and rant about their incredibly clichéd teenage problems. Hmmm, didn't you guys hate each other like 2 seconds ago? And then there's the stupid note, which is also supposed to be very in depth, towards the teacher who put them in detention which reads: 'You see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal. Correct?' Yeah, and even after the movie is over I see you as the exact same people, except perhaps the bully, who was also probably the only interesting guy in the whole movie but his character too was ruined towards the end. And, there is a scene where all of these idiots start dancing to synth rock music for no reason inside the school. How the hell did they find rock music inside the school while in detention anyway? Plus, the ending is completely idiotic and unbelievable.The worst thing about the movie is that I don't feel anything for any of the students. I mean, they could've dropped dead any second in the movie and I wouldn't have given a rat's ass. As this is a drama, we're actually supposed to feel for them in at least one way or another. Well, I didn't. And it's not that I have a stone cold heart. The last scene of 'Up' put me on the verge of tears. I fail to see why this movie couldn't do something that would make most people feel emotionally attached to the characters.Even if the overall idea of the movie isn't that bad, the execution seems completely terrible to me. The acting, cinematography etc. might be good but the overall plot does not come together well at all.",The Breakfast Club
290,Spinetinglers,"We're all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all.",10,27 February 2008,"Ah the eighties  a simpler time. A time when James Cameron was the greatest Sci-fi director out there (he had not even begun his obsession with the Titanic). A time when bright, almost neon, colours and big hair were in. A time when Ferris Bueller had made cutting school into an art form and Judd Nelson was the coolest guy on the planet! The Breakfast Club is not just another teenage movie, it is the teenage movie! (Even though the average age of the actors in the movie would have been about 25). I think you have to see it when you're a teenager to really appreciate it. Anyone who sees it when they are in their thirties or later, like Richard Vernon, (the teacher in charge of the unruly group of teenagers) has already forgotten what it was like to have raging hormones and bad hair.You could argue that it is a movie by numbers, giving you all the elements and characters that teenagers can relate to. You have in the simplest terms and most convenient definitions a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Everyone one of us can relate to one of these characters (personally, I was the basket case). You have snappy dialogue, a very uncool and intolerant authority figure, in the guise of Paul Gleason, demonstrating the generation gap perfectly. Lots of pretty people to satisfy those raging hormones. You also have all the major topics that teenagers are most concerned about discussing, losing your virginity, parental oppression, and school status to name but a few.The Breakfast Club is a film that I will make sure that my children watch when they are teenagers, and hopefully they will appreciate it as much as I did.

I'm far and away a Clubber. Watching this film now, I definitively find parts of it tacky and little overdone. However, you can't deny that it spoke for its generation and it serves it purpose: to demonstrate the hardships of growing up (especially in high school when your adulthood is taking shape) and of course, John Hughes' very blantent stereotyping that represents the different walks of life that we come into contact with on a daily basis. Not the most sophisticated of concepts, but the setting and cast make it interesting.It's sort of strange, but I've seen this film listed as both a comedy and a drama. I'd have a hard time making that distinction too, unless a ""80s Teen Anthem"" category becomes a reality in the near future. I'll always have a place in my heart for this movie (probably helps that I was 12 when I first saw it!) and it's still a great movie for people to see. Judd Nelson's role alone is worth the watch.

293,mauricepfeife,Great but not perfect,8,7 March 2017,"(Sorry for my English, I'm German) The breakfast club is not a perfect movie to me. It is kind of predictable, the fact, that Andrew gets together with Allison just because she looks pretty now ruins a part of the message. The acting is good, but sometimes kind of overacted (but I think it is part of the style of the movie). But what makes the movie so enjoyable for me are the excellent written characters and the way they are presented. At first, there is the introduction, (kind of) the exposition. Different (stereo)types of people are described. And the 5 main characters are perfectly fitting into these types. But as the movie goes on, it challenges you to overthink it. Every character breaks out of his role and when you are almost sure, everý character tells the reason why he is there and gives the character a touching background. (Making you being sure in your thesis) Added to that, the whole group starts to like each other, even though they didn't like each other in the first place. That shows you can not judge people by the first impression. Moreover you shouldn't just separate people into different types (stereotyped thinking), and that's it with learning more of each other. The whole story is full of funny, smart and characterizing dialogue, which I also love. There are two things I wanna say about the ending: 1. I don't like Andrew and Allison getting together at the end, just because she looks pretty now. Because it is said that you should not judge one by his outter appearance. And Andrew is totally doing that at the end. 2. Am I the only one thinking about John being an undercover agent who was just there to teach everybody the lesson they all learn eventually? Because at the end he holds his arm in the air like he did something incredible (Ok it could be because of the nice day he had but maybeeeeee) However, very good movie because of the outstanding characters, message and dialogue, even if you kinda know after the first 5 minutes where the whole thing is going. 8.3/10",The Breakfast Club

I loved it, in fact, and i wouldn't mind watching it again. So, why didn't i give it the perfect score? You might ask. Let me tell you why:Characters: the shift in attitude was portrayed unrealistically.Dialogue: for a movie with limited shooting space, dialogue is what counts the most. I didn't get how the flow of dialogues would sometimes -again with the word- shift so unnaturally, one second they're all being friendly towards each other, the next they're yelling and someone is crying!Genre: is it a comedy? Not funny enough. Is it a drama? Not dramatic enough. Like i said, it was... something. What thing? I don't know but it is an experience alright.",The Breakfast Club
295,Snatchy,A Grand Slam,10,3 October 1998,"Before degenerating into a hack of the teen-comedy genre he helped create in the 80's, director/writer John Hughes crafted this hilarious and surprisingly thoughtful tale.  Five teenagers, each representing a different clique in their high school, are forced to spend an entire Saturday in detention together for various infractions each has committed--some of which become central to the plot, as the characters gradually become aware that they share more in common with each other than their stereotypes and preconceived notions would ever allow.There's a minimalistic feel to the movie that helps maintain its focus on the characters; there are essentially only two other speaking parts of any significance outside of the five teens--the antagonistic school principal, Mr. Vernon, as well as a small part played by the school's janitor (who, if you look quickly, can be seen in the movie's opening sequence in an old photograph, presumably taken years ago when he was a student, hung on the school's wall declaring him ""Man of the Year"").  Adults over 30 might cringe at the unsympathetic and incomplete portrayal of Mr. Vernon, but it's a movie about the teen experience and rarely has it been captured so accurately on film.The acting is uniformly excellent.  Judd Nelson gives a brilliant performance as ""the criminal"", John Bender.  He's clearly the star of the movie, baiting the others to react to his crude behavior and acidic wit. This role put Nelson on the Hollywood map, but his subsequent roles never approached the heights he acheives here.  Molly Ringwald, the darling of John Hughes' 80's work, is solid as ""the princess"", Emilio Estevez shows more depth than the rest of his movies combined as ""the jock"", Anthony Michael Hall is eminently believable as ""the brain"" (and the only one that really looks like a teenager), and Ally Sheedy is okay as ""the basketcase"", although she has the most under-written role in the movie--which, as it turns out, is in keeping with the character.  This movie still holds up well 13 years after its release, and after meeting these characters for one fateful Saturday it will leave you wondering...what are they doing now?  It's perhaps better not to know, it's enough just to enjoy it for what it is.",The Breakfast Club
296,Andy B-8,One of John Hughes' best,10,25 August 1999,"I have liked most of the films that have come from John Hughes but The Breakfast Club is one of his best.It stands out because the premise is so simplistic and the entertainment relies heavily on just the dialogue between the kids in detention (unlike say, Home Alone).  There are lots of memorable quotes from it (is this where Bart Simpson picked up the phrase ""Eat My Shorts""?). Out of all of them Judd Nelson comes off best as the student with the big mouth but with a soft heart by the end of the movie.It's the quintessential 80's teen movie that still holds up quite well as good entertainment almost a decade and a half later.",The Breakfast Club

The mathematician in me says that there are 10 ways to make a pair from five people and I'd guess there are 10 major scenes, if you can catch my drift. I have to say that the scene with the broken glass was just pants. However, it could be seen as a 'trainer' movie, and as such it's quite a good one.If you're ~15 years old - see this movie.

298,RueMorgue,The cream of the crop in 80's fare.,10,30 May 2000,"This movie is one of the best, if not THE best, 80's film there is.  The fact is, every teen character in this movie can be related to someone we knew in high-school.  As a child of the 80's, I can honestly say that this is a representative cross-section of every high school in North America. The geek, the jock, the outcast, the rich pretty-girl snob, and the future criminal.  They all exist, to some degree or another, in the classrooms of every high school on the continent.What makes this film rise above the rest is the character development. Every character in this film is three-dimensional.  They all change, in one way or another, by the end of the film.  Whether or not things remain the way they are long after this film ends is unknown, and that adds to the rama.  The most important scene in this film is when the characters, as a group, all open up to one-another and describe the hell that their daily school routines are in a personal fashion.  Nobody likes the role they must inevitably portray in the high-school scene, but the fact is, it is often inescapable.  This film gives the viewer some insight into how the other people around them might have felt during that particular time in their lives.Each of the main characters in this film shines, but Judd Nelson (John Bender) and Emilio Estevez (Andrew Clark) rise above the rest.  Simply put, these two actors each put their heart and soul into their respective characters, and it shows.At the end of the film, the viewer is left to make their own conclusions as to how things will carry forth.  And I'm sure that most people will do that. This is one movie that left me feeling both happy and sad for each of the characters, and it isn't easy to make me care about a film in that way.

299,mckaymalcolm,Still Worth watching in 2021,7,21 March 2021,"I was 14 in 1984 and this film didn't really grab me back then; however, as an adult now I decided to revisit it and thoroughly enjoyed it.
First off - it's not a comedy. There some humorous moments that work and some that definitely don't work.
Where the film really hits the mark is when we begin to see the background from which these 5 kids come.
Initially we are presented with them as being poles apart in terms of their academic achievements, physical abilities or artistic talents but as the movie progresses each character reveals a bit more about their relationship with their parents - and how they themselves are affected by either their parents expectations of them or their parents maltreatment of them.
The film really comes together when they begin to realise that they all share this common theme.Looking at it through a 21st century lens, and given the characters are schoolchildren- some of the script can be uncomfortable to listen to and watch, and would certainly not even be considered if it were made now, but If you understand that it was 1984- and we thought quite differently then, you will definitely come away with a very positive experience from having watched this.",The Breakfast Club

The plot is extremely original and the tempo and storyline are just fantastic. Disregarding useless Hollywood monikers (such as ""the brat pack""), each cast member creates a memorable character perception while, at the same time, contributing to a wonderful ensemble effort. Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Allie Sheedy, and Mollie Ringwald each turn in what may be the best performances of their respective career. The story centers on a Saturday morning detention session in a Chicago high school involving 5 radically different students each suffering from a unique form of peer pressure. Paul Gleeson turns in a very convincing performance as the detention dean. This film has depth, emotion, humor and a soundtrack that fits to perfection. A must see !!!",The Breakfast Club
301,TheDragonTrader,Came of age well,7,27 April 2021,"Five different students that have never spoken before, are forced to spend 8 hours with each other in the library of their high school in detention. The first hours are somewhat awkward and ill at ease, but as they learn more about each other they start to connect in a most profound way.The main cast of this movie is absolutely astonishing and their chemistry is unmatched. Still in their late teens or early twenties, as I am now, when this was shot they manage to tap into that youthful liveliness with its all-time highs and all-time lows. Their dialogues are snappy and quick-witted - even in scenes that were improvised - and feel very much true to life. And the great fun of this movie lies in the fact that, even after 35 years, the stereotypes and the behaviours of the students are still very recognisable.The comedy is light-hearted and timeless with its clever punchlines and slap-stick-like actions. The drama goes deep and touches on difficult subjects such as abuse, neglect and the pressure young people feel being put upon them by adults. John Hughes (director) manages to blend the two brilliantly, although the film could have done with a more even spread.There are times though, where the dialogues start to take over the movie and the director forgets to reinforce the story with cinematography, sound design... but the soundtrack is legendary and as 80's as they come. Furthermore, the costumes of each character is perfect; we only need one glance at the characters to know who they are.The Breakfast Club is by no means Oscar-material, but timeless and part of movie history. It hits home, even today, and cracks a smile with even the most sour spectator. It is part of my parent's youth and now it's also part of mine.",The Breakfast Club

304,EJBaggaley,The next screw that falls out is going to be you!,8,20 February 2005,"The Breakfast club is one of the best teen movies ever made. Although this film is low budget, I found this film to be very precise and realistic to what high school environments are all about. Its about five high school students that attend a high school detention session one Saturday and all became good friends by the end of the session.What I found realistic about this film is how the director John Hughes managed to include every social class that children have in the high school environment. You've got Brian Johnson (Michael Anthony Hall) the nerd, John Bender(Judd Nelson) as the rebel punk, Claire Standish(Molly Ringwold) as the prude, Allison Reynolds(Ally Sheely) as the weirdo and Andrew Clarke (Emilio Estevez) as the jock. You even have Richard Vernon as the strict angry teacher(Paul Gleason) which stereotypes a typical example of an American teacher. What I also liked about this film was the brilliant acting, especially Judd Nelson who played John Bender for without him this film wouldn't have been half as good as it was. Although he was a punk, I found his persona quite cool and yet funny in the ways he behaved with his piers and his teacher Richard Vernon. Even though John Bender was in the wrong with Mr. Vernon and how Mr. Vernon got the best of him, I did respect John for standing up for himself against his teacher and for getting the best of Mr. Vernon by escaping from the room he was locked up in by Mr. Vernon and without Mr. Vernon knowing about it. I loved the scene when he yelled out to Mr. Vernon f**k you when Mr.Vernon left the room. Anyway, if you haven't seen this film then you should definitely watch it, for I believe the moral of this film is that whatever social class your apart of whether your a nerd, a jock, a prude, a weirdo or a rebel, we're all the same, no persons better than the next.",The Breakfast Club

Only Ally Sheedy comes off great, she seems to be playing a character that is unrecognizable in the Hughes Cannon- perhaps distantly related to 'Drummer Girl' from SKOW. This is a film that takes itself SERIOUSLY and begs you too as well. Very much of it's time- it feels dated- but the interesting thing is watching Hughes grow as a film maker.

John Hughes later started to be even more popular because of such of his pictures as: ""Home Alone"" (1990), ""Curly Sue"" (1991), ""Beethoven"" (1992) and other movies that became cult hits. Emilio Estevez, Paul Gleason, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy played six main roles. This movie earned $51.5 million, whereas its budget was $1 million.When five high school students once stayed at school on Saturday morning as a school punishment, they didn't realize that they would get closer to each other by speaking about their lives.This is an emotional movie about teenagers' lives with addictive plot twists. The life stories of the main characters open up to moviegoers gradually, provoking strong feelings. The movie raises and discloses many social topics. Teenagers deal with these topics and many others that have an impact on their lives and they cope with problems in their own ways. Even though the movie was released in 1985, the topics that were revealed in the movie are actual for the contemporary society and for current generations too.Written by Anastasiia Shystovska",The Breakfast Club

313,Idolprincess,One of the best movies about teenagers,7,16 June 2004,"It's hard for me to review a classic movie like this one. Even though it's not a perfect movie, it did an excellent job at explaining what being in high school is all about. I've been a child and a teenager in the 90's so I never had the chance to watch this great movie when it came out. I also had to endure all of the painful and unrealistic teen movies and soap operas of the 90's that were often set on glamorizing high school life or preaching to teenagers about serious topics such as teen pregnancy. I'm not saying that any of these movies or TV series were bad. They just weren't about teenagers. They were about models in their 20's who acted like idiots. Or they were written by adults in order to pass certain messages to teenagers.
What is so great about The Breakfast Club is that it brings to life many characters that are completely different. The ""high school stereotypes"" is something that's still present even today. The stereotypes might be a little different, but after watching this movie, we realize it was this way even in the 80's. This is an aspect of high school life that was never discussed in movies. As a teenager, when I first saw this movie, I immediately thought that it probably helped teens in the 80's understand their peers better. It can also help adults understand why teenagers can act certain ways.But this movie does not preach to us. A proof of this is that the parents are accused for putting so much pressure on their children and making them become the stereotypes that they are now. In fact, all adults in this movie have a negative image, which is something I liked. In most modern teen TV series, there is always a teacher or a parental figure who makes the teenagers learn something. The adults are ""always right"". However, in real life, it's not necessarily like this. Parents and other adults can also be a negative influence to their children and sometimes mistreat them. John Hughes understood that. It wasn't a perfect movie, of course. By example, certain scenes were silly and over the top, and the acting wasn't perfect. But isn't this what made the charm of this movie?",The Breakfast Club

I watched it for the first time, exactly 15 years after it was made, and I must admit, this movie is great.I was going to vote for this movie, and I couldn't decide wether I'd give it a 9 or a 10, but I thought that if the vote was based on the first thought that gets to your mind just after you finish watching the movie, I'd have to rate the movie with a 10, because the first thing I said to myself after watching it, was ""I liked this movie... I liked it a lot"".Sometimes it's fun for me to see actors when they were pretty young. I am used to see those actors now, in these years, but 15 years ago they looked pretty different.All the actors and actresses, Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy and Anthony Michael Hall, were great. Each actor, pretty young by that time, gave a very convincent performance.Not many people participate in this movie, just about 7. And the movie is always developed in the same place, the same atmosphere, but the dialogs and the discussions are awesome.For a teenager, like me, watching this movie would be really good, because I believe you can learn something from it. And even if you are an adult, you can also learn something from it.All those kids were in trouble for different reasons. And all had problems with their families. One of the kid's father wanted him to be number one at everything. Other father wanted his boy to get the best grades, and wont accept a bad grade. Other father gives his daughter everything. other gives his son nothing, oh, right, he gave him a pack of cigarettes for Christmas.Kids in different social positions, get to spend a whole Saturday locked up at school. They get to know each other pretty well, after a lot of tears dropped and stories told. But along with all that, there were many laughs and everybody got out pretty happy.And the essay they were supposed to write, which Anthony M. Hall wrote all by himself, was excellent.

316,mateusolivotti,A Perfect Portrait Of Adolescence,8,28 October 2020,"The Breakfast Club is a drama and comedy film released in 1985. The film tells the story of five young people with very different personalities who, being placed in detention at school on a Saturday, are forced to meet and thus form a strong bond of friendship. .The strength of this film is impressive, I was born 20 after the release of the film and even so it marked my childhood a lot. He can portray adolescence very well, even in just 97 minutes of viewing, the characters are great and can make you even moved by the relationship of the five.This film is part of the line of teen films by director John Hughes, which launched in the eighties: Ferris Buller's Day Off, Sixteen Candles and of course The Breakfast Club.However much this film has marked me a lot, I have to admit that it is not perfect. The feature has some slightly unnecessary and meaningless scenes (like when they start dancing out of nowhere), some exaggerations and clichés. But it is a remarkable film, funny, captivating and fun, even with some mistakes in my view.",The Breakfast Club

And that is what is great about the film. The issues may not seem deep to adults who have mortgages etc. But there is still something that teenagers (whether in the 80s, 90s or 00s) see of themselves in this movie, that have kept it as a cult classic.The Breakfast Club joins Grease and a few other late 70s/ early to mid 80s films that many of us in our 20s to 30s can quote line for line...",The Breakfast Club

319,Brian-97,A great teen movie,8,29 January 1999,"""The Breakfast Club"" is one of the great teen movies of the movies.  John Hughes is an underrated director.  His films all seem to have their own followings.  This film however is one of his best.  It explores the relationship and lives of five stereotypical high school students spending Saturday school together in the school's library.  Molly Ringwald is well cast here in an early role as well as her co-star from ""Sixteen Candles"", Anthony Michael Hall.  They are both good.  Judd Nelson shines as John Bender, the rebel of the group and Ally Sheedy is excellent as the shy girl. Emilio Estevez is also believeable in his role as well.  Overall this movie is full of wit and humor.  Overall Grade: B+",The Breakfast Club
320,caamich,True to teenage life and the hardships that go along with it.,10,3 December 2000,"This film shows quite eloquently the peer pressure, cruelty, and hardships that teenagers face on a day-to-day basis.  It's a very hard time in life when you're pulled in several directions by the child inside, by the adult outside, and by the expectations others have of you.  I think this film is the foundation for the ""Scared Straight"" shows on television that expose teenagers to what will happen if they drink too much, smoke, commit suicide, etc.  It's all about sacrificing yourself (and sometimes others) to impress the other people.",The Breakfast Club
321,gracegibson,Best of the '80s teen flicks,9,25 August 2005,"I love this movie. It's a teen movie but it's not sugar-coated. It's realistic and a little bit gritty with memorable characters. You have all your stereotypical high school characters (the popular girl, the geek, the jock, the bad boy, and the weird girl), but you eventually find out that there's more to them than their labels. The popular girl's parents are bitterly divorced and her mother's an alcoholic, the geek is under enormous pressure to get good grades from his parents, the bad boy has an abusive and neglectful father and (expectantly) does badly at school, the jock is under enormous pressure to be tough and do good at sports from his father, and the weird girl's parents ignore her. They see that all have similar problems and are more alike than they first thought. They come out of the school building more open-minded. A miracle has just occurred: five high school kids who normally wouldn't give each other the time of day have become friends. This movie is unusual in that has a powerful message that teens can relate to. It's a reminder of a lost era when teen movies had substance and weren't presented as a stereotypical product of the teen movie machine, horrible scripts and all. I hope someday that era can be brought back.",The Breakfast Club

I wish they'd make movies like that now.  Unfortunately all the 90's teen movies are too concerned with being ""hip"" to relay any kind of message.But I do have a gripe - what's with the brain not getting the girl?  I realize it might be a little cliche, but c'mon - even dorks need love!And I think they missed one character - the guy (or girl) who is not easily defined - the one who can get along with every group, but really doesn't belong to any clique.

323,SnacksForAll,A Flawed Classic,6,16 September 2007,"While THE BREAKFAST CLUB is a lesson in expert film-making, and a potentially profound statement on the 'substance' gap between social stereotypes and the individuals therein, as well as a critique of the loss of inter-generational communication, the film may not have stood the test of time for every audience member.Breakfast Club is a classic, to be sure, and one cannot deny the film's cultural impact. It was one of those ""It"" films I just had to watch when I was younger, but upon viewing this 80s cult hit through adult eyes, I can't help but backlash against its more latent subtexts, some of which are just plain offensive. The 'Brat Pack' pioneers here (Ringwald, Hall, Sheedy, Nelson, Estevez) each represent the classic High School castes; the Princess, the Jock, the square-peg of a basket case, the trouble-making ne'er-do-well, and the brainiac. Does writer-director John Hughes (himself from an affluent Illinois suburb) imply that these stereotypes -- who sit in a ridiculously well-funded library the likes of which few audience members have encountered in their own high schools -- are the only ones in existence, or the only ones who matter?While I am not a proponent in any way of Political Correctness, how can an average kid -- who might be a minority, or from a poor neighborhood -- relate to any of these characters? Even John Bender (""The Criminal,"" Judd Nelson), who seems to be the most economically disadvantaged of the bunch, speaks of an abusive father who beats him for spilling ""paint in the garage."" This makes Bender far more affluent than many of the kids I went to school with, a great deal of whom had lived in apartments their whole lives, sans garage, and sans father figure. The rest of the characters are likewise white and upper-class. Is John Hughes leaving anyone out? I think so.Most shockingly, the purest outcast of the group, Allison, who can quickly be described as eccentric, conforms to her peers' social standards at the end of the film -- she is disrobed of her dark pre-goth Garments by Prom Queen Claire, and made to look pretty, thus becoming acceptable. What sort of a message is this? The true loner of the group gives in to the cliquism of her environment, trading her individualism for some sort of forced happiness that seems a lame contrivance at the film's close.While The Breakfast Club does have a lasting message about the cruel high school caste system, I believe one must look at its content with a critical -- and adult -- eye.",The Breakfast Club

327,aliceboy,A classic...in spite of itself,8,23 August 2006,"I'll fess up: I enjoy this movie. Or rather I should say, I enjoy the first half or so of this movie. As is typical of John Hughes 2-3 year golden period in the 80s, this movie kind of peters out for me about midway through, probably around the time they all get high. That said, I am under no illusions about the quality of this film. The cast, all young actors who became bastions of the decade's films but struggled outside of the eighties, are as laboured as ever in these stereotyped roles. Each one is, admittedly, being expected to play up to their 'title' in the movie to a certain degree. However, when given an emotional range to portray, each one of these kids flubs it (does anyone buy for a second the 'tender side' of Judd Nelson's character?). The direction is typical Hughes, for the time and beyond. It's hard to imagine he does much more than set up the camera and say 'Action!' most of the time, because those rare occasions he tries anything inventive it goes awry (e.g., the pan shot around the stoned circle that gets obscured for several seconds by the rail). But he's never needed to stretch his directorial muscle and nobody's ever wanted him to: we see his movies to be entertained by quirky, endearing characters, not to be stunned by his camera work. And that's what he does here. This is, likewise, a typical Hughes story. A group of kids are thrust together in an unlikely circumstance (in-school suspension is typical to teenhood, sure, but at least three of these kids effectively chose to be there). They find a little bit of themselves in each other, and vice versa. All come out (perhaps) changed by the experience. This is what Hughes does...or did, anyway: he designs likable characters, in spite of their flaws, who you want to see pull it together by the end of the film. We do, and they kind of do. I'd like to believe that it's just that this movie came out when I was their age that makes this a more poignant and precise picture of teenage mentality. I don't think, however, that there has been another movie that attempts to draw a broadly outlined picture of the teenage personality and does it sympathetically. Most teen pictures within the past 15 years do, of course, specialise in the broadly drawn characters...but you as a viewer are rarely expected to sympathise with any but the 'hero.' Unfortunately, this movie has grown extremely dated in the time since its release, and I'd be surprised if most teenagers today could find any reason to watch it. A shame, truly, because a film like this becomes a significant pop-cultural milestone for its generation, and every generation should have one.",The Breakfast Club

It's actually a cool plot to bring five high schoolers with very different backgrounds and interests together in a Saturday detention setting. I remember serving detention after school once in middle school and it put me in a room full of not only kids from various grades but kids I wouldn't have normally hung out with at all. This plot idea made sense to me.Anthony Michael Hall was in his prime and was just great, for the most part. Judd Nelson is one of the most believable jerks in the history of cinema. The others play their parts extremely well.I just think the falling in love thing at the end (after 8 hours) was too silly for me. The ending felt forced. Otherwise this was a good time had.",The Breakfast Club
329,mmintz,Re-evaluating an old fave and still loving it!,8,14 September 2001,"A few weeks ago a film buff I'd just met made a disparaging comment about ""The Breakfast Club"" when he saw it on my list of faves.  He was incredulous that anyone could like such rubbish.  I must confess that (in light of his comment) I had to re-watch this old favorite and, as I did, I continually wondered, ""Okay, as much as I used to like this as a teen, is this REALLY any good?""  After close observation and careful consideration, I must re-affirm (for the world to know), ""I love this movie!""  Whether or not I SHOULD, I do.  No amount of condescension can take that away.One thing, however, that changed in the interim since my last viewing was the response I felt toward Judd Nelson's John Bender.  This time around I found him much less ""cool"".  Frankly, I thought (especially in the first hour) that he was annoying and loud, if sporadically amusing.  Snide comments and monologues that I used to love weren't as fun this time around. Not as you saw the faces fall of whoever happened to be Bender's target. As I saw the movie progress, though, and carefully watched the other characters' reactions to Bender, I realized that this was probably closer to Hughes' intention than my initial adolescent adulation.  The gradual revelations we are given into his background aren't as meaningful unless we begin with (at least) mild revulsion.  One of the reasons I really care about this move is because it just plain FEELS GOOD to experience this gradual change of heart toward John.  Sure, you never quite like him but you can definitely see that underneath all the barbs and bluster is a whole lot of fear and pain.  The look on John's face as Vernon publicly denigrates him says it all.  He is cringing and hollow-eyed as Vernon jeers, ""You wanna see something funny?  Let's look at John Bender in five years.  Now that's funny.""  Chilling moments like this, however cleverly written, reinforce the fact that ""The Breakfast Club"" may be funny but it's no comedy.I personally find the progression from mutual indifference to anger and eventual understanding (however limited) believable and touching.  Sure, in truth, not much is really accomplished.  A few silly stories are exchanged. Some personal secrets are revealed (hidden fears about growing old and shame about being virgins to name a few).  And some unstable romantic unions are formed.  But, isn't this part of what makes this such a wonderful movie? Sure, nobody saves the world.  Nobody really accomplishes much of anything...'cept a little bit of understanding.  And isn't that, after all, EVERYTHING?  Sure, the intimacy these five kids find in this ephemeral moment will never be rekindled in quite the same way.  I think of the end of ""Stand By Me"" where the narrator tells us that Teddy and Vern would eventually become for him just two more faces in the crowd.  But this, by no means, invalidates what was gained by these kids.  Each of them will take away something invaluable and (hopefully) indelible: a slightly broader mind and a little bit bigger heart.",The Breakfast Club

They are not allowed to talk to one another, and are forced to write an essay on why they're here and who they think they are.

I loved it so much the first time that I saw it that I immediately watched it for a second time right when it ended. Only then did I feel like returning back to real life. The film is quite simply one of the best teen movies of all time. John Hughes doesn't dumb down teenagers like so, so many other writer-directors have done when portraying teens in films. Hughes treats them like actual human beings with complex emotions, mature thoughts, and the endless energy required for some shenanigans. My favourite scene was when they all sat around in a circle and spoke from the heart - yeah, that sounds pretty cheesy, but you cannot script that kind of true emotion and that's why I appreciate Hughes for letting them ad-lib most of their lines in that scene. It's a great bonding film. John Bender is one of the coolest kids to ever grace the silver screen - and you know what, so is Brian ""the Brain"" Johnson. Well worth a watch.",The Breakfast Club

But what is the fascination (for me) with this movie? After all my teenage years were spent in Denmark during the mid-nineties, where the whole jock/prom queen (they don't exist here!)/ brain etc. thing isn't that apparent. Still the characters are like people we all know, their parental problems are similar to what most of us have experienced and the boredom of being stuck at school when you'd rather be anywhere else is certainly something i remember. It's a strange period of your life because the real life is waiting right around the corner, and you can't wait to get there.It certainly helps that good part of the cast actually were teenagers, who knew (maybe were like?) their characters. Big credits to John Hughes for having the balls to use a a script that left a lot up it's young performers. Let's face it, if the acting had been any less good than it is, it wouldn't have worked and you'd quickly get bored, since apart from a little running in the halls, Bender crashing through the ceiling and the ""So 80's"" dance scene, nothing much happens apart from talking.All in all it's arguably the best of it's genre, and it certainly stands the test of time. It's got it's goofs (like Bender's sneakers changing from black to white in every other scene) and that infamous dance scene is the only reason it doesn't get a ten, but i guess you can chuck it down to being a sign of the times.

I certainly do not expect anyone who stumbles across my little IMDb review to agree with me; I know I'm in the minority (I have no doubt that there are more people that believe 9/11 was an inside job and Obama was not born in the United States than genuinely hate this movie). Why do I hate this movie? First, I probably review this movie every two years or so thinking that I may find myself at a point in my life where I may enjoy The Breakfast Club. Nope. Hated it every single time. The first time I watched this movie was probably in 1989. I was nine and indifferent to it - didn't really understand it. That was the last time I didn't hate Claire, Bender, et al.I guess the single reason I hate The Breakfast Club is that I hate teenagers.

But still, this movie could be applied to me, my generation or the generations to come.And here comes the little question ""why?"". Well, I believe it's because it's universal. Social groups will always exist. I don't there ever be a time when jocks will be friends with nerds, popular with basket cases or criminals with all of them. Sure, we don't have class or casta system like in India, but it is surely visible when you have different interests. I don't think I ever seen the really popular kids hang out with the artsy ones and I don't think that's going to happen soon. (of course, the change is in our hands, but who am I to lecture anybody)If you are not familiar with this movie, it's about how 5 different young people get detention for completely different reasons on Saturday and their task is to write an essay explaining who they think they are. Well, the movie would be quite boring if they would just jump to the task. Instead how they are reacting to each other is really like a normal group dynamics (if you ever had to work with 4-5 other people, you'll know what I'm talking about).There are four stages of forming a good group ready to work and they go through all of them.Forming – they get to know each other a little. Who is who, the first impression - how different they are and it seems that they won't be able to do anything together. Storming – well, does this need to be explained? They quarrel. A lot. Feelings are hurt, people are mad.Norming – they get used to each other's quirks and how they all are bizarre, but just some of them are better of hiding it. They understand that all of them don't have perfect homes, all of them have some issues and all of them feel alone with those issues.Performing – they are talking, they are sharing about each other, coming up with solutions together. They are helping each other out, making them see that behind their social differences they are actually the same. They way how they from enemies become friends (of course we're not sure if they'll greet each other in the hallway) is just outstanding. It made me feel that no matter how weird you might be or what troubles you might have at home, you are not alone. And that thought brings comfort.",The Breakfast Club

This is a film that will make you laugh, think, cry, and laugh some more. I only saw this film for the first time last year and kicked myself for not seeing it sooner. It is a fantastic film about the pressures that every teenager will have to face in their lifetime, a film that will bring up a problem that anyone watching can relate to one way or the other.I for one like a film with a simple storyline, and this one has a pretty simple one. Five teenagers are forced to spend a Saturday in detention. Simple as that. But these five youngsters are very different from one another. Andrew Clark- The tough guy who thrives to be the best; Brian Johnson- The Grade A student. John Bender- The loud mouth nuisance. Molly Ringwald- The Prom Queen, and Ally Sheedy- the weirdo.5 very different people. One classroom, and a hard nosed teacher to deal with.

The idea for the film sounded like a loser to the movie executives.  You take five characters and put them in one room and let them talk to each other.  That's it.  No car chases, stunts, explosions.  This could have been a stage play. This film should be studied by film students because it shows that a film can be made for very little money and still be entertaining.  You just need a good script and characters who are easy to identify with.  Most viewers can certainly identify with one or more of these kids and almost everyone can relate to the loneliness and disaffection they experience.  Despite their differences, they bond with each other because no one else seems to understand the pain and pressure they live through, certainly not their parents or teachers.  The film has been accused of being anti-adult, or portraying the adult characters one- dimensionally.  I don't think that is fair because the film is clearly told through the point of view of the teenagers. This is how adults appear to them much of the time.  Parents can watch this film and even learn something about themselves and understand what teenagers are going through. The best reason to treasure the film is the strong, memorable dialogue, delivered to perfection by the terrific cast of young actors. Judd Nelson has the best role in the film and comes through with a spellbinding performance. He gives the film its edge and bite. We all knew kids like him and either hated him, loved to hate him or fantasized about being like him. Nelson beat out John Cusack and Nicolas Cage for this part and I think his performance is one of the greatest portrayals of a rebellious American teenager ever seen on film. Matthew Broderick in Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future also fall into this category. Nelson went on to play more anti-establishment characters in films like Blue City and From The Hip, but showed amazing range when he lost 50 pounds and played a wimpy nerd in The Dark Backward. He gave a mesmerizing performance as the genius killer in Billionaire Boys Club, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination. While all the actors were great, I think The Breakfast Club is a showcase for how underrated an actor Judd Nelson is.",The Breakfast Club

In ""normal world"" they would probably never even talk to eachother but thru some fights , arguments and understanding they realise they are not that different.The movie teaches you how every person has a battle within , personal problems and demons that we are all fighting but in the end people will only see your surface.I love the way this movie was made . Certain things don't really stand the test of time but the acting definitely makes up for it. I personally think there were some solid comedic moments but nothing that will really make you laugh out loud therefore , don't expect a high school comedy movie.Overall , the movie was very enjoyable and fun. The message of the movie , if understood , will live on for a long time and will be relavant for years to come.PlatinumanYT 7.7/10.",The Breakfast Club

347,arthurmauk,Hughes' finest,5,31 July 2007,"I never understood why John Hughes was so lauded as an 80s teen movie master. To me, Sixteen Candles was unrealistic, Pretty in Pink was unsatisfying and Ferris Bueller was totally over the top. But fluke or not, I have to give him credit for writing the best high school movie (for once I do agree with Entertainment Weekly).What makes The Breakfast Club so special then? I'd like to think it's the characterisation. Despite being such stereotypical brain/athlete/basket case/princess/criminals, the cast somehow makes it all work and adds so many distinct dimensions to the characters that you can relate to everyone. Never have I met someone who has said they couldn't identify with anyone from The Breakfast Club. The entire cast is simply outstanding, with my personal favourite being Ally Sheedy who manages to steal scenes without even speaking! Judd Nelson of course has to carry most of the movie on his shoulders, but I can't imagine a better actor to lead this fine film. Even the supporting cast is brilliant, John Kapelos always possessing that devious twinkle in his eye.Like all of Hughes' ""Brat Pack"" films, this one deals with a theme: one that does not involve the Molly Ringwald character trying to get a boyfriend. Well, almost. The film talks about subjects that matter to a teenager, and one of the most problematic ones is the parents. Whether it's pressure for success, going through a divorce, or simply ignoring your child, Hughes shows us all the ways how parental influence can screw up a kid for life. And he does this without falling into the trap of being condescending, which in itself is mighty impressive. And of course, there's the topic eternally plaguing all teenagers: sex. The end result is a hilarious script, witty yet still heartfelt.Of course, the film is not perfect. The pace ground down to a halt when they did the typical ""share our problems in a circle"" thing, but soon conflict arose and it became interesting again. Pairing Alison with Andy always felt a little forced to me, especially after she is made over by Claire. But I guess that epitomises the teenage years  even at the sweetest times (and oh how sweet they are) there will never be a lack of issues.I wasn't even born yet on March 24, 1984, but somehow Hughes manages to make me reminisce about ""the good old times"". Because really, are our teenage generations all that different?",The Breakfast Club

Well, if you were a teenager in the 80's, you watched The Breakfast Club. A lot.Didn't matter if you were cool or dorky or somewhere in between. If you were bored on some dull night in 1986 or 1987, you went to the video store and rented The Breakfast Club. It was almost like a record. You could just put it on and then talk on the phone or read a magazine and it would just play in the background.This movie was just instantly woven into the pop culture fabric of the mid-80's. You didn't love it or hate it...it was just always on at someone's house.

First they hate each other, and in the end they love each other.The writing is horrible, the actors are not likable, and the movie is not realistic. Here is a realistic movie script. 5 high school kids serve Saturday detention from different social groups. Teacher stays in the room and tells the kids to be quiet, or they will serve the detention again. Kids read or more likely sleep for 5 hours and then leave. On Monday they resume their lives in their separate cliques in their schools.Oh but my script doesn't make any money because most morons aka the public don't like reality.Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this turd, you'll never get it back.",The Breakfast Club

However, and this is not a strong criticism, I watch it today and I realize it's not much apart from almost 2 hours of talking. I love the jokes and the characters are outstanding but the ""bull session"" towards the end goes on way too long. I know that scene is meant to define each character and their stereotypes but Hughes didn't normally rely on so much dialogue to define characters. I also have to admit that your normal high school students don't have that much ""depth"". Teen angst is one thing but these characters are drawn out to the point of being in a Greek tragedy. It is an 80's Hughes teen classic but the drama in this particular movie tends to weigh it down at times.",The Breakfast Club

I am English and went to a Catholic all girls school in the 1970's of which I have great memories and without wishing to make it sound perfect there was practically none of the 'you are different so it's OK to pick on you"" type mentality. What was taught was tolerance which the five characters in this film eventually learn as well as four falling in love a little. Also for me as a lady who appreciates individual type actors I wasn't looking at anyone but Judd Nelson all the way through. I like him in New Jack City as well an equally fine film with a fine cast.

I was writing a story similar to this but after I watched this movie I gave up because I could never write it as good as this. If Ferris Bueller's Day Off was the lighter side of high school with some of the dark bits, The Breakfast Club (also written by John Hughes) was the darker side of high school with some of the lighter bits. It is so dark at time dwelling into the psyche of the characters but its at the same time so incredibly funny. Each character is done so well and each has their own story arc. Brian gains some friends, Andrew learns to accept other people, Claire learns to love, Allison learns to act in society, Bender gets accepted by other people, and even the principal learns to understand that he is just like the students. My only real problem is the end of the movie for two characters. And without giving away any spoilers, it isn't really fulfilling, especially with the connection the two build in the movie, that's my opinion at least.",The Breakfast Club

It is a movie that encapsulates being a teenager so perfectly, and truly pulls back the facade of teenage cynicism to reveal real people going through real problems.Throughout the film, we follow five teens who are in Saturday detention. Why it may sound like the most mundane concept ever, it is one that ending becoming the most famous high school film of all time.Each character is so diverse in their own way. We can connect with them and how they feel about other characters, and even themselves. This is a film that is primarily driven by dialogue in its single setting location, and none of it comes off cheesy, fake or scripted. Everything seems to genuine and authentic.The only issue with this film is the ending. While a climax of a film doesn't require explosions or car chases, it needs to have some sort of closure. This film has a perfect closing narration done by one of the lead characters, but it just ends. There is no real resolution, and part of that might have to be due to the fact there is no overarching plot that is in most movies. The ending may be a bit dull and make you scratch your head, but for this type of film, it works perfectly.This is THE high school movie you need to see. It will change your life.

Finally, although they have a quarrel, they can understand each other and finish the lecture on Saturday. There are five protagonists in the film. I think all these actors and actresses act very well. Especially, an actress who acts a mysterious character is great. This is because she plays a difficult character to act well and succeeds in expressing the atmosphere which the mysterious character has.

That is school caste, problem of their family, conflict with teacher, and that all of them have their own distress. At first, they conflict with each other, but they gradually reveal themselves. It is interesting that their characters are shown up by what they say and what they do.

The agreement they made in the library about talking to each other still probably held up still and I think they probably spoke to each other later on and became life long friends.Students these days compared to students in the 80's are quite similar with different style and obviously in the way we interact now a days and we're probably as judgemental and are clique with who high school students we hang out with.

370,EdMatt13,A classic,7,14 June 2021,"The breakfast club is a very misleading title for this film, I thought I was in for a rom-com about a pancake making and the subsequent eating of these pancakes however instead I was hit by an incredibly emotional and well written movie that is more topical now than it may have been when it came out.The Breakfast Club follows a group of students spending a Saturday in detention. If this sounds like a boring plot then you'd be surprised, as the characters get up to a number of comedic and heart wrenching discussions and activities throughout the course of the movie, ranging from whistling when supposed to be silent to smoking in the school library. It's definitely a movie that will entertain you at some point, even if it fails to keep your attention the whole film.The plot of the breakfast club, despite being very straightforward, is a plot with great potential, which Hughes definitely knew and utilised. The crazy adventures that Bender (Judd Nelson) leads the other children into seem basic and boring at first glance, however through witty dialogue and interesting scenes. That being said, not every scene here is a 10/10, some parts felt needlessly dragged out and made me feel slightly bored. High school drama comedies are not usually my thing and very few films that take place in a school setting are able to catch my attention (not you 'mean girls' and 'ten things I hate about you' you're perfect.) but that should go to say how good this film is that I was so rarely bored.I was very impressed by the performances in this movie, Judd Nelson was always going to be perfect for his role but my personal favourite is Anthony Michael Hall as Brian, whose childlike appearances betray his incredibly mature and gut wrenching take on the character help to bring a level of understanding and tragedy to the character that may have been missed if it weren't for the beautiful writing and performance. All the actors in this movie are perfect for their respective roles and give the characters a great voice and personality with tons of unique feelings and discussions.I believe the breakfast club is a movie that brings up many important issues such as peer pressure, depression, parental roles and high school feuds. These issues are tackled with such respect and maturity that it has become even more important as it has grown older and as these issues have become more serious and prevalent. Whilst this film may not keep me glued like some films do and there are some scenes which feel drawn out and unneeded, but this film is a near perfect blend of comedy and harsh realism and is a definite recommendation for teenagers and all ages, especially if they like high school comedy dramas.Thanks for reading :)",The Breakfast Club
371,Jeff M.-3,"Uh, so where's the ""great movie""?",3,16 January 2005,"If a spoiler is defined as how the characters make out in the end, there is probably one or two here.Now, I was flipping between a few things when I saw this on TV so I didn't see every minute of it, but I can describe my reaction in two words: Thoroughly unimpressed.I just didn't like the direction the story was going, almost from the get-go. Why, at 17 minutes in, would any of them have any reason to cover for the guy who took the screw out of the door? It went more or less downhill from there, and just when I thought it was about to redeem itself and become this ""great"" movie everyone who was a teen in the '80s says it is, it didn't.Bender is the type of student that would torture me in high school, if such a stereotype had actually existed, and to that degree. My high school self would have wanted to alternately try to beat him up (and fail spectacularly) or go tell the supervisor what was going on. He comes falling through the ceiling? Yeah, sure, like I'm going to cover for that.The movie revisits, or perhaps imposes for the first time, the ""values"" that supposedly everyone has in high school, meaning none. Look down on virginity, smoke pot, and swear enough to turn March air in Illinois even bluer. Oh, and you can find a guy/girl by getting a total makeover and/or being one of the chicks who dig bad boys.Anthony Michael Hall's character was alternately overexploited (is that redundant?) and underused. OK, so maybe a flare gun was all he had access to, not an unreasonable position for 20 years ago. But the revelation of that during the conversation pretty much ruined whatever the movie had going for it at that point. Then he willingly writes ""the essay"" for the group? Mm-hm. And on top of that, they expect me to believe that the nerd can dance. If you think about it, his situation is one of the most dated parts of the movie, since today he would probably have been shuttled off to a psychiatrist, put on Prozac, reported to the police, or all of the above. (The 'underused' part comes from the gymnastics one must do in the script to get a nerd in detention in the first place, which is where the flare gun came in, and then there's the problem of what to do with him after that.)I'm not dismissing the possibility that I just don't ""get it"" for generational reasons, as high school came 15 years later for me. I'm also not dismissing the possibility that I don't ""get it"" because perhaps my experience and angst aren't like most people's experiences and angsts, or because being in a small high school doesn't lend itself to as deep divisions in the student body. (And Saturday detentions aren't part of the discipline.)If anything, this movie has confirmed two things: I am most emphatically not a member of Generation X, and I should've know I probably wouldn't like this movie given my loathing of that other alleged symbol of teen angst, ""Catcher in the Rye.""",The Breakfast Club

I know I didn't. But, I think the movie has some qualities that can make everyone like it. Judging by other reviews I'd assume that's pretty much true. First, you have detention. Something pretty much everyone has done before. Next, you have one of the factors that made the Shining a great movie, that kind of ""no way out"" setting. And third you have 5 people who can't get along in an enclosed space for a long period of time. Put them together and here you have the Breakfast Club. This movie will speak to anyone who is or ever was a teenager. I particularly liked Brian's essay in the end. My one problem with this movie: Why were they called the Breakfast Club?

I am not originally from Chicago, so I was never a big John Hughes fan, although settling here 20 years ago to raise a family definitely deepened my appreciation for his films. Even from my East Coast POV where I lived when the film debuted, and from a West Coast POV where I lived when I first saw it, this is not only Mr. Hughes' masterwork but a ""best in class"" exemplar of the ""teen drama"" genre. I made sure that both my kids saw it before they started high school. US High Schools (when I was coming up at least) were so Balkanized then; they seem to be less so today, maybe in-part because we all made our kids watch The Breakfast Club! Yet we (at least I) watch it with a certain nostalgia for the eighties. On one level, it's one long music video.

374,RockoutGlockout117,Disappointing,6,5 April 2014,"So I bought a VHS copy(yeah I'm oldschool) of ""The Breakfast Club"" at a Goodwill several months ago as I was familiar with the films reputation and I lumped it in my ""To Watch"" pile. So months pass and I got busy with life and such when one day strolling through my FB newsfeed, I noticed one of my friends making a post about the films 30th anniversary and all of a sudden I figured I should finally get to watching that movie that I've had sitting around all this time.So I popped it in, was waiting for this supposedly ""FANTASTIC"" high school film to get underway, and this film is not at all what you have been led to believe, this movie is the cinematic equivalent of ""I thought he'd be taller"" this movie underperforms and is disappointing in just about every way I could think. Not that the actors were bad, they were fine, it just felt like most of the characters were either poorly written or extremely unlikeable.The film is largely driven by the Character of John Bender, an Anti-Authoritarian Punk ass who reviles at any sort of rules be they for his betterment or not. This film is basically 90 minutes of Bender complaining about how horrible life is and how its so unfair etc, not that Bender has any suggestions or ideas for how to improve life, he's to much of a dumb mother fu**er to have anything actually half profound to say. Instead he just sits around whining, and eventually the rest of the cast join in with him and they all have a big whining session. The only part of the film I found actually interesting was the sparse moments of backstory when we learn about the characters and why they were in Detention for that Saturday, in these moments you glimpse the great thing the Breakfast Club could have been, but then its back to Bender whining and complaining. Bender was insanely unlikeable and though I know this isn't an action movie I kept hoping the teacher would pull out a glock and blow that kid away, all he does is talk big and complain,in one scene he gets into a fight with the ""Jock"" and after being easily bested, Bender steps back and pulls out a switchblade stabbing it into a nearby chair, OH WHAT A BIG MAN YOU ARE BENDER! YOU COULD""VE STABBED SOMEBODY THAT WAS FIGHTING YOU WITH BARE HANDS! KUDOS. And then when The Teacher is haranguing Bender and he finally has a chance to take him down, he refuses, proving the teacher's point, bender wont stand up for anybody not even himself. WHAT A FU**ing pathetic waste of space. AND THEN HE GETS THE GIRL!?!??! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?????? The Breakfast Club is in the end, a movie that truly could have been great but devolves into a whining session with supposed ""Friends"" you know the kind of friends that say ""FU** you"" to each other all the time. The verbal abuse these children put upon each other is enough to make me not like it, but the film wants to act like it has soooooooooooooooooooooooo much to say. But it doesn't it sucks. At one point in the movie the teacher expresses fear that ""These kids are gonna be running the country! There gonna be taking care of me!"" To which the wisecracking Janitor responds, ""I doubt it"" but honestly, with folks like Bender at the helm, would you really want them taking care of you? And then just to point out one last thing, that essay was significantly less than 1000 words.",The Breakfast Club

The reasons are all different and gradually clarify. Their problems are not unrelated to our society. All five protagonists face one antagonist. The way they overcome is one main point in this movie. Other important person is their teacher. He gather five students to supplementary tution. He don't tell them why they must take this tution. He only says ""Write a composition about What is onself?"". He is also a mystery person and at first, his purpose is unclear. Almost all matters are hard to understand its opening, so you can enjoy watching this movie to the very end. All students and teacher display their originality in the one lecture room.

I enjoyed this movie, and want to watch another American high school movie. Also, this is a love story. I laughed very much because developments of their loves are so fast and I couldn't follow them. However, I had g good feeling very much because it is simple and they are meek and mild. It is just like young people, adults can't imitate it because they reflect on many things such as their jobs or families. Therefore, watching this movie, you can recall your youth.

Judd Nelson looks all of his 26 years). It seemed empty and utterly false then and 30 years on it looks even worse. It's on TV right now, the characters are impossible to like or care about and the script is arguably the worst thing John Hughes ever wrote (he never wrote anything good but this garbage screams to be taken seriously without doing anything to earn the right). Some people like this movie because it reminds them of teenage rebellion. I hate it because it has nothing honest or interesting to say about people of any age. No character says or does anything believable, and the hasty boy-girl pairings shoehorned into the final five minutes come out of absolutely nowhere (the ""prettying up"" of Ally Sheedy's token weird girl to make her an acceptable make-out target is particularly baffling).This film has no insight, no truth, no entertainment value and no point.

380,amandaroseobrien84,Best High School Film Ever,9,5 January 2013,"The Breakfast Club is, in my opinion, the greatest teen movie of all-time. I think what makes it so amazing is that it doesn't try to make high school into this magic place where we make friendships that last forever and experience our first loves, but instead, it presents it as a place where we are all trying to act like everything is OK but we're all equally confused and hurt on the inside. It shows that no matter how different people may look on the outside, we all experience pain. I kind of feel like the world would be a better place if life was more like this movie, where everyone's issues was out in the open . There would be less misunderstandings.

It is unique in that it is the quintessential 80's ""teen"" movie but it's way more than that - it remains every bit as relevant for today.There's so much to comment on that I'll keep it short - the film is extremely funny, thought-provoking, poignant, touching. Dialogue throughout is snappy and realistic - Hughes gets the very best out of the cast. What's most impressive is that the whole film revolves 99% of the time around just 5 characters and one location, and yet not for one second does it drag. Who needs special effects or bazillion dollar budgets when characterisation and character interplay are this good?So if you want to know what's a neo maxi zoom dweebie, go check this movie out - you will not regret it.

I was a college freshman the year it was released and I haven't seen it since. I remember it making some big powerful statement. Well, I ended up feeling pretty embarrassed watching this with my kid. All it really did this time around was make it clear how far we've come with representing youth cinematically since people like Cameron Crowe have come on the scene.The Breakfast Club now seems amateurish, laughably overacted and over-scored (Judd Nelson's speech about this family beating on him) and just well, again, pretty embarrassing.Additionally, it offered a pretty sh**ty message for young women. Molly Ringwald ends up sucking face with a guy who verbally abuses her all day...and Ally Sheedy ends up with a guy who would have been embarrassed to be seen with her until Molly Ringwald made her into a mini-me. Geez, makes you realize how an entire generation of supposedly liberated women ended up marrying guys who treat them like garbage, and are now addicted to plastic surgery.I think the only thing the Breakfast Club is good for anymore is to look back upon, roll our eyes a bit and be proud of how far we've come!",The Breakfast Club

The Breakfast Club is a film about a bunch of teenager sitting around whining about how much they're lives suck. People's issue may be along the lines of this film but there's no way that anybody truly acts like these characters. I did not consider this film humorous or greatly acted. Emilio Estevez and Molly Ringwald's performance were some of the most forced I've see in a long time. I found in the middle it seemed as if their principle was experiencing a 'mid-life crisis' however that was never referred to again.

386,dimoulas-466-176153,A cult classic I have never connected with,5,24 February 2014,"I think it is safe to say that The Breakfast Club has become somewhat of a cult classic. It's hard to criticize a movie like this because it has been around for so long and continues to connect with audiences. I have just never been that audience.It's a simple concept: five ""different"" kids attend an eight hour-long Saturday detention (sometimes it truly felt like eight hours to me). They all have their own stories, they tell each other and the viewer those stories, come to some kind of understanding of one another, and then leave. The film does succeed in its portrayal of the students. John Hughes seems to have a very good understanding of what goes on in the head of a high school student. The character of John Bender, played by Judd Nelson, does have serious problems, and should contact child services. The other characters really don't have as dire an issue, but to someone that age, it feels as though their universe is imploding.The film is not very cinematic. It felt like there was very little thought behind the placement of the camera. Conversely, in a film like 12 Angry Men, which also basically takes place in one room, the camera-work has a voyeuristic quality, and the audience feels like they are peering into a forbidden world of life or death issues. There are also drastic changes in tone in The Breakfast Club, from scenes of serious drama, to over-the-top dance numbers.The film's goal seems to be to move its audience and to teach the audience to take teenagers and their problems more seriously. It does succeed in moving me when I hear Brian Johnson's story about how he considered suicide. But then you realize he considered killing himself with a flare gunso basically, he was just doing that for attention, right?",The Breakfast Club
387,aadamhgafar-68237,"The Breakfast Club - review, 6/10",6,13 March 2018,"The movie is about five different teenagers - 'a brain...and an athlete... and a basket case...a princess...and a criminal' who are locked up together for a day of detention. I won't lie, this sounded like a boring movie to me but I watched it anyway to 'culture' myself on iconic movies of the '80s... or something.I'd heard that this movie really got teenagers, and maybe it did at the time but the characters don't really hold up as much as they might have in the '80s. The protagonists are clear-cut clichés of the cliques that usually exist in Hollywood's stereotyped high-school movies, these kind of social groups don't really exist anymore (if they did at all); nowadays the athletes hang out with the brains, the princesses hang out with the basket cases and the criminals... I don't know who they hang out with but the point I'm making is that I don't think a modern teenager can really relate to the teens in this movie. Saying that, the main point that the movie grapples with is exactly what I just said - that brains, athletes, princesses, basket cases and criminals can and should be friends but I feel that this argument is now about a decade too late to relate to which sometimes makes the teenagers feel somewhat 'alien' to me.The one thing that I really thought the movie got right was the actors, they're really excellent and spoke authentically about the universal experience of being a teenager (minus the weird cliques). They were the focus of the movie and carried it well until the end, listening to their stories and watching them form friendships was fun to watch and there was enough humour and quiet moments for you to just start to unravel the personalities of the five lead characters which, in my opinion, makes the movie interesting enough to watch.",The Breakfast Club
388,thebc-86158,The Best Film Ever Made,10,15 July 2018,"I love ""The Breakfast Club"" in fact, it's my favorite film of all time. It's simple on the outside but complex the further you go into it just like the characters. It's about 5 teens of 5 stereotypes Criminal, Jock, Nerd, Princess, and Basket-case, who are stuck in detention for a full 8 hours on a Saturday being watched over by an asshole of a principal and a janitor who knows them a little too well. So, why is it good? It sets up a simple story with simple characters who have hidden motives and character traits that unravel in an extremely enjoyable 95 minutes full of heart, and humor that isn't too long or too short. The acting from everyone is every bit as hilarious as it is heartbreaking while we learn about their character and backstory of abuse and crappy home lives outside of their school persona's. John Hughes' directing and writing is as quirky, awkward, dramatic, hormonal, angry, funny, and depressing as high school itself making you cheer for these characters whether they be playing their type or expressing their true selves with a moral of don't judge a book by it's cover. 10\10.",The Breakfast Club
389,norton833,Ridiculously Overrated,3,26 September 2010,"This is just one of the most overrated films of all time. Probably because of the emotional investment so many of its fans have in it, as they saw it when they were teenagers, or, just as likely, pre-teenagers. But even older critics seemed to have suspended their judgment.Despite having been made in, and so heavily identified with, the 80's, Breakfast Club is firmly rooted in the pop psychology movement of the late 60's/early 70's. Much of the ""action"" In the film consists of the eponymous ""club"" sitting in a circle and trying to ""break down"" each other's ""walls"" (in the parlance of the times), a trope directly lifted from the 70's pop psychology Encounter Group therapy session of the type seen in films like ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice"". A lot of these scenes are right out of the rule book of the infamous Synanon House of the period, where the ""encounter"" style was far more aggressive, and could turn into an attack on a single person. This happens a lot in Breakfast Club, to each of the characters. Most of this psychological terror is carried out by the school bully, Bender, played by then-25-year-old Judd Nelson, who incessantly harasses most of the other kids in room, who are there involuntarily, (for detention). The only ""kid"" (actually a 25-year old Emilio Estevez playing a kid) to hold his own against him is Andy, ""the jock"". There's also ""the nerd"", played to the hilt by Anthony Michael Hall, and ""the prom queen"", played by Molly Ringwald, ( about two years away from throwing her career right down the dustbin of history ). Ally Sheedy plays ""the loner"".In the weird logic of Hollywood, all of this abuse just makes the kids love Bender more. Similarly, at other points in Breakfast Club we are repeatedly expected to feel sympathy not for the victims of abuse, but for their tormentors, not only in Bender's bullying actions, but in the Estevez character's whining, self-pitying (and, I might add, seemingly endless) monologue about committing some freakishly creepy sexual abuse on some poor kid. Apparently, it really hurts to bully people. The film industry, largely made up of people with Leftist tendencies, often asks us to sympathize with bullies and criminal perps, a couple of the most egregious examples being the bleeding-heart hand wringer Dead Man Walking and the South African film Tsotsi.The ""encounter sessions"" in Breakfast Club are interspersed with small, generally non-sequitir vignettes of 50's-style teen rebellion, e.g., the crazy, spontaneous dance scene, backed by a soundtrack that was already dated back in 1985. This little sequence gives the movie its biggest WTF moment, when Estevez lets out a leonine roar, and suddenly a plate glass window shatters ( It plays like some weird fusion of Heroes, Dune, and Footloose ). So disjointed is this film that it seems as if several different writers were working on different parts of the movie, and when they were done writing, they just sort of patched it all together in random order.Worst of all is the way the film resolves itself, as, for no apparent reason, four out of the five kids pair up (guess who gets left out? Bingo! ""The Nerd""! How's that for a depressing message for at least a portion of the audience in a film that fancies itself ""uplifting""?) In addition, the eccentric ""loner"" chick is turned into a clone of the prom queen (and there's another nice message, this time for the female portion of the audience: conform, girlie)!",The Breakfast Club

A group of kids that are no where close to running in the same cliques and never would have said three words to each other if they weren't stuck in the same room together. But, they are stuck and therein lies the brilliance. In the same way that you end up befriending people you work with because you're stuck with them 40 hours a week, this group of kids get to know each other whether they like it or not.

The music and movies were the absolute top and this is a sterling example.  This film is insightful, intriguing, probing, and thoughtful.  It is the American Beauty for the 80's.  The characters are well developed, the story is fast paced, never boring, and completely original, and the acting is superb!!  The music is about as good as the movie, too!!  The opening sequence with Simple Minds ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"" and a famous/infamous quote from David Bowie will forever stand out in my mind.  I must say, my favorite character was Claire.  Molly Ringwald was moving (not to downsize any of the other characters who were equally moving and well-portrayed) but she always seems to stand out.  The ending leaves me with an indescribable feeling of overwhelming something that I just can't figure out.  I've seen this movie about as many times as you've seen your reflection in a mirror!

I think every person is worried about something like those characters when they are young. I saw many people who are older than those characters, but I felt difficulty to prove they remember teenage thought. If people remember completely and think as teenagers, they would fail to grow up. I think this story is about young people who start to grow up. I considered these five student characters are too clever, but I didn't dislike their trying to save themselves. On the other hand I returned to myself. I couldn't think just only myself in those year age. They are too far from me, so I felt that I watched completely fiction in somewhere of my head.

Judd Nelson gets all the best lines and in Bender fleshes out the embodiment of dysfunctional teen anger, but Sheedy is a slow burning flame who's just fascinating to watch. It's depressing to see modern teen films like American Pie and how little they have to offer their audience about the power of imagination and open-mindedness to change lives. It's not without flaws, but few films have taken the subject of teenage tribalism and disaffection and delivered a blueprint for what's possible when prejudice and immaturity are replaced with intelligence, understanding and dialog.

One decent character - John Bender - is not enough to keep a film afloat. The characters are paper thin stereotypes, each conveniently relegated to their own demographic. There are two quotable lines of dialogue in the entire film, ""Eat my shorts,"" and ""Does Barry Manilow know you raid his wardrobe?"" The Bridge On The River Quai parody is ill - advised, as is the very '80s dance routine. The dialogue is 5th rate psycho babble, and the whole film, in my opinion, is absoloute crap. It is amusing to see now, when none of the actors maintain any sort of stature in Hollywood, and the frankly appalling conclusion is unintentionally hilarious. Overall, one to avoid.

But to the average white American, The Breakfast Club was truly a coming-of-age movie.The late John Hughes served up a masterpiece film about what it was like to be in junior-high and high school during the 80's in a way that nearly everyone could identify with.At my school there were the ""Freaks"", the ""Soshes"", the ""Jocks"", the ""Losers"", and the ""Nerds"". Each of Hughes' characters represent one of the group at my school: Esteves (""Andrew Clark"") for the Jocks. Ringwald (""Claire Standish"") for the Soches. Sheddy (""Alison Reynolds"") for the Freaks. Nelson (""John Bender"") for the Losers. Hall (""Brian Johnson"") for the Nerds.I saw the movie in the theater when it came out, and later on VHS at several social functions with my peers. Each time, the result was the same: some people embarrassed by being exposed as the frauds they were, some people lionized by vindication, some people weeping by acknowledging the unpopular roles they played.The Breakfast Club is a perfect representation of the microcosm of 80's students, the utter BS of 80's school administrators, and the very real issues of saving face within social class distinction.The issues presented in The Breakfast Club are as relevant today as they were in the 80's.",The Breakfast Club

What was your role in the high school to be associated with that group, and what do you think you know about the other groups?The Breakfast Club, is not an attempt to break social barriers among high school kids, but more of an attempt to portray how even lives that have go in such different paths, all of them have common life issues. This film begs the issues, not only of why do we judge others, but why do we fear the judging of ourselves?The film's first hour is, what I believe, a very shallow attempt to introduce the film as a typical teenage comedy. I found myself to bite into the clichés these characters (probably intentionally) portrayed. However, the last 30 minutes of this film was VERY powerful stuff, it totally caught me off guard.

I agree with many of the reviewers that it really captures the 1980s feel and what it was like to be a teenager in high school then, or really at any time. If you had to pick 5 movies to represent the 1980s, this movie would have to be included. In fact, this is one of the few movies that if I'm home and I see it's on TV, I will try to stop what I'm doing and watch it, even though I've seen it probably 10 times. I was in high school from 1984 to 1988 so I remember when the movie came out although I think I first saw it when I rented it about a year later.On a personal note, I agree this movie does a great job of showing the hardships teenagers go through, wanting to feel popular but also wanting to establish their own identity. My parents got divorced when I was in 11th grade and I can not say that high school was a good time in my life. I mean I had a small circle of friends but like most teens, they were awkward years. However, I've come to see that in many ways things were simpler then. As time goes by, I enjoy more and more keeping in touch with some of my high school friends.If you want a movie that will make you somewhat nostalgic for high school, this movie is it.",The Breakfast Club

But I really don't think it's some masterpiece like everyone says it is.I LIKED it, but it's not really my taste, I guess. I mean I didn't like Ferris Bueller that much either. Whatever genre that may be. I guess 70s/80s teen movies or something.So, I GUESS I recommend it if you like those kind of movies, 70s/80s teen movies, but if you don't then don't see it.

It was cool.My favorite character in this movie is John Bender(Judd Nelson)He is very funny and i like his attitude.He starts a lot of trouble with people because he was raised poorly with his parents.He got burned with a cigar because he spilled paint on the garage.But i give this movie a 10 out of 10 because it has a theme to it:Relation,friendship, and courage.",The Breakfast Club

All of the movie of drama some how lack the spirit of youth, However this movie ticks all the right signs. I was blown away by the music the songs especially the song in climax of movie.The Movie is basically played out by five students who are gathered in library to serve there detention for various reasons. Each of these characters has individual tone, story, losses and struggles.All We have lost, thought was wrong in our life during our teenage life is laid out amazingly in right manner by john Hughes, This is his best work ever. I would recommend this movie to all because even if it portrays some negative image of Life it would surely make you appreciate your Life and the friends whom you thought were different and would respect them.A Classic to have.",The Breakfast Club
415,rejj2369,"Sometimes unrealistic, but overall a satisfying teen flick",8,11 September 2018,"I was a high school teen when I saw Breakfast Club. I was part of the ""burn-out"" crowd, so I was curious to see Judd Nelson AKA the criminal. In all honesty, he looked more like a wealthy freak from a Beverly Hills high school. His demeanor seemed genuine at times but he was largely too ""Hollywood"" to resonate with me. Adding to the disbelief was him scoring Claire after taunting and berating her throughout the film. Another character I found unconvincing was Brian Johnson the geek; he becomes mr. cool after smoking a joint for the first time? The movie was essentially about five young actors turning on their charm while they read their lines and improvised. But, that was not a bad thing after all. There was group chemistry and their unlikely friendship influenced teenagers for generations to come.The movie was well acted and I can definitely see the teen appeal; the actors embodied this all-American persona that drew kids in. It put a spotlight on high school teens and their struggle with peer pressure and identity issues. The movie became a mainstream phenomenon, and every American kid wanted to act out their ""celebrity status"" afterward. The last time something like this happened was during the 1950s with Rebel Without a Cause and The Blob. It was time that people took notice of high school teens again. They are after all, our kids as well. In real life, however, this breakfast club would never materialize - Judd Nelson would sit far away from everyone else; Ally Sheedy would be quiet throughout; Emilio Estevez would only talk to Molly Ringwald; and Anthony Michael Hall would be too shy to talk to anyone. There is a possibility of social interaction, but it's unlikely they would bare their soul and share their personal lives with one another. But alas, that is the appeal of the movie - and why this movie has an enduring charm. Despite the fact that the Breakfast Club consisted of kids coming from different backgrounds, they were able to form a common bond, and found themselves through each other. It has a timeless message of tolerance and humanity, as told by The Breakfast Club.",The Breakfast Club
416,SolNigerWithin333,"Entertaining movie, but very poorly delivered",5,10 July 2014,"'The Breakfast' starts of very promising, especially as it is centered around John Bender the ""Criminal"" who is probably the most interesting and well done character in the movie, if he wasn't in the movie i think it would be fair to say this 80's classic would never have had its iconic status. I remember giggling at his antiques and smart-alec comments very much at the beginning of the movie and was genuinely interested in seeing more of him.However after all the introductions are done and the movie settles down everything turns to let me put it bluntly, crap, even after all the tormenting and hatred between each other the detained teens somehow take to liking each other it could be because of a common dislike of the psychotic principal but years of contempt boils down to them befriending each other in the space of a few hours is kinda absurd if you think about it. I mean imagine having to spend a Saturday at school with 4 people you barely know i would have just wrote the paper and went to sleep.The movie is very unrealistic and at times you wonder if these kids really are teenagers and I'm far from being a feminist but the only time a female opens their mouth in this movie is to talk about something sexual, i mean did you see ""The Princess"" only talent, it was her putting on lipstick with her chest if that can be called a talent not to mention how this movie supports giving in to the masses and succumbing to superficiality i mean why would a chronically depressed and outcast girl ""The Basket Case"" be willing to get a makeover done its like the movie is screaming ""hey you will only fit in if you look appealing"" and ""Yes people will judge a book by its cover so let go of your true self to satisfy others"", also do it bother anybody else that both the jock and rebel got a girl at the end and the nerd was left out after he did write an essay for them all.6/10 for being entertaining and having some heart to it, the movie will appeal to those who don't look beyond all the laughter and happy endings but will surely be criticised by those like me who find the movie lacking in the realism and conveyance of its messages.",The Breakfast Club

Weather you were a high school student in the 80s or you're a high school student today, everyone can somehow relate to what went on that day spent in detention.The film follows five very different high school students who need to spend the day in together in detention. Over the course of the day they slowly become closer and realize that none of them are that different to one another. It makes us notice how we are the same in a way during our high school days.The film was brilliantly directed by John Hughes.

418,deanrowan585,I won't forget about this film.,10,31 December 2014,"A few years ago, I sat down to watch this film on New Years Eve. As I got towards the end of the film fireworks started to go off as the morning of the new year approached. Ever since that date, I have made it a personal tradition to sit and watch this film every New Years Eve. I love this film. I think the very first time I watched this film, I found myself so overwhelmed; not just by the incredible message, but by the beautiful character development and bond the characters share during the film. I think everyone who watches this film can relate to the majority of the five main characters of the film. The first time I watched this movie I couldn't help but identify traits from all five stereotypes in the film in retrospect to my own high school self. The film takes place in a High School on a Saturday, where three very different students are acquainted with one other to undergo a weekend detention. The five are each individually categorised as certain stereotypes; Jock, Basketcase, Princess, Brain and Criminal. Each of these stereotypes are common in the vast majority of High Schools and I think the whole development of these character-types is genius for that specific reason. The five characters initially appear to hate one another (though some share unlikely bonds throughout the movie) and eventually open up to one another towards the end of the film. I love how the characters sympathise with one another and eventually gain empathy for one another, even though they are completely different and lead completely different lives. It is almost like their meeting changed each and every one of them for the better and they each take away a specific quality from each other by the end of the film. I especially love the many different messages relating to morality and individualism within the film, these include; Everybody is equal. Respect one another. Treat others how you would like to be treated, and most Importantly: Everybody is different. This film has had a lasting effect on me since the day I put the DVD in my player. This film will almost certainly be in my heart due to the love I have for it. And, I think it is more than safe to say; I won't forget about this film. Ever!

I know it has a big fan base.But I must warn you if you're about to watch this movie, there's a good chance you get bored. Not much happens, and most of what does happen is predictable.I know the movie speaks about the mind of teenagers, so maybe some will relate to it because of that. But many discussions feel ""fake"" because nobody (no, not even teenagers) would react like this.Some of the problems these teenagers have are real teenager problems, but others are just ""first world problems"". It's nice to see that in 2015, people are more conscious of how ridiculous our little life problems are. I think there's more of a tendency today for people (yes teenagers too) to take a step back and realize that we're pretty lucky, life is pretty good, and our problems aren't that important!",The Breakfast Club

Even the clueless, burned out educator is represented. And the film throws a not so subtle hint that life after high school glory might not be so great (ahem, Mr. Janitor?) The dialogue in this film is utterly and completely authentic. It's not what the kids are saying, so much as what they're feeling at the time. The mish-mash of emotions, feelings, and general mania that constitute high school life. All of it is perfectly captured by this film.There are funny moments, sad moments, and everything in between. Just like high school. In the end, we're left with the hope that these people will grow to understand each other just a bit better, and maybe that we will too.How perfect is this movie? - so perfect that all these years later the current generation still sees themselves in these characters.

Well, it is---and although it definately invokes memories of the 1980's, the films self-importance begins to cloud my adult appreciation.  Its not as fun as ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" also by Hughes.",The Breakfast Club
423,Sci-Fi Junkie Lord,"A ""10"" well deserved",10,24 August 2002,"I gave The Breakfast Club a 10 out of 10. I can hear many shouts of approval, and even more of derision already. However, I don't claim that this movie is the best ever made. I gave it a 10, because The Breakfast Club is one of the best movies I've ever felt. When I watch a movie, typically a few mistakes stick out. Mostly things that seem inconsistent, or contrary to the theme or message of the film. When watching The Breakfast Club, I don't notice anything left out, or overdone, or anything that defies the purpose of the movie. This film received such a high rating from me, because it is perfect in its own right. It has done everything it was set out to do, and more. There is no way I, or anyone else, could improve it. Highlights: Paul Gleason's portrayal of a high school principal is uncanny. I'm in my senior year of high school, and I swear the principal of my school learned everything he knew from Richard Vernon. That includes wardrobe. Ally Sheedy defines the era of film making in which she starred. I find it startling that she has so effectively portrayed a social outcast like the secretly beautiful Allison Reynolds, and also the outgoing, ravishingly cute Jennifer Mack, in War Games. I'm running out of words here, so I'll end saying, if you've seen this movie and love it, keep watching, there's always something new. If you've seen it and don't like, stop watching it, you're missing the point. If you haven't seen it yet, you'll be trapped emotionally at age fifteen until you do.",The Breakfast Club
424,pessimistic_girl,"Look, I'm not going to discuss my private life with total strangers.",8,10 August 2002,"And yet that's precisely what they did. Breakfast Club is one of those movies that is easy to like. It's witty, moving fast, covering many differing subjects (such as drugs, sex, child abuse, alcoholism, suicide etc.) and has a set of more or less likeable characters that many of us can relate to on various levels. Keeping all of these facts in mind it would be very hard to figure out what this movie is lacking if you have as of yet not seen it.What's missing is credibility and a certain sense of reality. Anyone who's ever served a couple of hours in detention are aware that for the most part, unless someone you know is there, you don't go blabbering on about your own difficulties and personal problems. Strangers are just that; people you do not know well enough to speak to about private matters. And after 8 hours in a room together it's unlikely that strangers suddenly become friends (SPOILER alert) and even lovers.Despite the issues I've just mentioned I do love this movie and have watched it a dozen times (at least). Because firstly, it's mainly a teen-flick and secondly it's an 80's teen-flick; plot holes and ""unrealisticness"" can be overlooked slightly. Truth is, this movie is entertaining and a very well made dramedy that makes you laugh and get teary eyed at the same time. The characters are not as one dimensional as you are lead to believe, they all interact well together and the acting is very nice indeed. The movie runs pretty smoothly throughout except the ending which is my humble opinion seems slightly forced.Final grade: 7 ½ / 10",The Breakfast Club

It was just plain unrealistic, all of the characters were.  The actors were over melodramatic and all they did was blame the parents.  I didn't care for any of the characters and it had one of the weakest endings I have ever seen.  The princess and the rebel just... got together at the end for no reason at all, they actually hated each other but the next minute they were together.  Worse than that, the jock and the weirdo hadnt said two words to each other yet they got together, just because she got a make over.  There is no cleverness here, since each character has no development, but are just stereotyped.  Yes the criminal is mean, yes the jock is cocky, yes the princess is stuck up, yes the nerd is nerdy and yes the weirdo is weird.  And that people are your characters, and thats as far as it goes.  There was a subplot between the Teacher and the care taker, but it was left unfinished!! A very bad film.  Don't waste your time.

It joins Pretty In Pink as one of my favourite ever movies. Being sixteen I was born in the year The Breakfast Club was released but I found it just as relevant to me now as it was to teenagers in the eighties. Sure, some of their problems seem a little pathetic but on the whole I think everyone can identify to someone in the film at some point. Judd Nelson and Anthony Michael Hall give especially good performances, I think, though all the acting is good. I thought Breakfast Club was really funny and I was really impressed by it. It's certainly better than most recent teen films such as She's All That. One thing I thought was a bit crap was Ally Sheedys makeover at the end. It seems a bit shallow and like in the end she decided not to be herself and conform. Aside from that though I loved it and gave it a 9/10.",The Breakfast Club
428,bigjc33,Welcome to the writing for future teenage generations that is John Hughes!,8,14 February 2012,"John Hughes was truly a magnificent writer for teenagers of the 80's. Even though a lot of people hated his previous works, it doesn't matter since many people have flaws in their career once in a while. Well, this is one of John Hughes's well-written classics: The Breakfast Club. It follows a group of teenage kids who have done something to get them to have detention on Saturday!(Bummer having to stay in that school on a weekend!) Sounds pretty simple huh? Well, later on the characters get to know each other thanks to the brilliant writing from John Hughes! Judd Nelson plays Bender who in the movie is called ""the Criminal"" and is a straight up asshole but in a cool way. The lovely Molly Ringwald plays Claire who attempts to hide things from people kinda like bottling her emotions. Plus there are other characters I wont get into. My favorite character is obviously Bender since he throws out the jokes which makes this movie funny. Now, be warned! You may start tearing up because there are a lot of issues covered in this movie that relates to real life. The stories the characters tell are very poignant and moving and riveting. So don't be surprised if you start crying during the movie. This is a brilliant John Hughes movie that launched his career next to Sixteen Candles(which is another good Hughes film). What makes this movie so great you say? The way the characters develop is genius thanks to the magnificent directing! The jokes are CLEVER unlike so many other comedies *cough Meet the Spartans*. However, while this movie is great it does have some flaws. One is its a little too long for my taste and its tone is a little mixed up at times. Like is this supposed to be a comedy or a drama? But thats a minor thing for me since I can relate to this movie as a teenager next to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Plus, there are so many memorable quotes in this movie!

429,Hunter-Lostie,An instant classic,9,1 April 2015,"A timeless classic, ""The Breakfast Club"" is well renowned and cherished, even by today's audience, and I'm sure it will remain as such for a very long time; it's nice to see teens of this generation praising what's now considered an older movie.Unlike many of it's kind, ""The Breakfast Club"" bravely stares the prejudices of high school right in the face and makes a mockery of their false pretences. Just as the ending line of the movie perfectly states; each one of us is a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal. To cram one person into a single category would be ludicrous. Yes, we see the typical clichés of a school environment, and even get an inkling into how these facades can easily impact on how these people behave and treat those around them, but we're also able to delve deeper into their problems and see who they truly are. Each and every sequence in which we learn more about these characters' home lives is perfectly done, if not quite emotional, and reminds us how children fall victim to the pressures of high school every day.All in all, this movie kicks stereotypes where it hurts and shows us a deeper side to the most shallow of people, a softer side to the cruelest, and a more complex side to the seemingly predictable. ""The Breakfast Club"" is honest, iconic, and truly memorable. I give it a solid 9/10, simply because nothing is perfect.",The Breakfast Club
430,shaifalihere,A day of figuring oneself out!,7,3 April 2014,"The breakfast club is a buildungsroman of five high school stereotypes who figure themselves out that dull Saturday when they meet each other in detention. Brilliant acting by the star cast; the last scene where they are sitting on the floor and discussing what they did to get in here is pretty interesting. Good work in showing how family and parental influence affects children; the peer and parental pressure and ""image"" that directs their lives, and others'. Sexuality, grades, friends, fighting parents- everyone's life juggles between these and they come out of the detention room with an essay telling 'who they are'. It is not an emotional or nostalgic movie, and is a fine watch, but won't make you reaching out for tissues, reminding you of your school times. Written and directed by John Hughes, it is a clichéd story, but a good critical reading into the mindset of children. My favourite line from the movie, with which I cannot agree more: ""We're all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it.""

431,kosa-matyas,Excellent piece - perennial classic,9,14 March 2016,"Youngs are just want to be loved and understood, nothing changed since 30 years ago, in 2016 the film has the same eternal meaning. The film perfectly shows the difference, the gap between the generations and the problems of the young people in their families.John Bender's living in a dysfunctional family with a drunkard aggressive father, we can see that he is a traumatized youngster after he opened himself and told the others about his life at home where he doesn't get much love and tenderness. Andrew Clark and Brian Johnsons life is a disaster because their parents put too much burden on them, which they cannot bear. Claire Standish the spoiled prom queen seems the least overburdened between the others. Allison Reynolds the basket case definitely became ridden because her parents ignore her thats why she needs therapy.Firs when we observe them we see just normal students who got into detention because they deserved it, at least we could draw the conclusion. After we got acquainted with their feelings, their actions and they said why they did those actions we came into the consequence they just suffer from lack of love, need each other to provide support and bolster their emotions. John Bender the criminal and the teacher Richard Vernons case is typically a bad example how bad teachers are ruining the education in the schools and corrupting the integrity of the problematic pupils. The Breakfast Club shows how adamant and strong the children can be and sometimes maybe they are so intransigent because their minds know what they do.

432,TorquemadaFan,A societal horror commentary,8,4 December 2006,"A group of students have been put in Saturday detention for breaking the laws of their school. Foolishly the school principal puts them together in the library and each is to write a paper about why they think they are here. Naturally they rebel and break even more laws of their superiors. This leads to the establishment of a cult run by powerful mysterious entity.Once again, this is a much misperceived film. The liberal hugging audience thought it is about kids maturing and even teaching their adult superiors a few things, but upon closer inspection you can see the evil axis that is at hand. The students do learn something, but it is that they can exploit the weaknesses of their adult superiors for furthering the Devil's work. The principal just puts them into a room and expects them to listen to him! Fool! He should have done something himself, because ""idle hands do the devil's work."" The students proceed to indulge in drugs, profanities, and sexual fantasies as they are guided into a deep inner corruption. This is powerful message that good people can never truly rest in their mission of ridding the world of evil. The principal in the end recognizes this as he reads one paper that the students wrote and is an excuse for what he ordered them to do in the beginning.The final images are particularly shocking as the students even display their inner corruption in front of their parents who do nothing. Nothing! Is it out of shame? No, it is because they didn't do enough before and now the, just like the snowball that rolls down hill and gets bigger and heavier with each revolution, the evil is impossible to stop. The students have been recruited by the devil to further his plan of liberal take over. The final image of one of the newly recruited hellspawns as he salutes the evil force that has now the town under its umbrella is one of the most disturbing.

436,evanlivi,Overall the breakfast club is a classical movie for a reason and sill holds up well.,7,13 April 2017,"One of the greatest ironies of the breakfast club is that well one of the messages is people are so much more then their stereotype, everyone who watches the movie promptly forgets their name and only remember them by their name. They are however timeless stereotypes that are still largely the ones used to day, although if the movie was made today it might include a emo, and maybe hippy stereotypes and they would probably have more ethnic diversity. My favorite part of the movie is when the teacher is having a conversation with the janitor, I like the scene because the man who had spent the entirely of the movie being a huge dictator without the tator to all of the teens chastising them endlessly even going so far as threaten Bender, but in this scene he is humiliated and his ceaseless hate is broken down by the janitor of all people. The scene also ends with a great quote ""do you know what bothers me these are the people who are going to look after me when I get old"" ""I wouldn't count on it"". In the end almost all of the elements in this movie are timeless, with all of their themes still existing in high school society. However I don't think that high school society is quite as judgmental or clique-ish in my experience people at high schools are quite welcoming but falling under the basket case stereotype myself I am not really too experienced in high school society. In end well the breakfast club is a great movie but some of the friendships they form are a little quick to happen considering how much they fight at the start.",The Breakfast Club

438,SatanicMushrooms,Brilliant. Absolutely and utterly brilliant.,9,7 March 2009,"Despite this film being an interpretation of the sub-cultures within High School in 1985 (24 Years ago as of the time of writing this), the basic fundamentals of High School life in present-day have not change a bit, even if fashions and social groups have.The characters themselves portray, in an excellent manner, five stereotypical students of a typical American High School (a jock, ""basket-case"", princess, nerd, and a criminal - though now this could be interpreted as a stoner/gangster). Each character is very believable in the role in which they've been given, and by the end of the film, with the aid of the character development, we, the audience, are positioned to see the characters not as the stereotypes in which they're portrayed as, but as unique individuals.Emilio Estevez, despite pulling off his character as Andy Clark in a passable manner was cringe-worthy during the famous ""ad-libbed"" scene. I found myself growing impatient of his turd-flinging-ape style deliverance of lines whilst at the same time feeling a very real sense of nostalgia as the way he spoke and his sentence structure was very accurate to some of the jocks during my time in High School.This is a brilliant film in which all teenagers, regardless of what year it may be, can relate to. I strongly recommend that, should you not have seen it, hire/purchase a copy of this film immediately.",The Breakfast Club

444,jerseygalhello,My all time favorite 80's movie!!!!!,10,19 June 2000,I grew up in the 80's and lived by John Hughes movies. I love all of the films he has made. This one being my all time favorite.I knew kids just like these in my high school. I think I hung out with the Judd Nelson type.The first time I saw this movie was when i was about 12. I didn't understand all of the dialogue. But loved it anyway. Me and my friends were in love with Judd Nelson right away. I wanted to be Molly Ringwald so badly back then. As I got older I understood the dialogue much better and got all of the jokes. Also as I grew older I still Had the thing for Judd Nelson.Anyway I think this movie works well in the 80's and 90's and I am sure my son will love it when he is a teenager.,The Breakfast Club
445,moonlitek1,"A great movie, to put it simply.",10,30 June 2000,"Hi everyone!Let me start out by saying that I truly love this movie. To me, it is a movie I can watch again and again, finding something new to like about it with every viewing.Okay okay, you already know the story line and all the characters, so I'll just cut to the chase.Without a doubt, Judd Nelson gives the strongest performance in TBC. He hits every line perfectly and nothing that he says or does is ever out of character. No other actor could have played John Bender as well as him - he just fits the part so well, in appearance and actions. Not that his appearance is bad. His eyes are so gorgeous..and his hair, and his smile, and...you get the point. But I digress.Another strong performance, in my opinion, is given by Ally Sheedy. The girl hardly says anything in the entire movie, and yet her character ""speaks"" to you more than the others. Plus Allison was one of the coolest people, anyway. How come she didn't have friends? I would've hung out with her.Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, and Anthony Michael Hall give great performances too, though not as strong as the other two. Molly gives off the ""rich kid-prom queen"" vibe better than any other actress probably could. She doesn't make her character fake, like the snobbish types are in movies today. She gives Claire depth.Emilio Estevez is good in TBC, though his real shining moment is when he talks to Allison about her problems. His emotions are so apparent during the dialogue...it's at that pivotal moment that you know his athlete character has real feelings, too. And I swear, Anthony Michael Hall can do no wrong. He is so cute in this movie...his character is so believable. What an amazing underrated actor!*Spoiler*The only problem with this movie is the fact that a) Allison gets together with Andrew at the end when b) she could have gotten together with Brian (or not gotten with anyone at all). Andrew does drop little hints during the movie, if you watch closely, that he likes her, but they got together too quickly for me. It would have been a bit better if they'd just left the detention as good friends.And besides, why pass up Anthony Michael Hall? He's adorable in this movie. :o)Well, that's enough of my babbling.

In a rare case of voice-over working The Breakfast Club delivers on its intended purpose of addressing alienation, relating and drama at the teenage level, but the fun and comedy is never too far out from the picture.
Of the two girls Claire is the pretty one and no wonder she gets upskirted. And of course women being women the bad boy gets her to be his.

It really was. The characters each have their own unique personal lives and are the personalities that everyone eventually will see in school: a jock, a princess, a bully, a brain, and a person who doesn't really belong anywhere, just sticks around for the ride. It has a very good lesson behind it as well, that some people in school may seem perfect, but in truth they all have stories behind them. And when you put these different kinds of people in the same room for a day, The Breakfast Club has signaled what will probably happen. In short, brilliant film. I highly recommend it.",The Breakfast Club
449,unguarded_heart,The good times...,10,31 March 2005,"I was not quite thrilled with this movie when I saw it back in 1997---but being in 9th grade, I didn't quite get it so much as I do now.A crew of High Schoolers is put in detention on a Saturday for various ""mis-doings"" during the course of their day at school, therefore, they are punished with Saturday detention (which actually was never done in my school, but I also wasn't in High School in the eighties). There you have the Jock, The ""hood"", The ""Princess"", the ""nut"", and the ""Brain"" trapped with their ""fire breathing dragon"" of a principal.The thing that I really loved was how they all start off showing the closed mindedness of each student towards the other and all the assumptions they made and then lead into the whole ""We stick together"" thing. They all make inaccurate assumptions about each other and then really understand that the lines placed on students and cliques is all man made and they cross those lines and blur them. In the end, two of the guys and both girls get involved with each other (and the total opposite of each other ends up together) and the ""brain"" stays smart and stays single! More of a ""coming of age"" thing but a ""go against the standards and rulings of peers"" thing! The best performance was by Judd Nelson, playing John Bender. Anyone else would not have fit the part as well as he did, I don't care who it is. I believe that the part was made for him and only he could pull it off so well and Molly Ringwald's performance in their ""tension"" scenes and argument scenes was amazing---they played off of each other's energy and emotion and took it further. Also noteworthy is Ally Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall, and Emilio Estevez---all 5 played well off of each other and fed off of each other to carry the movie the way it went. The script was well written, but if the acting was no good, even the best script can go bad. Paul Gleason was also excellent in his role and his reactions and ""sternness"" really set a great tone, especially with his anger toward John Bender.Well done, a great classic, 10/10",The Breakfast Club
450,danielmeakin,a great film,9,26 January 2004,"Well, i first saw this film when i was 14, 1n 1992. That put me roughly around the age of the main characters (teenagers) so at first i just thought maybe it had bias on it. then the other week i dusted it off and watch it again. The tagline makes sense, many people lose contact after school is done. The only thing that concerned me in the script is that the flaregun going off in Brians locker and the false fire alarm raised by Bender, seemingly have gone unnoticed by the other 4, as they are not met with any real response from the others. unlike, andy's taping of larry lesters buns---and thats only mentioned coz Brian knows him. What basically the point of it is, is that apart from Bender knowing that Claire is the prom queen, and a comment to Allison, that he has ""seen her around"" they are anonymous to each other. The dialogue between Bender and Vernon is great, Judd Nelson is by far the most popular character overall (according to online polls ive seen)but i believe the show stopper is Ally Sheedy. Her poise throughout the film similar to Judd nelsons, only nelson has far more dialogue to work with. All the actors have at least one real powerful bit of acting, Bender explaining what his family are like and then goes up to andy and shows him the cigar burn, Brians ""i dont understand pressure"" Allisons ""i dont have to run to the streets"" andy explaiing that his father ""will not tolerate losers in this family"" Claire when she has been tricked into saying shes a virgin. Generally, i believe this is a greatly underated film, and would have been good to see a sequel, but with the tagline---it kinda makes it impossible. i voted it a 9....(well above its average)",The Breakfast Club

It starts out when 5 students get a Saturday detention. There's Brian a nerd, Allison a freak, John the criminal, Andy the jock, and Claire the princess. They start out by hating and annoying each other to becoming the best of fiends. What makes this story great is they have totally different backrounds and totally different personalities it is amazing how they go from hating each other and having nothing in common to liking each other and having everything in common. This is a very good film for a lot of adults I would not recommend this to children under 12 because of some language used. I give this movie*** out of *****",The Breakfast Club
452,dlsperl,A gem made when the Brat Pack had passion for acting.,10,16 August 2012,"When I first started watching this movie about five students (each a different type) spending a Saturday in detention, I was thinking this won't be nearly as good as Fast Times at Ridgemont High. It is all taking place in the school library and Fast Times had so many multiple settings. I ended up liking it slightly better (both were very good).This movie starred many members of a group known as the Brat Pack in 1985. It was early in most of their acting careers and you could tell their passion for acting was very high. I think it was Anthony Michael Hall's first film and he delivered a great performance. There were some movies in the late '80's/early 90's that had performances that were not as good by some of these actors. I usually check the date on a Brat Pack movie...early to mid '80's and the odds are it was good. Late '80's to early '90's and it is less likely.The actor that played the disciplinarian that supervised them and made threats to have them spend more Saturdays there was perfect for his role. His conflict with Judd Nelson's character was very well acted by both actors. There was a solid rock music soundtrack as well. It shows how these students clash at first and then slowly realize that it will be a very long day if they do not try to achieve a small measure of civility.The first part of the movie shows a dysfunctional environment that then transforms to at least some respect among the students. It reminded me of the first time I had jury duty(and that was with older adults..albeit 12 people instead of five. Ha!).There is also a romantic connection that perhaps was a bit forced and not plausible, but this was common in the eighties. Most of us knew people that were very similar to some of these students in high school and the performances are very good or better with some good messages provided. It is about 60% drama and 40% comedy.",The Breakfast Club
453,nacho-iyaam,A melodramatic caricature of school life?,5,5 November 2014,"I watched this again after a long while. The first time I watched it I was in the 90s and I would've been about 14 or 15, and I found it boring to be honest. As for now, I did find it a little more interesting, but it didn't have any memories flooding back.I'll start by explaining why I called it a melodramatic caricature... The Principal. He was just a typical tyrannical teacher from any random teen school movie. And I used that as a starting point for the five kids. Also, Bender looked like he was dressed as a 'rebel' for a cheap school play, as well as looking old enough to be one of the teachers.Those things aside, I don't know what life was really like in American schools in the 80s, but it sure as hell was nothing like this for us in English schools in the 90s. Kids weren't generally that segregated. We still had the separate friend groups, but that would include people from all of the categories in this movie. As for Bender, I thought he had some serious mental issues, because most of the time he was just acting out like a five year old that'd been told he can't have anymore sweets.It was still an OKish movie. Personally I would've been impressed if it was ad-libbed. Because, lets face it, as a written movie some of the long monologues just sound silly.And I'll just end by saying Bueller was a better movie. :D",The Breakfast Club
454,ironmaiden138,Simply an 80's Classic,10,28 May 2016,"I find it hard to believe that anyone who grew up in the 80's hasn't seen this movie. So, I guess this review is for generations after then, that may be looking for a ""classic"" movie to watch which gives an idea of life during the 80's. This movie will fit the high school life part of the 80's nicely. The premise is simple - 5 completely different high schoolers all do something to be punished with a Saturday detention session. You've got Emilio Estevez as the jock, Ally Sheedy as the ""weird"" girl, Molly Ringwald as the prom queen, Judd Nelson as the burnout and Anthony Michael Hall as the nerd. At the start, they don't know each other, but that all changes after they spend the day together, talking life and delving further into the hearts of each kid.The humor is great. The acting is better. Anthony Michael Hall and Judd Nelson each give fantastic performances, but Paul Gleason as the principal is truly wonderful casting. He's the perfect personality to sit thru this Saturday and watch these 5 ""punks"". The exchanges between him and Judd Nelson throughout the film are some of the most underrated acting performances of the 80's. They play so well off each other and it shows.This is probably my favorite of the John Hughes movies and I highly recommend to anyone who may not have ever had the chance to see this classic",The Breakfast Club

John Hughes creates an atmosphere by bringing together five students from different cliques within high school and forcing them to interact with each other. At first this treads familiar paths, albeit an excellent standard; however, the conclusion gives an emotional, climactic pay-off which puts it ahead of the rest.Judd Nelson may look a little too old but shines as the main antagonist, striking a perfect balance between rebellion and childish back chat. The other characters too, are well played, and undiluted by a noticeable-by-its-absence supporting cast.If you are, or ever were, a teenager/in school, then you'll enjoy this film.",The Breakfast Club

It doesn't have the lasting power of similar 80s films such as Stand By Me, but it still shows a good depiction of high school stereotypes.Although The Breakfast Club is set in the 80s, not much has changed in some modern day schools. If a modern day breakfast club were to be made, it would look pretty similar to the original. My favorite scene in the movie was when Brian asked the club ""What's going to happen on Monday? Will we still be friends?"". This shows the insanity of the social hierarchy in high school and how if you are unpopular you cannot be seen talking to the ""cool kids"".I believe they stuck to their agreement on Monday since the film ended on a positive note with new relationships made. The Breakfast club shows the bad side of high school with all of the cliques that are still echoed today.",The Breakfast Club

It's probably my most re-watched movie of all time.It starts with 5 teenagers having to spend a Saturday in school for detention. They are completely different and have absolutely NOTHING in common.

There is something about it that juxtaposes how phony and gimmick-laden modern cinema has gotten, as if the women not made of silicone and solid shea butter aren't enough.One would have to be a rather immense movie snob in order to dislike this film, especially if you're young. It shows different perspectives of very well-written characters, and reminds you that there's usually an explanation when you judge someone. It assumes nothing, and levels the field for adults and kids. Not only does it strike at popularity and age discrimination, but also has a humanistic charm which instills a little more faith in people in general.There is also an aura of idealism from the characters, and it's that sort of mentality that keeps people productive and optimistic.

It represents teenage life very well from different points of view. but this is not the best thing about this movie, what i liked most about this film is that it criticizes each of the five characters. the jock and the princess are criticized for their completely unauthentic behavior, they can't think for themselves, everything they do is because someone tells them to do it or because of peer pressure. then the brainy one is told that his whole life should not be the grades at school and that he shouldn't be obsessed with them. the basket case is told that she shouldn't shut herself out of the world and socialize a little more, and finally the criminal is told that he can't rebel against everything CZ he'll just ""lose"" of he does. i think a combination of these five types of people makes out an almost perfect person, but this movie does not tell us to be perfect, it tells us to be who we really are, to be ourselves no matter what defects we have.

462,gregg084,One of the most overrated teen pics ever,5,10 May 2001,"While a passable film. It just never rang true. Hughes tries to define all 80's teens in 5 cookie cutter characters speaking as if they were in their 30's. Although it is sometimes billed as a comedy, it's simply not funny. As a drama it comes across as preachy and overdone with the whole film trying to take itself way too seriously. It might have made a decent stage play, but didn't make such a great movie.  I was in high school in the 80's and if we would have seen kids that acted like the characters in The Breakfast Club we probably would have exiled them (after beating them up). Don't get me wrong, I don't hate this film, I just think that it's a far cry from the way it really was and much less than Hughes' other teen films of the era.

One year when my son was home from school during summer vacation and was a freshman in high school I created a couple of homework assignments over the summer break. I had him watch a few movies that I thought he could learn something from and this movie was one of them. I feel its this movies story could help to teach young people about a lot of things like diversity, unity, peer pressure, bullying and just coping with pressures of home and school life.

465,sugar_n_spice,Quite possibly the best teenage movie to date. (spoilers throughout),10,22 June 2007,"""Saturday, March 24, 1884. Shermer High School. Shermer, Illinois, 60062.""Most people would give an exasperated sigh at that monotonous voice-over, but not in this case, since preceding it was a David Bowie lyric from ""Changes"" on a black screen smashed like a glass window, the pieces falling to reveal Shermer High. Such an opening visual wakes up the audience to the sleepy town of Shermer, Illinois--sleepy like the monotone of the voice-over.What you get from the voice-over is that five people have detention from 7:00 a.m. to dinnertime (I believe it's 6:00 p.m.), and each person is a typical high school teenage stereotype: the brain, the athlete, the basket case, the princess, and the criminal. Following the voice-over, you witness each student arrive at school.The princess skipped class to go shopping, but her father clearly spoils her and doesn't seem to care much about her offense. Because we know so early what Claire (the princess) did to get the detention, we assume that her character is easy to read. But after a while, you find out that her parents use her for leverage in a crumbling and loveless marriage; that she's no promiscuous ""little-miss-popular,"" but rather a naive virgin; and she actually hates being the popular person she is, and hates her material world and the pressures in it.The athlete's father seems to be genuinely concerned about his son. He says that guys ""screw around"" and that's customary, except this time Andy (the jock) got caught, and he has to suffer the consequences now. His father tells him to basically get his act together, because no school will give scholarships to discipline cases--which is true, and he's right. But throughout the movie it's revealed that Andy has no desire to be a varsity wrestler; he only does it because it makes his father proud. And then you find out that the reason Andy is in detention is because he beat up a much weaker kid in the locker room. Why? Because his father dislikes weakness, and Andy wanted to please his father. Once Andy's heartbreaking story is told, you look back on the conversation between Andy and his father in the truck and realize what a douche-bag his father really is.The brain's case is possibly the most surprising of all of them. Brian (brain, with the ""a"" and the ""i"" reversed) is a straight-A student who seems to be picked on a lot by people like Claire, Andy, and the criminal. He always tries to fit in, and you wonder what got such a nice kid in detention in the first place? A gun in his locker, because he failed wood-shop (a class he thought would be easy and give him a chance to mingle with more ""average"" and popular kids) and ruined his 4.0 GPA. It's not really his family that pressures him so much (although you can see in the beginning that his mother isn't happy with him AT ALL), but rather himself, because school smarts are the only smarts that people like him really know, and they are afraid to fail at the one thing they are good at. (Take it from someone who was almost exactly like him in junior high--minus the gun.) Although the gun was only a flare, it showed everyone else at detention that Brian needed to break out of his shell and become their friend.The criminal, John Bender (they just call him Bender), doesn't come to school with a parent, he walks. When he gets inside the library (where the detention is held), he takes the phone off the hook and does a couple of other kooky things. He seems to take pride in being able to annoy people, especially Claire and Principal Vernon, the guy who basically represents the rest of Society to the five students. He pulled a false fire alarm to get into detention, and he earns another eight during this detention. But he's not really heartless, despite several arguments where he practically crucifies Claire (his crush). During the course of the movie, you find that his father is physically abusive (proven by the cigar burn on his arm), and he has just as many feelings as any other kid at school, though his are well-hidden.The last student is the basket case, Allison. She didn't do anything to earn the detention, but lied to her parents because she actually had nothing better to do on a Saturday. When she gets out of the car in the beginning (the back seat, actually), she tries to talk to her mother, but her mother rolls up the window and drives off. Apparently, she is always ignored at home, and she reaches out to the unsuspecting students at detention, actually finding out most of their stories through careful insight before they admit anything (especially Andy).So, what happened on Monday? This is a popular question for Breakfast Club fans. Do Andy and Allison stay together? What about Bender and Claire? When Brian walks up to one of them, will they shun him (as usual) or accept him? Will Andy apologize to Larry Lester for beating him up? Will all of the students resolve their problems with the parental units? And finally, will Principal Vernon find a way to actually reach out to students in need instead of always putting them down? The fact that the Breakfast Club is open-ended, and the way it makes the viewers' imaginations take off, is one of the many things that make it a perfect 10.",The Breakfast Club

Judd Nelson plays a Criminal like person and makes fun of people yet he does have feelings. Molly Ringwald is very good in this movie and so is Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, and Anthony Michael Hall. I have only seen the tv version of it but it really gives you a chance to think about how people acted in 1985. It is totally HIGH SCHOOL. I love the quote that Brian says near the end the letter one. Dear Mr. Vernon. that one.",The Breakfast Club
468,mellenyt,Not all it's cracked up to be,4,21 July 2001,"I remember when this movie came out and everyone thought it was the greatest thing...it just ""spoke"" to our generation so much.  I never understood all that.  Rather than appealing to audiences because it was interesting and made sense, it just seemed to me like it capitalized on every teenager's hidden fantasies about fitting in.  Girls liked it because it let them imagine for a minute that they too could suddenly get the star quarterback or the standoffish rebel.  And guys must have liked it because it let them think that dating them was the ultimate goal for every teenage girl, and girls would be willing to fundamentally change themselves to be with them. The message of this film is terrible for teenagers.  It shows one guy who doesn't even notice the girl until she radically changes her appearance to fit into his own model of beauty, and another guy who shows his affection by being verbally insulting and abusive until the very end.  I just don't understand what's so great about this movie.",The Breakfast Club

I know most of the script off by heart... but the best thing is, I notice something new every time, even now.As a kid, I always wanted a sequel... but that would have ruined it (like Grease 2)... so I'm happy to keep watching, drooling over Bender (he's SO cool)and pretending I am not in my 30's!!",The Breakfast Club

472,rmolloy9,Pretentious as hell,2,6 January 2021,"This is one of the most overrated movies in film history.I was in high school about the same time this movie was made. This resembled NOTHING of what high school was like.I believe John Hughes was only 35 when he wrote this but you would bet that he was a 50 year old trying to figure out how kids talked or related to each other. Clueless and pretentious as hell. Characters doing and saying things just to jolt the audience into saying...""WOAH...that guy's a rebel!"" Or ""Boy, that girl's pretty weird!"" To quote Bender...pathetic and sad.I compare it to Robin Williams' comedy act from the 80's. Somehow it got labeled as hip and important when it was actually crap. Everybody thought they had to like it or be labeled uncool or someone who just ""didn't get it."". Everybody was afraid to say that the emperor had no clothes.Hughes got it right and very funny with 16 Candles but fell in love with himself in this one and made a pretentious classic for the pretentious masses.",The Breakfast Club

474,Sarah22222222,The Breakfast Club,10,8 January 2008,"It was one of the most definitive films of the 80's and one of the first to really address the growing teen anarchy yet ""The Breakfast Club"" still rings true today. It is the story of five teenagers each from a different social group who are trapped together in Saturday detention from seven am till four. By the end of the day they begin to realise they have more in common than they once thought and that judging a book by it's cover can be deeply deceiving.Sometimes called contrived, ""The Breakfast Club"" should not be taken at face value. In reality these five students probably would not relate in the deep and meaningful way in which they do, but it's symbolic and that should be remembered. It's a film about understanding why people are the way they are and realising that we are all human in the end.""Molly Ringwald"" is the daddy's plastic popular princess. Everybody loves her, looks up to her, worships her, or so it's thought. The Breakfast club unveils her unhappiness with her image and the pressure she suffers, but still her own vanity and excuse less cruelty. She's a more realistic version of the stereotype too often presented as a dumb cheer leading blonde. She happens to infuriate the class clown and ""bad boy"" John Bender, portrayed by ""Judd Nelson"" who's anger is fuelled both by his oppressed affection for her and own sad home life which contrasts greatly with Claire (Ringwald) in her diamond earrings. Next is the ""jock"", Andy (Emilio Estevez), secretly hating his father for forcing to him to constantly compete and hating himself for the cruelty he's shown in the past in order to impress his father. If there's a jock there inevitably has to be a ""geek"", played by Anthony Michael Hall. Brain box Brian might get teased for his interest in chemistry, maths or physics and weedy nature but is secretly envied by the rest of the breakfast club who automatically assume his parents must lavish him with affection for his academic success and good behaviour, however, his very reason for being in detention makes it crystal clear that this isn't the case. And of course there is the one who doesn't fit any title or social group, the ""quirk"". Allison (Ally Sheady) claims she considers fleeing her home because her parents simply ignore her. It is proved that how we are raised effects us so greatly, in that none of the rest have heard her talk before today. When she talks she talks a lot, adding that she is a compulsive liar.Confined to one room for the majority of the film ""The Breakfast Club"" relies on strong characters and intelligent dialogue. It's unpredictable, funny and often moving. Within it's 97 minute running time it manages to say a lot about society; family life, school life, authority and the notion of happiness. Is anyone truly happy? Can happiness in all aspects of life at once ever be achieved? The film also breathes hope in stating what can be achieved when we begin to understand each other more.""The Breakfast Club"" addresses a fear of young people worldwide: Do we really turn into our parents when we grow up? ""It's unavoidable"" says Allison, ""When you grow up, your heart dies."" It is the sincerity and sadness with which such lines are delivered that make this film so believable and special. In a decade of ""American Pie"" type teen comedies, which, despite being somewhat entertaining, preach fairly hollow messages, it's been a long time since a gem such as ""The Breakfast Club"" has graced our screens. It is a more realistic image of teen life, not so warped by Hollywood glamour and refreshingly, although it is raised as an issue, not focusing on sex drugs and rock and roll. Seeing this film more than twenty years after it's release, baring in mind the amount of hype and discussion it received and constant references in other films and television shows I expected to be disappointed on finally viewing it. I certainly wasn't. ""The Breakfast Club"" will change how you think if you let it. At the very least, the next time you see somebody you think you've got sussed out, you'll find your mind wandering back to the jock, the beauty, the brain, the criminal and the kook and you'll wonder if what you see is really what you get.",The Breakfast Club
475,aleapug,A realistic and intimate portrayal of teen life,10,2 August 2013,"The Breakfast Club was a breakthrough movie in the 80's. John Hughes wrote and directed this masterpiece about five completely dissimilar teenagers who are forced to spend 8 hours together in the library for detention. This movie can grab you in, making you laugh, or making you even shed a tear. The Breakfast Club is one of the best movies from the 80's and possibly the best teenage movie of the century.I always find some hilarious lines from John Bender (""Does Barry Manilow know you raid his wardrobe?""), and some great lines from Principal Vernon. The movie manages to make you laugh a lot. However, for these five teens, they may be dissimilar, but they all relate to having parent issues. Somewhere between the arguing with them all, they find friendships in their 8 hour endeavor which is shown in the last 30 minutes of the film. One of the best and funniest scenes from the film, is where they gather to the back of the library and smoke weed. Although a very obviously wrong thing to do, they manage to shield the pain through the drugs supposedly. It portrays how teens live their lives and when they need to get away from the abuse they might have. Emilio Estevez doing back-flips across the library, while the rest are stoned on the couch is an example of the comedic style and energy shown through adolescence. The first hour makes you laugh, makes you root, makes you wish for the 80's, and makes you think. After all the chaos; (Arguing, Smoking, Escaping Vernon, Laughing, Crawling through the air vents.etc), they gather on the top of the library and create one of the best and most wonderfully scripted emotional scenes to date.In the last superb/emotional 30 minutes of the film; They pour their hearts out to each other. Emotional topics such as suicide, abuse, and drugs are brought into the conversation caused by all of their parents. Molly Ringwald's character ""Claire"" doesn't believe their friendships will carry on after the Saturday of detention when Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) asks the question. They all eventually break into tears after they all admit the stress of life, school, and popularity.They end a legendary conversation with admitting that they care about each other and a laugh at Brian's expense (although he eventually laughs with them too.) After dancing to 80's pop music in happiness (which i yearn to hear in movies again), giving Allison a makeover, and writing the supposed letter posed to be written to Mr. Vernon in the beginning about ""who they think they are""; They walk out of detention with pride and accomplishment. The film ends with Bender raising his fist to the sky on the school field (as a freeze frame.)Although i didn't describe every detail of the film: (Relationships, Locker Scene, Closet Scene, Gym Scene.etc), i summed up what the movie was about, and it is a fun watch. It may bring you nostalgia, but it always manages to bring a smile to your face (at least for me). The Breakfast Club is a classic that will always be one of my favorite movies.

They have a different characteristic such as a sportsman, a genius, a bad boy, a princess and a mysterious girl. They don't have a common point but they talk and complain about their parents with each other. They gradually open up to each other and each students think about who am I. When I was a high school student, I belonged to a basketball club. There are various kinds of player in the club. As a result, a conflict among the players sometimes happened and each time we talked to each other for a long time and we could open up to each other. Finally, our team got a strong union.

Everyone was perfect in this movie. I have no problems with it whatsoever. It is probably one of the closest relations to actual teenage/high school life that I have ever seen on the big screen (Most of those movies are totally exaggerated and idiotic. People aren't setting fire to things in the school lawn and there aren't massive Junior girl fights in the corridors,at least not where I go to school). All of my friends love this movie and, like me, can see themselves in each one of the characters, even though they are all so different. That is what makes this movie so profound and excellent. Perfect. I can't say too much else. I'm going to buy it as soon as I can get to the mall again.And to those who don't like it, I have one thing to say. ""Eat my shorts."" :)",The Breakfast Club
478,louisebindon,Ode To Teen Spirit,9,9 November 2015,"I remember hearing about The Breakfast Club for years before I actually got around to watching it. As soon as I graduated from elementary school and started on my way to high school, I had people constantly telling to watch The Breakfast Club because it's ""amazing"". They would then tell me they love the movie and I could never seem to get a word out of them past that. No one would tell me what the plot was or why it was so amazing, until one day I straight up asked my mom what this ""amazing"" movie is about. She replied with, ""It's about a bunch of teenagers."" I wasn't sure what to do with all of this new information, so I finally sat myself down and watched it. I have to say, I can certainly see why everyone recommended this movie for my then excited soon-to-be eighth grade self. Despite the fact that this movie is set around 30 years ago, the ideas and issues they cover in this movie are timeless. While the focus is teens' issues, they also give us a glimpse into the world of those who are growing older. They show us how alarming it can be to watch as the younger generations stumble in, seemingly destroying everything they can, while the adults change unknowingly into the people they'd hoped they'd never be. There isn't anything I really dislike about this movie. Normally, I would have a whole list of things that I think could be tweaked in a movie. There's something about this movie that feels different. Every time I find something that could be considered a ""flaw,"" I consider the context and I realize that it is not in fact a ""flaw,"" it is simply something that adds to the story and tone of the film. This film almost feels untouchable; it is still so famous and well-loved so many years later. Despite the fact that it's set in a sketchy, nearly unoccupied high school, this movie somehow contributes to the romanticized fantasy all eighth graders have about high school. High school is a place for the big kids: it's where you find your clique and look cool. No matter what is happening in your life, there's always going to be at least one more person who knows what you're going through, which is an idea that is relevant for people of all ages. I really love the fact that John Hughes took characters that you can see in everyday aspects of high school life and broke them down to show that they are multifaceted and more than the image they project. All of the adults in this movie are shown as stubborn, insensitive fools who refuse to bother listening or paying attention to the kids who's live they're messing up. One of the most memorable adults in this film is the looming presence of authority, Principal Vernon. The students seem to view him as a bad guy and I can certainly see why. When I look at him as a character, I see an unhappy, afraid, old man who feels like he's tripping over his feet trying to keep up with the rest of the world. He believes that he is a victim of injustice: the kids are just getting brattier and brattier and he's just a guy trying to knock some sense back into them. He receives a strong, cold glass of reality when Carl (the janitor) tells him bluntly and without malice that it's not the kids who are changing, it's him. Yes, I do agree that a lot of young people are brats: it's what we do. We're too inexperienced and new to the world to see beyond our problems. What Vernon needs to understand is that he is the one who is changing. Yes, parents can't get away with the same punishment they did a few decades ago and yes, there is a surplus of new technology that is changing the way people experience their lives. But Vernon is changing himself. Nothing seems bright and shiny and new anymore. He's seen every kind of kid you could see, he knows the tricks, and his life has fallen into a sad routine. He expects respect for his experience in the world, while all he does is throw his weight around and pretend that he understands every kid he meets because he's probably met at least three others like them. He can't remember why he chose to do this. He watches bright eyed kids graduate every year to experience new adventures and start their lives. All of these kids are passionate and ready to live and learn new things, but he has no more adventures left.This movie is a cult classic because it has aspects that appeal to both the young and old. Both sides are provided with an insight into the other. We learn about each other's struggles and find that appearances can indeed be misleading. Despite all of the images and airs people may put on, we are all complex humans with valid feelings and thoughts. All we want is to find empathy and belonging. Decades may pass, but we all still have basic, common struggles. I think one of the reasons this movie is so loved is because it's so easy to connect with: no matter who you are, if you're a human, you'll probably be able to relate to at least one aspect of this move. This movie helps remind the audience that it's okay if you don't have everything figured out, no matter what age you are. It's hard when you don't know who you are or can't remember.",The Breakfast Club
479,Stalker74,Moronic Stereotypes add up to Dumb Movie,1,16 October 2005,"The Breakfast Club has to be one of the dumbest and most boring movies ever made. Who can buy Jughead Nelson as a bully? He looks like a girl. Alley Seedy, Molly Ringworm, Anthony Michael (wasn't he in Van Halen), and Emilio Sheen Estevez (Thanks to his Dad, Martin Sheen, for this role). What a cast of boring rich kids.Ally Sheedy, she was what? An alcoholic? Judd Nelson was a victim of his Dad? Talk about unimaginative stereotypes. The Breakfast Club was one big stereotype, down to the dork who played the Principal. These characters are two-dimensional and dated. Would five people who hated each other spend all day whining to each other? What kind of school ever had Detention for more than one hour? Reform School? Of course, by the end of the movie, the corny canned ""Let's Be Friends"" ending is trotted out for the five millionth time. Hollywood thinks movie audiences are made up of morons, and the fact that so many people think that The Breakfast Club is a classic just goes to show that Hollywood is right about the dumb masses. Breakfast Club is the ultimate Low-Budget teen rip-off movie. Give them fake angst, whining, and blame the parents; and teens lacking self-esteem will run to the theaters to pay.",The Breakfast Club

Bender is aggressive, but at the end of the movie he changes a more compassionate person. The social insecurities of high school is a timeless aspect shown in the movie. Bullying is still a problem, but has severely decreased in todays schools. My favourite quote from this movie is: ""Chicks can not hold dis smoke.""

482,krissy_24514,The Ultimate Teen Film,10,31 May 2008,"I have so much love for this film that it can barely be contained. It really is just such a clever and inclusive way at looking at adolescence and high school cliques. The movie is easy to follow and the change in each character is gradually and believably seen.Judd Nelson is mesmerizingly charismatic as the witty and defensively flippant, John Bender. And really, he makes this movie. Not wanting to take anything away from the other actors, but he has about 40% of the dialog. If Nelson's performance had lacked even slightly, the whole movie could have fallen over. But he is fantastic.One of the most interesting things about this movie, is how much you care about the characters and how much you just wanted them to succeed at everything in the future. A sequel here, would not have gone astray. But obviously now, it is much too late. And the idea of a remake makes me nauseous. I would hate anyone else playing these characters. They were all that good.The most asked question, upon finishing the film is, no doubt, ""What's going to happen on Monday?"" And I, as much as anyone, would love to know the answer to that question. But ultimately, it doesn't matter. If they all ignored each other for the rest of their high school careers, it wouldn't matter. Because they still had something that day in detention. They still learned something about themselves from each other. And for a day, at least, they could say they were completely themselves, and they were still liked.I don't care if Judd Nelson was an a-hole to Molly Ringwald during filming, I don't care that they played horrible 80's music throughout (like seriously, they had Duran Duran, the Go's Go's, Cold Chisel, etc, they couldn't have taken one of those paths?), I don't care that there's no way that Emilio Estevez could have broken that glass simply by yelling (he's hardly Pavarotti).

492,suzi-75611,Mixed feelings,6,17 April 2020,"As a millennial teenager I loved many late 90s and noughties coming of age films but never much delved into the classics that came before which helped to define the genre I so loved. Having finally got round to watching The Breakfast Club, I have mixed feelings about it.As we get older we forget what it FEELS like to be a certain age. If like me, you watch this film for the first time round as an adult, the characters can come across as overly dramatic and temperamental, which can make them a little frustrating to watch. If you can try to consider what it was like being a teenager again and recall some of these feelings, you can perhaps see past these traits, or at least have more empathy for them. Having said this, I do feel I enjoyed it more now than I would have done if I had seen it when I was younger - I think I would've been underwhelmed and found the film too slow paced.I thought the original introduction of the characters was interesting and they were all entertaining in their own way. I was expecting a little more in the way of meaningful relationships to develop though and this never happened. They were all arguing and quite nasty to eachother with only 15minutes left of the runtime - by the time they get let out it wasn't really enough to believe that any of them would be on good terms with eachother.
The romantic relationships that formed right at the end were both frustrating and disappointing. I appreciated that the relationship between Claire and Bender was hinted at throughout the film and not completely sprung out of the blue, unlike Andrew and Allison. They had a great deal of interaction together and a few suggestive looks were given. However, their get together was just so utterly diappointing given how he treated her, with no forgiveness or character arc from him.Although I was disappointed by that aspect, I couldn't help but quite enjoy the majority of The Breakfast Club and still felt entertained. Maybe a classic for its time, but it would absolutely no way receive the same praise had it been released today.",The Breakfast Club

495,LittleOracle,This was what high school in the 80s was like...,8,9 January 2002,"It blows me away when I read the nasty comments about this movie.  From what I remember when I first saw it, it hit home in a number of areas for me -- as it did for plenty of teens that I knew.  Remember, this was a HUGE hit back in '85 and that was because kids related.  This wasn't just another teen romance -- it actually attempted to dig deeper into the crud we knew as high school cliques.Don't get me wrong, it has it's shallow moments and I cringe when I watch chunks of it but that's because I couldn't stand being a teenager.  Who on earth did?  Think about it... each cliche in the movie existed somewhere in your high school in some relatable form.  John Hughes knew what he was doing when he took a person from every major clique in high school and said, ""What would happen if you put them all in a locked up room together for a Saturday afternoon?""  He succeeded somewhat.  Each clique member eventually revealed that they were a person underneath the label.  That was the whole point of the movie.As for where Hughes got his inspirations and writings, it was very simple: he talked to teenagers and plenty of them.  Sure, he didn't capture it entirely, but he got pretty close.  I remember watching this with friends and my mother saying that high school wasn't anything like that and all of us replying: ""Yes, it is.""  I remember my local church posting a bulletin that they were playing it for the kids that attended that evening (despite the language) because it had a good lesson.  I remember that it made such an impact on my high school that they actually performed it onstage in a play. Why?  That's because John Hughes somehow captured underneath the unbelievable crashing windows and ceilings collapsing how crappy it is to be a teenager.Still think it's a bad movie?

I don't like to copy other people, but this movie is so great, it's a reminder of who we really are, and always should be: young.That's wright, always stay young in your heart and the looks will follow.This is a movie that can be watched all over again, without getting bored, it's definitely a ten from my point of view.However i do must admit that the end of the movie left me with a sad sense of nostalgia, like a beautiful tale that must end eventually.I didn't like that.Still, for me this movie is and always be Number One.What is the message? Stay young! Always!",The Breakfast Club
497,Lee_Baker,A Summary Of Every By-gone Era,9,9 June 2008,"While 'The Breakfast Club' appears on the outside to be a one-dimensional high school comedy about five misfits who are each spectacularly different, the truth is actually far deeper and much more intriguing...Each person in 'The Club' represents each group in schools across the board. We have 'The Athlete', 'The Basket-Case', 'The Princess', 'The Brain' and not forgetting 'The Criminal'. Each of these students believe that they are simply there to be disciplined, but the truth is an eye-opener seeing as detention is possibly the best thing to happen to them in their educational lives. It helps them garner an understanding of each individual and, while some of them don't exactly see eye-to-eye on their first meeting, they grow and crawl out of their typecast shells and see the characters for what they really are: Individual.This may be an obvious insight, but rarely have we witnessed a movie so spectacularly spellbinding and riveting as this one. Another point of note is that the viewers and the characters and confined to merely a few rooms in this, at times, claustrophobic school which is characterised as some sort of prison for these no-hopers. Thus leaving the movie hinging on it's dialogue and acting (a la '12 Angry Men', 'Dial M For Murder', 'Rope', etc.), which, for a group of young thespians is spectacular... One to be seen to be believed. Thoroughly recommended. Two thumbs up.",The Breakfast Club
498,zerrega,They are stupid and contagious,1,4 February 2011,"I like John Hughes movies - Planes, Trains And Automobiles is one of my all-time favourites comedy, Ferris Bueller's Day Off was great, Uncle Buck and Sixteen Candles were OK so I was thinking that Breakfast Club which got such high rating on IMDb should be at least no worse than his Weird Science or Curly Sue. But it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I suspect that it got above average rating from damsels who liked Estevez. The movie is about nothing, no plot, no story, no emotions - just a bunch of stupid teenagers pretending that they have something to say not only to themselves but to us too. I was a teenager too but I fully understood that I have to learn a lot and I was reading A LOT of books, visiting art museums, concerts etc. I don't understand why someone has decided that this is a comedy. It's so pointless and dull that I can't say this is a movie at all. The speeches of Mr. Brezhnev in his late days when he had a lot of problems with brain functioning were much more exciting and dynamic than this worthless monument of American teenage stupidity. After vwatching this crap I now understand why there was no sequel - according to this movie all these teenage dimwits should blow their brains or become junkies in a year or two. The ""experience"" of watching this is just like eating and digesting a NY telephone directory.",The Breakfast Club

500,razitar,Most unrealistic movie in years,2,15 January 2013,"I cannot believe how this movie could have gotten such a high rating from so many critics and being called one of the cream movies of the 80's. Were people stupid and cliché back then? The story moves around five stereotypical teens at a high school in America who got a whole day detention, and their task is to write an essay about who they think they are. Here we have the athlete, good looking guy who bullies others to please his dad. The prom queen lady who is afraid of being called a bitch or a slut and therefore avoids talking about her virginity. The little nerd who brags about his good grades and tries to fit into the group all the time. The anarchistic bully who doesn't care about anything and just messes around to have some fun. And last but not least the quiet and introvert emo-girl who shows off her weirdness by eating a sandwich buttered with sugar and unboiled pasta. Seriously??More than half of the movie is about that bully guy who can't stop gathering attention by messing around, picking fights, yelling mean things at each and everyone of the other students in order to find their weak mental points. Everything culminates in all of them sitting in a ring together, smoking pot and becoming best friends by whining about how more miserable their lives are compared to others. Okay, up to that part, I can still squeeze out enough energy to believe in the plots' realism. But what really went on my nerves is how that bully guy can be as mean as he wants to be and everybody follows him regardless, going down the hallway to get some drugs from his locker, sitting around smoking, talking about their parents and their miserable lives. And no matter HOW nice everyone is and shows him that he is understood and that nobody wants him any harm, but rather help him, he continues to be mean and hurtful toward others. He is at his worst against the prom queen girl who just doesn't want to admit that she is still a virgin, because she is too afraid of the others opinion. He throws sexist comments at her all the time and makes her cry and break down at last. I became so furious at the movie because NOBODY tries to tell him that he doesn't have to be mean all the time, just because he has a hard home life. The worst part starts at the very last ten minutes of the movie. Now after the quarrel in the group ring has reached its limit, the teens put on some music and dance like there's no tomorrow. Everybody is friends with each other right now, despite that they fought and hurt each other just a minute ago. The essay that everybody has to hand in is for the smart nerd to write, all five of them. Because ""he is the smart one"", as the athlete boy describes it. Meanwhile, the prom queen is giving the weird girl a makeup lift, and suddenly the athlete has eyes for her and falls immediately in love with her and she with him, so they end up becoming a kissing couple in the last three minutes. Same goes for the prom queen who starts to kiss the bully and asks him to be her boyfriend. The movie ends with their teacher reading the nerds essay which reads that nobody really can know who they really are because everybody just sees others as they want to see them. The end.I was really disappointed at the end. Because the movie showed such interesting potential when everybody was explaining their hardship to each others in their own ways. It was interesting to observe how they would react to and bound with each other once they would realize that they all had problems and were different than what they appeared to be. But after that happened, it just went downhill. You can't expect the audience to believe that two people can fall in love with each other after a makeup or after one treated the other like crap the whole day. It doesn't make for a believable end and that is what made the movie become very disappointing. There were many open questions left unanswered, like how next Monday would be when they would see each other at school again and stop ""being friends"". I wished the writers would have considered such things to make the movie more realistic instead of more appealing to the target audience.",The Breakfast Club

The acting was great, you actually felt where they were coming from. Also, it showed and stated a lot of feelings that kids go through at this age, but most people wouldn't like to admit and talk about.

Whether you grew up in the 1980's or not, this movie is timeless and can probably apply to school's for the rest of time. Outstanding performances all around, excellent storyline and has the ability to hold almost anyone's attention. A very easy movie to relate to no matter what social group you were/are in.

The direction in this movie was astounding. I couldn't believe how well the director cast the characters. Allison was a hysterical yet deep addition to the cast.

508,paigeelton,The Best HIgh School Film of All Time,9,6 November 2015,"The Breakfast Club is an all time classic, and in my eyes, one of the greatest films ever made. It has managed to stay on top as one of the best, iconic high school films of all time to this day, tackling the rebellion of youth, and social problems still faced today. Why? Because it so accurately portrays the life of teenagers. Capturing the classic stereotypes of the brain, the athlete, the basket case, the princess and the criminal. But through this film, you see who they really are, that they are not just stereotypes, they all have problems in their lives and hardships. It proves that we all hide behind these masks, or personas, we feel that's all we can be, and we can't step out of that box, and be with other, different people or who we really are. Anyone who has made it through high school and lived to tell the tale, can relate to this movie, feel their pain, laugh, cry; cause really, aren't we all hiding behind these masks placed on us by society. One of my favourite lines of all time, is ""when you grow up, your heart dies,"" from Allison (the basket case), as the group frets about turning out like their parents, which by the end of the film, the group reluctantly defies that fate. Their principle, Vernon, is also portrayed as the classic, hard-ass authority figure. But is he really a bad guy? It is revealed half way through the film during a conversation between Vernon, and the janitor (the eyes and ears of the school), that it's not the kids who have changed, it's him. Abuse of authority comes as no surprise, and you can see clearly through Vernon's character that's exactly what's happened. Personally I think, he isn't a bad guy, underneath his hard exterior, but that is in fact what he has become, and perceived as by the students. In conclusion, the Breakfast Club will live on in our hearts for a long long time.",The Breakfast Club
509,fyona-03838,I really liked the Breakfast Club,9,24 November 2015,"Breakfast Club Review By:Iona McAllen I think that this film has stood the test of time because so many people are able to relate to the characters, the issues the characters are going through; their parents, peer pressure, pressure to succeed and more. I really like this film and can relate to it because as a teenager I have lots of stress and pressures to do well in school, sports, and maintain a social life. In the film every character had something they had to deal with; Andy his dad and not being able to think for himself, Claire her parents and having to do what her friends say, Alison being alone, Brian his grades and pressure from his family, and John his parents. This film portrays the lives of teenagers very accurate; because of this many people can relate to the characters and the issues they have. The mood the director was trying to set was that no matter who you are, what social group you belong to, who your family is, and no matter how different you are, everyone has pressures and issues they have to deal with. This movie is directed to mainly teens, but because so many people are able to relate to the movie anyone from teenagers to adults are able to watch the movie and relate to the characters and their situations. I think that the Breakfast club is a movie because it is for leisure entertainment.",The Breakfast Club
510,rodrigoorozcom,The breakfast club.,6,18 November 2015,"What would you think if your school punishes for bad behaviour and makes you go to an extra- time school? That is what happened to 5 teenagers, 3 boys and 2 girls. When they are in the school, looking each other, they did't want to be there. Every character are different. Some of them are looking for their personality, others are there because of their previous behaviour. I think the setting of the film is very boring. They are always in the same place (school) and at the beginning specifically, the movie has very large scenes that makes you fall asleep. At the middle of the film, it starts to have a little more action, when they dance and smoke some bad things. When they start talking each other and telling themselves their private thing, that is the point of the movie when you actually get a little bit of fun. They finished being friends after telling all their secrets and why were they there. At the end of the movie some of them get in love with another, and that is something really cool and different from another movies. First hate and then love.",The Breakfast Club
511,hduggan-99735,"The Breakfast Club, a film that proves we are more than what we appear to be",9,12 November 2015,"""You see us as you want to see us...in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions. You see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal. Correct?""'The Breakfast club,' a wonderful film that perfectly depicts the five main social groups. The brainiacs, the sporty kids, the weird outsiders, the popular kids, and the troublemakers. In the 80's, this was all there was. You were part of one of these groups and that was it. The year is now 2015, 30 years since the release of the film, and yet it is still regarded as a film that accurately depicts what high school is like. But how can that be? Can high school really be the same now as it was in 1985? The answer is yes. School cliques and social statuses do still exists, they're just not exactly the same as they used to be. But although these cliques may have changed and people may belong to more than one of them, they're still around and that's why the breakfast club is still regarded as a realistic portrayal of high school.I've always been a huge fan of the film. I'm not sure what it is about it that I love so much. Maybe it's the dynamic and relatable characters, the simplicity, or maybe it's the message. This film does more than just entertain, it gives us a glimpse into the lives teenagers and shows us what lies behind all of our conventional exteriors. It shows us that there is so much depth and meaning beneath our surfaces and that our true selves can be a lot harder to discover than we may think. The director, John Hughes, does this in such a beautifully simple and casual manner too. The entire film takes place in the one setting that revolves around all of the main characters, school. Sometimes as I watch, I feel as though I'm in the library with them, learning about their lives outside of school and the hardships they face on a day to day basis. One constant that I've found lies within the film is the fact that all of the adults in it have something in common: they've grown up; and just like Allison said, ""When you grow up your heart dies."" All of the adults except for one, Carl, the school's janitor, who seems to be the saving grace of the film and living proof that not all adults have to be so clueless and cruel. Probably because being the janitor means being "" the eyes and ears of this institution."" He's the only one who understands what they go through and how they truly feel for he is a constant first-hand witness of what their lives are really like, unlike Vernon. Vernon is the Principal of the school and is made out to be the antagonist of the film. He is a character who is grumpy, tired, and fed up with idle teenagers that every year seem to become more and more nettlesome and unwilling to behave and treat him with the respect that he feels he deserves. The person who knocks some sense into him is our favourite janitor, Carl. He enlightens him and tells him that the students aren't the ones who are changing, he is. But is Vernon really the bad guy he's made out to be? Well if you think about it, it's not his fault that the students did what they did to get into detention. In fact, instead of just letting the students off with a warning, he threw away an entire Saturday so that they could sit in school and think about what they had done and why they were there; and remember that essay he wanted them all to write? He told them all to write one thousand words describing who they thought they were, something that I thought sounded absolutely ridiculous when I first saw the film. But the entire story is about them discovering who they really are. So really it's because of Vernon that they were all there together on that Saturday and it's because of him that they spent the day attaining a deep understanding of who they are. If you really think about it, without principal Vernon, there would be no breakfast club. I've yet to hear of someone who has disliked the movie. It really is a film that is enjoyable for any and all audience members. A film that reminds us all that we are so much more than our appearances and the cliques we belong to. A timeless classic that has been enjoyed by many and will be enjoyed by many more. It's fun to watch and yet also contains a deep and beautiful meaning; and it even has a catchy and memorable song to play over the final scene, which is always a nice touch.",The Breakfast Club

I really enjoy this film because the director puts so much emotion into the dialog. I love the twist that John Hughes puts at the end, when the ""jock"" ends up with the ""basketcase"" and the ""criminal"" ends up with the ""princess"". I think the film was good because it was very relatable and mature. I think each actor played their roles to the finest. Everyone in the film has a specific problem or situation they face either in school or outside of school. One of my favourite things about the film is the lessons you learn. No matter who you are, you are no better, or not worse than anyone else. The director was trying to set a realistic storyline with problems that anyone can relate to, but a happy ending. I think that the director did a successful job at doing this. This movie is targeting people the around younger teenager up. I think you have to be a certain age to understand the story. I think that the breakfast club is a film not a movie.",The Breakfast Club
513,Averus_19,"""You see us as you want to see us""",10,19 July 2009,"""You see us as you want to see us""- Brian Johnson In the genre of High school/coming of age films, The Breakfast club is arguably the best film in it. Detailing the teen angst and problems they go through in high school as never been done in such perfection. From the slow burning start to the beautifully dramatic ending, High school has never been shown like this. Ironically it takes place on a Saturday where five very different students are forced into detention for the entire day. The quite popular athlete, the popular drama princess, the weird loner, the unhappy academic and the tough guy who doesn't care; these are the stars of the movie. Most people think its cliché to categorize and characterize high school students like this but like it or not these people are there in almost every high school. Trust me I am in one right now. The movie takes place in this single seemly mind numbing boring day where these students who in normal circumstances wouldn't even go close to each other are forced to interact to pass the time. This is where the movie becomes from good to unforgettable, from barely speaking to each other to finally opening up like they never have before, all this is done with incredible subtlety. Each actor pulls out there character perfectly and there interactions with one and another is nothing more than that. From the witty dialogue to the surprisingly good acting, this film will make you laugh your head off and move you from a hundred different emotions. Anyone who has ever been to a high school will instantly relate to the characters and most probably find themselves in one of them. Compared to other R rater films this is quite minor. Yeah there is a little drug use and swears but that's just what we go through in that stage of our lives. Some may argue about how this film stands against the other classics but some thing that anyone has seen this movie before is certain of is that this is definitely the greatest High school/teen film ever made.Maybe you have been there and done that or maybe or still going through it all but by the end of it, you'll be raising you fist high for The Breakfast Club as well.",The Breakfast Club

I think they probably stuck to their agreement but i have a feeling they might have hung out outside of school. I wouldn't say high school kids are as clique-ish but still a bit judgmental. One main thing I can think of that is no longer relevant in high school society is detention, we don't really have that anymore.

Everybody identifies with the characters in these movies, which isn't surprising, as these are very much films about people rather than events - a rare commodity indeed.

I must have seen television ads for this a hundred times when I was younger, but never watched it.  I'm glad my first viewing was of the video version with all the swearing and marijuana left in. These elements may not be pretty, but they keep the film grounded and realistic. I'd say it's aged pretty well, as the archetypes and the questions of identity haven't changed a bit.  10/10",The Breakfast Club
524,reggie-25,A very nice and funny drama. This one had past the time test successfully,8,4 October 1999,"I first saw this fun movie when I was about 13-14. It's been 5 years and I still like it a lot. The problems and dilemmas the fellas are dealing with are very real and sensable. I find this movie very funny at times but also very deep and sad in his other parts. I mean if you take the scene where the five of them are all smoking Hashish, and having a good time, you feel good when you see that. But then again when you here the same five all talking about their parents problems it makes you wanna cry. It has great scenes, it is performed brilliantly buy all the actors (especially the psycho...)and is directed in the right way by hughs.

525,Domi-10,Best movie ever.,10,6 June 2000,"What can I say? All I can say about this one is that it is most likely the best teenager movie i ever saw. It starts out as a comedy but along the way it turns into some sort of drama. And that, I believe is a very good trick to do. the way we get to know the club, it's just amazing. The reason why this should be the best movie is that in stead of sticking to the original plot the soty digs in the lives of the characters. As I said, one hell of a movie.",The Breakfast Club
526,vali424,80's Teen drama at it's best!,10,21 January 2000,The Breakfast Club is the essential movie to represent teen 80's movies. It is a slap in the face of high school reality.  How the social labels are placed on each kid is very poignant.  The movie makes me laugh and makes me cry.  It takes me back to those painful and beautiful high school years.,The Breakfast Club

With that said, John Hughes ""The Breakfast Club"" seems to me to be a sort of love letter to all of us who just seemed to blend into the background during our high school years.  Of course like everyone I also have a favorite character in the film, and my choice is Allison who is wonderfully played by Ally Sheedy.  So, my advice to all who have read this far is to try and watch this film with your emotions rather than trying to analyze the film to death.",The Breakfast Club

I had not had the pleasure to see this picture when it came out in theatre in 1985. Yes, the 80s is omnipresent, especially in fashion and music. The script is excellent. And so is the acting. But this is all too US-centric. And somewhat clichéd. In fact, over in Europe, most notably in the UK, it was a flop and failed to compete with the likes of ""Witness"" and ""Police Academy 2"". Most of my american friends should know that Ally Sheedy aside from ""Wargames"" fame, the ""Brat Pack"" was literally unheard of in Europe. I am only now discovering Molly Ringwald who should seriously, with all her talent, have had a more successful career than she did.",The Breakfast Club

And the movie is very long as well. The cuts have not been made well. But what do you expect form a movie form 1985?
Those were all the things I can really criticize.

It was introduced when there was no 'typical' stereotype movie, and it exploded into it's own unique theme and plot. I found it funny, and it's moral very true, especially in my own school life.I can't believe that this got only a seven, every person I've ever seen it with has loved it and proclaimed it one of the best movie's they had ever seen, along with me. I own it on DVD, and I never hesitate to put it in and fall in love all over again.The characters that you meet seem like real people, that you can compare to some of your friends or enemies alike. It doesn't jump into the plot too quick, and the ending is completely heartwarming to me. If you don't like this movie, I refuse to believe it.You must see and own this movie.",The Breakfast Club
533,zeleztial-eclipze,"""And each year, these kids get more and more arrogant.""",9,6 July 2006,"I wasn't yet born when this movie came out and so therefore I could hardly say whether or not high school life was portrayed correctly. All the same, it's definitely an enjoyable film. There are five students, each symbolizing a certain stereotype as indicated in the movie (athlete, nerd, princess, criminal, and basket-case) and a supervisor who I would personally hate to have in or around my school. Throughout the film, the characters become more than characters; they become someone you know or have seen in your own classes; which is a great tribute to John Hughes. The development of these characters allowed an insight into the troubles of teenagers (which I think are grossly underestimated nowadays). It shows that although a teenager can seem like a lunatic, or snobby, or as a rebel, it is not entirely their own doing. The Breakfast Club perfectly suits the saying ""You should never judge a book by its cover.""-- Spoiler --The plot is actually debatable among some. Some of my friends think that it's a twisted comedy with a bit of romance thrown in there, others think that it's a teenage drama. I personally believe it to be about the character development and the idea that there is more to someone than just an outer appearance and a label. Some think that there are parts of this movie that are cliché, such as the angelic girl falling for the rough ""bad boy"" but these types of clichés probably weren't clichés back then. >.o-- End of Spoiler --In any case, the acting is amazing on everyone's part. Judd Nelson is fantastic as John Bender and Emilio Estavez is equally impressive in his role as Andrew Clark. The movie ends at a point so that you're left wondering what will happen when they meet up again, if they meet up at all. There are a lot of conflicts, some of which are cleverly left to the viewer's imagination and perspective, and overall it's just a well-done, well-acted, insightful, and thought-provoking film. If you haven't seen The Breakfast Club, do so as soon as possible.",The Breakfast Club

Don't get me wrong! Not all basic movies are necessarily bad but it didn't work out on this one. This movie is exaggerated on the wrong things and monotonous but I still think ""the breakfast club"" deserves 6 stars since it's a little entertaining and has that 80's vibe in it.

It all fits together so well because of how well each personality is shown! From nerds to self- proclaimed cool people, students, the wonderful Detention Teacher have their personalities developed deeply. It is amazing how much storyline the movie covers, considering how much in detail each personality is shown.Oh yeah, and it's really funny too! There's funny scenes all throughout the movie, of course, and, of course, depending on your personality, you might find some more funny than others, but this is especially true in this movie.

539,rockclimbergrl13,One of the best movies EVER,10,20 June 2008,"This movie is honestly one of the best ones I have ever seen. It easily and brilliantly captures a time when is to the extreme and when anything can happen.Everyone can remember the groups in school (the popular kids, the freaks, the jocks, the nerds, etc.) Everyone can relate to at least character in the movie and everyone will end up cheering them on by the end. The acting is great. Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, and Ally Sheedy give a amazing performances and truly put their heart and soul into their parts. The emotion the actors put into their parts really make you believe everything they say. You may start off laughing a bit when ""Bender"" starts describing what its like at his house but by the end you'll be stunned silent. Emeilio Estevez plays the jock very well and the scene where he describing what he did to end up in detention and how much he hates his dad is one of the best scenes in the movie he puts so emotion in it. Everything Ally does is totally convincing (she's the crazy one.) This movie may have come out about 7 years before i was even born but it is one of the best ones i have ever seen and probably the one that touched me the most. It's a movie you really don't want to end. You'll walk away from this movie with a new perspective. It's a must see.",The Breakfast Club

I was wrong. It's an amazing film. It's simple, it's witty, and it's subtle. I don't recall ever leaving a film with a sense of feeling better. I don't mean to say this is a ""feel good movie,"" but after watching it, I just felt better about everything. I didn't go into this movie depressed, angry, or sad, but in watching this movie something about me was lifted up. (In re- reading this, I realize I sound ridiculous, but I really can't explain it).

542,Cornflake_Girl,A great movie for teens..,9,25 May 2003,"In my opinion, ""The Breakfast Club"" is a wonderful movie for teens and above, and gives them a chance to see that you should look beyond whatever subculture/Social Status a person is part of and get to know the person before you make any judgements about them.In the movie, a few teens who seem completely different are stuck in the school's library for detention on a Saturday morning, and find out that they have more in common than they actually think.My favorite characters are John Bender and Allison Reynolds, because they are the two that remind me of myself the most. In fact, I think the most wonderful thing about this movie is how you can relate to at least one of the characters and how they feel and think.Warning: Spoilers below!!!I remember first seeing this movie, and I was thinking ""This is perfect!""...up until the very end. The very end is completely unbelievable and goes against everything Molly Ringwald said in the library about them most likely not being friends anymore when Monday comes. The freaky outcast girl dates the school jock? The prom princess and the punk rebel? I give it a day at the most. But, even then, this movie is still a wonder to behold. Rent this for your teenager today.",The Breakfast Club
543,throwing_copper,Definitely overrated (contains one or two spoilers),2,4 June 2003,"The characters are full of stereotypes - that would be okay if they were not meant to be realistic to begin with, but if I understand the director correctly, he seriously thinks his movie portrays reality. One thing that made watching this movie really hard for me was the horrible stereotypical teacher. Teachers like that man simply do not exist. No teacher is legally allowed to treat a student the way this man treats Bender. It is terribly exaggerated and I am getting very tired of seeing the same prejudiced two-dimensional teacher images in movies.The story... well, what can I say. Very unrealistic, and the script is full of pseudo-philosophical blaaaah. I think I kept rolling my eyes throughout 3/4 of the movie. The supposedly ""terrible secrets"" that the students reveal to each other in the end seemed pretty trivial to me and left me wondering why I even bothered to sit there for 1 1/2 waiting for the truth to come out. I think if I were 15 I could relate to some of the problems the students talk about (isolation, insecurity) but, as I said, that is spoilt through the stereotypical characters. I find the typical ""brain"", ""prom queen"", ""athlete"" etc. boring to watch. Give us some interesting characters please!I give it a 3 out 10, because even though I really don't like this movie whatsoever, I was pretty impressed by the actors and actresses.",The Breakfast Club
544,charlesradams458,Eww!! High School kids,2,14 January 2014,"I only gave this movie a 2 because it did a decent job at capturing some of the most vile kinds of kids that made High School almost unbearable. That being said, its terribly cliché, and while high School kids tend to be that way, who wants to watch them or hear them bitch about life. When was the last time you wanted to go and hang out with high School kids? And if you have recently wasn't it awful? High School was and is awful and if you don't agree, well that's just sad and probably really creepy (Matthew Mcconaughey in Dazed and Confused). And I suppose I wouldn't dislike this movie so much if not for so many other people being so insistent on it being a great movie. The entire movie is basically summed up in the pretentious note that Brian writes:Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. But we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see usIn the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brainan athletea basket casea princessand a criminalDoes that answer your question?1. Sacrifice? you goofed off, smoked pot, had a bad 80's dance and getaway montage2.For whatever you did wrong? You know what you did to get detention , don;t act like you're civil rights protesters locked up unfairly3. Introspection is key to self improvement(keep out of detention), you open up to each other but refuse to write a simple essay? what a spoiled 16yr old girl 4.What you found out is exactly how everyone already saw you!Really you are worse than my initial impression of you.There is that better Brian, you're not exactly who I thought you were.You easily give into peer pressure, fall into stereotypes and cry about being judged unless it s a judgement you like then that's fine, even if it isn't true. And I feel like that was supposed to be the point of the movie to ""Not judge a book by its cover' which it really failed at doing. Am I supposed to feel bad for Bender? He is exactly the bad influence on the other kids , bully, narcissist, drug pusher the principal thinks he is. And was it really necessary for Claire to start dating him to make her parents mad? That's terrible Andrew likes Allison just fine after her makeover, note to girls if you are a terrible person its okay so long as you look okay! Terrible No one will be Brian's friend and he is so gutless that he will still offer to do their schoolwork for them.Awful The janitor is the smartest guy in the school, I don't know how many janitors that you have spoken with recently but... yeah...80'sSo there is no real story to speak of, no comedy, no action, no good romance, no good dialogue and its full of clichés; so whats this movie good for?And please don't say the soundtrack, most people only know the one song, and really only five words from that song.And it isn't very good",The Breakfast Club

The educator pulling Saturday duty isn't the nicest guy around, and the kids immediately begin carving out their niches according to what they believe their social status and place in life demands. By the end of the film, you understand that this day, they've learned a lot about life and who they are, and that they will not allow their lives to be determined by what their parents, teachers, and other students think they should be. This is a wonderful film, and a powerful lesson in life, love, friendship, and free will. What happens in between the start and finish will make you mad, sad, and everything in between.

Last year, I watched Rocky and didn't love it, 6/10. So was wondering if I should bother watching an old movie again but gave it a try.The story is of 5 teen students who end up getting a detention of 9 hours on a weekend. Each person has his/her own story. And they just mean that no person is free of problems and that they all make mistakes and move on. I think that every teen who thinks that his life sucks, watch it, you will know that it's been the same for decades if not for centuries.Other than that, at one point, you feel like not completing at all but the last 30 minutes pay it off. At first, it just feels boring but you will learn to understand it.If you are from the too much new generation, listening to rappers, smoking weed, and love teen movies like Twilight, and stuff like ""Teen Wolf"", you won't understand it totally.The movie is about how, given time, the 5 students learn to respect each other's problems and to respect the perspective of the other students.It's pretty weird though how I first wrote the review ASAP after completing the movie and gave it a 7. A few hours later, after reading some stuff, I came back and gave a thought to it and felt that it surely needed a 9 if not a 10 (like many have given it). It may seem completely messed up at one point where the kids are doing stuff while being high but everything you watch in the movie, will have an impact on how you think.",The Breakfast Club
547,jonghyuk1997,Sharply reflects current issues that are currently happening today,10,16 November 2015,"A handful of students, supposedly with lots of problems, gather together on a nice Saturday morning at the school library for detention. But is it entirely their fault they are in detention? This film explored deeply into this matter- how it is not all the children's fault that they trailing off in life, no matter if you are delinquent, rich, or an all-A student. It also showed how important family plays a role on us, and moreover, teachers- who we spend the most of our time with at school. In this case, I thought this film was well-made and meaningful because they expressed the scars of the students and how they get to kind of resolve them by sharing their problems, and how they feel compassion and unity upon themselves by doing so. I would greatly recommend this excellent film to everybody of all ages :D",The Breakfast Club

After watching it one time, I was able to quote some of the lines, too. The Characters are so dynamic. They fit well into any high school whether it be in the 80's or the present day. There is not one character in the movie that a person cannot relate, too. I find it neat how the movie has a very basic setting. Most of the movie is in the library. There are the few scenes where they aren't but most of it they remain the one spot. I think the best scene is when they all start whistling. It is such a simple beginning to a scene and brings more humor to the movie. The change in the characters through the movie is a drastic change. They start as students who don't know each other or even care about one another. Then in the end, they all talk about one another. They learn things about the other people that if they hadn't been stuck in detention together, they would never know about each other. It is how people in school still interact with one another. You never really know your fellow student until you are sitting next to them in class, or stuck with them for a project or in detention.

We get to see our characters slowly become more comfortable with one another and watch as they realize for them selves their own flaws and that they may have misjudged each other. Even the principal our antagonist is a sympathetic character, as all he wants is to teach the kids a lesson and break through to them. Overall It tells a compelling story with laughs drama and great music. I found the jhon bender really salvaged the film for me as he was the most interesting character and i liked how he started off cocky and confident but as the film progressed showed a bit of worriedness and anger. I found that claire impeded the film as i don't feel like she changed enough as a character and really learned any lessons. I think the mood was supposed to be a light hearted film with elements of drama and i found it to be very successful. This Film primarily targets youths as they are the most likely to relate to the events in this film and would probably enjoy it the most. I believe this is a film as it conveys a message about how not everyone is what they seem.",The Breakfast Club
552,kylorenawakens,A nice story in which the absolute simplicity of film-making coincides with the greatness that is deep character complexity,10,12 July 2018,"...And if you're like, ""Huh?"" This is what I mean:Okay so the film was made on a budget of around a million dollars, has little over ten people as its cast (with only five main and two co-star), and takes place (with its setting) around the same location throughout- a high school. It's a very basic set-up but basic doesn't necessarily equal bad. No, it's quite the opposite actually. The film centres and surrounds itself around five characters who are all brought in to detention on a Saturday by their assistant principle, Mr Vernon, each for a different wrongdoing in which was brought on by the pressure, negligence and abuse of their parents. The five students are: Andrew, Claire, John, Brian and Allison. Each of them represent five different backgrounds and stereotypes. Andrew's the well-known jock whose father gives him harsh criticism and brings him down about his wrestling; Claire is the popular ""princess"" and spoilt-like teen of the five, to which she gets what she wants, more or less. As well as this, her mother and father try to use her to get back at each other. John (better known as Bender, his last name) is the criminal and rebel of them, always poking fun at people and belittling them, who smokes weed, has a knife, wears denim and jean jacket and clothing as well as fingerless gloves, and likes rock music. Bender's father is abusive. Brian is the smart and intelligent nerdy-like teenager, the brain, whose parents are very strict with his grades. He feels if he fails, it's all over. His life is just as tough as the rest because of the over-abundance of pressure put on him. Allison is the outcast/introvert and somewhat unknown one of the five, also known in the film as the ""basket case"". Allison dresses in black and her true looks aren't properly revealed until the end of the film. Her parents ignore her and she feels neglected. All different, complex backgrounds, all from different peers, but in the end they're all more alike than they know. The movie is brilliant. It's solid effort in terms of acting and directing. The casting is perfect, too. And the co-stars make a great add to the film itself. There are lots of laughs, uplifting moments, sad scenes, rebellious moments that blend in with both funny and serious, and so much more. And for a great and clear experience, the film is superb when watched on bluray.The prevailing Bender as he walks across the football pitch on the way home and then lifts his arm up into the air as a status of perseverance and might is probably my favourite film ending of all time, if not definitely in my top three for sure.10/10",The Breakfast Club

It was cool to watch this movie and see all of the iconic lines and scenes like when all of students were dancing around room and on top of tables. This movie is not only funny, but also relatable. Each character represents a school clique that anyone can identify with. While each character is different, they realize that they share the common struggle that comes from their parental issues. We can all relate to having disputes with our parents or our parents not understanding our feelings, which makes this movie enticing to watch.

As everyone remembers being a teenager and the personal problems you face at this time, the film touches you on one level or another. The script is so pure and simple that the characters have to carry the story which is exactly what the cast does. The character development in this film is incredible and you empathise with each of them, especially Jude Nelson as 'bender' (the criminal) who's attention-seeking angry behaviour unravels throughout the film and we see him as the vulnerable character he is.

There's Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall)-the Nerdy smart guy; The Jock-Andy Clark(Emilio Estavez), the wastoid smart Aleck-John Bender(Judd Nelson), Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald) the rich, stuck up snob, and Allison Reynolds(Ally Sheedy)-the psycho girl with indifference issues. After wasting a good part of the morning goofing off and making a fool out of the intolerant teacher Richard Vernon, who is supposed to be supervising our youngsters, instead he makes them write an essay about who think they are and why their in detention. As the day progresses they learn important lessons about themselves and each other. The major point of this film is that everyone is so busy judging other people by their outward appearances that we don't really know the person underneath the wrapping. This movie dabbles where teenagers fear to tread, in the good old heart of hearts! The actors in this film all play their parts to the hilt, you will think you actually know them and I guarantee you will love them!",The Breakfast Club
556,dannyboy-2,still rocks after 450 times,10,11 January 1999,"This movie is my all-time favorite.  Surprisingly enough it still doesn't bore me, though I have seen it over 450 times. Anthony-Michael Hall as the brain, showing why most brains in school are brains - mostly because of parental pressure. Emilio Estevez as the athlete shows us much the same thing. Most of us still excel in something because we're afraid of being a disappointment to our parents. Ally Sheedy not only looks her cutest (well, wargames excepted here), but portrays a basket case if I ever saw one.  She reminds me so much of a girl in my high school classroom it's unbelievable. Molly Ringwald as the stuck-up, self-righteous princess torn between her basically gentle character and her stuck-up friends and last, but certainly not least, Judd Nelson as the criminal. Abusive parents and all.This movie is a classic from beginning to end.  Dump 5 kids in a school library for a day and they WILL end up friends, even if it is just for that day.  In that lies the realism. Take a person away from his environment (be that the 'popular clique' or the 'bad kids' and they set all prejudice aside. This movie shows that no matter in what layer of society you are) everyone is essentially the same with the same problems. Sadly enough the truth is that although they end up friends, they will only be friends for that one day.Personally I think it's a shame that John Hughes went on to make crap like home alone.. He should have stuck with what he knows best. brain, athlete, basket case, princess and criminal.",The Breakfast Club
557,Lugbert,Can you say misogynist!?,6,17 September 1999,"The female characters in this film are ridiculous.  What's with all the insecurity?  It seems Hughes hates women.  Why must Ringwald be such a masochist?  Why must Sheedy depend on Estevez's approval?  Why must there be total romantic resolution at all?  My guess to the third question is because Hughes wants his women to be in subservient positions.  Taken individually all characters are plagued with personal problems, largely insecurity. Nelson and Estevez leave with more security and the women leave with false security, they're dependent upon the males.  Hughes: women aren't that bad, you don't have to dislike them so much.",The Breakfast Club
558,rmahoney,Definitely not a classic,5,18 July 1999,"How do people get off calling this movie a classic?  First off it involves a bunch of kids sitting around in a library during an 8 hour detention crying about how mommy and daddy don't hug them enough.  The only redeeming value is Emilio Estevez jumping around stoned which is just plain nuts.  I hope the writing isn't serious, because it is cheesy as hell!DON'T BE FOOLED THIS MOVIE IS NO GOOD!   5/10",The Breakfast Club
559,Joy-25,Stereotypes get broken... great film.,10,27 February 1999,"You know, it's funny, I went to a Catholic all-girls high school, and the stereotypes still held true.  There were the jocks, the basket cases, the brains, the prom queens, and the bullies.   Hughes gets to the heart of all the high-school stereotypes in The Breakfast Club, and creates an environment where they can be broken.  I loved this film when it came out, and I still love it 15 years later.Interesting side note about breaking out of stereotypes... Ally Sheedy tended to play the prom queen types, and was originally cast to play the part of Claire, as opposed to Molly Ringwald.  But they couldn't find anyone for the role of Allison, so they switched Ally over and put Molly in.  Can you imagine Ally Sheedy as Claire????",The Breakfast Club

John Hughes masterfully takes all these characters and places them in such a common place, detention, and sees what happens.

I really love Judd Nelson. The Breakfast Club made me laugh. It made me cry. I felt like I was emotionally in it.

Each of the issues raised in the movie truly reflect the opinions of teenagers everywhere. ""My Parents Ignore Me"", ""My Parents Expect Too Much From me""...""My parents Don't Care"". Every teenager on the planet has similar thoughts.Not to mention the high-school need to have had sex, and the reality that most who say they have, actually have not.The filming is basic, and as a result, the emotions of the characters become more identifiable.A basic film, with basic messages, no fancy this, no fancy that. A True Credit to the film industry.If you have not seen it yet, shame on you.",The Breakfast Club
574,sameasnothing,"Excellent, enduring movie that represents an era/age",10,8 December 2001,"Note: Recommended to have seen filmThe Breakfast Club, a movie about 5 dissimilar teenagers who get stuck together on a saturday because of detention, was just not about some inner-discovery-developing-plot or even necessarily the humor (though I found that a very vital part of the film). But before I display my perspective, I'd like to address those of a few other people. For those of you who criticize The Breakfast Club, you're obviously not looking at it for the right reasons. If you see the characters as flat and the plot and its issues as mundane, you're analyzing the movie in an incorrect way. Maybe in viewing the movie you seem to have lapsed over the fact that the movie was a Teen movie dealing with Teen issues. (For the few who might suddenly think that this label turns all the characters into Alicia Silverstone look-a-likes talking about their hair, think of such movies as Rebel Without a Cause or even Cameron Crowe's older films, for example). The Breakfast Club manages to combine all it's character's into one setting (Shermer High School/Shermer High School Library), without any major change in setting, character addition, or sudden abrupt plot twist and yet still manages to stay interesting. In such situation, one must assume the dialogue would hold the movie together, and for the most part, I'd say this is the case in The Breakfast Club. The steady humor (usually good) was very important for leveling out the (countering) occasional seriousness of the film. Some of the dialogue was filled with some rough phrasing; however, in my opinion, it could almost be considered intentional. When a group of teenagers, seemingly cast in completely different molds, are thrown together and suddenly find themselves talking about their own appropriate, deepest problems to these (formerly) strangers, would it honestly come out in the most articulate of speech? This is why I feel you shouldn't blame The Breakfast Club for its ""amateur psychology"" (as some have phrased it), or more more appropriately, I think it should be awarded for managing to deal with some issues of high school and teenage life that it did without creating some ludicrous, unbelievable situation inorder to achieve it. Even so, one should not dissect and scrutinize every single line; you can only appreciate the movie by absorbing it as a whole of its parts. To me, the gift of the The Breakfast Club is not one certain thing, but surely through it all we can find positive. The movie was very well acted by everyone of its characters and if one of them had gone astray it easily could have failed. However it was teenagers addressing their issues on their own terms, supplemented by laughs, that made The Breakfast Club into a great 80s movie, a great teen movie, and just a plain, great movie as well.",The Breakfast Club

The preps, nerds, jocks, thugs, and weirdos. It affects me tremendously. Also, the views about how the school officials really feel about the students.

With great acting from Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald etc, great direction by john himself, and great scene settings, it is a work of art. It is one of few movies that the film is able to stay in the one setting, and yet still be extremely entertaining. The character that steals the show, has to be John Bender (Judd Nelson). With his witty comments, and his personal family problems, we are able to feel so many emotions; anger, pity, humour.  It was a shame that this was the only blockbuster that he appeared in (except of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back).Overall, i have to give this movie a 9 out of 10, for its sheer excellence.",The Breakfast Club

But once you've put enough distance between you and high school - and grown up enough to recognise it - you can relate to this film. Even if the clothes and the hairstyles are outdated.People talk about it being over-simplified - I think that's kind of the point. It's a simple film which addresses the need we all seem to have to make things more complicated than they have to be - perversely by putting over-simplified labels on people.Kids have this complicated code of conduct - the jocks can't hang with the geeks, etc. Yet when you get down to it - in some ways, they're not that different, if only because they're all just trying to get through life, trying to earn approval from someone.I think it's impressive that such a small cast operating in such a small set can hold the attention so well - down to the fact that everyone, even just a bunch of kids, have a story to tell.A cult classic.Oh, and I don't have a problem with the obviousness of the pairings at the end because it's totally subjective as to whether or not they really did overcome the stereotypes. Maybe they did ... Maybe they never spoke to each other again ...",The Breakfast Club
581,cundar01,The teenage struggles of growing up,6,15 June 2011,"The movie, The Breakfast Club, is a movie about five high school students, from totally different social backgrounds, forced to spend a Saturday together in detention. At the start of the detention they dislike each other and argue. They felt they had nothing in common but once they begin to open up to each other that changes. There are a couple of themes in this movie. One is the stereotyping of the usual cliques or social groups that exist in high school, the jock, the hood, the nerd, the weirdo and the homecoming queen. Another theme in the movie is the struggles that teenagers face as they try break away from their parents' control to gain their independence. Two other movies with similar themes about teenagers dealing with the struggles growing up are The Wonder Years and American Teen. Bender (Judd Nelson) the ""criminal,"" is just an all around hood who is a regular attendee of the Saturday detention. He is in detention because he pulled the fire drill. Andy (Emilio Estevez) the ""athlete,"" is in detention because he wanted to break away from the straight and narrow and do something bad just once. He taped together the buns of a fellow student. Claire (Molly Ringwald) the princess is a little rich girl who gets everything she wants. She is in detention because she skipped school to go shopping. Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) the brain is in detention because he brought a flair gun to school and it went off in his locker. Allison (Ally Sheedy) the basket case came to detention because she had nothing better to do. While in detention they begin to bond. Their first bonding moment happens when Bender removes a screw from the detention room door and the door no longer will stayed opened. The principal walks into the room and wants to know which one of them removed the screw but no one admits to knowing. Another bonding moment comes when they are sitting around after smoking pot. This is where they begin to open up and tell each other about their home lives. Bender grew up in an abusive home with alcoholic parents. Andrew is consistently being hounded by his father to always win and not to do anything bad that will ruin his chances of getting an athletic scholarship. Claire feels that her parents do not care about her and use her just to get back at each other. Brian is pressured by his parents to always excel academically. Allison says her home life is unsatisfactory because her parents ignore her. The camera angles used during the scene where they begin to open up to each other had close ups of each of their faces as they each talked about their home life. Viewers could see their eyes well up with tears as they talked about how sad they were about the relationships they had with their parents. Motifs which are repetitive images, patterns or ideas that relate to the theme existed throughout different scenes in The Breakfast Club. Motifs were show through the many stereotypical social group conflicts that occurred between the criminal, the athlete, the princess, the brain and the basket case. Although all five came from different social background but they still had a connection.",The Breakfast Club
582,atarmstrong,"""The Breakfast Club""",10,6 July 2007,"Being a high school senior when this movie was released, it hit home on a lot of subjects. A lot of people don't get this movie. And all i can say to that is, then you didn't go to high school in the early thru mid 80's. The whole plot of a jock, brain, princess, criminal, and basket-case having to spend a Saturday in detention was never done before or has it been repeated since this movie. And that is the way it needs to stay. 22 Years later i'm still wondering what they were like in the hallway the next day, did any of them say hi or hang out with one another?I seen one or two trailers for this movie before it came out in February of 1985, and i blew it off. Well being bored with the movie i went to see, don't even remember the name of it, a few doors down was the breakfast club so i was like, i'm getting my three dollars a fifty cents out of this place before i leave it. Think i came in on the opening credits so i missed maybe a minute. John Bender was the one i related to the most, it was like they knew me, and had Judd Nelson play me. Molly Ringwald was the perfect person to play Claire. Anthony Michael Hall played the part of Brian and was like a natural for the part with his looks. The whole cast was a very believable bunch in there parts. That is what made this movie. The story was easy to keep up with, the plot was simple. And you could tell the unknown tone through out the movie. My favorite was when they were talking about turning into there parents, that one subject hits very hard with anyone. I must admit i don't watch this movie all the time. I seen it when it came out and again like ten years later on TV. I saw it a few months ago on DVD and as it ended i had the same feelings as i did when i watched it in 1985, that not knowing whats next feeling. But like i said, i came out of high school when unemployment rates were high, you stayed on your job because a bad one was better than not having one, and you had no idea what the future was holding for you. As something that happened to me last year while i was on vacation, i had planned for a side trip when i got back from Hawaii, to go to Hollywood and also Rodeo drive. Well while a was walking down Rodeo drive i passed what i thought was someone i knew who smiled at me as we passed, i smiled back and kept walking, and i kept thinking man she looked familiar then some one behind me starts saying loudly molly Ringwald can i have your autograph?

But this is how I felt. While it's true that the characters are likable and you can easily relate to them, I don't know how it was back in the 80', but I find it extremely unrealistic that teens would be so vulnerable and open about their feelings with strangers that they generally don't trust. So this is one thing. The other thing is that this is an awesome novel structure - it is. Like I said, fantastic characters. And great monologues/conversations. AND? What else? I wanted something to happen, but nothing did. Don't get me wrong, back stories are great. Everyone loves a character with an interesting story behind it. But it's literally just people sitting in the room, talking... that's not... a movie. That's real life. So that's too realistic to be interesting. I need my 3 acts, I really do need them.

I think everyone can relate to each character somehow. It's one of my all-time favorite movies.

589,edwinallarren,Labeled: Delinquents -Actually: Students- Most Defineately: Human Beings- Undeniabley Eighties!,10,8 April 2012,"The film ""The Breakfast Club"" reflects the recognizably flippant disposition that so many 1980's movies so vividly portrayed, however, it differentiates itself from such a post in several acutely creative aspects. Set in a Chicagoland north suburban high school, it accompanied the artistic genre that so many film companies engaged in when using Chicago as an ideal filming venue during the eighties' movie era. Unlike so many films set in Chicago, ""The Breakfast Club"" capriciously emanates a mandatory acrimony with every one of the main characters in this film! The one scene whereby all of the students commiserate with each other about their justified tales of woe, became a scene which evokes a bevy of utterly human responses. At that juncture in this film, these students were thoroughly aware of the fact that they could ill afford the luxury of pulling back any punches, and, it was incumbent upon them to ameliorate their socially awkward circumstances. Each one of them, the student (Anthony Michael Hall); the athlete (Emilio Estevez); the princess (Molly Ringwald); the basket case (Ally Sheedy); and finally, the criminal (Judd Nelson), became the precarious representative of the walk of life whom they represented in the high school which they were attending. The very last scene of Judd Nelson (The Criminal) was a significant trademark of the entire film's dynamic. Judd Nelson's agitation was manifested through his desultorily assembled attire. As a matter of fact, each one of the major characters in this movie were flawlessly executed to exact the proclivities of a handful of teen-age cultural stereotypes. Any director and/or writer will tell you that articulating a perfect 10 character development with every one of the main characters in any given film, becomes an insurmountable task which is neon impossible to successfully accomplish! The movie, "" The Breakfast Club"", managed to depict every one of their main characters with an uncanny cogency that puts this film in an auspicious category all by itself! ""The Breakfast Club"" was made in 1985, and, it was partially responsible for laying out the existing paradigm for movies, as well as high school students' attitudes in general, for the decade of the 1980's. In 1985, ""Out of Africa"" won the academy award for best picture. ""Out of Africa"" is, of course, a fabulous film, however, ""The Breakfast Club"" is far more adept at sparking naturally human interaction into the scope of cinematic entertainment. A film like "" The Breakfast Club"" accommodates the purpose of movie going, which is, often times, to re-emphasize the significance of delving into the tumultuous intricacies of faulted human nature. A grass roots recognition of our egregious inadequacies as individuals, is an indelibly crucial component to stellar movie making. At such a level, the film; ""The Breakfast Club"", is virtually second to none in procuring such a coveted feat. Director, John Hughes, deserves one accolade after the next for his efforts in the wonderful production of this film. The acting was phenomenal! Subsequent to the making of the film ""The Breakfast Club"", all of these actors and actresses have gone on to be eighties icons, as well as perennial top billing entertainers. It has always been a yearly ritual with me to see this film on the Saturday before Easter. Last night, I watched ""The Breakfast Club"" once again, and, I thought it was better than I ever previously remember it to be from times before! It is an absolute must to see this 1980's marvel; ""The Breakfast Club"" - Eighties Classic! An Ultimate Movie Treasure Extraordinaire! Five Stars!",The Breakfast Club
590,sarcasm_is_me,John Hughes Brilliance,10,12 September 2006,"this is quite simply my favorite movie of all time made more credible by the fact that it took Hughes just two days to finish the script, the acting is believable, it is nice to see Molly Ringwald playing a character other then the ""loseR"" or ""reject"" despite wanted the role of the ""basketcase"" originally, she is perfect as the ""princess"", judd nelson is perfect casting as the ""criminal"" as are the rest of castings in the movie. The story is a good use of stereotypwes to show the idiosynchrisies of hih school and in particular the harsh reality of pressure on teenagers and the complications they face in everyday life. the scenes are realistic and it is worthwhile and entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. whether you want to laugh, cry or dance. the breakfast club is a great showing from start to finish. 100000000000000000000000000000 kudos!",The Breakfast Club
591,dmnted100,Classic eighties,10,19 February 2005,"This movie is for me a manifestation of USA in the eighties. Or I should say a climax of what I, as a non American, experienced as an array of culturally strong movies. John Huges is credited for more than a handful of good movies, always oozing of the American way of life, and he doesn't fail to deliver here. Molly Ringwold, Emilio Estavez, Anthony M. Hall and Judd Nelson all perform brilliantly in this stream of classic remarks. This is one of those movies where you learn all the lines of by heart; quoting an inquisitive John Bender as he asks Pricipal Dick Vernon ""... does Barry Manilow know that you're raiding his waredrobe?!"". As a teenager I watched this over and over again, and I firmly believe it has added to my understanding of one of the most powerful cultures of the eighties. I recommend it to anyone.",The Breakfast Club
592,Toroksv,"A Film, A Statement, Society At Large",7,8 May 2004,"What to say about John Hughes's film the Breakfast Club? What was he trying to accomplish with this project? Yes, its true that he was trying to make a teen movie. But was he not also trying to make a statement about our society at large? Like Edward Albe's controversial play Zoo Story, through the Breakfast Club John Hughes is trying to make a statement about the mixing of social classes. However Hughes and Albe seem to go two different ways. Albe is saying that two classes can't merge without violent contact, but Hughes is suggesting that everything turns out alright. So I applaud Hughes for his brilliance and his decently made film. Good job Hughes, damn good job.",The Breakfast Club
593,johnnylover13,One of the Best,10,29 May 2004,"I adore this movie to bits,(mainly because of Judd Nelson) It makes you laugh and cry, and gives you a complete new outlook on life. It gives you a little bit of all the worlds; From prep, to jock to geek to outcast to bad boy. At times in the movie you have to think, ""They're more alike than they know!"" The only real shocker to me, is that The jock ended up with the outcast, and the prep with the bad boy. In a lot of ways you know their lives changed forever, which gives a good feeling inside. If only the real world was as good as this movie! The part that really touched me the most was when they were discussing stuff on the floor and Bryan brought up where they would be in the future. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do so now. It deserves 5 thumbs up. *I love Judd!*",The Breakfast Club
594,aleavellx,Never judge a book by it's cover.,9,1 October 2012,"The main setting of ""The Breakfast Club"" is at Shermer High School, specifically in the library on a Saturday morning. The library is an important aspect in the setting of this movie, because it provides a parallel with the dialogue. The script of this movie is heavily laden with dialogue and the spoken story of each character, similar to the books, writing, and words that fill the library shelves. Another important aspect of the library is the quiet nature of the space, putting the focus entirely on the characters and their issues. With no other noise or distractions, the central focus of the film is clear.An important character to consider that is often overlooked is the assistant principal, Richard Vernon. Throughout the film he is portrayed as a villain of sorts, out to get the group of students being punished that particular Saturday. Completely unable to relate to his students or any of their situations, he only sees what is on the surface. It is pointed out by the janitor later on in the plot that while Vernon assumes the students are the problem in his lack of understanding the new generation, he never bothered to look closer and realize it was he who had changed. This plays a major role in the overall theme of the movie, which is the inability to see past the surface of a problem or character and judge solely by a look.A pivotal scene for the five students locked away in detention is the group discussion they have about why they came to Saturday detention. Although it is obvious that it is pivotal because they are opening up, but it is also pivotal in the mood of the film as well. Before this scene, many, if not all, of the interactions between the characters were cold and isolated, making the movie seem tense. As the characters begin to open up, the feel of the movie transitions to an easier, lighthearted feel that pulls the audience in to the escapades that begin to occur. Not only has it changed the relationship between the characters, but it changes the mood of the rest of the movie.The lunches that each character eats are representative of each of their respective parents. Claire eats a fancier meal than the rest, Andy's food is loaded with carbohydrates and calories, Brian's lunch consists of a crust-less peanut butter and jelly sandwich, Allison's bologna (which she discards to replace with candy), and Bender, who has no lunch. Each meal represents the parenting style of each teenager, such as Allison's discarding of part of her sandwich signifies the way they ignore her, giving her the freedom to do whatever she wants. The writing in this movie is realistic and plausible, seeing as it is an everyday occurrence for us to judge others solely by what is on the outside. The slow reveal of the inner struggles and personal demons of each of the characters is realistic, coming slowly and in pieces, each filled with emotion. It is obvious that many of the characters do not wish to open up, which is very typical of someone dealing with their own issues. The inserted lines of dry and sarcastic humor lighten the mood when it is necessary, just as some situations require and easily remind us that they still are, in fact, teenagers. The writing is very symbolic of the things that can happen to every day high school students, although perhaps not as extreme, it serves as a guide for those moments that we all have had some sort of experience with.An aspect of grouping in this movie is shown by the colors of the characters. Red for Bender, blue for Andy, pink for Claire, green for Brian, and black for Allison. These colors play into the stereotypes that they are portraying, further signifying the outer appearance contradiction that the characters struggle with. A smaller grouping is the group of teenagers, and the adults. The stark contrast between the two age groups, both physically separated and emotionally, magnifies the generation gap and the lack of ability to understand one another.The aspect of judgment plays a large role, especially in the beginning where each character has made specific judgments against their peers. Applying that to the whole, judgment becomes the main theme that motivates them as characters, as well as how easily judgments can be changed. In watching this, I see media messages that have changed over the years. The message that this film delivers is one that can be forgotten easily, but this movie is a nostalgic reminder to never judge a book by its cover.John Hughes was the king of successful movies in the 1980's, with this movie being at the forefront of his laundry list of hit films. Seeing as how many movies were based off this movie and others like it, ""The Breakfast Club"" is a teen drama that has become the stereotypical teen drama. The storytelling techniques, such as the ability to show the progression of these characters in a single day, and revealing character complexity is something seen even recently, in shows like ""Community.""The storytelling technique used by this movie was a unique choice, one that is not often seen. It is easy to forget that sometimes and entire story can happen in just a matter of hours in your life, not over a long span of time. This technique is adding to my ability to comprehend the realistic nature of cinematic storytelling by proving that you do not need to show weeks or month of passing time to have a story with impact.""The Breakfast Club"" uses its title to emphasize the reason why it is so important not to judge something strictly by what you see.",The Breakfast Club
595,briannavallbacka,Greatest film ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,9,26 February 2013,"The breakfast club is my all time favourite 80's film! The movie was just amazing! It connected to my life and others probably too. John Hughes is a genius! I thought the idea was fantastic and every little scene made it better. Time after time you would learn something new about the characters. They are an athlete, a Princess, a Brain, a basket case and a criminal. Does this sound like a breakfast club to you? I think Brian signed off the letter with ""the breakfast club"" because all five of them were poor in a way. Plus usually in a you meet all sort of different which seem like your friends because well just because! But after a day you never talk again. This movie showed that if you be yourself you will truly reveal the kind of person you are. I would say a 14A rating because there is tons of swearing and talk about mature themes. This movie is great and you, yes you should watch it!!! :)",The Breakfast Club
596,ayushgoel_gem,Amazing! Had me spellbound for the entire 97mins,10,19 July 2013,"I think this movie is one hell of an awesome movie. So good that it actually made me write a review about it, which I usually wouldn't feel worth the effort. Specially being a teen, I was able to relate to it and could actually sympathize and not just empathize with their emotions. Respect for the director and writer for making it with a mix of subtle humor and overwhelming emotions and at the same time portraying the plight of the students which I think is what the entire movie revolves around. The entire movie was shot in a couple of rooms and with kids just blabbering about their worthless lives, it could have turned out to be a complete fail had it not been so realistic and fascinating at the same time.",The Breakfast Club
597,ugga-1,Outstanding and timeless.,10,14 October 2004,"This movie includes one of my favorite songs (Don't you -Simple minds) and my absolute all time high favorite actor, Judd Nelson.The first time I can remember seeing this movie was when I was about 14 years old. It had me astonished from the very start. The first 15 minutes or so I was wondering if they would ever get their asses out of that school and go hit the streets, doing some rebellious stuff and living as this was their last day on earth. Clearly I had no idea. I soon forgot all about that and instead I was completely blown away with these young actors amazing performances. They had me glued to the screen, almost in cramp, devouring every move and word they expressed. Never once did I doubt them or in any way was I reminded that this was just a flick, not real people sitting in front of me. They were real! Of course they were. They are! Especially Bender and Alison cause I was able to identify myself by them. I was as weird, rebellious and left out as they were. In a lot of ways, I still am.Still to this day (I'm almost 22 now) this is my absolute favorite movie. Sorry to say, they don't make movies like this one any more. Containing everything essential about life, growing up and being a little different (as I think we all are) this is The One Movie that I'm gonna take with me where ever I go. This is my bible.",The Breakfast Club
598,zetscho,"Very good, but a corny ending",6,7 September 2006,"Well, a teenage movie from the 80ies, how bad can it get, I thought. But it really surprised me. I like those kind of movies where only a few characters accidentally get together in one situation or one room and therefore are forced to get to know each other, e.g. ""12 Angry Men"". ""Breakfast Club"" is such a character study and as each character represents a high school stereotype also a social study. Dialogues, acting and directing are great. You have two conformists, one nerd, the rebel and the ""schizo"". The way they get in touch to each other, how the characters develop over that movie are very believable. It is really worth watching. There's just one thing that really bothers me about it: the ending. I would bet that this isn't the ending as writer and director Hughes has planned it and that some producer has interfered to give it the ""hip"" teenage note appropriate for that time (1985). The romance has been slightly implied in the first part of the film and on that level it was totally believable and would have left an open end on how these guys would react on Monday as it was part of the discussion in the key scene. But the way that Claire suddenly comes to John and kissing him was totally out of context. And even worst is the romance between Alley and Andrew. First, it wasn't indicated at all and second, she had to have been made up to fulfill the beauty standards of that time. That was really a downer, a killer of individuality. Maybe typical American, maybe typical 80ies, I don't know but it certainly destroyed the profoundness that movie had until the key scene was over. Well, with an more open ending this would have been a really great flick. But because of the ending which left me disappointed it is only a 6 out of 10 for me.",The Breakfast Club
599,jessicamayjohnson,Amazing.,10,30 April 2013,"I watched this film on recommendation by my 17 year old cousin and by references to the movie in recent hit, 'Pitch Perfect' a couple of days ago. It was a bit slow going at first, and some bits made me cringe, but in overall, I was enticed by it. I liked it so much, I went out the next day to get a copy, and forced my friend to watch it with me so I could see it again. She seemed to like some of it, but not as much as I did. Although the movie is a bit outdated, I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I'm only 14. I would recommend it to anyone, it's thought provoking and really makes you think about the concepts of pressure, and how it effects different people. It's definitely been added to my favorite movies list.",The Breakfast Club

The side of adolescences that is rarely shared with the world. The characters come from all different back rounds and show us that they are rational, intelligent, and caring. That they are human.Bottom Line: A must see, true to life classic that will make you rethink teens. I would recommend it for anyone who is going into high school, or currently in high school. But it can also be a reminder for those who have long sensed passed the great wasteland that is public schooling.",The Breakfast Club

Although the characters do reveal many social issues in teenage life, the plot itself dragged on, all inside of one library for the majority of the movie. I found myself attempting to change the channel several times but decided to see if any jolts would occur. I finally gave up on the movie after watching about 75% of it. I was very disappointed with this film, considering it had such a great cast. If you are a fan of Saturday detention drama, then this is a great film for you!",The Breakfast Club

Most people like this movie after they see it. I personally like it so much that I have seen it almost like 8 times. I would suggest this movie to all and I think if I had to rate it on a scale of 1-10, I would give it an 80,000 lol. If you like comedy you will definitely like this movie.

604,galangmillen-999-917601,The Teen Perspective,10,12 May 2014,"One thing every teen struggles to find is them self. This movie is in the heart of every lost teenage soul, who's just trying to fit in with the others, refusing to conform to the social norms, being relentlessly judged by adults (as if they were never teens once in their lives), having a hard time making their parents understand them, and just trying to figure out what it is they want. The Breakfast Club shows that all teens may have different personalities, sense of style, friends,interests and hobbies, but in the end, we stand by one another, facing the same hard realities of our everyday lives. We fight with our parents, study hard enough to pass in school, do things with our friends to be accepted by others, and many more. Being a teenager is not as easy as an adult would think. Because we are young, we tend to do things that sound good at the moment, and sure enough regret doing it later. We have big hearts with empty spaces that need to be filled, so we try to find a guy or a girl to help fill that empty space for us, later on inevitably getting our hearts broken, but never irreparably damaged. The adults loathe us because they can never be this young again. This movie shows how 5 diverse teenage people, each unique in their own way, can relate to one another in terms of family problems, school situations, maintaining your social status and finding yourself. Praise for this incredible movie. My perspective on life has changed after watching this remarkable film, and I am very sure that so will yours.",The Breakfast Club
605,jwskiman,80s in a nutshell,10,17 October 2006,"I truly don't believe there ever has been a better-made movie that captures so precisely what high school in the 80s (and now, probably) was like. The perfect representatives of each group, the struggle for popularity if not acceptance, finding the painful things that make us common, and the striking differences that drive us apart.Hughes gets a bad rap for many of his movies, but this really is his finest work, IMO. It has everything - humor, drama, fight scenes, conflict, and resolution. More to the point, it has characters that everyone over 17 can identify with. If not, they at least recognize what makes up and drives the other characters since we basically grew up with all of them at our own high schools.I'm certainly not going to say this was Emmy-worthy, but on a personal level this movie has been and will always be in my top 5 of all time. If you haven't ever seen it (or have only seen the watered-down version on broadcast TV) do yourself a favor and rent it tonight.",The Breakfast Club

Teenagers of whatever era are able to watch it and relate to it. And there's always one character we can all relate to and that's what makes it such a wonderful movie. The script is witty . The actors brilliant. The music legendary. In fact the entire movie is filled with classic scenes and hilarious dialog. This is the story of a group of kids from opposite ends of the social field being forced to be together in detention. Despite the problems these kids all have you can't help but like each and every one of them and despite the fact they can't stand each other in the beginning by the end friendships blossom as all have united and become a team. Judd Nelson is of course utterly brilliant in his famous role as Bender. He's rebellious, sexy . Just the kind of guy you always wanted to date as a teenager. Hope this movie continues to be shown across generations. An unforgettable movie!",The Breakfast Club
607,bene-mail,High School pupils have to spend a Saturday to think about themselves and become close friends while having a lot of deep conversations,9,9 November 2015,"Being a high school student in the same age as the characters I can really relay to the plot of the movie "" The Breakfast Club"", even it was filmed in the mid 80's. At the beginning the different groups of high school teenagers are well presented. Nowadays these groups, like sportive people, nerds and ""Bad Boys"", can still be found while walking trough a hallway. In the course of the movie these borders break, because the characters are starting to have a deeper conversation about their families, background and school life. A main reason for the ongoing conversation is Mr Vernon, being the perfect cliché of a principal, by forcing the teenagers to stick together. This team is being developed trough the whole film and is been shown off in Benders run to the gym to save the group. A main reason why I consider this film to be real is the perfect presentation of development of deep friendship. My own experience in school has shown me the same kind of getting together. This development is perfectly illustrated with music and the shots. A lot of repetition can be found in the filming, however it is perfectly used to show similarities in the characters lives. Breakfast Club is showing off a lot of stereotypes and sticks to these perfect role models, regarding the five teenagers. This could be seen as a critic point because it is a little bit to perfect, but it really makes it easier to develop the message. From my point of view the film really wants the viewer to think about role models and stereotypes and if we could break those borders from time to time. Choosing the classic American High School to present this makes a lot of sense and I think it fits perfectly. Regarding filming and screenplay I absolutely love the fact that this scene is filmed in one straight location and has a very low time span. Some might say that this makes the film boring but it is amazing to see that such an easy and cheap production can develop a huge message without using a lot of Special Effects and money. Being able to keep the viewers attention on a film without changing locations or give a lot of impressive shots really shows the value of plot and dialogue. All in all I think this film is amazing in showing off how a cheap production can still deliver a huge message concerning a main topic of human nature. Regarding film and music the film is not that impressive but its simplify is a clear advantage to highlight story and characters.",The Breakfast Club

A thing they all had problems with. For me personally the movie was very attractive, because the main actors were only a little bit older than me. Another reason why i really enjoyed watching the movie is, that pretty much every teenager has some problems with his parents. For me personally it was the best ""old"" movie (behind Star Wars) I've seen so far with my 16 years. I think the best part of the movie was the end and the conclusion. It was really nice to see, that everyone at the end was in a good friendship/relationship to each other. So I think the author made a very good movie, which shows that people have completely different problems and families, but at the end they are all very much the same.

609,kalebdekker,Good Movie,10,12 November 2015,"Many people would say that the breakfast club is the greatest movie of all time, although it is a fantastic movie, I would disagree that it is the best movie of all time. In every movie there are always positives and,negatives, but in the movie the breakfast club I would say that there are definitely more ups than downs. I enjoyed this movie to the maximum, some of the things I enjoyed about the movie was the audio, it was very clear and didn't seem fake, but when you look at other movies from that time era they have very unrealistic audio, like the movie Death Wish II. As I said in the former text that I really enjoyed it, there were only a few reasons why I didn't find this movie perfect because it was slow and got really boring throughout the core of the movie. I think that if John was not in the movie the director would not of been able to salvage the film, although many people love (wanna be her) Claire Sinclaire/Molly Ringwald, I really did not like her she seemed like she held no part in the movie and was impeding the movie the whole time throughout the movie. I think that the mood of the movie was dramatic and a little bit of a comedy. I believe that the age group for this movie is targeted from 15-50 because there are some crude jokes, and I believe that anyone older than 50 would find this movie not very funny and overall dumb. I believe that this is a movie not a film because in my opinion I don't find that there is a lesson in this movie.",The Breakfast Club

Five students with different life styles and different reasons to be in the detention for one day, each one of them represents very clearly stereotypes from that time.Good characters and fun comedy is one of the best characteristics of the movie like when Andrew ask Brian ""What do you need a fake I.D. for?"", he answers ""So I can vote"", each one of the teenagers is a well made personality that makes you like and care for them.Shows how strong was the stereotypes in the 80's that now is almost non-existence but it shows too how the students judge each other, what still happens nowadays.

During the detention the Criminal, Basketcase, Princess, Athlete and the Brain discover how they have a lot more in common than they thought. Today the stereotypes would be a bit different. The stereotypes would be the gamer, the athlete, the princess, the criminal, a weird person, the brain and the shy person. More over, the high school society changed a bit, because the detention isn't really popular anymore. Instead of the detention the high school students have to write essays or help to tidy up the classroom. My favorite quote of the movie is "" we are friends"", because it changed the whole atmosphere from tense and desperately to cheerfully. I think the characters would speak to one another when they see each other in school, because they learned how important real friendship is. The basic message of the movie still holds up because high school students are still clique-ish with their friends. Also, everyone still has problems so students are not that different today as they were in the 80's.

The entire film is always a mixture between drama and comedy. The jokes and dialogues are awesome! It's just fun to watch the five students gradually become friends. I can recommend this movie to everyone, it gives you the chance to have a view back in the 1980's with it's hearty and funny image- and not to forget, it has such a beautiful morality behind it: Everybody is different but if you opened to get to know him and don't be impressed by stereotypes, they can become real friends!",The Breakfast Club

My favorite scene of the movie is the last part when you see the difference between the first part of the movie and the last part. In high school students know a days they are not so clique-ish and judgmental as they are in the film, but still there are a little bit clique-ish and judgmental.

Don't bother if you wanted to know where the famous fist-pump moment came from, skip to the last 5 irrelevant seconds, it isn't even significant like wtf. The four stars were for the only mildly relatable character, being the wonderful teacher who dedicated his Saturday to disciplining troubled teenagers who can't hold it together. He was the most interesting and complpex character by far because his whole life wasn't explained in mumblejumble in its entirety. He also had problems of his own but he handled them like an adult and never gave up on his principles, showing them a good example. The problems the kids had were so surface level and basic honestly without any back story they came off meaningless and boring, we don't even care about these characters yet and their already trying to earn sympathy points with suicide cards and my dad beats me cards. Very lazy. I was expecting at the very least some morals but it turned out to be 5 kids complain about their lives in a library for 2 hours and then go home happy. It was confusing and unsatisfying because there WERE NO RESOLUTIONS?? what was the point. If you're going to make a basic highschool movie about stereotypical groups clashing together all cheesy at least change it up a bit and make it interesting or something. They weren't even allowed to eat in the cafeteria ffs. Train of thought idk. It was so straight forward, nothing left to the imagination. I suggest reading the movie description and saving 2 hours of your life because the movie doesn't offer much more than the synopsis honestly, even the visual aspects are insanely boring. Pretty much the same room for the entire movie, same lighting, same characters, same everything. I usually enjoy watching bad movies even if they're classics but I don't know if The Breakfast Club is even worth it. Essentially the moral is ""you can't tell us who we are"" so Basically ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" because the popular girl is stressed out and the straight A student is suicidal and The bad boy has feelings... need I go on?? Such a surface level movie.",The Breakfast Club
619,harrymego,One of the Best Movies of the 80's,9,9 February 2020,"This movie is great because it understands teenagers. It understands highschool, and all the struggles teenagers face in that time.One of the things few movies did back in that time was make stories that accurately portrayed how teenagers thought and act. It's very relatable.Even to this day, the way the characters act and the struggles they face in The Breakfast Club still hold up today. The challenges that plague their lives are realistic, and paint a picture of what many teens struggle with today.All in all, an excellent film.",The Breakfast Club

Anthony Michael Hall is really great in the film, but maybe I'm being a little biased since he is my favorite actor:) I highly recommend this film, to watch with a lot of your close friends or by yourself...  this is also a great movie for teenagers, what can I say, John Hughes is an excellent director to say the least.",The Breakfast Club

Each character was perfectly planned out, each played their part perfectly. None of them ever struck me as the slightest bit unrealistic, and the story was great. It was simple. It had an actual story to it unlike the many movies today which are just eye candy.

The all-star cast brings all aspects of the high school drama to life with excellent accuracy, especially when compared to other high school-based films.This movie is home to scores of classic moments and epic lines that have been repeated countless times by my generation.There are less than a handful of films that are truly untouchable in all aspects, but this is definitely one of them.

I completely respect the fact that other people have opinions, but these are mine.First off, I am a child of the 80's and I know that many-a-cheesy things came out of the decade, and sure, this movie has MULTIPLE cheesy parts, but I, being a fan of all movie types, am yet to see a movie without a few cheesy parts thrown in.  And also, being a teenager, I am yet to meet someone of my generation (or any other for that matter) who hasn't liked the movie that has seen it.  I had one teacher in high school who even showed it as part of their class.  The stereotypical teenage angst, the separation of personalities (though over the top at points), and the seemingly meaningless incidents, mean so much more to those of us with the idea of sentiment in mind, as well as quality.  If you are looking for an art film, this is not it.  If you are looking for yet another great ""Brat Pack"" movie, THIS IS IT.",The Breakfast Club
629,fnaff-20577,Nostalgic,10,30 May 2019,I love this movie because of how much of a classic it is and how nostalgic it is to watch. The actors are good in their roles and this movie has a great ending.,The Breakfast Club
630,lauradaughton,Labels Stripped Away,9,3 June 2019,"Without a doubt, John Hughes is one of the most talented directors of the century. His raw talents are only further displayed in this blockbuster film, ""Breakfast Club."" Released in 1985, this immediate box office success is still regarded today as the film that defined the decade. Much like in his earlier films such as, ""Sixteen Candles,"" Hughes yet again manages to delve deep into the mind of a teenager. He directs with such authenticity, it feels as if he travelled back in time to view everything through the lens of a highschooler. He accurately portrays how teenagers are in reality by displaying the five highschool stereotypes of teens, and then knocking those stereotypes down completely. In the beginning, the audience is introduced to five characters: the jock (Emilio Estevez), the princess (Molly Ringwald), the freak (Ally Sheedy), the rebel (Judd Nelson), and the nerd (Anthony Michael Hall). These characters each represent a different stereotype established by their script, appearance, and actions. Eventually, the audience discovers they are not as entirely different as they seem. Combined with John Hughes' superior directing, these five incredibly talented actors contribute to this film's immense success, fame, and timelessness.During the first parts of the movie, we learn that these five high-schoolers are being held captive in Saturday detention for various reasons. Through various fights and shenanigans, these characters establish first impressions most identical to their labels. However, we learn that these five, seemingly very different teenagers have much more in common than we think. After excessive bickering and various explosive antics, they all gather around to resolve their differences. Unarguably one of the most powerful scenes of the decade, the five characters tear down their emotional barriers to reveal their truest inner-self. This scene proves that it only takes a heart-to-heart conversation to solve any issues. We discover that despite their differences, these characters share the same fears, desires, and emotions deep down.Hughes prompts the audience to question society as well as themselves. Why do we enforce such stereotypes on teenagers? How are these stereotypes displayed? Do these formulated opinions influence our initial judgement of these characters? While watching this movie, it is only instinctive human nature to categorize these individuals based on societal perceptions. For example, take John Bender- the rebel. From the beginning, we come to the realization that he is the ""bad guy."" Along with his disheveled appearance, his vulgar nature and knack for violence contribute to his label. With his nonchalant attitude and coined phrase, ""eat my shorts,"" the audience instinctively institutes a label. However, that label is eventually stripped away to reveal a character that the audience can sympathize with, and perhaps even relate to. Another example is Claire Standish, a popular socialite played by award winning actress Molly Ringwald. We assume in the beginning that the only things her heart desires is popularity and shopping for new clothes. Eventually, we learn that her shallowness and arrogance is merely a facade. Her label strips away to reveal an empathetic, soft-hearted young teenager just trying to fit in this world.Hughes demonstrates the enormous power of labels. But when we take off our labels instilled on us by society, we unify as one.",The Breakfast Club

Ive watched it with a few of my friends and they all love it too. Its got some great actors ( I really like Anthony Michael Hall and Judd Nelson ) except for Molly Ringwald who I usually like, but she annoyed me in this movie.  Some people have said that it lacks depth, but its a teen movie and there really isnt one that has too much anyway.  I normally hate teen movies, especially the ones out now like Bring it on (how can people like that?) but compare 80s movies (john hughes mostly) to the ones out now and you will see them in a different light.  I guess adults who dont like it really need to be a teen to understand what the characters are going through, because high school is tough, and some people really would get upset if they couldnt make a ceramic elephant. This movie is great for teens no matter what social group they are in. The only part i dont like is how Anthony Michael Hall doesnt get a girlfriend. He was so adorable!",The Breakfast Club

Their were changes and problems but they all played their role perfect. whenever i think of a basket case or criminal i will always think of John Bender(Judd Nelson) and Allison Reynolds(Ally Sheedy). they really display a perfect replica of what those kind of people are like. i hope this was helpful and enjoy the movie,The Breakfast Club
635,kaylajoy,one of my favorites,10,25 June 2006,"Though this movie came out the same year that I was born, I remember watching it a lot while I was growing up. As a teenager it was one of my absolute favorites and it still is. I love how each character seems so different at the beginning of the movie, but later on you come to realize that they are all very similar in many ways. I love all 5 of the members of the Breakfast Club and I think the actors/actresses all did very well portraying them. This movie is such an 80's classic and I really hope that one day John Hughes will release the other 2 hours that go with it. I would loooove to see what else happens to the characters!!!",The Breakfast Club
636,erwscarwash234,my favorite movie ever,10,29 June 2006,"This movie shows you the true values of teenage life in the 80's. Many people don't understand the concept behind this powerful John Huges film. I agree with many people that this is a deep and powerful movie. This is a classic. It was my first R rated movie. Judd Nelson was astonishingly good looking. I had the biggest crush on him. He was like the perfect bad guy. I cant imagine a better guy for the part. He just made me want to do something really bad.Ally Sheedy had the weirdest buy coolest character in the whole movie. All you can say when you watch her is she may be weird but she is so cool. The magic and longing for someone to listen was played wonderfully by Sheedy. I am such a Molly Ringwald girl. I have seen Pretty in Pink, For Keeps and 16 Candles. What i really love is her ability to be a conceded rich girl in one movie and a nerd from the other side of the tracks in another. She is the best teen star. Ask VH1. Emilo Esteves was never my favorite. I love him no doubt abut it but i just never thought he was a doll like my friend. As i said i was a Judd nelson, bad girl. I loved his character and his sad story (in the movie) about his dad made me cry. He has his fun side and his touching side which is what i love about him. The Geek, Anthony Micheal Hall was Super Geek. I don't think anyone can play a geek better. I mean that in a nice way. I love him in weird science, 16 candles and of corse Breakfest club. Who doesn't love a geek. He is the funniest man aliveI never did understand the janitor? What did he mean when he talked to th principal? Was he really Brian's dad?I have seen this movie over 10 times and i still never get that part. Anyway this is one of a few movies you can see over and over again.

638,j-63688,Still a relevant message,9,24 January 2020,"Soon to hit 35 years in the making, The Breakfast Club is still relevant to many teenagers' lives today in 2020. Minus the chaos of social media, Director John Hughes hit a home run with this film.One high school, five children, stands by common stereotypes still found in society today. Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), viewed as ""princess,"" fails to uphold her mannerisms as one of the popular kids. Branched off from her friend group, Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), struggles to feel like the jock champion written on the side of his jacket. John Bender (Judd Nelson), not so athletic but holds the criminal reputation of the school and ankle bracelet locked around his leg, fails to succeed in school, unlike Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), who appears to be the perfect son and student. Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy), less obvious in the eyes of her peers, starts quiet but comes out with a significant change.Being held on a Saturday, for eight hours by Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason), The teacher in charge has no tolerance for miss behavior and shenanigans. The group of teenagers find ways to keep themselves entertained through conversations consisted of past hardships, drugs, sex, rebellion, and assumptions of each other. Together they adventure outside of their designated detention area the library, which leads them to a whole new perspective.The commonality between them all starts with their unsatisfying home lives. The very first scene preview to the viewer is a quote by David Bowie, ""And these children that you spit on as they try to change their worlds are immune to your consultations. They are quite aware of what they are going through. '' This quote can quite frankly be targeted towards parents as well as sum up the reason why these kids are serving detention.Overall the movie is well filmed. As it was shot in the 80s, you get the stops of musical bliss that only adds to the emotion. Throughout the movie, music in the background helps contribute to the tone of the characters. The actors did not fail to deliver their roles. Staying true to their characters, it can easily be said that actors made the movie as enjoyable as it is.A remaking of this movie would be difficult. With the fact that it is a Caucasian based cast, to incorporate characters of different ethnicities could most definitely change the aura of the film. Being an older movie, this can be expected, but the culture and diversity could've made this movie break its own records. In this day of age, the amount of struggles that students experience is a much vast amount.As this movie may seem like a brat flick it holds a special message that still has yet to be heard.",The Breakfast Club
639,Beautiful,...most watched movie...,10,16 April 2001,"TBS Superstation plays _The Breakfast Club_ so often that I've never bothered buying the movie. The thing is, no matter when it's on or what else is on, I always end up watching it with great intent. My mind never wanders from the screen, and if it wasn't for commercials, I would probably never get up for a snack or a bathroom break. The best thing about _The Breakfast Club_ is the fact that, even after 16 years, the film still paints a spot-on picture of high-school life.

Five young students spent their detention on a Saturday in school and discover the others and themselves. Of course, each one is completly different and they share just one common enemy - their teacher.

Its all about a group of five teenagers stuck in a Saturday detention which all have different personalities and lives. It has a sport who is the best athlete in the school, a beauty queen who is the most popular girl in the school, a hard rock badboy who doesn't care less about anyone but himself, not forgetting a silent girl who never speaks and who is just strange and mysterious.

643,Cramenda,Simply the best,10,22 May 2001,"Despite other erronius reviews I've read (here) TBC is, simply put, the best movie of it's category I've ever seen.  For those of you have not seen it (yet) it's about a group of 'catagorized' high school students who are lumped together one fateful Saturday for detention.  Sound dull 'till you see it.  The walls of society's 'pigeon holes' come crashing down when the teens learn to talk to each other as individuals rather than talking to each other as who they think they should be. In example we learn that the 'tough guy' John Bender (Played by Judd Nelson) although street smart and rugged is also insightful and intelligent.The thing I liked specifically about this movie is how the writer (John Hughes) takes the conversations between the actors one step beyond. Although in real life the flow probably wouldn't happen. It was portrayed in a believable manner.  The attitudes, dress, and even the language of that era (1985) take me right back to high school.It has been commented that scenes in the movie 'could never happen' and are even 'far fetched'. To these critics I say perhaps. But if you delve into the real meaning of the movie and understand that the intention of the writer was to illustrate the social prejudices of the time, you'd understand that the premis isn't 'far fetched' at all.On a less serious note, there are (at least in my mind) some serious one liners that even today i'll take out of my one liner library, dust off and use. ""Does Barry Manilow know you raid his wardrobe?"" All in all I found this movie to be funny, nestalgic, dramatic and uplifting... Even still. I give it a full 9.9/10. An excellent rental for the 30 something crowd.",The Breakfast Club

A must see for any eighties fan, this movie written by JOhn Hughes in two days is charming in its simplicity. Five kids with nothing in common, or at least thats what the society of high school tells them. One day without the restraints placed on them by their peers and uniting against an antagonist played perfectly by the late Paul Gleason (Van Wilder ""Nice place, decorated in early f#ck""), John Kapelos as the scene stealing janitor with witty lines.

I've never been so disappointed in a film in all my life. How it's considered to be a comedy, or a drama I'm not sure.

Had never seen the movie before, but knowing its reputation I was looking forward to it. What I saw disappointed me, for the most part because it seemed like it was missing a lot of key scenes that would make the interactions between the characters make sense. It's like they are arguing one moment, then the next they are all up for some hijinks together, then more infighting, friendly conversation, infighting... it's not that the scenes themselves are badly written (although they aren't great, except for the ending sequence with the letter), but that they feel like missing important bits that would make them flow logically. As it is in the version I watched, the script plays like a rough draft that needs fleshing out.How long was this movie in the theaters? How long is it supposed to be?",The Breakfast Club
651,caffedup93,very deep,9,11 November 2006,"I really can't say very much about this movie. only that it is wonderful, fantastic, deep, interesting, and sad all at the very same time. i really loved this movie because, as many people have pointed out, i love to analyze things. This movie gave me many things to analyze: where the plot was going, what the plot meant, what the characters were trying to express beneath what they were saying and doing. the thing that everybody should know when watching The Breakfast Club is that all of the students are from different cliques, so of course they don't know each other, trust each other, and have never spoken a word to each other. The best actor in this movie is probably Judd Nelson. Follows next are : Molly Ringwald, Anthony Micheal Hall, Emilio Estevez, Aly Sheedy. Nelson plays a bully who we then find out has a 'troubled life' that he never talks about until he gets detention with 4 other teenagers who, after getting stoned with them, he feels are the only people he can talk to, even though he has just met them. He first comes off as well, a jackass, but as the story unravels, and the feelings get heavier, you start to see the insecure, scared and unhappy abused child within. While watching, some may see that it is a story about a group of 5 high school students stuck in a detention together that get high together and spill their guts. I did not see this side of the movie. I noticed that every single child in there seemed like a rec-loose, a criminal, a spoiled brat, or a nerd, (very different things), but they all had one very important thing in common: they hated their parents. That is the heart of the story; that the children do not want to end up like their parents, a problem that every person deals with at some time or another. It's inevitable, becoming like you're parents, which comes to the sad side. Not all parents are abusers, some ignore their child, the other's push them, and then they last pair of parents spoil their kid: while being spoiled and pushed to do your best may seem great, it scares the child, no matter how old. The movie ends with a kiss, and you turn off the television and think to yourself ""wow.""",The Breakfast Club

653,clyde2,I Absolutely Love This Movie,10,19 September 2001,"I absolutely love this movie.  I have seen it at least ten times.  It has some of the best lines I have ever heard.  I think that it does a great job illustrating some of the issues with which many teenagers struggle.  These issues may seem simple and unimportant to adults but they mean the world to the teenagers.  There are teenagers who attempt or commit suicide over these issues every year.  So, they are very important.I also thought that the movie did a great job illustrating how teenagers are often divided into different cliques particularly at school.  As well as how these various cliques rarely interact and sometimes look down on each other. As a teenager (and I was a teenager when this movie first came out), I had many problems around the issue of acceptance.  I wanted other schoolmates to accept me.  I wanted to ""fit in"".  I wanted to be popular and well-liked. I wanted my parents to accept me for who I was at the time.  All of this was very important to me.  I can really relate to the characters in this movie.This movie will always remind me what it was like to be a teenager.  I also believe that it helps me to better relate with teenagers now as an adult. Thank you to anyone who had anything to do with it and thank you to IMDb for all the great quotes they have listed here for this movie.  Take care and God bless you and yours.",The Breakfast Club

John Hughes delivers the definitive nostalgic teen movie of the Generation X crowd. The cast made up the '80s ""brat pack"" with Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. It's hard to believe while seeing this film that Ringwald and Hall were the only real high school aged performers... the others were in their mid to late 20s during filming.While modern teens may not find this as ""sophisticated"" as over-sexed comedies like ""American Pie,"" anyone can appreciate true feelings, teen angst, self doubt and relationships with parents portrayed in this film.A group of kids sitting for 8 hours in detention on a Saturday none of them will ever forget. While there is foul language, it's about the same speed as what you can hear on ""NYPD Blue"" on TV. There is no nudity or sex, just raw, in your face teen angst.You see this group of ""losers,"" warts and all, and become friends with all of them before the film is over. The DVD doesn't offer anything other than cast bios and subtitles... which is a disappointment. It would have been great to have had some interviews with the cast and behind the scenes footage.

662,beaded-glory,"Great movie, too much analysis",10,7 March 2002,"Spoilers included!First of all, I read over sixty reviews on IMDB, and most of them were good, and usually those that did offer criticism also provided back up for why.I noticed some people commented that it doesn't fit into comedy well, and it seems awkward when you try to push it into drama. Well, why does it need a genre? Isn't the whole movie about breaking down cliques, titles and stereotypes? The dialogue was awkward at times, and some said that took something away from the film (like the quality, for example) but if you were in the library that day when you were in school, would you have been comfortable and relaxed with people like Bender, who're armed to the teeth and come across hostile? Or Claire who would likely look down on you? Andrew with his inane attempts to stand up to Bender and speak to Brian even though he was laughing at him too? What if Alison was there, and she sat in silence and stared you down every time you tried to communicate with her?
The film deals with a lot of teen problems, without making them seem unworthy or childish. That would have meant something to most teens when they saw it, since High School sure isn't like the ""Porky's"" series. The dancing, getting high, etc. remove realism from it, but think about it for a minute - the kids probably won't speak to each other again after that day. Getting high brings the four others into Bender's world, dancing (however ridiculous it may seem that the principal DIDN'T notice) represents Stubby's party, and hanging out with the popular kids. Claire and Alison bond through make-up, and Brian is just pulled along for the ride. The Breakfast Club probably didn't define a generation, and the tag line for it is as cheesy as David Bowie's tights were in Labyrinth, but it's like watching an episode of ""I dream of Jeannie"" - you wonder how anyone could have gotten away with making it, then feel glad that they did.I doubt the Breakfast Club is an accurate portrayal of all the problems teenagers face, but it scratches the surface of self-absorbed kids (like me! Ha!) who worry over stupid things because they don't know the real world yet. Like training worries.

The characters, although stereotypical and strict in their format, display all different aspects and characters that some may remember back in High School.Disregarding that each character is a stereotype, the movie is entirely realistic and is an eye-opening look at the emotions and impact that a social life or a cruel family life has on each student.Another ""fun"" aspect of this film is that everyone can relate to it.

All he does is make people feel bad about what they do and what they are. He yells at Claire, telling her that she ""has everything"". He completely overlooks everyone else's problems, assuming that he is the only one that deserves any sympathy. I hate how Claire and the rest of the club let him get away with criticizing Claire on what she is. She is the one who seems the most real to me. She's the only one not trying to play a part.

Their journey from knowing nothing about each other to becoming great friends seems like a natural progression, as we really get a sense of each character's personalities. However, after a while the film seems to just smash straight through these barriers that the kids have put up and suddenly, almost without warning, the end arrives leaving everyone friends for life. It's a little disorientating, especially as two characters who are screaming and shouting at each other all the way through the film, one even reducing the other to tears, start sharing one of those romantic moments with *absolutely nothing* to lead them to it. It seems completely unnecessary.Much is made of the experience the characters have changing their lives forever, but it's hard to see just why this is from the film, with little more than a five minute talk about themselves to distinguish this from any group of teens hanging out somewhere. Yes, it's good to get your problems off your chest, but I hardly see anything during this as life-changing. It really let down the film for me, because (aside from a completely patronising ""put on make-up, do your hair and all your problems disappear!"" makeover) nothing really changes in these kids, while the ending implies something huge.But, having said that, the rest of the film is fun, and the interaction between all the characters works really well. I enjoyed it, but the ending just left me wanting something a little more satisfying.",The Breakfast Club
667,DeeBoy,One of those films,10,21 December 2002,"Well Ive read most of the comments about the Breakfast club, good and bad. Its one of those hated or loved movies, i guess.  If its any measure of how i feel about it, then i will say its the only film ive ever went out my way to watch again.  Ok, it has its flaws, i dont like the scene where Emilio Estevez shouts so loud that the glass on the door breaks - it almost turns the film into a spoof and outdoes the good work leading up.  But nothing is black and white, in life and in the movies and i think that the Breakfast Club overall is a fantastic movie.  It is a credit to the film that it appeals internationally and that it can mean so much to so many.  Its a very eighties film, tho, still relevant to this day , perhaps, i could be wrong but unless high school has undergone a remarkable transformation it still appeals.  Judd Nelson has the best lines, Molly Ringwald looks pretty but she aint wearing pink,  Emillio Estevez is more concerned about tomorows wrestling meet,Anthony Michael Hall is analysing the whole situation in a scientific sense- yet cant still make sense of it all and Ally Sheedy is just there - cos she has nothing better to do.

The film serves no purpose other than to solidify five high school stereotypes that everyone is aware of before watching the movie which does nothing to make any of the stereotypical characters likable.

John Bender becomes the unlikely leader of the pack, as he's got the most knowledge of the streets. He's also got a big bag of marijuana that they end up smoking together. By the end of the movie all the characters, which were once alienated from each other, become close friends. They feel good about their new friendships and leave their detention sessions with a fresh and optimistic feeling about themselves and their peers. It's amazing how to this day this movie still holds gravity and relevance nearly 25 years later. The darker and heavier themes of alienation and teen apathy give this movie an extra level of importance in comparison to it's contemporaries like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Sixteen Candles, and Pretty In Pink.

672,tjpeach,Dealing with Ones External Perceptions,8,29 October 2011,"The Breakfast Club is a movie based on a group of high school students in detention that would normally not have spoken to each other. They begin their journey of understanding humanity by talking and learning about each other's lives. The movie allows you to feel like you are in the group as an invisible bystander. It shows how each group of teenagers in high school struggle with their abilities.The main actors are the teenagers that are in detention. They are the jock, Andrew, played by Emilio Estevez, the criminal, John Bender, played by Judd Nelson, the princess/prom queen, Claire, played by Molly Ringwald, the brain, Brian, played by Anthony Michael Hall, and the weird one, Alison, played by Ally Sheedy.John Bender's character is the group trouble maker who also portrays himself as having a terrible home life. This makes the other students see him in a different life. He cause them all to communicate with him by making rude remarks, leading them from the detention room, and delving deep into their lives to understand who they are. He leads them into a life they never experience, and are intrigued so they follow. This causes enlightenment to why each character is who they are, and the problems that they have in their young lives.The movie deals with issues that are hot topics, but often not dealt with. There was only one part of the film I don't think should have been filmed, but I will leave that to the viewer to decide as to not give away too much. The film makes the teenagers very real and everyone can relate to one of the characters. It makes you look back at high school and remember all of the issues and groups that existed.They also go deeper and look into some deep issues of a teenager, and how they have coped with their lives. At the beginning of the movie they are each separate entities that have no desire to communicate, and by the end of the movie they have formed bonds, understanding, and heart felt feelings for each member of the group. The film is not a typical teenager movie, but rather a glimpse into what each person undertakes in high school and how they thrive. This movie is a must watch for everyone. Play special attention to the letter at the beginning of the movie and then again at the end. It plays an important role in understanding what the teenagers learned from their detention experience.",The Breakfast Club

674,pliable-1,"An excellent film, but I may have an idea why it might not always hit the mark now....",10,9 August 2009,"Firstly, I admit it..I love The Breakfast Club. I was a teenager when it first came out and it remains the quintessential 80's Teen movie. John Hughes made great and entertaining films and it is sad that he is no longer with us, by far his best work are the teen flicks of the 80s.Reading through the comments on here, I was initially really upset that some people hated it (how dare they!), but I have thought of a few reasons why.Firstly, there will always be people who just don't like this sort of film. It's just a given.Secondly there are people who are uneasy about the characters and how rigidly stereotyped they are. I understand this, but I also think I get why John Hughes made them this way. Obviously 'real' people are less defined and have a bit more of this or that in them, but my experience of school was that kids pigeon-hole people like crazy. If someone is big on sports that defines them, if someone is highly academic with no interest in sport they are 'a geek'. They are other things too, but this main characteristic is the 'essence' of who they are in high school terms. Brian says '....the most convenient definitions....' I think John Hughes simplified them to exaggerate this point.Finally, and this is the sad reason. I think The Breakfast Club is victim of its own success. These films (The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Some Kind of Wonderful, etc) paved the way for the teen movie format. They have been emulated, rewoven, and even copied. There have been so many teen flicks in the 25 years since The Breakfast Club was made, that I worry that it's near impossible for the modern teen to fully appreciate the films as I did when I was young. The Breakfast Club could seem clichéd even though it wasn't originally. It is a little slow by modern standards and the dialogue is occasionally dated. I wonder whether it would have been made if the script came along now; and that, my friends, would have been a great shame, because it really is a great movie and I don't believe the underlying messages are any less relevant now than they were then (eg prejudice, pigeon holing, petty authority, home life, wealth/poverty, understanding) So, please do watch this film, forgive some of the dated vernacular and try to judge it sympathetically as an original format for its time. Then look at the world around you and see if you think the problems are really very much different!",The Breakfast Club

When I first saw this movie as a teenager from about Anthony Michael Hall's age, it gave me the feeling that I wasn't the only one who was misunderstood by his parents (even though my parent's are great, unlike the parents from the characters in the movie). After just coming home from this film, I started remembering what it was like in school, what I loved and loathed about it and what it was like being a teenager, making friends and belonging (or not..) to a certain crowd.There were a few people commenting that the movie was bad and it was too simple, with the parents being blamed for all the problems. As far as I can see they missed the point entirely. Yes, the parents get a bad rep, but that is not the main point. The very obvious point is that despite their differences in background/social circles, their problems (and teenagers problems anywhere) and more importantly themselves are more alike than they imagined...

It is famous: a cult classic, and I would have certainly hoped it a deserved title. The set up is interesting: a character driven story about five total stereotypes locked up together for an extended period of time. Of course, as the movie progresses, the characters began to feel less like stereotypes and more like people as so they should in any movie, and I found them believable (for the most part) as people, but their interactions were utterly contrived. For a character driven movie, it really felt like the writer had no idea who the characters were: they simply slipped out of themselves constantly doing things that they obviously would not as people have done, such as Brian and Andy smoking pot in the library. Mostly, the end is ridiculous. It is as if the writer simply said ""Damn, I'm out of pages, I guess I'd better make everyone fall in love."" There was a ton of potential here, and the payout was in small nuggets of real humanity. That's the beauty of a character driven plot: the humanity of it.

679,jljohnson08,The Breakfast Club,7,28 October 2010,"This film's theme relates to an array of issues that revolves around the development of the characters; influence, acceptance, diversity, prejudice, tolerance, family issues and how to just survive high school. ""The Breakfast Club"" is about a group of five teenagers who have very little in common and don't care much for each other. They come from different walks of life and are reluctant to accept each other. But when sentenced to serve a detention in the high school library on a Saturday morning for eight hours, they end up revealing their inner secrets (with the help of a little pot session) and realize they have more things in common than they first thought; by the end of the day they become friends. ""Somewhat"" supervised by the Principal Richard Vernon played by Paul Gleason who ironically is also doing detention in his office and knocking back a few beers. The outcome is very predictable, which could be an understatement, but the cast was very effective as their characters opened up to their emotions. The main characters were the typical students in most high schools in the 1980's and to some extent are still the same today; Andrew the jock played by Emillo Estevez, Brian the brain played by Anthony Michael Hall, Bender the jerk played by Judd Nelson, Claire the popular princess played by Molly Ringwald, and Allison the introverted basket case played by Ally Sheedy. Written and directed by John Hughes (Ferris Bueller's Day Off; Sixteen Candles) has the ability to tap into the minds of teenagers and show them as adolescents trying to find a place in a culture that is sometimes hardened and unsympathetic or unable to understand the dilemma of survival in high school and society. The sound track used in the film was typical 1980's music which had various artists including Simple Minds ""Don't You (Forget about me) and a main feature point in the film, without the sound track this movie would have been lifeless. Brian played by Anthony Michael Hall opens and ends the movie with a short voice-over narration. The inside/out editing technique is apparent in the very first shot where the scene ""breaks"" away (looks like glass shattering) and the focus moves on to the beginning of the movie. Overall this movie was dead on in the 80's; influential and controversial at the same time and although I preferred John Hughes' movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off much better this movie was Hughes' most successful.",The Breakfast Club
680,carr24-917-202292,Good entertainment from the 80s,7,12 December 2010,"The Breakfast Club is a film about teens searching for their identities during a Saturday detention. The cast represents stereotypical characters from all the major high school cliques. Andrew Clark is the athlete portrayed by Emilio Estevez, Claire Standish is the princess as portrayed by Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall plays the brain Brian Johnson. The ""Club"" is rounded out with Judd Nelson as the criminal John Bender, and Ally Sheedy as basket case Allison Reynolds. The Club's chief rival and on-screen antagonist is Principal Richard Vernon played by Paul Gleason.The Breakfast Club is the name the group gives themselves in a thesis written by Johnson. The film is primarily a comedy, but differs from other teen comedies of the1980s such as Ferris Bueller's Day Off, in the depth that the film delves into the teenager's perceived angst. Ferris Bueller was sure of himself and the only angst he suffered was the fear of getting caught in one of his schemes. As mentioned before the Club's on screen adversary is Principal Vernon, but as the Club members get to know one another and search for common ground they all point their fingers toward their parents as the source of all their maladies. I interpreted their revelation as a mechanism to show that no matter how different we appear, we are all the same in fundamental ways, and what teen doesn't blame their parents for their problems? The movie opens with all the Club members arriving at the school on Saturday morning and interacting with their parents as is the case with Andrew, Claire, and Brian, however Allison is ""ditched"" at school while John comes wandering in on his own. Detention starts with Principal Vernon laying down the rules; you will not talk, you will not move from these seats, and you will not sleep, the last command being aimed at John in a way that shows Vernon's familiarity with John's tactics then the students are left on their own.All of the club members try to do their own thing to while away the time but John is at unease with the peace. He initiates confrontation with all of the others except Allison, whom he identifies as a fellow misfit, and ultimately has a showdown with Vernon. It is through John's persistent annoyances that the Club eventually come together to find common ground.The film constantly reaffirms each Club member's stereotypical persona, through dialogue, dress, and actions. The film also uses popular music of the era to help set the tone. There is even an impromptu music video with each member letting their hair down in a manner that fits their individual persona.The film succeeds as a comedy, but it also brings a little something extra to the table as the teens reveal their angst to one another and find common ground despite their differences.",The Breakfast Club
681,martie03,This movie does a great job with depicting the pressures that teenagers went through in 1985 and still go through today.,10,9 December 2010,"The Breakfast Club was written and directed by John Hughes in 1985. This is a movie about five students that have to spend an entire Saturday in detention and have to write an essay telling Principal Richard Vernon who is played by Paul Gleason who they think they are. One is a basket case, one is a spoiled rich girl, one is a geek, one is a criminal, and one is a jock. This movie does a great job with depicting the realistic pressures that teenagers went through in 1985 and still go through today. I feel that the movie has great continuity and the actors are creative contributors to the success of the film. This is the type of film that no matter who watches is they can relate to it in some fashion. Everything about the film from the set, the characters costumes, and the music are a great representation of how and what public suburban schools look and feel like throughout the country. At the end of the film everyone is left drawing their own conclusion on how things will play out for each of the characters. This movie left me thinking about how high school was for me and how I could relate to each and every character. I would recommend that you see this movie, especially if you want to look back at the time you spent in high school.",The Breakfast Club
682,chaffi04,The Breakfast Club was directed and written by John Hughes,9,11 December 2010,"The Breakfast Club was directed and written by John Hughes. The movie is completely shot in the high school setting with five students who are facing detention. The students are Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), John Bender (Judd Nelson), Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald) and Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy). The other two actors portrayed in the film were Principal Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) and Carl (John Kapelos). I found the actors that John Hughes selected for this film was perfect. The location for the film was a high school and this worked great for the film. The lighting that was used throughout the movie seemed good as a school is lit well, but not too bright. The sounds reflected each scene the way it needed too. One example of that would be the scene in the basketball court. You could hear the echoes just as you would in a real basketball court. The only example movie I can think that might have some resemblance to the plot and setting would be ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"".This movie could have focused on a number of themes, but I feel that the theme that stood out was peer pressure. The movie was all about five students from different lifestyle backgrounds. There was the jock, geek, rich girl, criminal and the crazy girl. At first, you would not think this movie would be any good, but the use of the school setting created the atmosphere that we have all faced. Also, the theme was based on peer pressure that everyone goes through during their school years. The costumes all reflected each student's background and this allows the viewer to identify each character by looking at the costume alone. The movie was shot at a school and it truly brings back memories of high school as you watch them run the halls and you can see all of the doors leading to class rooms.I found that Bender was the main character in the film because he would be the one causing the peer pressure. Bender would start the fights with not only the students, but with Principal Vernon as well. He had dark secrets about his home life and he let it control his life. Each character in the film had secrets and in the end, well you need to watch the film to see what happens.I did feel that the film will allow any person to relate to how things were in school and the film might have been for the 80's, but it is still relevant today. The same pressure that we faced back in school still exists and this film has a great way of showing how people face it and how we can change. I found this movie to be rewarding and I was satisfied with the outcome of the film and how it kept my attention during the whole film.",The Breakfast Club
683,abel03,The Breakfast Club,8,14 December 2010,"The Breakfast Club, directed by John Hughes, touches base on popular stereotypes that can be found in any typical American high school. The film follows five students of very different backgrounds on one day in detention. During a regular school day this particular group of teens would never be seen talking to each other or dare to associate with one another. When they see who they are ""stuck with"" for their detention, none of them are pleased, to say the least. The students are John Bender (Judd Nelson), Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy) and Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), who are the bad boy, the jock, the popular rich girl, the emo, and the nerd of the school. The teacher in charge of their detention is Mr. Vernon (Paul Gleason), who is also the principal of their school. The only thing that the students notice they share in common right away is their hatred for Mr. Vernon. Mr. Vernon assigns them to all write a paper about ""Who you think you are"". During the course of the detention and through actually speaking to one another, the students find out that the misconceptions they each had of one another were extremely wrong. I believe the Breakfast Club did a good job introducing all of the characters and began in the right direction allowing the viewer to see each of the students as the other students saw them. We as the audience were introduced to who they ""really"" were right along with the other class mates. John Hughes also did the movie Ferris Beulers Day Off. Both of these movies seem similar to me. In one movie it focuses on a larger group of teens and the differences they thought they had in turn to find out how similar they are. Ferris Buelers Day Off focuses more on one student, his sister, and one of his friends. Again there was a hatred for the principal by Ferris and his friend. Ferris' sister was the nerd sucking up to the principal trying to help him bust Ferris for skipping school. Ferris and his friend were the ""bad boys"" trying to have a day of fun by skipping school. I think the Breakfast Club was more of a drama for Hughes where Ferris Buelers Day Off was to be more comical. However both films focused on stereotypes of teens. Overall I really enjoyed this film and watching each of the characters take on the ""real them"". It shows how high school can really be for teens and how it is to be okay with displaying who you really are.",The Breakfast Club
684,oceans74,The pressures in teenage lives,9,29 January 2011,"In the film 'The Breakfast Club' we see five teenagers that come from different cliques come together for a Saturday detention in high school. The cliques that they come from is the 'Brain' Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), the 'Athlete' Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), a 'Princess' Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), a 'Basket Case' Allsion Reynolds (Ally Sheedy), and a 'Criminal' John Bender (Judd Nelson). Throughout this day they taunt each other, make jokes, and party, this helps them come to an understanding of each other and become friends by the end of the day. This may seem like a typical teen movie except it really hits home not just during 80's but, for every generation that has come after. They did not want to go to the school and on some levels were concerned with being cool and fitting in, not getting along with their parents but wanting to please them at some levels. The pressure they have from their peers, during the scene where they were all sitting on the library floor and Brian asks if they will still all be friends come Monday. Claire said no, that they would say hi to them and then cut them down when they walked away so their friends would not make fun of them for talking to the others.This film touches base with the pressures these teens go through at home. Claire's parents use her to get back at each other. Brian's parents expect perfection, Andrews father expect him to be a winner and put down those who are not. Allison's parents ignore her, and John's parents are physically and mentally abusive to him. Most of us could relate to one if not more of these teens home lives which makes this film feel more personal having that insight into many lives. Staying in the time period of the 80's the film 'Pretty in Pink' you see many of the same teen issues of fitting in and the pressures that come with it. When two teenagers start to like each other and they are from opposite sides of the tracks. When Andy Walsh (Molly Ringwald) and Blane McDonnagh (Andrew McCarthy) want to start dating and their friends put pressure on them about how it is not right due to they are not in the same clique. At the end they decided that they did not care and some of their friends changed their minds and others were still against it.The theme song for this film fits it perfect 'Don't forget about me' by Simple Minds. In this song it talks about telling your troubles, and how love is strange, these two things happen in the film when they all tell each other their problems and when Andrew and Allison and John and Claire have connections with each other from more than a friendship. When the song says 'will you recognize me?' this is told during the scene when Brian asks if they will still be friends on Monday. The song really relates to the fact in the movie that some are worried what will happen when they are in school with their other friends will they say each other's names? Or just walk on by.During the dance part of the film when they were playing the music in the library the camera shows the actors in a long, medium, and close up shots, this shows them dancing alone defining them from different cliques. Then we see them dancing together in long shots this helps to show that even though you can see from their appearance that they are from different worlds in this school, it shows that they are connecting with each other through the music. When they dance together you see John and Allison, then the three guys together, then the two girls. The Breakfast Club depicts what kids go through from the pressures of teen life not just from the 80's but today and generations to come. People can find themselves in one if not more of the characters and relate to the problems and pressures that they are going through.",The Breakfast Club
685,babyluv2623,A Brat Pack Classic,10,4 February 2011,"In this film five very unlikely students end up becoming friends during a Saturday detention. They end up opening up to one another and learning more about each other in one day than most learn in years of friendships. After the discoveries made throughout the day, they decide to call themselves The Breakfast Club. With all these students learn and go through together, it would be best said that it is a coming of age film with hints of judgment and stereotyping: many things in which teenagers go through at this time in their lives.For Clair (Molly Ringwald) and Andrew (Emilio Estevez), they fall under the popular clique so they have had previous interactions. While the nerd of the morning falls on Brian (Anthony Michael Hall). Then, there is always that troubled one in the group whose home life make them the bad-ass they get labeled is that Bender (Judd Nelson). Lastly, what group would be complete without that of the kooky member, which falls to Allison (Ally Sheedy). Without each of these roles the coming together, the group may not have had as large an impact in how they end up by the end of this film. In some small way, they take steps in no longer caring what others may think. Instead, they think for themselves, for the future.Everything occurs for the most part in one room of a school and with this simple setting, using open lighting helps one put more focus on each character and how they change through out the day. Allison and Bender seem to have the most growth during the movie. Sheedy does an amazing job in the beginning showing off the eccentric side of Allison. While Bender keeps his hard edge. It makes it more understandable who he is and what he silently needs. He finds out those things in this group of different kids – people he never dreamed he could befriend. But in each other, they all find what none of them could find before – themselves.In some ways, no matter the decade, I think this movie shows that you can find the best things in life in the most unlikely of places; certainly these five students did. Every adolescent has felt or been in a situation where they could relate to one or more of these characters whether it was like the odd one out like Allison, the nerdy geek like Brian, the troubled like Bender or the popular/jock standing like Clair and Andrew. Everyone is being judged by others that are different from them. It's a part of coming of age.",The Breakfast Club
686,campbe89,The Breakfast Club is a movie that will always be watched,10,6 February 2011,"The Breakfast Club is about five kids a jock Andrew, princess Clare, brain Brian, criminal John Bender , and basket case Allison, that were thrown together for Saturday detention. At the beginning of the movie when they all arrive at school they just figure it was going to be a day of sitting there doing nothing; until principal Vernon told them that they need to write an essay about who they are. As the movie start you hear Brains voice giving a brief description of who they are. The theme of the movie is that no matter who you are and what kind of back ground you comes form we all have differences. Bender is always pushing the bottoms of the other to get things out of them on who there are. This brings them all together and they have became friends. The director made his point with different camera angle he would use close up in scene when a point was being made and how the music was tied in is the right point in the movie. The Breakfast Club is a movie that will always be watched. The pressure of being a teen ager will never change. They have become more then when the movie was filmed in 1985. Those pressures of using drugs having sex being forced by your parents to get all A's will never change. Just have to learn how to cope with them and not to judge people until you get to know them and you never know that you might have more then you know in common with that person. It doesn't matter if that person is a jock or a criminal it is just a stereo type of people and those you may think are a criminal might just be just like you and he is being judge by the way he or she acts. I would say that The Breakfast Club is a great movie the points made it the movie will never change in time. That is why people will continue to watch The Breakfast Club. For fifteen year the movie have never died and can be seen on TV this show me that the movie is a classic and the no matter when it is watch people can relate to The Breakfast Club.",The Breakfast Club
687,caselnova,Great lesson for all ages!,7,6 February 2011,"The Breakfast Club is a story that almost everyone that has made it through high school can relate to. Whether you're the jock, the princess, the nerd, the loner, the delinquent or another stereotype there is a familiar scene in this movie for you.Saturday detention is full of likely and unlikely participants that morning. Andrew (Emilio Estevez), the jock, we learn is in detention for taping a boy's behind together in gym class. Clair (Molly Ringwald), the princess, has skipped class to go shopping. Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), the nerd, has been caught with a flare gun in his locker because it went off! Allison (Ally Sheedy), the loner, showed up Saturday because she literally didn't have anything better to do! Lastly, Bender (Judd Nelson), the delinquent, pulled the fire alarm as a prank to earn him a seat there that Saturday morning. The theme of the movie deals with social problems. It portrays five vastly different people thrown together who discover their similarities and become friends.The lighting on the film was primarily high-key lighting. This lighting created powerful images especially when the angles were close up on the characters faces. This effect is best displayed during one of the final scenes when all the characters are revealing why they are in detention. The angles and lighting used are able to showcase their emotions. The final scene with Principle Vernon (Paul Gleason) reading the letter written by Brian on behalf of the entire club"" also demonstrates the use of angles and lighting. The elements used create a dramatic, yet emotional impact. The frame starts tight and gradually widens out as Principal Vernon is reading the letter. The letter states what all five detention participates had learned about themselves and the world, not how they actually saw themselves when they left the library that day. They entered in separate worlds as the jock, the princess, the nerd, the loner and the delinquent. The left as five teenagers who discovered who they could be-whatever they wanted not who they were expected to be.",The Breakfast Club
688,jennyhazelton,A group of unlikely friends come together after a day of detention,10,8 February 2011,"The Breakfast Club. This movie has a universal theme in a dated setting. The title clues the viewer in that this group of kids somehow forms a club, but it's not until the movie starts that we find out just what kind of club it is. The movie starts with a group of kids who has ended up with Saturday morning detention for various things. Each student in detention comes from a different background. These kids would not normally be inclined to associate with each other except for they are all in detention. There is the preppy rich girl played by Molly Ringwald, the tough street thug played by Judd Nelson, the smart nerdy kid played by Anthony Michael Hall, the psycho goth girl played by Ally Sheedy, and the jock kid played by Emilio Estevez. Through the course of the day these kids fight and argue, but they also come to some kind of realization that they are really all alike. They all deal with the same issues of insecurity about themselves and coming of age as all teenagers. They realize that just because they come from different backgrounds and have different interests, deep down they are all quite similar. Although the preppy kids don't necessarily want to associate with the nerdy kids once detention is over, but the nerdy kids feel like it would be quite an honor to at least be able to say hi to the popular kids once detention is over. The setting of this movie takes place mostly in one room, over the course of one day. It is interesting how the passing of time goes in this film. The students encounter some adventures throughout the day while trying to avoid the principal who is in charge of keeping them in line. They escape the library for a short bit and almost get caught. The bad guy played by Judd Nelson actually gets kicked out of the library until he breaks out of the closet and goes back to the other students. Every element of this story is used to develop each character, from their parents and the vehicle they are dropped off in, the conversations they have with their parents when they are dropped off, they way they dress, their choice of lunches, and most of all the reasons that they all ended up in detention. Each element gives us a better understanding of their lives and how they are different from each other. In the beginning the student have no intentions of getting along with each other and plan to spend their day keeping to themselves, but in the end they have formed a sort of club with a day filled with stories that they will share together.",The Breakfast Club

Once they started sharing the all of their pasts and their pain you feel a sense of sadness and sympathy. If I had to compare ""The Breakfast Club"" to another movie I'd compare it to ""Never Been Kissed"" and ""10 Things I Hate About You."" Both of these are great movies as well as ""The Breakfast Club,"" and all these movies are based on the same themes. There all movies on teen relationships, fitting in, social identities, and getting made fun of because you're not ""cool"" enough. These are all awesome movies that I would highly recommend watching and taking something from them. I think the message people should take from this movie is that everyone has a different social identity, none of them being right or wrong, and maybe students should start being more accepting of others. There are always reasons for why people are the way they are, and maybe if we gave different people a chance we could be more understanding.",The Breakfast Club
692,cakeordeath16,Writing like this is hard to find,9,11 April 2005,"It is a credit to the writing of this movie that I came away from it desperate for a sequel but hoping one would never be made. I love this movie and the five characters as so fragile that it looks like they may shatter at any moment, yet find a collective strength Anyone who's seen this film knows it switches from melancholy to funny to confrontational in the blink of an eye, but there is a method to the madness. Unlike modern teen flicks where there is the predictable ""X and Y are different, grow to like each other, big fight, reunion"", this film is a little more insightful to teenage angst and emotion, that being completely unpredictable Set over the course of half a day, there is no film i've ever seen where you emotionally invest in the characters so much you want to see what happened to them all after that day, even though you know they are merely fictional characters.

It just seems artificial, with nothing that would really work. I agree with some of the statements about how most would stay with their own crowd, but a lot is mistaken. Real high school life is a fresh-baked pie, full of unique flavors you've never tasted before. This movie is a hostess fruit pie, with artificial flavors you've had too many times, and with a bitter aftertaste. Also, I HATE how the quirky ""basket case"" Got a makeover, and, OH BOY! The athlete suddenly notices her! Holden Caulfield would have a field day with this movie. Final words: Five stereotypes walk into a library, they leave after a cookie-cutter movie. Oh, and Judd Nelson dresses like the terminator when he attacked Sarah Connor in the Club Tech Noir.",The Breakfast Club
694,psdougcbj,The Breakfast Club does a good and realistic job of capturing what it was like in high school,8,29 October 2011,"The Breakfast Club does a good and realistic job of capturing what it was like in high school for the average American teenager. The movie revolves around the theme that teenagers often succumb to the pressures of society to group off into their own social classes with no tolerance for those who are different, whether that is from peer pressure or family values, but if we look past those social boundaries, we may find that we like what's on the outside.The movie starts off showing all the parents dropping off the teens at their high school for Saturday detention. The main characters and stars are: the jock, Andrew, played by Emilio Estevez; the geek, Brian, played by Anthony Michael Hall; the trouble maker, John, played by Judd Nelson; the preppy girl, Claire, played by Molly Ringwald; the freak, Allison, played by Ally Sheedy; and the principle, Richard, played by Paul Gleason.The movie really is a movie of clichés, as the plot revolves around the central theme that the geeks, preps, trouble makers, and weirdo's all tend to stick to their own groups and really don't fully understand the other groups, but if they took the time to understand each other, they would realize that most of them are alike in a lot of ways. Motif is continuously used to drive home the theme of the movie, because we are constantly reminded through the dialog between characters, that they are all from different social groups and they don't understand each other.Throughout the movie we continuously learn of each characters life story and what makes them who they are and we quickly find out the common theme is that they all think there home life is a drag so to speak. Andrew is constantly pressured by his father to be a winner and to win at all costs, Brian is pressured by his parent to make sure he always does perfect academically, John isn't pressured at all by his parents, he just has a bad home life where he is mentally and physically abused, Claire feels that her parents don't care about her, they just use her to get back at one-another, and Allison is just completely ignored by her parents.The home troubles are really what brought the kids together throughout the course of the film. In the beginning there were often clashes between John and Andrew because of the way he talked to the other kids in detention. John spends most of the movie making fun of the others and causing trouble with the principle Richard, which eventually leads to John being banished to a closet. But as is predictable from the very beginning, the more the kids talk to each other the more they begin to get along, and like typical teenagers, what really brings them together is there dislike of their parents, and overall home life. Dialogue is the main way the director gets across the theme, by continuously showing scenes where the kids are interacting socially with each other and getting to know each other's stories.The ending of the movie is ridiculous, but doesn't detract from the movie overall, as we observe John and Claire hooking up and Andrew and Allison pairing up. Those scenarios are highly unlikely in the real world over the course of one Saturday morning, but I think the purpose of the ending was to drive home the theme, that if we take the time to understand one another, that we might find out we like someone who we perceive as different.",The Breakfast Club
695,bailey_evans,The Breakfast Club was a Success,10,29 November 2011,"The Breakfast Club is a heartfelt, thought-provoking, and emotional film. It is a story of five teenage strangers, who meet in detention and find out there is more to a person than meets the eye. They each embody five different stereotypical persona's; the jock, the basket case, the princess, the nerd, and of course, the rebel. Ironically their teacher, Mr. Vernon, who put them in detention in the first place, asks them to write an essay about who they think they are. Upon further discussion with one another, the students realize their beliefs and stereotypes go much further than expected and they share common problems such as loss of identity and trouble at home. Problems faced by the teenagers may seem insignificant to the viewer but the film does a wonderful job of capturing teenage misconception and loneliness in a world of on-going adaptation and rivalry. They reveal their deepest secrets, and learn about themselves in the process. Mr. Vernon's question of ""who do you think you are"" is not taken lightly, the students redefine the stereotype of who they are, and fully understand that it takes a lot more than a simple question to define someone. Mr. Vernon judges them based on who he thinks they are, and his ignorance makes the students look superior to him. The film leaves the viewer hoping the breakfast club will always remain friends, or at least remember the wonderful afternoon they spent, getting to know each other outside of their social cliques. Mr. Vernon is unaware that his punishment turned out to be a blessing in disguise. John Hughes provides a look into the sentimental aspect of high school labels and provides his audience with a light story of sympathetic virtue and contentment.",The Breakfast Club
696,yunapinkfinalfantasy,The Breakfast Club is about five totally different strangers becoming friends with each other after realizing that their stereotypes shouldn't define who they are.,10,3 February 2012,"The Breakfast Club has the theme that stereotyping is wrong and should be avoided even with one's self. The film starts out by introducing the five different teens as their label; the princess played by Molly Ringwald, the brain played by Anthony Hall, the criminal played by Judd Nelson, the basket case played by Ally Sheedy, and the athlete played by Emilio Estevez. As the movie progresses the viewer gets to know them as Allison (previously the basket case), Claire (beforehand the princess), Andrew (was the athlete), Brian (who was the brain), and John (which was the criminal).The theme is shown by the changes made in the letter from the beginning of the movie to the one at the end of the movie. The first version just admits what was done to get them there was wrong, they thought the he was crazy to tell them to write an essay about themselves, and that he wouldn't care to read the essays anyways since he sees them as their stereotyped labels. The corrected version at the end doesn't have them admitting to having done anything wrong just that they deserve the detention and accept it, writing an essay about themselves is crazy, and he'll see them as he wants to under ""the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions"" which they each sign off as under their own label.The other way it is shown is as each individual explains their home life. Each of them have the same problem, their parents don't understand them as their selves but as their labels. They further their realization of that as they realize they are just different is all. They each had something different as their lunch; with one of the having nothing, one having sushi, one having sugar on bread, one having a regular nutritious lunch, and one having tons to eat. Then they understand that in totality after seeing what each person carries around in either their purse or wallet.This same theme is covered in a different way in the movie The Pregnancy Project. That film focused more on pregnant teens being stereotyped as having no future any more. However at the end the girl conduction the project realized the problem wasn't that the pregnant teens were treated different the problem was stereotyping and happened to more than just pregnant teens. She gives a presentation at the end to explain this, while this is explained only in the letter and their new friendships in The Breakfast Club.Film elements and techniques added to the film to help get the theme across. One main way was the music and in specific the song ''Don't You (Forget About Me)"" by Simple Minds. The song's lyrics are very similar to the plot of the movie while the song is played at the beginning and picked up at the part that has the word la repeated in beat by John as he helps the others avoid getting in trouble by getting himself in trouble, the song then is repeated at the end of the film. Another way is how the film goes back and forth between the principal, Mr. Vernon played by Paul Gleason, and the 5 teenagers.Overall the film covers how labels shouldn't be put on people. Everyone is different but their differences aren't given justice by labeling them. Stereotyping just causes problems. I feel that the movie was excellent and the acting was done excellent as well especially with the actress Ally Sheedy's playing Allison who at the beginning of the film was a funny character by the way she acted entirely different than the rest but over time starts talking and at the end changes her look all together with help of Claire. Definitely a movie worth watching again for either the theme or comedy it presents in the way they manage to aggravate Mr. Vernon.",The Breakfast Club
697,elizabethavila85,We All Can Relate,10,4 February 2012,"Director John Hughes created the film The Breakfast Club simply about stereotyping. This film is about 5 students who get stuck in detention on a Saturday all day. Claire (Molly Ringwald) is the princess, Andrew (Emilio Estevez) is the jock, Bender (Judd Nelson) is the criminal, Allison (Ally Sheedy) is the basket case, and Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) is the brain. Together Claire, Andrew, Bender, Allison, and Brian spend the day getting to know each other and revealing who they really are. Each of these students shares their emotions and realizes that they have a lot more in common than they thought. Claire is just a teen who is popular, but doesn't like the pressure everyone puts her under just because she id. Andrew just wishes he didn't have to live up to his father's expectations. He wishes he wasn't pressured into being popular and being mean to those who aren't jocks or not in his social group. Allison is considered a basket case because she is weird. Bender is misunderstood and is considered a criminal because he acts out due to coming from an abusive household. Brian is smart and isn't popular due to the fact he is stereotyped as a nerd. Director John Hughes captures their bonds when are sitting in a circle in the middle of the library. The camera zooms in on Claire's, Andrew's, Bender's, Allison's, and Brian's faces as they reveal their truth about why they are in detention. You can't help but feel their emotions from their facial expressions and movements as they speak. Claire, Andrew, Allison, Bender, and Brian are dancing to ""We Are Not Alone"" and in that moment all their stereotypes disappear. They are just a bunch of teens that like the same music. They are just dancing away, having fun, carefree, and bonding. Another movie that can relate to this theme of stereotyping is Pretty in Pink also directed by John Hughes. Again in this movie you have the stereotypes put on students who attend an upper class high school. The teens are just trying to rise above it and make it through high school. Stereotyping is everywhere and The Breakfast Club can be related by every one of all ages. I love this movie and can watch it over and over again. The humor, music, actors, and theme just draw you in because you can relate to the characters in the film. The film gives you a glimpse of what teens go through.

The students, John the criminal, played by Judd Nelson, Allison the basket case, played by Ally Sheedy, Brian the brain, played by Anthony Michael Hall, Clair the princess, played by Molly Ringwald and Andrew the athlete, played by Emilio Estevez, all come from different backgrounds. At the beginning of the movie, they appear to have nothing in common. However, by the end of the movie they have more in common than they thought. Many movies that deal with stereotyping, such as The Breakfast Club and Can't Buy Me Love, show that although, the belief that one group is better, or different than other groups, we still have common elements. The movies portray what it is like to come from different backgrounds and how stereotypes are formed. Whether the groups are jocks, nerds, or outcasts, if one takes the time to get to know the other by simply listening and opening ones heart, maybe they will see that we are all alike in some manner. We all have feelings. We are all out to find friends, love and happiness.In the beginning, the students are put in the library as told to write an essay about who they think they are as a person. Andrew is a jock who is trying to please his father. Claire comes from a wealthy background and is in with the popular group, but feels as if her parents don't care about her and just use her to get back at one another. Brian is very smart, but his parents always expect more from him. John has a criminal history and comes from an abusive home. Allison is just very odd and feels that her parents ignore her and simply do not care about her. Mr. Vernon, played by Paul Gleason has formed opinions on the students. He speaks about how John will never amount to anything and how he expects more from Andrew. John immediately lashes out at the others. Although his opinions are not taken well by the others, he may be the most honest among the group. John seems to know how to push their buttons and make them defensive. They begin by arguing and coming close to fighting. They all have negativity towards the each other based on friends, clothing and actions. The producer shows this by the simple shots of their shoes. It shows the designer boots, the tennis shows, the nerdy shoes, and the worn shoes, showing the different social classes. Soon the social classes come together and form a unity. They begin to defend one another and after John introduces marijuana, they form a circle and begin to open up and share their feelings about life, parents, love and pain. While sharing their personal stories, the producer plays music to show the vulnerability of each student. The camera scans around the person and the circle. It draws the viewer in and helps pull at heartstrings. Although there is still arguing, a friendship is forming. Feelings never shared before with others are revealed with this new group. Even though individual groups and separation still exists, a new club is formed. These 5 different students from different backgrounds and different cliques now become a part of a new club. They may not be friends outside of the library, but they will always be connected and known as The Breakfast Club.",The Breakfast Club
699,Wolfram-And-Hart,A film about teenagers not just a film with teenagers,10,7 April 2004,"Breakfast Club is about 5 kids who get thrown into detention and over the coarse of the day become friends.We see them first as they are seen by the world,as a brain,an athlete,a basketcase,a princess and a criminal, and they act as you would expect those types of people to,at first.As the day goes on they talk more and bond and share their fears and problems with their fellow inmates.At the end of the day,they go home,leaving us to wonder what would be instore for them on Monday as a result of this experience.There are some odd bits with the dance scene(probably put in to ease the tension)and Ally Sheedy's character getting made over,but it's still enjoyable.A great film with a great message:that everyone has problems and that just because people aren't like you doesn't mean you should give up on them.",The Breakfast Club
700,bananabeetle,Dull - Hasn't Aged Well,3,23 February 2012,"I found this film incredibly dull, hardly anything happens and all the characters are unlikable. I couldn't identify with any of the characters. This film is like Dawson's Creek only without any of the interesting story lines - only the parts where the 'teenagers' (who are blatantly 25+) brood about their lives. I think the reason it has such a high rating is because it was probably good in the 80's, but it certainly has not aged well. I think if anyone reviews it high it is because it gives them that cosy nostalgia feeling. I was born a year after this film was made so unfortunately didn't experience any nostalgia whatsoever.",The Breakfast Club
701,MeBaum05,My favorite movie,10,5 April 2004,"I wasn't even born yet when this movie was released, but I can still relate to it. I think everyone can is some form. What I love about this movie is how, one minute they're arguing, and the next minute they're sitting around telling each other their feelings, then they argue again and yell at eachother, and then they dance. The dancing scene is my favorite part of the movie. If you listen to the words of the song, it really fits with what just happened in ""group therapy"". If you have the DVD and can't understand the lyrics, just put the captions on. I watch this movie all the time, and never get sick of it.

I think anyone of any age or style can relate to this film and take something out of watching it. We all can learn that no matter how opposite you are that doesn't matter. This is John Hughes best film from the 80's and brat pack days. Weather you grew up when this film came out or am seeing it for the first time today, you will love it. It has a little bit of everything; the stoner, the princess, the athlete, the brain, and the basket case. You will be laughing and wondering what is going to happen next while watching. The ending is a great surprise. John Hughes makes detention look fun and gives everyone a little bit of hope for acceptance in the world.",The Breakfast Club

I feel like I'll probably watch it again this year as another biannual keyframe of the formative years. That or I will put the VHS I bought in my dad's garage sale this month and not feel anything.My grandma died at 72 in July. Five months later, my grandpa found his ""soulmate,"" some lady who plays the bongos and does yoga. I ended a 3-year relationship last spring, still in love & happy with him but I got confused about who I was, where I lived and how I wanted to be kissed. My grandma seemed supernal and soft. My grandpa seems brash. They were married somewhere like 50 years. I am coping with confusion concerning loyalty, commitment, fidelity and the permanence of love. I did not see my grandpa cry at my grandma's funeral.1. People talk along with this movie because they know the words and it feels good like it's sentimental and they laugh at the outdated dialogue that isn't funny and they decide who mirrors which character in real life. All the teen girls said I was Allison the first time I watched this movie. I hate college. But it's all part of the ""experience"" (so is college).2. Everyone is upset that Andrew only likes Allison once she is wearing makeup. I think there's too much hate and cold in everyone. If love exists then let it, don't infringe on it.3. It's about you. And everybody. Your heart will die when it gets old, but it's not for lack of trying and it has nothing to do with listlessness.I saw the person who used to be my boyfriend on Saturday to go see The National, who have been as formative as John Hughes (at least to my heart) (I don't know how you felt from the start). I tucked my chin around my shoulder to cry because the chords and transitions sounded so nice in the bottom of my skull but for some reason not because of the emotional weight of the lyrics (it's sort of like not eating even when you're still hungry, or not looking out the window in a window seat on the train, or taking a shower when you don't need one). He left his ticket on the floor of my car but not his empty pop can, expressing only negativity for the past which mocked the nostalgia that used to grow without check. I guess I believed (thanks a lot John Hughes) that we had a ""spark"" unique to each other. The only word I can offer to that ""spark"" today is ""whatever."" And I can see how he got icy. You can pour enough cement on your heart and it dies. There are a billion feelings to address in a hundred different slowcore songs but you know from the place in your stomach that you shouldn't go back there, so you pour cement on your heart and it dies. Nobody is ever going to crack the concrete and that's what makes your first love superlative.On Saturday I felt half-dead, hating rain and lightning while it got all over my window screen in the dark in my room in the corner of my bed with my nose between my knees & I didn't have the drugs to sort it out. It looked just like heaven when I got up to leave. And late last night I slept so easy. I woke up smiling and even danced while I brushed my teeth. I bought orchids for my desk at work. I realized I'm allowed to fall half-in-love with someone I've been half-in-love with all along. I deleted 20 gb of music from my iTunes library and added 30 more. The cement around my heart is concrete and I respect every dead-hearted old person, particularly my ex-boyfriend and my grandfather. If all 600 muscles in your body pulled in one direction, you could lift 25 tons. I think the heart lifts like 24 of those.The priest, at my grandmother's funeral, with my two aunts and uncles and my parents and 2 sisters and my brother and my 5 cousins and my grandpa and I standing in a circle in the back of the church, prayed like a little anchor for all the people inside. He looked right in my eyes and I was shaking a little bit from holding in some sobs and he said ""just cry."" He said we have to mourn right now and confront the fear of feeling (and cry, live in salt) or else it would all come back in a more haunting way. I did let my heart die for my grandma. I guess this morning the blood is all gone from my face and if I were to crack I would collapse but I feel so comfortable in my old dead heart. In 2010 we were driving in the dark by the soccer field & the library and you said if we ever broke up then you wouldn't know what love meant and used ""Say Anything"" as evidence. On Saturday you weren't thinking of that drive but you said, ""I don't know what love is anymore."" I was pent up then but I get it now, I've seen the way that bodies lock and bodies tend to break, and I don't care if I never feel a strong feeling again whether it's good or bad. I would dance to Future Islands even with hollow limbs rather than bleed to Red House Painters forever.",The Breakfast Club
704,pumkinandcherry,"My God, are we gonna be like our parents?",10,14 June 2012,"""My God, are we gonna be like our parents?""...It's the one question that every teenager asks themselves. In John Hughes 1985 drama, The Breakfast Club, five high school students meet in Saturday detention. The brainy Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), the princess, Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), the criminal, John Bender (Judd Nelson), the athlete, Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), and Allison Reynolds, the basket case (Ally Sheedy). From seven in the morning to four in the afternoon the teenagers delve into their problems at home and prove that they're bigger than their respective stereotypes, while trying to evade their villainous principal, Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason). At the beginning of the movie Andrew and John immediately go at it after John mocks him and Brian, and sexually harasses Claire. Gradually the group begins to open up to each other, revealing that they all have unpleasant relationships with their parents. Andrew's father wants him to be a winner, and won't take anything less. Claire's parents use her to get back at one another, while Allison's parents ignore her. John's life at home is full of violence and rage. Brian is seen as the ""perfect kid"", but he is under intense pressure to keep his grades up. The teenagers are then shown together, dancing all over the library, their stereotypes no longer holding them back from one another. The movie has amazing dialog that plays a large part in setting up the characters and gives the movie verisimilitude. Claire (Ringwald) tells Vernon (Gleason) at the beginning of the movie ""Excuse me sir, I think there's been a mistake. I know it's detention, but I don't think I belong in here."" This simple line has a subtle snobby air about it, with a slight hint that she thinks she's better than the people she's with, that the audience can relate to hearing with the own popular kids in their school. When Vernon asks if the kids care to return to detention Brian (Hall) stands up and says ""Uh, you know I can answer that now sir. That'd be a no, no for me."" Being the nerd, this line makes it look like Brian is trying to get on Vernon's good side, which is stereotypical of the ""nerd"" type, always being the teachers favorite. Bender's (Nelson) dialog in the movie is constantly sarcastic and mocking, which makes the audience believe that he really is the one kid that doesn't care about school and is always getting into some sort of trouble. An example of this is when he asks Vernon ""Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?"" This quote makes people think back to the ""dropout"" or ""burner"" they knew in high school, the one who was always getting into some sort of trouble. The same type of verisimilitude is given off when Andrew, the jock (Estevez), tells Brian ""You ask me one more question and I'm beating the sh*t out of you."" This line shows the typical jock, the one that uses his fists to settle things and scare people. Another wonderful aspect of the movie is the costume design for the characters. The costume design seems to fit perfectly to the type of stereotype each of the actors is playing. Allison (Sheedy), the basket case, is wearing something that looks like ""bag lady clothes"". She has on really baggy clothes that are dark colors. Her hair is slightly disheveled and she has very dark eyeliner. Her clothes make her blend into the background, which adds to her being a sort of recluse. Claire looks like the standard rich prep, with an expensive leather jacket and diamond earrings. Her makeup is light and pretty and she has a sort of innocent look about her. She looks very put together with a skirt and a light pink shirt paired with boots. The audience can tell that she definitely comes from a family that has money. Bender, the criminal, has a grungy look to him. He has an overcoat, leather biker gloves, with black combat boots that have bandannas tied around them. He has a jean jacket over a half unbuttoned plaid shirt. His hair is long and carefree. He looks like someone you wouldn't want to mess with. Brian looks like a typical nerd. He has a respectable haircut with khakis and a green sweater. He has an air of innocence while you know that he's the one sitting in the front of the class hanging onto the teacher's every word. The jock, Andrew, comes in with his wrestling letterman jacket on, displaying loudly and proudly that he is an athlete. Under that he just wears jeans with a muscle shirt, showing off his toned biceps. All of the costumes pull together, yet while being completely different at the same time. Overall, this film is one of my favorite films of all time, and was an instant hit with me. I loved the witty dialog, the characters, the setting, everything. The one aspect that really stuck with me was how I could completely relate to almost every character in the film, knowing at least one person who acted in the exact same manner. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who is in high school, or who has ever been in high school. On my list, The Breakfast Club will always be a 10 out of 10.",The Breakfast Club
705,plunkette97,Still Relevant Today!,9,3 January 2018,"Honestly went to watch this movie and expected something that wasn't going to live up to the hype, or was just going to be another dull teenage flick. I was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't, it's an actual good movie that lives up to all the hype that was given to it, and for an older movie, it's even better because it's still relevant in today's society (maybe more so than ever).The film takes place all in one school where five teenagers have been put in detention on a Saturday for their own reasons, which will be revealed as the film continues (some reasons more sad than others). Even with this limited space, most of it being in the library, the film does not dull. It uses everything around them to the best of their advantage and having such big personalities in the movie helped keep the movie interesting! Some moments are kind of played out a few too many times, like the fights between Claire and John (note 9/10 and not 10/10)Overall loved the atmosphere of the movie and the actors in it were brilliant in their respective rolls.

This movie is still relevant even almost 30 years later. The Breakfast Club is a must-see movie, and it will be sure not to disappoint. The movie will make you laugh and it might even jerk a few tears. The characters in the movie will relate to every person that has ventured through the tough and confusing years of high school.

707,jamesfbhull,Breaking down stereotypes,10,15 September 2012,"The Breakfast Club is a new classic that is holding up well to the test of time. The film revolves around five teenagers; Emillio Estevez as a wrestling star, Anthony Michael Hall as Brian Johnson straight ""A"" student, Judd Nelson as John Bender the thug with a criminal past, Molly Ringwald as Claire Standish the popular princess, and Ally Sheedy as Allison Reynolds the anti-social basket case. These five teenagers are forced to attend an 8 hour Saturday school for their various crimes against the school. These five individuals, deprived of contact from their normal social groups, are forced to communicate with each other. During this communication they learn that they are not so different after all. They learn that each person is an individual with their own individual struggles and difficulties. The movie tries to break down stereotypes and show the viewer that you can't always judge someone based solely on what group you identify them as belonging to. It strives to show us that you need to past the stereotype to find the individual underneath. Just like his movie Pretty in Pink Director John Hughes tries to teach us about looking past first impressions to find the real person. Hughes uses several key points in the story to show us the friendship developing among this group. The first scene is when Bender removes a screw from the door causing it to slam shut and not remain open. This causes the view of the room to be obstructed allowing the group freedom to move about the room. When the group is confronted about why the door is closed they chose silence and risk getting in trouble instead of telling on bender. One of the most telling scenes is when the group has snuck out of the detention room to retrieve pot from John Benders locker. After one of the most frustrating scenes in the movie, a Scooby doo like chase in the hallways, with rapid shots showing the group trying to escape the principal, Mr. Vernon, played by Paul Gleason. The group realizes that they are trapped and cannot successfully manage to return to the room without getting caught. Bender then decides to take the fall for the whole group and runs down the halls making a huge ruckus in order to distract the Mr. Vernon. Bender, despite his reputation as a bad boy criminal, shows his friendship for this new group of individuals by protecting them from trouble. Hughes also used space to bring the group together in the mind of the audience. In most of the shots he has it lined up so that when one actor is the focus of a particular moment, there is always another actor in frame. The way the group sits in the library for detention. He is always trying to bring them closer together. I think the film itself best describes the theme of the movie. ""The film itself outright states the theme of the movie at the end ""You see us as you want to see us, in the simplest terms and most convenient definitions. But what we have found out is that each of us is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal"" """,The Breakfast Club

It's an epic chronicle of the forced meeting among all of the cliques of high school and general life. But even more so, it is the ballad of the merging of personalities, the dissolution of social and mental boundaries, and the siren song of being accepted. In The Breakfast Club, nothing exists for the characters on that Saturday other than what's happening at that school. Parents don't matter for that day.

711,taylorgraef,The Breakfast Club,9,19 February 2013,"""Five strangers with nothing in common, except each other."" Located on the front cover of The Breakfast Club, this quote is a good summary of the movie. Five high school students: the Jock, the Criminal, the Princess, the Brain, and the Basket Case, with no similarities are stuck with each other during a Saturday detention. As the day starts out they do not associate with one another at all, but by the end of the day they all became friends. And to us they became known as: The Breakfast Club, a must see classic film that I would recommend to anyone. The entire movie setting took place all in one Saturday morning detention being almost completely dialogue-driven. John Hughes, the writer and director, does a great job of making it stand out as one of the classics. The Breakfast Club takes on two of the most critical of teen dilemmas: stereotypes and personal identity. Hughes had a number of other high school age movie successes in the 80s such as Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The Breakfast Club, however, has been deemed one of the best high school movies of all time by critics and also one of Hughes' greatest works. The movie has an all-star cast with five members of the famous ""Brat Pack."" Molly Ringwald (the Princess), Ally Sheedy (the Basket Case), Judd Nelson (the Criminal), Anthony Michael Hall (the Brain), and Emilio Estevez (the Jock) star in this motion picture and made it one of the most memorable movies with their outstanding performances. The actors did a wonderful job of taking on their very specific roles by portraying the stereotypical students that every high school in America can identify with. One of the most intriguing parts of the movie was when the students asked each other why they were in detention the audience learned a lot about each character and teens in general. The film also has one of the most memorable soundtracks from the 1980's with such songs as ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"". It plays at the end of the movie and delivers the message of this film about being able to be friends with each other despite our differences or our backgrounds. The Breakfast Club had a major influence on pop culture in the 80s and still continues to influence films today such as Easy A and Pitch Perfect almost thirty years later. The Breakfast Club has one of the most memorable endings a film can have as well. It gives the audience a new perspective on teen dilemmas. In the end, the characters are faced with a tough reality and ultimately the audience is left to assume the future of the students. This film influences the viewers (mainly teens) to step away from the status quo like the ""Breakfast Club"" proved was possible.",The Breakfast Club
712,stein-alay,John Hughes' The Breakfast Club is mellow but memorable,8,19 February 2013,"America's 1980s film scene witnessed the teenage comedy fever spread faster than the plague, each director fighting to find the new best cure; and when America asked for a miracle doctor, John Hughes was there with Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Sixteen Candles, and possibly the most memorable teen comedy of all with the birth of the 'Brat pack', The Breakfast Club. In his 1985 film, The Breakfast Club, John Hughes uses a humdrum plot as a backdrop for the most memorable character development and enduring life lessons in cinematic history. I remember once someone explaining to me that ""The Breakfast Club is one of those movies where nothing really happens, but somehow at the end, everything is different"". The film begins with a collection of stereotyped teenagers sharing a Saturday in detention at their suburban Chicago high school. Though the kids find ways to break as many of Principal Vernon's rules as possible, nothing else really happens. Still, it's hard to walk away from this film without feeling the emotional change the five main characters (labeled throughout the movie as the brain, the princess, the athlete, the criminal and the basket case), experience by prodding at each others' personal lives and stumbling upon surprising similarities. From the start, Bender (actor Judd Nelson) plays the criminal, antagonizing his co-stars with mean jabs and persuading them to join him in outlandish misbehaviors. Several times throughout the movie, Bender and his detention mates: Brian the brain (Anthony Michael Hall), Claire the princess (Molly Ringwald), Andrew the athlete (Emilio Estevez) and Allison the basket case (Ally Sheedy), take turns in shouting matches and conflict ridden discussion only to find that they come from similar backgrounds and situations. Hughes' intense emotional scenes engage the audience and encourage a reconsideration of how we view those around us. The Breakfast Club is a gripping insight on high school stereotypes and how the expectations and pressure from the outside world can keep one from being who they really want to be. ""I hate it. I hate having to go along with everything my friends say,"" Claire, the princess, declares after the group discusses how everything will just go back to normal on Monday. But by the end of the day, Hughes has used everything from new relationships to the students' clothing to show how the group has broken the stereotypes they held in the morning when they walked into detention. Unlike many teen comedies of the decade, The Breakfast Club takes no risks with an ambitious plot. However, such a basic plot line is the perfect setting for the strong development undergone by these not-so-basic teenage characters, who find comfort in crossing the lines that have been drawn for them. John Hughes finds huge success in this 'Brat Pack' classic whose lessons are still relevant more than two decades later.",The Breakfast Club

This is one of the top 5 80's movies in my opinion and it's in my top 10 list of all movies. Great cast, great characters, very well done! Some people I know who have seen the movie feel closterphobic because it's done mostly in one room and never leaves the school (except for the opening and closing credits). This is the same kind of reaction I've gotten from watching and knowing people who have watched ""Panic Room."" However, it wasn't the same for me. Don't let the one setting deter you from watching or liking the movie. It is done very well and there's plenty of ""room"" for their antics and mischief.",The Breakfast Club

I really enjoyed the argument as well the the dialogs. Not to mention the original soundtrack, particularly the ending.

715,programgame,The film The Breakfast Club directed by John Hughes is one of the best 80s movies I have ever seen.,8,4 May 2013,"The film The Breakfast Club directed by John Hughes is one of the best 80s movies I have ever seen, with the exception of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The character and story development was superbly done without sacrificing the pace of the film. The film was centered on a coming of age theme where the young characters become more mature and discover how their actions affect other while trying to break away from the stereotypes that have been placed on them by their peers. The movie centered on the development of five main characters, with each having a different stereotype applied to them, while spending Saturday detection with one another. Emilio Estevez was the ""athlete"" Andrew Clark, Anthony Michael Hall was the ""brain"" Brian Johnson, Judd Nelson was the ""criminal"" John Bender, Molly Ringwald was the ""princess"" Claire Standish, and Ally Sheedy was the ""basket case"" Allison Reynolds. When the movie starts each of these characters is introduced with these stereotypes and at first they defend these roles that society has determined that they fit into. John the criminal is the main catalyst in the movie for the other characters to start to examine their roles in life and how following these roles effects themselves and others. He acts out and forces the others into conversations and taking action, when they would have just kept to themselves for the entire detention. John forces the characters to rethink the way they act and the reasons for their actions. I love how this mechanic is used to develop the characters in the story.Each character finds that what that the roles they have taken where a result of their parents, and other peers pressure placed upon them and that they are deeply unhappy with their lives. The criminal John finds that he does not happy with hiding his emotions through violence and vandalism and emotionally opens up through the film. Clair the princess comes to the realization that she is not happy with being forced into such a culturally restive life and wants to be a more carefree person. Ally the basket case is tired of being rejected and ignored by her parents and fellow students and learns that she can still have meaningful social relationships with others. Andrew the athlete learns that it is OK to be weak and Brian the brain learns that he does not have to be academically perfect. In the end each of these characters becomes more emotionally mature fitting in with the theme of the movie.However, the best part of the movie for me was that the ending was open to the viewers. Each of the characters went their separate ways after the detention, leaving with the thoughts of Clair's statement that when they get back to school peer pressure will force them back into their roles and they will all cease to be friends. This makes the viewer determine if the he or she think that the characters have become mature enough to overcome this flaw.",The Breakfast Club
716,thompw02,This film is a classic 80's comedy,9,5 May 2013,"The Breakfast Club is a 1985 comedy directed by John Hughes. It has several well known actors/actresses such as Emilio Estevez (Andrew), Judd Nelson (Bender), Ally Sheedy (Allison), Anthony Michael Hall (Brian) and Mollie Ringwald (Claire). The basics of the story is that five kids from different social circles are stuck together for Saturday detention. Through out the day they have their spats and differences, but in the end they discover they are a lot alike in many ways despite different backgrounds. They are a bunch of kids who are in that transitional point in life where they want to be treated like adults, but they still don't quite act the part.Throughout the film you see the idea of opposites attracting slowly start to take shape. By the end, the stereotypical straight- laced jock, Andrew, finds himself taken by the oddball and emotional basket case Allison. At the same time, the popular girl Claire falls for the bad boy Bender. In the mix Brian emerges with four new friends who don't fit into his normal social circle of highly intelligent ""nerds"". Along with everything else that is going on, you have the assistant principal, Dick Vernon, who is played by Paul Gleason. He plays the roll of the typical assistant principal in that he comes off as a wannabe tough guy who isn't going to ""take any crap"" from punk school kids. Hating the idea that he has to spend his Saturday at school watching after them, he is going to go out of his way to make them as miserable as he is. A very obvious aspect of the film was costumes. You knew before the story really got started what kind of personalities the characters were going to have just by the clothes they were wearing. Ally Sheedy with her frumpish look, Emilio Estevez in his letter-man jacket and Mollie Ringwald with her designer outfit. They didn't even have to speak and you knew what kind of people they were going to be. It all added to the different people from different social circles aspect of the film. The film also captured a very good cross section of 80's popular culture in many ways. Some of those included, again, the clothing worn, hairstyles, vocabulary and the music. To this day, if someone who was born in the 90's or later wants to know what the 80's were like, I tell them to watch either the Breakfast club or a another movie that was similar in a lot of ways, Fast Times At Ridgemont High.",The Breakfast Club

718,nachi-marine,An tribute to DETENTION,10,25 July 2013,This really an awesome movie and i recommend it to all people.the story basis on five high school students making their detention period of one day to know not each other but about them in common. Really an classy movie to watch and the characterization is simply awe full... Thanks to director John Hughes for this master piece .I watched lots and lots of movies but this one makes me feel uneasy on the fact that it revolves around our life story. Excellent performance given by all cast members especially Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall ) and Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy ).overall its a good time to spend to watch this movie and all the modern day parents are recommended to watch.,The Breakfast Club
719,gallag07,An 80's Classic,10,4 August 2013,"Director John Hughes created a timeless film about five high school students and one day of detention. The typical stereotypes of high school are represented by each character: the athlete, Andrew Clark, played by Emilio Estevez; the brain, Brian Johnson, played by Anthony Michael Hall; the criminal, John Bender, played by Judd Nelson; the princess, Claire Standish, played by Molly Ringwald; and the basket case, Allison Reynolds, played by Ally Sheedy.Detention begins with each person believing the stereotypes strictly define themselves as well as the others around them. Principal Richard Vernon, played by Paul Gleason, has them write a paper describing who they think they are. As they address each of the roles they ""play"" in school they grow to realize each role is the same in some way or another. As students they have all been cast in every role at some point or another in their lives. Similarly in Mean Girls, the characters learn that they fit in each of the stereotypes produced in a high school setting, despite the original role they were given by their peers. By the end of the movie the kids have figured out that they are not against each other because it's who they are but rather protagonists and antagonists for each other because of the role they have been cast in. In the end they have reached a friendship that is for them to share even though it may not be seen in the halls of the school. The use of dialog and a single shoot location create the real feeling of high school and thus the characters. Hughes allowed the actors to ad lib and create much of their own dialog, giving each actor the ability to pull from their own experiences, making it a more authentic experience for the audience. The simplicity of one location, a high school library, forces the audience to focus on the stories being told and the characters themselves. Each of us can relate in some way or knows someone like each of the characters that Hughes introduces us to in this amazing film. More than likely each of us can see ourselves in each of them. In the paper that Brian ultimately writes he echoes that sentiment, that each of them are an athlete, a brain, a criminal, a princess, and a basket case.",The Breakfast Club
720,manicmoviereviews,"Great movie, a little outdated but worth watching.",8,5 September 2013,"So, The Breakfast Blub... what can i say. The breakfast club was a 1985 film written and directed by John Hughes starry Molly Ringwald as the sensitive yet independent character Claire. Anthony Michael Hall as the stereo typical 80's nerd, Brian. Emillio Estevez as the high school Jock. Ally Sheedy as the weird, eccentric girl Claire. and Judd Nelson as the total asshole, *cough cough* i mean tough bully with a hard life, John bender.So what does The Breakfast Club have to offer as a film. Well aside from the cheesy 80's dance scenes, it has a fair amount to offer. Not only is the breakfast club and entertaining film to watch, it is also one of those films you can watch over, and over again, and not get bored. I'm looking at you, The Good ,The Bad and The Ugly. So the film starts with an interesting opening, depicting all the characters and their possible attributes and personalities. Like just by the way Claire is treated in this situation, the situation being that all the teens are to be kept in solitude on a Saturday in school for their own personal reasons. All of which are revealed later on in the film. The teen 'misfits' are all then greeted by the stuck up school principal, Richard Vernon, played by Paul Gleeson, best known for his role in film, die hard as Police chief Dwayne t. Robinson. The kids are then directed into what i can presume is a library or study hall, and told to write an essay on who they are and why they are there. So then begins the next 1 hour and 20 minutes of the most unforgettable films of all time. Oh wait, you wanted a more in depth look at what happens in the film, well to put it simply...John's a perv, Claire is annoying, Alison likes cereal sandwiches, Andrew has feelings, Brian is a virgin, Carl is well, just Carl... They all get high,a cheesy 80's dance scene, Richard get's annoyed at coffee, John's a bad ass, and they lived happily ever after...and did you know that the joke john tells while in the ceiling has no punch-line and that he just ad-libbed it on the spot.But overall, it's a good movie. Okay, in my opinion, it's no stand by me or Shawshank but it rules pretty high. The characters are relatable and the general atmosphere created by them it truly wonderful. It's as if you want the movie to go on see the characters even more and keep on enjoying it but, you know what they say, all good things must come to an end.My only complaint about the film is the fact that it is outdated a little. In fact, quite a lot outdated. Now i usually stand by a strong rule that true classic movies can never be outdated, like the original King Kong, we have a new one but the old one will, in at least my eyes always remain better. It's an popular opinion, yes but i stand by it. However there is certain trends that usually die out in that certain era, such as happy and innocent rap. I don't think I've seen a rap song that doesn't have swearing in it from around 1999 onward. The breakfast club dwells on it's trendy time period a lot. And i mean a lot... But you could always argue that it was popular then and that's all that matters. But just been warned when going in to this film, there is a lot of it. However, having there will always be a sweet charm in 80's dance music that will never die out. Okay i maybe on my own on that but, i digress, The breakfast club will remain a special place in my heart which only cake and Sporks will fill. one last fact. Did you know that Nicholas Cage was originally cast for the role of John Bender.",The Breakfast Club
721,kelcie-baker-carroll,The Uncanny Revelations of Saturday Detention: The Breakfast Club,10,2 October 2013,"The Breakfast Club, written and directed by John Hughes in 1985, has an award-winning cast that will blow any audience away, young or old. The film encompasses all of the different characteristics that compose the never ending clique-oriented aspects of high school including the jock, the emotionally conflicted rebel, the thief, prom queen, and (of course) the brain. Locked in a room together for the majority of their Saturday afternoon in detention they discover that maybe the theories they had about another are actually conceived by false interpretations they have developed based on biased opinions of their own secluded cliques and family backgrounds. They learn they have more in common with another than they had ever imagined.Andy (Emilio Estevez), Brian (Anthony Hall), John (Judd Nelson), Claire (Molly Ringwald), and Allison (Ally Sheedy) are shoved in a room together when their curiosity gets the best of them, questions fester, and fights begin. By isolating them Hughes gives them a chance to understand that everyone faces tribulations that may compare to peers, but each individual has different ways of getting past trials. Some steal, some focus on school, some work hard to impression the hard-headed, and others revert to a shell for safety. By doing this, Hughes shows that every person is different, but everyone has things in common. People cannot find the similarities unless they break free of preconceived notions and open their mind to new possibilities. This movie sparked a specific interest to me because of its barrier-breaking theme. Being the sap I was in high school I reverted to books and movies to understand the trials I was facing. I always saw people as people and never understood the concept of cliques or seclusion, so to see a movie that broke through those perceptions poked at my curiosity. To get an inside look at the idea of relationships based upon individualism and not social stature captured my interest immediately. I love this movie, what it promotes, and stands for. John Hughes picked a great cast and did a phenomenal job making this movie. Movie goers who haven't seen it purchase it now!",The Breakfast Club
722,payton07,The Breakfast Club,5,3 November 2013,"In John Hughes' 1985 film, ""The Breakfast Club,"" several teens at their local high school have been subjected to a Saturday detention in the school's library. From all different walks of life, the film continues to come back to the idea that being an individual is okay as each student is forced to spend the day with each other in this detention setting. The kids all have the typical high school stereotypes, such as: the bully (Judd Nelson), the cheerleader (Molly Ringwold) and the jock (Emilio Estevez). These kids all spend the day exploring the different things and characteristics in each other that all make them different and all make them alike. In the end, even though they all have their misconceptions, stereotypes and disagreements with each other, they all gain a better understanding of the next going forward from their time together. This film in a lot of ways can be compared to the X-Men film series from the standpoint of the characters in each movie take turns understanding what makes them the same and what makes them different. The X-Men, while all mutants, take a lot of time understanding what makes each mutant different from the next, including powers, geography and age. ""The Breakfast Club,"" while not nearly as fictional as the X- men films, takes the same kind of perspective with these high school kids without the action and violence. Angles are particularly important in this movie, because there are certain scenes that have to catch a facial expression without dialogue and without soundtrack. The expression may be in relationship to an action being performed by another character(s) and is most prevalent in Nelson's character. He spends a lot of time in the beginning scenes making the facial expression and following it up with criticism of the character that he is making the facial expression at. Lighting in this movie is not nearly as detailed but is equally important. Because the film's setting is a school, there has to be very bright lighting throughout the movie, because that is the way that most schools are lit. The bright lighting helps give the viewer the feel that they are truly in that setting with the film's characters. In the end, the characters learn more than they had ever imagined about each other, experiencing their quirks and hearing their stories. The turn those misconceptions, stereotypes and disagreements, and turn them in to understanding.",The Breakfast Club

I was just about 5 when this movie first came out, but as I've gotten older, every time I see it, I think it's a classic from a good time in my life growing up. I think it's part of a dying breed of movies where people can actually act. Look at movies nowadays.... Just a bunch of special effects, and pretty crappy acting, if you even want to call it that. Watching this movie kind of gives you a good idea on how different the lifestyles and backgrounds are of people you hardly ever come in contact with now, let alone the ones you never even meet. I don't know what you think about it, but it's just a really good movie. I can't say that about a whole lot of movies that have come out of the 80's.",The Breakfast Club

725,sarahthompson6959,The Breakfast Club,8,16 February 2014,"Picture it, the quarterback and the captain of the cheerleading squad, the ""ideal"" high school couple or maybe the Student Council President and the Valedictorian. There are preconceived notions in high school that have to be maintained. Now let's throw in a plot twist; welcome to The Breakfast Club, it consists of a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Not your clichéd friends by any means, but this is who find themselves spending much unwanted time together. The Breakfast Club is a must-see movie that will send you back to the glory days of high school. We all lived it. We all knew these people. We all can relate. Five very different high school students, each representing their own typical group of the 80's, spend their Saturday in detention. With the common high school cliques being broken, the jock, the nerd, the glamour girl, the loner and the druggy are forced to coexist. As the movie progresses, the changes in plot demonstrate the typical stereotypes becoming broken. It is emphasized that the students aren't as different as they seem. They all have pressures from their home life and stressors at school. Throughout the day as they try to avoid their overbearing principal, the student's bonds strengthen due to the disintegrating stereotypes, to the point that they all end up leaving detention as one. Strong relationships are made and the people who are least likely to remain friends find relationships, as the students realize each other's personal problems tie them all together. The excellent acting in the movie allows the changes in stereotypes to reach full potential. Judd Nelson embodies Carl, the bad boy druggy, and owns the part. One moment he has you laughing, the next crying, and the next making you want to knock him square in the face. His mysterious trickery allows him to pull information out of his fellow classmates that most would, by no means, even consider asking. He encompasses the attitude associated with his character, haggling all of the other students and pushing the exact buttons to set them off. His physicality is superb; he becomes up close and personal, breaking respected bubbles. Whether he is arguing with the demanding principal or jamming out on the top of the sculpture in the library, he leaves you wanting more, discovering sides to him that you never knew existed. With many of the roles being very credible including parts played by Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy, the principal, Paul Gleason, seemed to fall short in some scenes, especially during his argument with Nelson. When Nelson was questioning authority Gleason states, ""I'm begging you, take a shot. Just one hit."" This is a phrase that could be very intimidating, but the acting did not hold up to the line. The phrase could have been said with much more gusto and anger behind it, making the principal sound threatening; unfortunately there was no acting there to assist in his cause. Regardless, the stellar acting by the five students help make up for the principal, who only plays a supporting role in the movie. The leads did a fabulous job portraying their characters and owning their parts, stepping up to the plate and hitting a home run. With its fantastic plot line and characters, The Breakfast Club is a movie set apart from the rest. Yes, it is different, but different is good. It is a much needed change from your usual high-school aged movie. Due to its contradicting plot line of character portrayal, you won't want to stop watching. You will want to discover their story and how the students changed in their day-long adventure. Don't you forget about The Breakfast Club!",The Breakfast Club
726,chack0329,The Breakfast Club,9,18 February 2014,"The Breakfast Club, a perfect display of the shenanigans and relative life stories of kids in an ""unsupervised"" detention. This classic 1985 film from director John Hughes shatters social barriers and cliques that still exist in schools today. This film not only teaches life lessons, but also provides a good laugh. From the phenomenal storyline to the top-notch acting, this movie receives a definite thumbs-up.The story begins with five high school teenagers, each coming from a different clique within Shermer High School, spending an entire Saturday in detention together. There is Andy, the jock (Emilio Estevez); Claire, the princess (Molly Ringwald); John, the delinquent (Judd Nelson); Allison, the basket-case (Ally Sheedy); and Brian, the brain (Anthony Michael Hall). They all know nothing about each other, and while in detention are expected to write an essay explaining who they think they are as people. Soon they realize that they are not really sure who they are, and that even though they aren't from the same cliques, they are more alike than they had originally thought.Each actor sells their role perfectly as a high school student. From their body language to their facial expressions, they all suit the role of a teenage adolescent perfectly. Judd Nelson plays a great ""criminal"" in school with his extremely laid-back body language, giving even more support to his don't-care attitude. Then there is Emilio Estevez playing the jock, Andy, and his macho man athlete status. Estevez's monotone voice and his ability to show no fear from his facial expressions contributes to his status of the ""big man on campus"", and that is a credit to Estevez as an actor. These are only two small examples, as the entire cast does a wonderful job.Not only do the actors put on a superb performance, but the plot of the film is excellent, basically tearing down all social norms in schools in 1985, norms that are still present today. Stereotypically, jocks don't get along with nerds, and troublemaker-tough-guys like Bender don't really get along with well, anyone. It's interesting in this movie to see how a little turmoil between characters can be solved with just a little conversation, and of course with a little help from some marijuana smoked in the school library.This movie has it all; laughs, crazy antics, and all the drama of high school cliques. With great acting, and an amazing storyline, it's hard to find a reason not to see this movie. It is so easy to relate to since most people already know the experience of high school and the certain social groups, or eventually will know someday. The Breakfast Club is a prime example of how difficult it is to really know everything about someone, and how closely people's lives can be related, no matter where they come from. This film has a funny way of teaching valuable life lessons, and also gives an idea of maybe how tolerance of others can help bring people together. There is no doubt that this movie is a must-see, and is absolutely worth the time.",The Breakfast Club

Actually, you tend to like everybody the more you see of the movie - by getting to know them so sincere.

And it's not that predictable either. Sure, you might possibly figure some things out after a while - but it's not a movie that works like that.

The five students who got stuck in a room for seven hours on Saturday morning, a teacher who asked them to write an essay about themselves, and a cleaning man are the only characters that contribute a verse to the movie. I expected the movie to be far-fetched as the main characters have nothing in common. I, however, was quite fascinated by the plot. Each character has strong individuality, and it makes the story unpredictable. Also, it had such a good cast; the acting is so outstanding that I was actually infatuated with the story. Not to mention the memorable soundtrack. Though the movie is set in believable situation and it was shot only at a school, songs like 'We are not alone' and 'Don't you forget about me' keep you hooked on the breakfast club. Besides the cast and the soundtrack, what I appreciate the most in this movie is the message that's hidden. The Breakfast Club conveys a message ""Your problem might not be your problem."" You may understand what it means if you give this classic teen film a try. You won't believe this film was released 30 years ago. The message still is realistic enough to impress today's teenagers.I highly recommend watching this movie. I promise it won't let you get bored.",The Breakfast Club

It had such a perfect blend of romance, comedy, drama, and great characterization. Every character was so well developed, I felt like I knew each one personally when the movie was over. Each performance is amazing, but I really enjoyed Ally Sheedy's portrayal of Allison. She managed to be the comic relief and give a highly convincing dramatic performance all in the same movie. I think that every teen should see this movie because it shows high school in such a raw and real way without being melodramatic. Although it is unlikely that a princess, brain, jock, criminal, and basket case would really put aside their differences and become friends, it looks very convincing on screen.

733,Ddrake36,Movie Review,10,2 December 2014,"Dondra Drake English 111 Carly Smith 29 November 2014 The Breakfast Club""I have such a deep admiration for guys that roll around on the floor with other guys"" is said by John Bender in the 1985 classic movie ""The Breakfast Club"", directed by John Hughes. This inspirational film gives examples of hardships teenagers go through on a daily basis and it consists of six characters of whom only five are the main objective. These characters play roles from being popular to being a criminal and shows a great perspective on the true aspects of lives for teenagers. The demographics of the film gives a realistic point of view expressing each character's home life as being unsatisfying and emotionally undetached, creating a way for teenagers to cry out for help.The setting of the movie takes place in a high school library where the characters are being punished with Saturday detention for not following school rules, each having different situations. Each character plays a role that some might say ""fits the teenage image"" and is described as ""the brain, the athlete, the basket case, the princess, and the criminal."" This film gives the audience an inside view of adolescents with different aspects of themselves; however, they come together with a common issue of emotional neglect from their parents. They start off enemies and by the end of the movie are bonded on an emotional level that surpasses the anger and insecurities they had in the beginning.Brian, played by Michael Anthony Hall, shows an example of what life is like as the ""brain,"" but is completely withdrawn from himself as his parents push him for perfection. Perfection is expected from the ""Athlete"" in Andy, played by Emilio Estevez. His father beats into him the macho, narcissistic world of high school sports, and Andy is lacking in constant approval. Parents fighting against one another puts Claire, played by Molly Ringwald, the ""princess,"" who is constantly seeking her parent's approval as they pin her against one another due to their anger towards each other. John, played by Judd Nelson, is ""criminalized"" in school as the delinquent to get attention other than the anger and physical abuse of his parents. The void and despair of feeling alone of being forgotten about by her parents, Allison, played by Ally Sheedy, is a ""basket case"" trying to fill the absence of acknowledgement by creating her own world where she is recognized and spoken to.Seeking approval from the parental role model is the main issue in this movie that each teenager is facing. However having a principal that is an antagonistic role model towards these teenagers shows the true reasoning on why teenagers react the way they do and seek the approval they desire to show their importance in life. Mr. Richard Vernon, played by Paul Gleason, was the hardcore shell of a principal that made it obvious that he expected more out of the ""popular"" teenagers of the group and bullied the ""criminal."" Many teenagers today experience the same aspect of this movie by feeling it to be ""close to heart"" facing the many difficulties in their own lives. This film shows people that bullying and finding approval for themselves has always been an issue in today's world; however, teenagers are less likely to reach out to others to find the help they deserve and consider committing suicide to be ""the only way out."" Bullying is a huge issue today not just by other children but from adults as well.The true inspiration of this movie is to not see the funny side of it or the fact that ""cliques"" do exist, but to see that all people including teenagers seek approval for being who they want to be. Each character of the film shows a different type of person who does play a real role in humanity and who feels the everyday pressure of wanting to feel accepted by anyone. My personal experience as a teenager is expressed very highly through this movie. I had constant worries about being considered in the ""clique"" that I so desired to be a part of. I lived with fear daily of letting down my teammates on the cheer squad I worked hard towards to be a part of to an extinct of being someone that I really was not. In my teen years, suicide was not mentioned nor an option, and I learned to stop seeking approval by becoming the person I am today. Being proud of who I am will be the true inspiration I give to all children that I teach in the future and the guidance this movie gives will help children and teenagers to see the realization that what they feel does not make them alone.",The Breakfast Club

Those who say this film is too ""overrated"" and ""too emotional"" or ""does not say anything"" you are completely wrong. This film will show you everything it is like to be a teen and I bet if you look back you can see that. 
They take things very seriously and the breakfast club sums up that and also how their whole life is a popularity contest or trying to make your parents proud. 
It's all about how five totally different teenagers are chucked together and changes each other's life. I bet if you went into a school today you would see the exact same people just with different clothes and phones shoved in their hands. This film teaches about teenagers and how they are not really those horrible teens making all that noise on the end of your road, no it shows you that they will take things too seriously and they think that they're life's are hopless.

First off, 3 guys, 2 girls, all pretty much one step above the caricatures in Archie Comics, as well as your cardboard cut-out mean principal, have to spend a Saturday at school in detention. Oh yeah, they're all white, heterosexual. They're able to get the door to the library closed so that the meanie principal can't see them. Clearly, the principal never heard about putting a chair or a garbage can, to keep the door propped open, or just bringing his work and sitting with the students. Then the principal occasionally checks in on them, including one scene where the school ne'er-do-well hides under the desk of the pretty girl and performs cunnilingus on her. Think about it: Random stranger is able to hide under a desk in a school, perform oral sex on a girl he just met, and it's supposed to be realistic? Funny? How about just plain unbelievable, offensive and one-step-away from being called rape. The ending has the nutty girl getting a make-over, and now she's popular enough to catch the eye of the popular jock! And the loser guy is now the popular girl's boyfriend! And ... you get it.

736,dazzle162,Must be 43 times now...,10,5 January 2006,"I have just watched the Breakfast Club for what must be the forty third time, if I remember rightly. And I loved it just as much as when I first saw it, two months ago.Being a typical teenager, (aged 13) I was actually sceptical to see this film. It has what I think is probably the most inappropriate name for such a good film. In fact, when a friend suggested I watched it, I believed it to be a club, where people went to eat breakfast.I don't know whether it's the simple but heart tearing dialogues throughout the movie, the obvious attracting vibes running through four of the characters, or the amazing long scene where they are coming down from the cannabis, but something in this movie means that when I watch it, I can still feel the tensions between them just as I did the first time I saw it.Not only giving a star performance, all five teenagers put their heart and soul into their performances, and it really shows. They have striking differences, but still they manage to come together as the breakfast club in the end.Also adding a sinister feel is the corrupted principal of the school, who takes it upon himself to be rude to all the students, and in particular Bender. Adding a random but amusing character is the Janitor, who struck me also as rather sinister, when he revealed that he spied on all of the students when they least expected it, and went through their lockers.I thought this was an absolutely amazing film, and will probably remain one of my favourites for a very long time. When the end came, I insisted on watching it again and again, because its endless dialogue was never wasted. I would recommend this to anyone, as it is a great movie, and I would love it if there had been a sequel. As it is, all the actors are now in their forties, so it probably wouldn't have the same teenage effect.",The Breakfast Club
737,lucas-hooks,The Breakfast Club Synopsis and Review,8,23 February 2015,"It is a Saturday at Sherman High School and five students have earned the ""privilege"" of an all-day session of detention. The group consists of five differing, yet common, high school stereotypes. There is the jock (Emilio Estevez), the nerd (Anthony Michael Hall), the rich girl (Molly Ringwald), the troublemaker (Judd Nelson), and the ""weird"" girl. (Ally Sheedy). The teens have all earned themselves a full day of detention by means of their different personalities. The day begins with Principal Vernon (Paul Gleason) harshly laying down the laws of the day, one of which involves the students writing an essay about who the students think they are. The rest of the day revolves around the group's boredom which leads to personality clashes along with mischief. The personality clashes lead to verbal altercations between members of the group while the mischief includes an array of activities from theft to recreational drug use and everything in between. No one in the group is spared the bullying brought on by his or her high school clique. The arguments are largely instigated by the troublemaker who initially targets the rich girl. When the jock comes to her defense, he too is added to the verbal assault. The nerd initially attempts to keep the peace which, in turn, earns him his share of the bullying. The ""weird"" girl says nothing for the first half of the movie but baffles the rest of the group by her gross habits and actions. As the movie progresses the altercations between the students begin to make them realize that perhaps they are not as different as they think. As the movie comes toward its end, the students begin to have more constructive conversations that allow them to better understand each other. By the end of the day, the group has not only overcome their differences, but also has put a unique twist on their essay assignment. ReviewThe jocks, the nerds, the popular kids, the troublemakers, and the outcasts are groups that everyone is familiar with if they spent a day in high school. We all belonged to one or more of these cliques in one way or the other. Stereotypes separate these groups while in high school and long after. In John Hughes's ""The Breakfast Club,"" a long day in detention brings a group of five students together while overcoming the social barriers that separate them. The 1985 dramatic comedy has a character that everyone can relate to. Whether one sees him or herself in a character or can identify the qualities of an acquaintance, there is character in the movie that can be identified with. The acting quality is excellent and what makes this practical in the movie. The acting quality is crucial to ""The Breakfast Club's"" success not only in Judd Nelson's role as a central figure in plot development, but also in the entire casts ability to keep the movie interesting despite a lack of setting change throughout. The cast as a whole keeps the movie interesting despite an abundance of dialog paired with a lack of action. Approximately ninety percent of the movie takes place in the library. There is seldom a change of setting making the acting all the more impressive. Five characters in one room keep an audience's attention for well over an hour. This is a result of the intensity the actors provide throughout the course of the film. From Miss Ringwald's screaming and crying in retaliation to Nelson's genuinely angry assaults to the whole cast sitting in tears as each learns more about the other's problems intensity is maintained throughout the film. Janet Maslim shares in her review, ""Personalities are dissected; tears are shed. The kids, each representing a different teen stereotype, come to understand each other. They strike up friendships. They denounce their parents. They decide that 'when you grow up, your heart dies'"" (Maslim 1). As Maslim describes, much goes on over the span of the movie. Keep in mind, as aforementioned, all these different events take place in one room of a library. The cast does a great job of keeping the attention of the audience while only having limited working space. With a lack of working props, their dialog is one the few tools they have at their expense to keep the movie interesting. It would be misplaced not to bestow a notable mention upon Ally Sheely for her role as the ""psycho"" outcast. To her credit, she keeps her character interesting while not uttering a line of speech for almost half of the movie. She uses body language and facial expressions with great success making her character an equally important force in the movie despite an initial lack of verbal communication. This is not to take away from the performance of the other members of the cast. They all dramatize their characters appropriately for the situation of the film. It is easy to come to the conclusion that characters like Nelson's and Ringwald's are overly dramatic when all the screaming and crying they contribute is first observed. However, it is important to remember if the cast sat down and talked civilly for an hour and a half without raising a voice or shedding a tear, saying the movie would be boring would be an overstatement.",The Breakfast Club
738,fquynisha,sincerely yours,9,23 February 2015,"This movie is considered a classic and normally, I find interest in classics but this movie is just flat out amazing. Not only is The Breakfast Club amazing, but it is also timeless. It is honestly empathetic to just about anyone who has gone through high school, no matter the circumstances and I think that is one reason why many people connect with this movie. Most people who have gone through high school have experienced the several clichés and cliques that circulate around the school. The Breakfast Club just mainly focuses on the nerds, the jocks, the lost causes, the preppy girls and the future criminals. Going to a big high school myself, I happened to experience all of these stereotypical groups head on. Not only that, but I was also subject to detention on several occasions for various reasons. Right off the bat, I was hooked right there. The movie revolves around five teenagers that were all given a Saturday detention for whatever punishment they did while in school earlier that week. Each of them briefly knowing one another from seeing each other out and about inside the school but none of them really knew how similar they really were. Throughout the movie, each of them tends to get a little closer with one another. They laugh, they cry, they share stories, they dance, they smoke a little marijuana, and they come out with an open mind at the end. At the end, they all come out learning more about where each other came from and how they grew up and come out learning a huge lesson. There were also little lessons jam packed throughout the movie that many people seem to overlook but after watching it several times, I began to pick each out one by one. One of the smaller lessons taught in the movie was when Andy said, ""We're all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all"". This is true. Everyone is weird and everyone has different things that separate him or her from one another. The thing is that some people tend to show their true colors more than some other people. Some people are more comfortable in their own skin than the next so they tend to bring out those bizarre colors. Another small lesson that seems overlooked in the movie is when Brian and John get in a small altercation and Brian said, ""Do you know without trigonometry, there'd be no engineering?"" and Bender follows up with ""Without lamps, there'd be no light"". Both of the boys are right but what Bender is saying is that you can't enjoy the intricate things in life without the simpler things. The biggest lesson The Breakfast Club taught viewers that labels are not for people; they are more suitable for things like food or clothing. In simple terms, each of them learned that you should never judge a book by its cover or its stereotype. Just because a person hangs out with a certain group does not mean they think just like that person or come from the same background as that person. In Andy's case, the jocks at school were not also dumb and senseless and in Brian's case, the nerds weren't always up in the library studying for every single thing. We are all different in many ways and we should all own who we are. Though that is easier said than done, it can be pulled off. Not only was this movie easy to connect with and had many lessons that can be carried all throughout one's lifetime, but it was also packed with humorous scenes such as the iconic dancing scene, the marijuana smoking and a few more. It may be because I'm a bit biased towards comedy movies, but I love to have a good laugh, especially from a witty, sarcastic comment, which this movie was full of. All in all, The Breakfast Club is a timeless classic. Just about anyone who has been through high school, especially a bigger one can connect to this movie. Honestly, I think anyone who watches this movie will take away a life long lesson and have a good laugh as well. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.",The Breakfast Club

Some scenes were shot in my high school since it was filmed in Illinois. Maine North, which is now a Police Department, was the original setting. There are two particular scenes I can recall that were shot at my Alma Mater, Maine East... One where they walk through the trophy area and in the end when Judd Nelson walks through the field. All in all, this movies shows the many different social groups of teens. Some time along the way, high school kids are find their ""clicks"" and social groups.

741,manueldavilajr,"Fun Loving, and Great Lessons in being yourself",9,22 September 2018,"Seeing this movie means marking a check in the checklist of life experiences. As every teen more or less has gone through this experience in their high school years. With every generation, knowing who you are becomes more and more important; the characters in this movie display this in a situation of discipline, which can be hard on some while difficult on others at this age or just considered another day in detention. Some of the characters do not seem to mind the punishment considering how bad their home life or status in society i.e. High School is, vice versa, some of the other characters feel and know that this punishment could and would ruin their reputation. Maintaining humility is unlearned practice as a teenager. Most teens are so worried about how they will fit into their social class or their problems that they neglect that other people have problems too, they forget who they are, thus causing more abrupt problems in our current youth's society. This is a tough topic in the modern day, some teens do not overcome these issues and go into dark places, and do horrific things, much like the millennial generation and school shootings. This movie demonstrates how important is to be true to who you are before things become too dark. Unfortunately bullies do exist only to exacerbate the problems for other teens who are not accepting of them and who already in a dark place in their minds, as a bully does not know when to stop being bully or has not meant enough consequences or love to really know why it is so wrong to bully. Though often times the bully itself has problems they cannot contain, and the result is that take their problems out on others. Even as unfair as this is, it is not easy to stand up to a bully in the modern day, in comparison to the 80's setting in this movie. More than likely, at that time bullies were recognized more quickly, and they was little nonsense for such behavior.The plot centers around a group of students that are sent to detention all for different reasons, though each of them realizing their problems are not any worse than others, thus helping them realize who they are and how things are not actually that bad and they can get through it. These values are missed today, their is no excuse for bullying, or not speaking up about your problems. What is even worst as that those truly good people have to suffer differently than those who have a comforting home life as a teen. In the end we need to be nice, you never know who is hurting or needs a little love to truly become who they are.Love conquers all, and we find that these teens survive this dilemma to become even greater people, only if this was used more today to create loving environments. We all need practice with this, and this movie displays beautifully how an fun loving environment without drugs or alcohol can truly help people grow.",The Breakfast Club

The Breakfast club, gleefully, may just be the only movie I have ever seen that has absolutely no flaws. There is always a way of picking out things from a film, but to me, it seems impossible here. The backstories of the characters are so charismatic, that when taking them seriously. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this film, but having five completely different people, mixed together to become friends, is something that moved me in many ways, and I will grasp onto this story forever.",The Breakfast Club
743,tommasofusari,pretty good movie,7,10 November 2015,"""The Breakfast Club"" is a 1985 American coming-of-age comedy-drama film written, produced, and directed by John Hughes, the same filmmaker of ""home lost"". the famous film of 1990. Critics consider it one of the greatest high school films of all time. the film plot is pretty easy, the story take place on a normal spring Saturday in America, at 8.00 am when five pour guys are forced to join in a special high school detention for students who didn't follow the rules. Detention consist in stay into the school library writing a 1000 words essay speaking about the reason of their detention. hours passing and the library starts to be boring and oppressive as Vernon, the teacher who have fun in molesting the students, so, finally the tough kid can't resist picking on the prom queen, and then there is a series of exchanges. they discovered that, in their self difference they are so similar,and only put away every prejudice they can show to others their real behavior.It begins so an original story where the most difference guys create a strong relation with each others during the whole period of their detention. i think that this movie probably was so innovative for the '80s period when nobody cared about teenager mentality and their behavior, with this film the filmmaker create a original and addictive plot for young guys. With this movie i think the filmmaker'd represent the short period of childhood that will be destroyed by overcome of adulthood. Why? You will discover your own by watching this pretty nice film! enjoy yourself",The Breakfast Club
744,roubenprice,Great Movie,10,10 November 2015,"I have always heard people say that the breakfast club is a great movie and now is considered a classic, and I would have to agree with them. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because of the plot seemed seemed somewhat believable and the characters seemed real. I really enjoyed the characters Bender and the Janitor. I liked the character of the janitor because he was a good guy in the movie and seemed like one of the most reasonable people and Bender because he was entertaining int he way he talked and acted, he sort of began to break down the awkwardness in the beginning and started people talking. I didn't like the principal in this movie, Im sure many didn't because he was the antagonist and not designed to be liked. I found his manner rude and unkind. I think that Bender salvaged the film and Allison kind of impeded it because she in my opinion made everything awkward and hard to listen to, but she was also necessary in getting stuff moving along. I would say that the mood is kind of dramatic and a little bit of a comedy and seems to be targeted at people fro ages 15-35. I would consider this a movie rather than a film. But all in all i really enjoyed this movie.",The Breakfast Club

Everyone do things for their own reasons, and this movie, shows that a lot. This movie show how your attitude can be responsible for the others attitudes.

746,eleganose,review of breakfast club,10,12 November 2015,"This movie. K, first of all, the cast and characters are all solid, and do a good job. The clichés are all well rounded, the general amount of teen types commonly seen on TV, the principal, and the almighty janitor. A high point of praise for this film, to this person at least, was its ability to paint a clear picture of the teen's background and family life without ever showing it once, the actors do a very good job expressing when they tell the stories of their family troubles. The principal is sympathetic, yet remains a somewhat effective opposite force to the teens. He is understandable in his actions, in that he's just doing his job, but is not so understandable or likable that we take his side over the kid's, as he also misuses his authority a few times during the movie.It's a great movie that does so much with just a little. It does away with complicated visuals or the like, and instead opts for a great narrative told by its wonderful characters, yet has enough movement and visual to it that it's not a bore. The stories entertaining, the comedy funny, and the characters lovable, it's a great piece of film, and something I wouldn't mind watching again sometime.",The Breakfast Club

What I found interesting was that they seemed to have nothing in common and in the end, they found out they share many feelings and it is something that happens a lot in real high schools.

750,dolezelkayla,The Breakfast Club,9,23 February 2016,"The Breakfast ClubIt's a classic. A jock, a nerd, a prom queen, an outcast, and a rule-breaking tough guy (your basic high school stereotypes clustered into one cast) trapped in detention on a Saturday. As with similar movie expositions, its no stretch to the moviegoer's mind that these odds end characters will delve into each other's personal lives and leave their ""wasted Saturday"" with a better insight to each other's lives. Although the plot is rather predictable, The Breakfast Club does an exceptional job at portraying realistic high school students. Stuck, for eight grueling hours. All while having nothing in common with one another except for their current location: the library. The students are assigned to write an essay for their teacher, Mr. Vernon (Paul Gleason), describing ""who they are"". They instead find a variety of other ways to pass the time: talking, dancing, pulling pranks, etc. Eventually, the characters get into a conversation about what got them in to detention in the first place and further discuss the problems associated with being popular or unpopular in a high school setting. With somewhat of an ""artistic license"" given to the actors, by director John Hughes, many lines were improvised to enhance their realness. The middle finger, obscene words, demeaning sarcasm, and sexual implications throughout the film are inappropriate. However, few will argue that they are unrealistic within a high school setting. And then there is the character's daily dialogue splattered with the words ""like"", ""psh"", ""uh"", which mimics the real conversations of adolescence. Throughout the production of the film, young Judd Nelson (Bender) embodied his character flawlessly. The swaggering stance, callous sarcasm, and a disregard for any and all rules sets him up initially as the antagonist to all the other characters. With each flip of his long hair, and every object he uses as a footstool, Judd Nelson sears into the viewers mind the familiar image of a ""rebel"". However, as the film progresses, we soon unveil that there is more to his character than his frequent stops in detention and the careless show he puts on for those around him. Judd's performance is complimented by other emerging movie stars at the time: Molly Ringwald (Claire), Emilio Estevez (Andrew), Anthony Michael Hall (Brian) and Ally Sheedy (Allison). The other characters develop throughout the film. However, what they disclose comes as no surprise to the audience. Each character For instance, Andrew shares how his parents . If you're looking for a dramatic storyline with twists and turns or shocking discoveries, this film isn't for you. The film can seem long, with a few dry stretches (perhaps this is to draw comparison to actual detention) However, it will have you laughing at lines flooded with sarcasm and the actions of the characters. This feel-good movie will ultimately leave you pondering those ""John Benders"" in your life you might think you ""know"".",The Breakfast Club
751,akemibby,A classic,10,4 May 2016,"This movie features five teenagers who meet at a Saturday detention. They all have basic names or ""stereotypes"" that fit their personality yet as they get to know each other they've come to realize they are more than just that. John Hughes directed and produced this amazing, heart touching film on February 14, 1985. On Saturday March 24th, five students begrudgingly go to Saturday detention. John Bender ""The criminal"", Allison Reynolds ""The basket case"", Claire Standish ""The princess"", Brian Johnson ""The nerd and Andrew Clark ""The jock/athlete"" gather together and are all significantly different. Due to their differences, they don't get along. At the start of the film, they all argue and are constantly in conflict. The day continues and slowly, all of them realize how similar they are. At the end, a big friendship forms. This movie is very well made and done. It very much relies on the dialogue. Dialogue is the main connection to this film, what the characters say and how they express it makes you relate and want to think back to your ""old high school"" days. Bender ""The criminal"" does most of the talking during the film and helps the characters build up. He helps their walls break down and the character pours their feelings out to let the plot build up. The soundtrack was very well picked. In the start of the film, you hear the iconic song ""Don't you forget about me"" by simple minds. You immediately get hooked on the film and groove a little to the beat. The film does an amazing job by capturing the characters in the first few minutes of the film. You get to see the characters grow and change their outlook of life and social groups. The Breakfast club highlights a variety of peer pressure on the teens during high school. Let it be social groups or parents. They are constantly faced with pleasing their parents or acting as a role model to their friends. When Brian asks Claire ""What's going to happen on Monday? Are we still going to be friends?"" The camera focuses on everyone's faces to see how they would react. They're all hesitant and Claire says something that leads the group into a heated argument. Since they all come from different social groups, Claire and Andrew are viewed as the two most popular liked kids at school and can't be seen hanging out with ""nerds"" like Brian due to their social ranking. The teens are all faced with some sort of family issue or pressures that affect them on how they act.Overall, you relate to the characters and understand their life situation. I could watch this movie repeatedly due to the amazing characters, soundtrack and plot. It's made me cry, upset because of the issues they face and smiling. It'll move you and make you wanna watch it all over again. I highly rec-command to anyone that wants to take a temporary break from life because you will get absorbed in this film.",The Breakfast Club

753,farcryparry,"Damn near perfect, possibly the best high school film ever",9,6 November 2017,"*I would like to point out that I am a teenager and the desired target audience for this film, so my opinion may be biased by this*The Breakfast Club almost needs no introduction, it's one of the most famous films to come out of the 80's. Most likely those who haven't seen it know about it in some way, whether it be the final freeze frame, some of the more quotable lines or the famous song by Simple Minds that plays at the end. In any case, I was aware of how popular the film was before I watched it and I was still blown away. The plot itself is extremely simple, a group of kids from different social groups in their school are stuck in detention for an entire Saturday and begin to become friends, where they realize that they are all more similar than they thought. While it may appear that there is no real good way to develop this story it quickly becomes interesting as it continues. One of the best things this film does is make you feel in the same position as the characters, the film can sometimes be uncomfortably quiet, making it quite interesting when music actually plays, you really feel like you're with these characters and learning more about them as they do. Without a doubt the best part of this film are the characters and dialogue, no matter who you are you will identify with one or more of these characters, they may appear as stereotypical high school film characters, but once they begin to talk to each other you'll realize the depth and detail to these people, especially towards the end during the most touching scene where they reveal to each other how they got in detention (all improvised by the way). Even the ""antagonist"" of the film, their supervisor Richard Vernon has some development to his character making him feel as real as any normal strict, authoritative school teacher with genuine reasons for how he talks to the kids. Which brings me to my next point...The dialogue is fantastic, not ""David Mamet"" levels but after all these years it still comes across as both genuine and genuinely funny, I can almost guarantee you will laugh at one point in this film due to the dialogue. The performances from everybody are great, especially Judd Nelson who plays John Bender, possibly the best character in the film and delivering some of the films best lines. While it may not be the greatest film ever, for a story as simple as this it does some exceptional things with dialogue and character and is perfect for what it was trying to be.

The basic message of the movie will be relevant as long as high school exists, the fact that high school is still has the cliques and is still as judgmental. People may not be as up front about their judgments and schools have better polices against bullying but its all still the same. My favourite scene from the movie from the movie is near the end where Brian is asking whether they'd still be friends when it came to Monday, because it shows how they put aside their differences when they weren't with their peers and saw how they weren't much different to each other. I think if The Breakfast Club was to be made again today the stereotypes of the characters would not change. There would only be minor changes to the characters perceptions and views on things in life, like Claire and Andrew would probably not be so against smoking weed because the younger generations are growing up in a world where it is more acceptable to smoke weed. I personally like to think that they all talked to each other on the Monday after but looking at it in a realistic sense the most probable friendships to last for more than the one day they were together is Brian and Allison, and Andrew and Allison. These are the most probable outcomes because Allison and Brian are seen as low down on the popularity scale and i feel they would connect on their distaste of the popularity hierarchy. I think Andrew and Allison's romance would continue because I feel Allison would Andrew the courage to stand up to his peers and his dad and not do what they say.",The Breakfast Club

One of the best teen movies ever",9,12 March 2017,"Five high school kids get detention on a Saturday by their principle Vernon and asks them to write a 1000 page essay on who they are and this makes for one of the best coming of age stories and high school movies ever.So, john Hughes is the writer director of this movie and he is really great in making movies about just a single day in a characters life. The characters from exterior are pretty different from one another but as the movie goes on you realize that they each face the same insecurities , complexes and pressures that are associated with a high school student. So, Claire(Molly Ringwald) and Andrew(Emilio Estevez) are your typical rich popular kids who the other kids look up to. Brian(Anthony Hall) is scholar nerd. Allison(Ally Sheedy) is a weird girl and last but not the least John Bender(Judd Nelson) is the rebellious kid who is a brat but also is brutally honest.The kids meet each other for the first time and they right from the start are not getting along. But their hatred towards the Principle brings them to talking terms. As they go through the day they start to grow on each other.The best scene of the movie is when they are all sitting together and they reveal the reasons why they are in detention. It makes you think that no matter how they portray themselves all are somewhat same having the same problems. I think the main message of the movie is to let go of what people think of you and also and to be who you are no matter what your friends think of you about who you hang out with and what you do.The breakfast club is one of the best movies i have seen which deals with teen issues in a very real but entertaining way. Do check it out guys.",The Breakfast Club

760,ben-klose,a good movie with a good ideas sometimes a little bit boring,7,19 April 2017,"THE BREAKFAST CLUB MOVIE REVIEW:The movie 'The Breakfast club' is written and directed by John Hughes and entered the cinemas in 1985. The movie is about five high school students, which have detention on Saturday. They are 5 different characters 1.The criminal 2.The princess 3.The athlete 4.The brain 5. The basket-case. During the detention the students discover that they have a lot more common than they expected. If the breakfast club would made again today the 5 characters would be so different. The time changed and the interests of the youth changed. The stereo types would be 1.Criminal 2. The flirt 3.The gamer. 4The shy one. 7.The normal 8.The weird one. My favorite scene was where they all sat on the ground and talked like normal people or friends they just talked and didn't offense themselves the hole time.i liked the scene because it showed how it could be if people don't judge from their prejudges and just talk. The basic of the movie still holds up that every student has problems and they always have something in common. Compared to the students today it changed a little bit. There are still cliques and prejudges under the students but I think its more mixed now of different people and interests. Through the time some things changed in high school society like there is no more detention the teachers are more friendly and are like your friend .I think a big point that changed is that the cool ones are not anymore the ones which go with the mainstream its more the people which are going against it.In total liked the film it showed a little bit more of the life of an high school students and problems and that prejudges are often wrong. One of my favorite 80s movie.",The Breakfast Club

Im 13 years old and yes it's rated R ,but i couldn't keep my hands off this movie.",The Breakfast Club
763,KawaiiDango,I'm not that far out of high school.,10,15 August 2017,"Even now, this movie can be extremely relatable with its characters and their backgrounds. Of course, this being the 80's, it definitely shows its age. You can understand where each person in the film comes from, and the movie stretches out enough time to get to know each one and feel what they have been through and what their lives are portrayed from the people around them. Hands down my favorite movie of all time.",The Breakfast Club

I recommend this movie to all ages but specially to teens teens because you may feel a little more connected with the characters,I must add that I actually don't give much 10's but this movie has the ""something"" that turns a great movie into a memorable one, do not miss it, totally recommendable, probably the best of the 80's films, i don't tell what's about because you must go to see a movie without expecting or knowing anything about it in order to enjoy it at the maximum point, good bye and enjoy the world of movies.",The Breakfast Club
765,seymabece,Too good to a teenager/high school movie,8,25 December 2017,"The movie is one of the best movie I've ever watched! Its cast was chosen perfectly. They reflect their characters very well. Movie criticizes the same type of people who want to get in a stereotype groups. So movie displays this situation. You can feel 80s atmosphere from their clothes and music that they used. Songs were perfect and dance scene was fun. Smoking scene was pretty good but final scene was the best! ""DON'T YOU FORGET ABOUT ME!!"" The best teenager movie so far.",The Breakfast Club
766,axe-336,"""Don't you... Forget about me.""",9,3 January 2006,"That line from the end song really is one of the big messages in the movie. I guess it's a spoiler which is why I put the warning, but the scene where they realize who is going to still be friends come Monday is one of the big points of the movie in my opinion. The song's statement goes right along side it, don't you forget about me... come Monday, don't act like we aren't friends just because of your social circle. I think one of the greatest things about this movie is that it applies to each new generation. Some people may say it helped define a generation or an era, but I say it helps show who we are as people, prejudiced against that which we don't know and understand, laughing at it and calling it names so it won't come near us so we don't have to try and understand it. That's... What I think comes from ""The Breakfast Club"". Now, there are other reason's to see it, like the scene where everyone is dancing around, some of the famous lines, or just to see Allison in action (My favorite character). However, you could get stuff like that from other movies, what I said first isn't in a lot of movies and that's why I would recommend it to anyone not afraid of language (Because it does have that). If that does scare you off however, a similar, though perhaps not quite as solid, statement is made in the movie ""Mean Girls"" which is surprisingly good in my opinion and I would recommend that anyone with teenagers in high school watch it. So yeah, see The Breakfast Club, it's worth it.",The Breakfast Club

The coveted weekend has arrived, but five High School teenagers find themselves not at home, at the mall, or even with their friends. Eachof these individuals has done some act, or committed some crime to receive the punishment of an eight-hour detention at Sherman High.Frictions develop between these teenagers who are wildly different and stereotyped as a jock, a princess, a basket case, a brain, and a criminal.This movie is rated R for a reason kiddos. The comments, (mostly made by John Bender) could make anyone watching more than a little uncomfortable. But that's the beauty of the movie; it goes beyond the stereotypes, beyond the initial small talk about school affairs and parties. The language is crude, but it wouldn't fit if it were any other way.Eventually, all five of these Teenagers confront issues such a school violence, pressure, their family lives, parents, and sex. With such different personalities, groups of friends, lives and problems, it's hard to believe that somehow, they find a way to have something in common, and become ""The Breakfast Club""...",The Breakfast Club

It challenges a lot of issues teenagers go through such as peer pressure from both friends and family and although the film is quite dated now people can still relate to it. but then again i really think someone should look into making an updated remake that includes some of the stereotypes now found in college and it totally needs a sequel to properly finish of the story, you become so interested and connected to the characters you want to see more! Judd Nielson was perfect for the role of Bender, i heard that Emilio Estevan was first offered this part and i am so so pleased he was switched to become the jock. Molly Ringwald was also brilliantly cast as she plays the spoilt rich girls to perfection! Plus her clothes are wicked and scarily still in fashion now! love it! i strongly recommend this film to anyone! go see this film!",The Breakfast Club
770,vadragonwriter,Wow,1,17 June 2006,"Wow. I thought I had seen bad movies before this one, but this takes the prize with flying colors. You couldn't pay me any amount of money to waste another two hours of my life on this piece of garbage. However, if you like stereotypical characters, an unrealistic story, and a plot so god-awful that the every copy of the script should be burned in a giant fire, this is the perfect movie for you.One of the first, most obvious, and most painful issues with this movie are the characters. They are all completely stereotyped. There is the 'everyone else in the world owes me a personal favor' prep, the 'poor me, I'm just the best at sports' jock, the 'part of every academic club at the school' geek, the 'who really knows what my problem is' weirdo, and the 'I'm so bad because I have such a terrible life' criminal. I am in high school right now. I think that, when people look back at high school when they are thirty or whatever, they see things how they want to, and so they categorize the people they knew. They think that each person is one way, and nothing else. WRONG. You don't have to be just one thing, in one group of people. People can't always be placed in neat little categories, GET OVER IT. The only realistic character is the prep, who only cares about herself and what the world can do for her. I know people exactly like her, but thats it. People need to be a little more realistic.The story, of course, doesn't help at all. One example: a gun goes off in Brian's locker so he gets Saturday detention? Really. More like suspension, and only that because he probably never did anything else. But one Saturday detention? Right, and I just saw a flying hippo enter a bar where it sings every week.And last, but certainly not least, is the plot. This movie is what I like to call a 'prep movie'. Translation: shallow, useless, and the preps win. You either change everything about yourself to become another brainless zombie prep, or you loose. You die. End of story. Sure, this is a happy, feel good movie- as long as you're another brainless zombie prep.So, to sum everything up, I repeat wow. This was the biggest waste of time I have ever seen. So, if you have a choice between watching this and poking your own eyes out, do yourself a favor and poke out your eyes.",The Breakfast Club

Mostly for John Bender's Character. And for the writing. Ontop of it all, I realize the spectacular acting. It is not easy to portray any of these characters. and the cast of the movie did it well.

772,swagswagkillinit,One of the best 80s movies ever,10,15 October 2018,"""Spend a little more time trying to make something of yourself and a little less time trying to impress people..."" 
""The Breakfast Club"" tells the story of five high school students who come from different social groups, and who spend an entire Saturday together in detention. During detention, their principal that craves power, Mr. Vernon, makes them write an essay about ""who you think you are"" and the reasons for attending detention. There is a brainiac, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Throughout this boring Saturday, they began to bond and realize that they're not much different from each other. It is funny, that the characters despise each other at first. Yet, throughout the movie, their true selves begin to come forward as they start to open up more. Featured in this movie is Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, and Emilio Estevez. All of these actors starred in multiple hit movies and tv shows: Blue City, Home Alone 2, Sixteen Candles, The Outsiders, and The Dark Knight. In ""The Breakfast Club,"" These five high school students influenced views on high school society, by showing that you can be friends with anyone as long as you get to know them. Some of the characters even started to have feelings for each other. Sadly, the next day at school they probably would act like that Saturday never happened. However, the characters and this plot truly is unforgettable. This movie is one of the best 80s films ever made. John Hughes movie, ""The Breakfast Club,"" is a classic, and because of the characters' brutal honesty and the simplicity of the story, it is the best portrayal of the highschool experience. 
 ""The Breakfast Club"" taught me so many life lessons and showed me what not to do in high school. It has revealed the disrespect some teachers show towards students they do not care about. Some people believe that a teacher being disrespectful is unrealistic, but in high school there is always one teacher that does not know how to treat their students with respect. In this movie, Principal Vernon, played by Paul Gleason, came off as rude and entitled. For example, he pointed frequently throughout the movie, and pointing is a very rude thing to do. Hughes showed me that popularity is nothing but a label, and it should not be the only difference between my peers and I. When watching this movie, you learn that everyone is not as different as they seem, and that you never really know what is going on in someone's life. The most popular kids could be the ones with the most abusive or judgmental parents. Or, the schools ""criminal"" could have a lot going on in their life, and he is actually more sensitive than how he comes off. 
The greatness of this movie is on full display as it shows us the lovable side of these characters. Every character changes into their true self. For example, Molly Ringwald (Claire Standish) wanted to help Ally Sheedy (Allison Reynolds) so she gave her a complete makeover. When Ringwald did this, you could see Sheedy's true beauty, and Emilio Estevez (Andrew Clark) begins falling for her. The most important scene is when all five of them were sitting in the library, and they begin to open up to each other. They described the torture that high school is, and they learn that none of them likes the label they were given to portray throughout high school. Then, they all come to the conclusion that it is inevitable what ""clique"" you're apart of, and it is inescapable. 
At the end of the movie, you're left with a cliffhanger. The director leaves you to decide what happens next for the five high schoolers. ""The Breakfast Club"" was able to leave me feeling sorry for and happy for every character. This movie is worth watching because it teaches you a lot of life lessons, and it is a classic. It is also the most accurate representation of the high school experience. To be honest, we should watch every movie that is considered a ""classic"" before we die. Because if we do not, did we really live life to the fullest? Therefore, watch ""The Breakfast Club"" you definitely will not regret it.",The Breakfast Club
773,Jeroenvogel,The Breakfast Club and its theme are universal,10,5 March 2006,"As an exchange student from Holland I walked in blindly when I went to an American high school. I was only 18, my English was not too good, but it was such an big adventure that all the difficulties didn't matter. It opened my eyes on America from the inside, and, especially, how people deal with each other in that country.The way the teenagers in The Breakfast Club could be described as purely American by (mostly) Europeans who have never been to the United States. These people tend to think that, when they see a movie like this, the American way of interaction is (over)dramatized and that they would never talk the way the teenagers do in TBC.Wrong. I have traveled quite a bit in both North-America and Europe and I have met people from all over the world. These kind of conversations, the entire process of opening up to each other, are universal. Whenever people end up together in a situation similar to the one in TBC, they start doing the same thing. And that's exactly what makes the movie and its theme so recognizable for people all around the world. The American setting doesn't matter. It could have been filmed in a Dutch windmill and still have the same effect on Americans and other nationalities.And so even skeptic Europeans have to admit that this movie is a classic. And trust me, all the people around me who have seen it do. They think that The Breakfast Club is simply brilliant. And right they are! The dialogs, the scenario, the directing, the music and the acting all come together as one big thing. As a whole. It's so touching. Viewers feel what the characters feel and wonder what they would do and say in a situation similar to the one in TBC. I think we should thank John Hughes for leaving generations to come with such a state of the art motion picture!",The Breakfast Club
774,hollywoodcgd,A hard to forget film,10,10 March 2006,"The Breakfast Club is a perfect film from start to finish. Each actor was able to portray their character perfectly. From John Bender, played by Judd Nelson, and his constant lack respect for others, to Brian Johnson, played by Anthony Michael Hall, and his need to stick to the rules. This movie used both comedy and high school drama to portray the lives of teenagers. This film can show teens a different point of view other than their own, and can give adults a view on how hard a teens life really can be.John Bender was your average ""I don't give a s**t about no one and nothing,"" guy. As soon as the movie starts you know that he won't sit quiet during his stay in Saturday. Brian Johnson was John's polar opposite. Stuck to the rules and always got A's in school, but this movie showed just how hard it is to be like that when you're going to school. Even the popular kids, princess Clair Standish and athlete Andrew Clark, have trouble with pressure to be cool from their friends, and a lack of real love from their parents. And the one person that no one knows the story of, the basket case Allison Reynolds, played by Ally Sheedy. As a way of making her look like a nobody, you don't even hear her name once throughout the entire movie. This movie shows everyone, that no matter how different you think you are, we all have one thing in common.",The Breakfast Club

The kids didn't know each other at first but they taught their selves something so important that you can never forget about in all of life. My school has been affected by this movie. Not only the students may i add, but the teachers as well. They would not choose to show this film for the fun and entertainment. They chose it because it really teaches you a life long lesson.

777,njgagnon,The Social Classes,10,18 January 2019,"The Breakfast Club, a brat filled classic which starts with 5 students having to come to school on a somber Saturday for a day of detention for which they received for certain disciplinary acts. At first none of the kids know each other except for their reputations around the school. Andy played by Emilio Estevez who is the classic jock and the high school wrestling team star, Brian played by Anthony Hall who is the school nerd who's seen as socially awkward, Claire played by Molly Ringwald who is the school queen and the girl everyone supposedly looks up to, Allison played by Ally Sheedy who is socially awkward and doesn't talk much due to her being rejected by her parents which is seen at the beginning of the film when you see her parents drive away before saying anything to her, and finally John played by Judd Nelson who is the school rebel and bully.John Hughes film brought multiple generations together and showed how people from all walks of life can come together and connect with one another. The Breakfast Club blew out every other teen movie of its time and became an instant classic. Hughes also made this a classic by incorporating the 5 biggest stereotypes among high school teens, a brainiac, a jock, a princess, a basketcase and a criminal. Even though Hughes is a great film director he might need to consider becoming a social workerAt the Start of the film while there all sitting in the library nothing much is said except some small banter between Brian, John and Claire which leads to some tensions starting to build up. After that they all start to connect deeply on a social and emotional level and start to release their deepest secrets. There erratic and moody behavior is the reason this teen drama seems realer and the most authentic than all the others at the time.During the film, it hits a point where all the characters start to connect with one another more and decide to sneak out of the library to find Johns ""stash"" in his locker to make the time pass. As the scene develops and they get to Johns locker and they hear the principal walking by them and they have to get back to the library before there spotted. This scene may be seen as insignificant but it displays how the teens can start the day by making judgemental marks about one another than transition into having to trust and rely on each other to make it back to the library before being spotted by the principal.In the end, the message of the film and how we can break social walls lives on throughout movies like Divergent and The Hunger Games.",The Breakfast Club

It paved the way for millions of movies, while teaching the world that it is possible for everyone to just get along. We conducted character studies in a Psycology class at my high school. It revolved around this movie. We analyzed the characters. I took the class just because of that assignment. However, I learned more about myself in one semester, than I have in my entire life. I'm not sure if all that is relevant. The point is...The Breakfast Club is a versatile movie that will stand the test of time. Every person on Earth can identify with at least one of the characters.
